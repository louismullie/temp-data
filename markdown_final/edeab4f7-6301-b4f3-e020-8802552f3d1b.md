## Question

Carl is figuring out how much he'll need to spend on gas for his upcoming road trip to the Grand Canyon. His car gets 30 miles per gallon in cities and 40 miles per gallon on the highway. The distance from his house to the Grand Canyon, one way, is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles. If gas costs $3.00 per gallon, how much will Carl need to spend?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much Carl will spend on gas for a round-trip drive to the Grand Canyon, given different city and highway fuel efficiencies, one-way distances, and the price per gallon. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total round-trip distances for city and highway segments. Then, I should calculate gallons needed for each segment using the appropriate mpg. Next, I will sum the total gallons and multiply by the gas price. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any assumptions need verification, such as whether the stated distances are truly one-way and whether the mpg figures are realistic for the vehicle described.

> Let me first confirm the distances and that we are calculating a round trip. The problem states one-way city miles are 60 and one-way highway miles are 200, so round-trip that is 120 city miles and 400 highway miles, which I should explicitly write down to avoid a mistake later.

> Now, I will calculate fuel consumption for the city segment. At 30 miles per gallon, 120 city miles divided by 30 mpg equals 4.0 gallons exactly, so the city portion will use 4.0 gallons for the round trip.

> Next, I should calculate fuel consumption for the highway segment. At 40 miles per gallon, 400 highway miles divided by 40 mpg equals 10.0 gallons exactly, so the highway portion will use 10.0 gallons for the round trip.

> Wait, let me verify the total gallons before moving to cost. Adding 4.0 gallons for city and 10.0 gallons for highway gives a total of 14.0 gallons for the round trip, which seems correct on a quick mental check.

> I will now calculate the total cost. At $3.00 per gallon, 14.0 gallons multiplied by $3.00 equals $42.00, so Carl will spend $42.00 on gas for the round trip.

> Hold on, I should verify that I did not inadvertently treat the one-way distances as round-trip in the division steps. I initially thought "60 miles at 30 mpg is 2 gallons", but wait, that would be one-way; for the round trip I correctly doubled the distance to 120 miles before dividing by 30 mpg, which yields 4 gallons, so the earlier mental note was a reminder to keep the round-trip framing explicit and the final calculation is consistent with that.

> Final answer: Carl will need to spend $42.00 on gas for the round-trip drive to the Grand Canyon.

Carl will spend **$42.00** on gas for the round trip. Here's the breakdown: the total distance is 520 miles (120 city + 400 highway), requiring 14 gallons of gas (4 city + 10 highway), and at $3.00 per gallon, the total cost is $42.00.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

### 1. Calculate total distance (round trip)

- **City miles**: 60 miles (one way) × 2 = 120 miles
- **Highway miles**: 200 miles (one way) × 2 = 400 miles
- **Total distance**: 120 + 400 = 520 miles

---

### 2. Calculate fuel consumption for each segment

- **City fuel consumption**: 120 miles ÷ 30 mpg = 4 gallons
- **Highway fuel consumption**: 400 miles ÷ 40 mpg = 10 gallons
- **Total fuel consumption**: 4 + 10 = 14 gallons

---

### 3. Calculate total cost

- **Gas price**: $3.00 per gallon
- **Total cost**: 14 gallons × $3.00/gallon = $42.00

---

## Final answer

Carl will spend **$42.00** on gas for the round trip to the Grand Canyon.

### Outbreak of acute gastroenteritis among rafters and backpackers in the backcountry of grand canyon national park, April-June 2022 [^d54456e4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous norovirus outbreaks have occurred among river rafters in Grand Canyon associated with contaminated food products and person-to-person transmission resulting in recommendations to adhere to strict hygiene guidance. An increase in norovirus activity was observed at a national level in spring 2022, with the number of outbreak reports returning to prepandemic levels for the first time since March 2020.

With norovirus increasing nationwide and visitation rates returning to near prepandemic levels, the potential exists for resurgence of norovirus outbreaks among visitors to the Grand Canyon backcountry. River rafting and camping might amplify norovirus spread because of limited hygiene supplies and close person-to-person contact. Prevention and control of future outbreaks includes rapid reporting of illnesses, symptom screening before trip launch to minimize introduction of illnesses, strict adherence to hand hygiene with soap and water and sanitation protocols, disinfection of water before consumption, prompt separation of ill passengers, and minimizing of interactions with other rafting groups.

Decompression sickness ("the bends") — mechanism and gas kinetics are described: Breathing air under pressure causes excess inert gas (usually nitrogen) to dissolve in and saturate body tissues; the amount of gas dissolved is proportional to and increases with total depth and time below the surface; if ascent allows supersaturation, bubbles form that interfere with blood flow and tissue oxygenation, and the excess dissolved gas must be cleared through respiration.

### Energy and transport [^5c6d3566]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

We examine the links between fossil-fuel-based transportation, greenhouse-gas emissions, and health. Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability.

### Grand canyons on the moon [^2545c0ad]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Alternatively, the rays may be lateral sprays of ejecta(i.e. part of a butterfly pattern) from an impact with a trajectory of 22.3° east of north, as implied by the largest swath of continuous ejecta (Fig. 1). In that case, ballistic launch angles would have been higher. We derive from published datathat they would have been 51.3 ± 6.5° and 46.0 ± 6.9° for Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck, respectively.

The minimum kinetic energy necessary to produce measured craters along Vallis Schrödinger is 1.68 × 10²⁰ J. Because most craters are overlapping, the minimum kinetic energy is likely to be overestimated (~ 15%) in regions with high secondary crater density. However, gaps between identified craters in other regions offset this effect. Assuming a similar distribution of excavating impacts along the entire crater ray implies a total kinetic energy of 3.39 × 10²⁰ J. Values for Vallis Planck are less well constrained, but higher (~ 1.21 × 10²¹ J) because of its greater length. The energy to produce the grand canyons on the Moon are 1200–2200 times larger than the nuclear explosion energy once planned to excavate a second Panama Canal on Earth, more than 700 times larger than the total yield of US, USSR, and China's nuclear explosion tests, and about 130 times larger than the energy in the global inventory of nuclear weapons – (Supplementary Table 1).

Preventing diving disorders — planning and equipment guidance is provided: Recreational divers should dive conservatively and well within the no-decompression limits of their dive tables or computers; when multiple dives are planned, strict guidelines known as surface intervals are prescribed to allow adequate time for dissolved inert gas to drop to acceptable levels before the next dive; tables derived from human-tested algorithms have traditionally been used to manually calculate dive times and surface intervals, but dive computers use the same algorithms with real-time depth and time inputs to compute individual guidance and have largely replaced tables for manual dive planning.

### Carbon footprint of the RSNA annual meeting [^f34d137f]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the airplane travel-related carbon footprint of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting, the associated health burden, and the costs to offset these greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. compensation of emissions by funding an equivalent CO 2 saving elsewhere).

Methods

The RSNA's website was used to determine the reported country of origin of attendees to the 2017 meeting that took place in Chicago from November 26 to December 1. It was assumed that attendees had traveled from the airport nearest to the largest city in their country or state to Chicago's O'Hare international airport. The total amount of air travel-related CO 2 -equivalent emission (based on round-trip economy class travel), the imposed health burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the global population, the total CO 2 offsets costs, and the CO 2 offsets costs per DALY were calculated.

Results

The calculated airplane travel-related CO 2 -equivalent emissions of 11,223 attendees from the United States and 10,684 attendees from other countries were 7,067,618 kg and 32,438,420 kg, totaling 39,506,038 kg. This caused an estimated 51.4–79.0 DALYs. The calculated amount of Total CO 2 offset costs were calculated to be $474,072, which corresponds to $6,001–9,223 per DALY averted.

Conclusions

The airplane travel-related carbon footprint of the RSNA annual meeting and the associated disease burden are relevant, and potential attendees and organizers should take measures to overcome this undesired side effect. Offsetting this carbon footprint is cost-effective and this initiative should be taken by the radiological community.

### How to make climate-neutral aviation fly [^9ae152aa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Life-cycle GHG emissions, costs, and resource indicators are calculated for representative flights by broad destination departing from Europe (i.e. North America, South America, Africa, Middle East, Asia, and intra-European flights). The destination type presets the altitude profile of the flight, notably the share of the fuel emissions released in the different strata of the atmosphere — see Air emissions. Longer flights tend to spend a higher percentage of the flight distance at high altitudes than shorter flights. On an average Europe-Asia journey, 97% of the route is flown above 9000 m of altitude, against 85% for an average intra-European flight. This is important as the different non-CO 2 effects in this study occur in different altitude ranges, while CO 2 emissions have a constant and similar impact on warming regardless of the emission altitude. The results per passenger-kilometer are multiplied by the demand for transport per destination in each air traffic demand case to obtain overall indicators for the European fleet.

### Effect of radiation schedule on transportation-related carbon emissions: a case study in rectal cancer [^ac088c53]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods and Materials

Patients treated with preoperative RT for newly diagnosed rectal cancer at our institution between 2004 and 2022 were included in this institutional review board–approved study. Patients living out of state were excluded. Travel distance and travel time to radiation were estimated with the Google Maps directions feature using patients' reported home address. When multiple routes were offered, the route with the shortest travel time was selected. Associated GHG emissions were calculated in proportion to vehicle type (gas, hybrid, electric, or plug-in hybrid) and defined by published statewide vehicle registration statistics using a published well-to-wheel model, which accounts for all emissions related to fuel (ie, gas, electricity) production and use (Table 1) (calculation method available from GHG). GHG emissions were converted into carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) using global warming potentials, a measure of how much energy 1 ton of an emitted gas will absorb relative to 1 ton of emitted CO 2; they provide a common unit of measure (CO 2 e) and enable comparisons of emissions across sectors and gases. Travel-related costs were determined by the 2022 Internal Revenue Service mileage reimbursement rate of 58.5 cents per mile traveled, accounting for gas, insurance, and vehicle depreciation. Comparative analyses between variables were performed using t test comparisons with Stata, version 14.2.

Air travel volume and health concerns — In 2019, 4.5 billion passengers took nearly 47 million international flights; the following year, global passenger air travel volume decreased by nearly two-thirds (1.8 billion passengers took 22 million flights), a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequently has reverted to pre-pandemic levels. Illness directly from air travel is not commonly reported, but main concerns include exacerbations of chronic medical conditions from changes in air pressure and humidity, relative immobility during flights leading to thromboembolic disease, and risk for infection due to proximity to others on board who could have communicable diseases.

### Private practice career after GI training [^0001f146]. VideoGIE (2019). Medium credibility.

Moving to the next phase, your career after fellowship, involves big decisions and sometimes an overwhelming number of questions. Here are some tips on organizing your thoughts around them.

In general, there are 3 choices for your long-term career: academic practice, employment, or private practice. The attributes for each practice choice are not mutually exclusive and are what you make of them. There will be trade-offs. For example, you should find intellectual stimulation in all types of practice, not just academic practice. And although private practice is supported by revenue resources alone, academicians require a ramp-up to independent funding, and in the employment setting, time is money. Autonomy can be an area of potential tension, because there will be a natural offset in larger practice settings where there is less autonomy and more automation. No matter what choice you make, the essential considerations for pursuing this next phase are quality of life, geographic location, finances, and practice setting. Thinking through your personal and professional needs, presenting yourself well, and obtaining the right information will help you make the right decision that will reflect positively 30 years later (Video 1, available online at).

No amount of gestalt or guesswork can replace thinking through the questions you need to consider as you contemplate your future career. An inventory of your personal and professional needs before you start looking for a job is the task at hand. Examples of considerations for your personal life should include the must-haves that are essential to your quality of life. What do you hope to do with your spare time? If global travel is important, how close is the nearest large airport? What will you not live without? For example, is it important to you to have a symphony, a theater company, or rock climbing nearby or just within driving distance? How do you spend your discretionary income? What are the professional opportunities for your partner? How does having children or planning a family affect other needs, such as quality of schools?

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^305b8862]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations — expand public transportation state that public transportation systems reduce the necessity for single occupancy vehicle trips, reduce the production of automobile emissions, increase incidental physical activity, and provide necessary transportation access for people with physical, economic, or other limitations that impede their access to and use of a single occupancy motor vehicle. Recommendations include to 'Explore opportunities to increase funding to strengthen the positive health impacts associated with expanded public transportation options' with actions such as 'Encourage funding decisions that strengthen public transportation', 'Encourage states to increase investments in public transportation, congestion relief, air quality improvements, and other options, and to remove barriers to use of gas tax revenues for public transportation and bicycle-pedestrian improvements', 'Give state, regional, and local governments more flexibility to choose from transportation funding categories to meet local transportation needs', 'Explore the extent to which program requirements and resources can be made to be more comparable for public transportation, highways, non-motorized and rail travel alternatives to encourage investments in all modes of transportation', and 'Provide incentives to support a strong network of public transportation options, including bus rapid transit and light rail, which connect housing and jobs as well as improve access to healthy foods, medical care, and other services'.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^53a74c66]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Acclimatization at high altitude — time course and physiologic changes are described: the human body can adjust to moderate hypoxia at altitudes up to approximately 5,200 m (17,000 ft) but requires time to do so, with some acclimatization continuing for weeks to months and an acute process occurring over the first 3–5 days following ascent. The acute phase is associated with a steady increase in ventilation, improved oxygenation, and changes in cerebral blood flow; increased red cell production does not play a role in acute acclimatization, although a decrease in plasma volume over the first few days does increase hemoglobin concentration. Altitude illness can develop before the acute acclimatization process is complete, but not afterward, and acclimatization improves sleep.

### Acute gastroenteritis outbreak among Colorado river rafters and backpackers in the grand canyon, 2022 [^8d0b8226]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

From April 1 to May 31, 2022, Grand Canyon National Park received increased acute gastroenteritis reports. Pooled portable toilet specimens identified norovirus genogroups I and II. We sought to determine outbreak transmission contributors and individual risk factors while rafting or backpacking in the park.

Methods

Grand Canyon rafters and backpackers were surveyed online from June 13-July 8, 2022, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictors associated with illness and adjusted for potential confounding factors.

Results

Among 762 surveys, 119 cases and 505 well persons submitted complete survey data. Illness among rafters was associated with interaction with ill persons during the trip (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] = 3.4 [95%CI 2.3–5.0]) and lack of any hand hygiene (1.2 [0.7–1.9]) or use of only sanitizer or water (1.6 [1.04–2.6]) before snacks. Younger rafters had higher illness rates compared to those ≥ 60 y (1.5 [1.2–1.8] for ages 40–59 and 2.2 [1.4–3.5] for ages < 40 y).

Conclusions

Person-to-person transmission likely accounted for the widespread outbreak. Future outbreak mitigation efforts on river trips could focus on symptom screening before the trip starts, prompt separation of ill and well passengers, strict adherence to hand hygiene with soap and water, minimizing social interactions among rafting groups, and widespread outbreak notices and education to all park users.

### CDC grand rounds: global tobacco control [^03b5ca2f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The Years Ahead

Governments worldwide collect nearly $133 billion in tobacco excise tax revenue each year. Despite this, less than $1 billion is spent globally on tobacco control, with 97% of such spending occurring in high-income countries. In contrast, tobacco use costs the world economy an estimated $500 billion each year in health-care expenditures, productivity losses, fire damage, and other costs. Without effective global tobacco control efforts, low-income and middle-income countries with high population densities will continue to suffer the most harm. Even a modest decline in smoking prevalence from 25% to 20%, achieved through broader implementation of MPOWER strategies, could prevent 100 million global deaths from tobacco use by the end of the century.

Jet lag management — general tips state to choose a flight that arrives at a time that gives the traveler the optimal amount of timed light exposure and consider use of a jet lag calculator to personalize recommendations on the timing of bright light, avoidance of light, and administration of melatonin. Additional tips include if possible, adjust sleep time to more closely match the sleep period at the destination for a few days prior to the trip; time activities (e.g., meals, sleep, light exposure) based on the destination time zone; stay hydrated because volume depletion can worsen physical symptoms of jet lag; avoid excess alcohol; avoid sedative medications with long half-lives; maximize natural light exposure at the destination; and avoid lengthy naps during the day at the destination because this will make it more difficult to sleep at night; short naps may improve alertness.

### The ecological footprint of medical AI [^00962958]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

How big a problem are medical AI models in this regard? To help comprehend the scale of this ecological impact, let us examine some relatable comparisons. On an annual basis, an average inhabitant of EU-27 contributes about 6.8 tons of CO 2 emissions, as per greenhouse gas emission statistics. A round-trip flight between Munich and New York in economy class emits around 2.1 tons of CO 2 per person, according to Stiftung Myclimate. And if we look at medical equipment, an MRI scanner running for 1 year results in around 58.3 tons of CO 2 emissions which amounts to 14.6 kg CO 2 per scan for a utilization of 4000 scans per year.

Consider, now, the carbon footprint of training a large language model like GPT-3, the predecessor of the first ChatGPT model. Training such an LLM leaves the same carbon footprint of roughly 262 persons taking a round trip flight from Munich to New York or running one MRI machine in a typical hospital environment for 9.5 years. Comparatively, the carbon emission of conversing with a mid-sized language model in 20 interactions (i.e.g.iving 20 prompts) typically is equivalent to about a millionth of a one-person round trip transatlantic flight. Of note, this number depends on multiple factors, such as the size of the language model, or the infrastructure used for deployment, but we estimate, that this number is correct within few orders of magnitude even for larger contemporary language models. Let us examine a more specific example from medical research, where smaller AI models are frequently used. Consider a state-of-the-art network undergoing training on a large database comprising hundreds of thousands of images for 100 hours. This equates roughly to the typical daily carbon footprint of a European citizen. This is modest. In the future, when AI models will increasingly be applied the carbon footprint of deploying the model will be more relevant. Let us assume that an AI model is run on the images of a patient that has just undergone an MR examination. In our experience, applying a model on a new examination takes a fraction of a second, but to account for bigger models in the future, we estimate that the model will occupy a state-of-the-art GPU in the cloud for at most 10 s. This amounts to a carbon footprint of 0.5 g. Compare this to the carbon emission for the MRI scan itself which amounts to 14,600 g.

Jet lag disorder — strategic shifting of sleep may facilitate adaptation by shifting sleep toward the destination time zone before travel, for example shifting sleep 1 hour later (westward) or earlier (eastward) per day in the 2–3 days prior to the trip, which may reduce the time to adjust; sleep loss during travel can worsen jet lag, in‑flight sleep can be maximized by minimizing alcohol and caffeine intake, alcohol and caffeine can cause dehydration that can further exacerbate jet lag, upon arrival staying awake during the local day helps facilitate sleep during the local night, and short daytime naps (20–30 minutes) can be utilized.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^99e74bef]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To test a scenario where customers use light-duty passenger vehicles to pick-up a package from a retail store, we use the city fuel economy of exemplary gasoline (31 MPG Nissan Versa) and electric (124 MPGGE Nissan Leaf) light-duty vehicles from U.S. fuel economy information. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimated that the average vehicle trip length for shopping purposes was 6.4 miles, according to the most recent survey data. We use twice this length (12.8 miles or 20.6 km) as the base case roundtrip travel distance for personal package pick-up from a retail store. If the roundtrip energy is allocated to one package, the base case energy use is 50.5 MJ for the gasoline personal car and 3.7 kWh for the EV personal car. We test the sensitivity to these results by using minimum and maximum roundtrip distances for retail of 2 and 20 miles, respectively, as done in Weber et al. This sensitivity range would also likely include the uncertainty regarding allocation of per package energy and chained trips with other errands. At a roundtrip distance of 2 miles, a personal gasoline car would still have more GHGs per package than small drones in most of the U.S. but would have lower GHGs than large drones.

Emissions from fuels

The life-cycle GHG intensities of diesel fuel, gasoline and natural gas are adapted from Argonne National Laboratory's GREET modeland Tong et al. using IPCC AR5 100-year Global Warming Potential valuesof 1 (CO 2), 36 (CH 4), and 298 (N 2 O), and are summarized in Supplementary Table 5. These include both direct values and upstream GHGs associated with extraction, transportation, and processing of fuels.

### Three cases of severe hyponatremia during a river run in grand canyon national park [^949888b6]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We present 3 cases of severe hyponatremia occurring on a commercially guided river rafting trip on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. All 3 women appeared to have been overhydrating because of concern about dehydration and required evacuation within 24 hours of each other after the staggered onset of symptoms, which included fatigue and emesis progressing to disorientation or seizure. Each was initially transferred to the nearest hospital and ultimately required intensive care. Imaging and laboratory data indicated all 3 patients had hypervolemic hyponatremia. Unlike the well-documented exercise-associated hyponatremia cases commonly occurring in prolonged endurance athletic events, these 3 unique cases of acute hyponatremia were not associated with significant exercise. The cases illustrate the diagnostic and treatment challenges related to acute hyponatremia in an austere setting, and underscore the importance of preventive measures focused on avoidance of overhydration out of concern for dehydration.

Jet lag calculators — traveler tools — have been developed to provide travelers with recommendations on how to mitigate jet lag by adjusting the timing of sleep, light exposure, caffeine consumption, or use of melatonin in the days prior to, during, and following the trip. Light exposure and melatonin recommendations used by these jet lag calculators are often based on phase-response curves.

Treating skin disorders in wilderness settings is often challenging. In this report we describe common skin conditions affecting the feet of river runners on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. These conditions are frequently referred to by river runners with a catchall term, "tolio". Several skin disorders have been identified as components of tolio, with the most prevalent currently being pitted keratolysis. We present a case of pitted keratolysis in a river guide occurring during a multiday river trip, where treatment can be difficult. Prevention is often more important.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^db3361e9]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

For n rotors of diameter D, the theoretical minimum power to hover is:

When the drone moves at significant velocity or in significant wind, the minimum power requirement changes somewhat depending on the air speed and incident angle. For example, when the drone has substantial forward pitch and forward velocity, the rotors must spin faster to achieve a given thrust, because they must accelerate the air faster than its incoming velocity. The minimum power with forward motion can also be calculated from conservation of momentum. Adapting from Hoffman et al. the power is given by:where v i is the induced velocity required for a given thrust and can be found by the solution to the implicit equation:

We correct the theoretical minimum power by the overall power efficiency of the drone, η, to get expended power:

We determine η empirically for the quadcopter model and apply the same factor to the octocopter estimates. Alternately, the velocity-dependent power–thrust relationship for a specific propeller can be measured empirically or estimated with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The relationship is available from the manufacturer in the form of a lookup table for the propellers in our quadcopter test model. We include the CFD result in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 for comparison.

To calculate the energy efficiency of travel, e, we divide power consumption by the average ground speed of the drone:

We find the energy consumed for a delivery trip of one-way distance d by:

where power and velocity (which we assume are constant for each leg) are evaluated with the package present to give e loaded (for the outbound trip) and without the package to give e unloaded (for the return trip).

Adventure travel risk factors for illness and injury include that climate, terrain, and weather can be extreme, communication often is limited, even with modern technology, and destinations can be remote and lack access to medical care; physical exertion increases caloric, fluid, sleep, and thermoregulation requirements. Trips may span several weeks, months, or years and may be goal-oriented, which can cause travelers to exceed safety limits, and unexpected complications can occur with flight schedules, vehicle breakdowns, weather delays, and other factors.

Medical evacuation insurance — medical evacuation from a resource-poor area to a hospital delivering definitive care might be necessary despite having travel health insurance. The total cost of a medevac varies by location, ranging from USD 25,000 for transport within North America to over USD 250,000 for more distant and remote locations, and costs increase when the patient being evacuated is critically ill or needs complex infection control measures. The decision to medically evacuate is at the discretion of the insurance company; it is not made at the request of the traveler, and typically, the traveler must be hospitalized with anticipation that multiple additional days of hospitalization will be required or specialized surgery or treatment is needed that is not of comparable quality at the current destination. Some medical evacuation companies have more extensive experience working in some parts of the world than others; travelers should ask about a company's resources in each region of travel, especially if planning trips to hard-to-reach locations, and if the health risks are too high, a traveler might want to postpone or cancel their international trip.

### Role of flying cars in sustainable mobility [^921af099]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
GHG emissions normalized by vehicle-kilometers traveled. The GHG emission results for single-occupant VTOLs and ground-based vehicles (ICEV and BEV) are normalized by vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT). This illustrates the impact of amortizing the fixed burden from the hover phase over longer distances. The VTOL GHG emissions break even with the ICEV at 35 km

The ICEV performs better than the VTOL up to ~35 km, where aerial flight is dominated by the energy-intensive hover mode. GHG emissions for VTOLs drop substantially below those from ICEVs for trips longer than ~50 km. For long-distance trips, VTOLs can leverage efficient cruise performance to outperform ICEVs. The VTOL emissions approach, but do not match, those from BEVs for distances > ~120 km. For our base-case travel distance of 100 km (point-to-point), the VTOL has well-to-wing/wheel GHG emissions that are 35% lower but 28% higher than the ICEV and BEV, respectively.

Initially, VTOLs are likely to operate as aerial taxis, and service providers would target near-full occupancy from a utilization–maximization standpoint, similar to current commercial airlines. Passengers could be incentivized to share VTOL rides given the significant expected time savings from flying. Thus, it seems likely that the average occupancy of VTOLs will be greater than conventional passenger cars. Given an expected occupancy difference, it can be argued that the emission burdens between VTOLs and ground-based vehicles should be compared on a PKT basis rather than the VKT basis shown in Fig. 4. The results of this assessment are described in the Sensitivity Analysis.

Air travel and oxygen considerations in COPD: Although air travel is safe for most patients with chronic respiratory failure who are on long-term oxygen therapy, patients should ideally maintain an in-flight PaO2 of at least 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). Studies indicate that this can be achieved in those with moderate to severe hypoxemia at sea level by supplementary oxygen at 3 liters/min by nasal cannula or 31% by Venturi facemasks. Those with a resting oxygen saturation > 95% and 6-minute walk oxygen saturation > 84% may travel without further assessment, although resting oxygenation at sea level does not exclude the development of severe hypoxemia when travelling by air, and walking along the aisle may profoundly aggravate hypoxemia.

### Role of flying cars in sustainable mobility [^abbd49fa]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Interest and investment in electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (VTOLs), commonly known as flying cars, have grown significantly. However, their sustainability implications are unclear. We report a physics-based analysis of primary energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of VTOLs vs. ground-based cars. Tilt-rotor/duct/wing VTOLs are efficient when cruising but consume substantial energy for takeoff and climb; hence, their burdens depend critically on trip distance. For our base case, traveling 100 km (point-to-point) with one pilot in a VTOL results in well-to-wing/wheel GHG emissions that are 35% lower but 28% higher than a one-occupant internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV), respectively. Comparing fully loaded VTOLs (three passengers) with ground-based cars with an average occupancy of 1.54, VTOL GHG emissions per passenger-kilometer are 52% lower than ICEVs and 6% lower than BEVs. VTOLs offer fast, predictable transportation and could have a niche role in sustainable mobility.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^a6fa7f66]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In selecting the velocity, the operator may choose to minimize energy use (i.e. maximize range) or may choose higher speeds for faster delivery times (and better capital utilization), or lower speeds for safety or other practical considerations. The size of the package also influences the optimum choice of velocity, although the overall contribution of package drag in our base case is small (9 and 7% of roundtrip energy use for the quadcopter and octocopter, respectively). For simplicity, we assume a 10 m/s velocity for further analysis in all cases, which yields power demands close to the modeled optimum (at most 14% higher). Supplementary Tables 1–3 present model parameters and assumptions.

In our flight tests, the quadcopter flew total distances of 2.6 to 3.7 km on a single charge during the high-speed measurements (5–12 m/s) and 0.6 km to 1.15 km during low speed measurements (< 5 m/s), without a package. For the scenarios below, we define range as the farthest distance from a warehouse to which a drone can deliver a package and still return to the warehouse. The test model configuration is thus not suited to package delivery, except at very short ranges (about 1 km). However, increasing the battery size can increase the range. Figure 2 shows the dependence of range and energy use on battery mass. In principle, the range increases with battery size with diminishing returns, up to a maximum where additional battery mass becomes counter-productive. Although the model accounts for the increase in drag due to the presence of the additional battery volume, we find this effect has very little influence on the result compared with the weight of the battery. The maximum range with base-case assumptions is about 5 km for both the quadcopter and octocopter. However, the maximum is achieved with batteries that are impractically large and well beyond the thrust capabilities of the test models, likely imposing problems for flight control, capital cost, and energy efficiency. For further analysis, we choose battery sizes that provide most of the range while still within or near the thrust capabilities of our test units: 1 kg for the quadcopter and 10 kg for the octocopter, providing ranges of about 3.5 and 4.2 km, respectively. These ranges are short compared to the distances traveled by conventional package delivery vehicles and the sizes of most metropolitan areas.

### How much can optimization of hypofractionation help to reduce carbon equivalent emissions? A single-center modeling study [^8b160933]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient travel

In 2019, we treated 2239 patients with 2625 EBRT courses. This accounted for 43,433 visits and an estimated total travel distance of 2.67 million km, representing an estimated total of 394 t of CO 2 e emissions. The mean travel distance per visit (round trip) was 61.5 km (95% CI, 60.4–62.6) and the median travel distance was 59.4 km. Travel distances for different subgroups are shown in Table 2. In 2019, 74.9% (1966/2625) of the courses were already performed using some form of hypofractionation (defined as fraction size > 2 Gy). This was the case for 59.7% (132/221) of prostate irradiations and 99.3% (571/575) of breast irradiations, where only moderate hypofractionation schedules were used instead of ultrahypofractionated ones (67.25 Gy in 25 fractions and 56 Gy in 16 fractions for prostate cancer and 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions for breast cancer). With 2024 hypothetical maximal hypofractionation, there would only have been 33,711 visits, decreasing the total traveled distance to 2.18 million km, representing 322 t of CO 2 e, which is a decrease of 18.3% (95% CI, 17.7–20.0) in emissions. Table 3 shows the differences in CO 2 e emissions for the indications where hypofractionation could be improved. The reduction was much more important for early breast cancer (–32.4%) and prostate cancer (–48.5%) than for all the other pathologies (–7.0%) (Fig. 1).

### American orthopaedic foot and ankle society annual meeting all-in-person attendance results in immense carbon expenditure [^0f59c92e]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Professional society conferences are integral to the medical profession. However, airline travel is a major contributor to greenhouse gas production, and the environmental impact of in-person attendance at an orthopaedic conference has yet to be described. With growing concern about the climate crisis, we sought to quantify the carbon footprint of in-person attendance to help potential attendees more consciously consider in-person attendance, inform strategies to minimize greenhouse gas emissions during travel to annual meetings, and increase awareness about and momentum for efforts in orthopaedic surgery to reduce the carbon footprint of society conferences.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What was the magnitude of greenhouse gas production resulting from all-in-person 2019 American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) annual meeting attendance in Chicago, IL, USA? (2) What was the magnitude of greenhouse gas production resulting from the all-virtual 2020 AOFAS annual meeting, and how does it compare with the 2019 AOFAS annual meeting carbon footprint? (3) To what extent could an alternative in-person meeting model with four or seven hubs decrease greenhouse gas production resulting from round-trip air travel compared with the 2019 AOFAS annual meeting?

Methods

A list of the postal codes and countries of all 1271 registered participants attending the four-day 2019 AOFAS annual meeting in Chicago, IL, USA, was obtained from AOFAS headquarters. The 2019 conference was chosen because it was the last pre-COVID meeting and thus attendance was more likely to resemble that at prepandemic in-person conferences than more recent meetings because of pandemic travel restrictions. We estimated carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO 2 e) production from round-trip air travel using a publicly available internet-based calculator (Myclimate: https://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new). Emissions produced by the conference venue, car travel, and hotel stays were estimated using published Environmental Protection Agency emission factors. To estimate emissions produced by the all-virtual 2020 AOFAS annual meeting (assuming an equal number of attendees as in 2019), we used the framework published by Faber and summed estimated network data transfer emissions, personal computer and monitor emissions, and server-related emissions. Using the 2019 registrant list, we modeled four-hub and seven-hub in-person meeting alternatives to determine potential decreased round-trip air travel greenhouse gas production. Meeting hub locations were selected by visualizing the geographic distribution of the 2019 registrants and selecting reasonable meeting locations that would minimize air travel for the greatest number of attendees. Registrants were assigned to the nearest hub location. Myclimate was again used to estimate CO 2 e production for round-trip air travel for the hub meeting models.

Results

The total estimated emissions of the all-in-person 2019 AOFAS annual meeting (when accounting for travel, conference space, and hotel stays) was 1565 tons CO 2 e (median 0.61 tons per attendee, range 0.02 to 7.7 tons). The total estimated emissions of the all-virtual 2020 meeting (when accounting for network data transfer emissions, personal computer and monitor emissions, and server-related emissions) was 34 tons CO 2 e (median 0.03 tons per attendee). This corresponds to a 97.8% decrease in CO 2 e emissions compared with the in-person conference. The model of a four-hub in-person meeting alternative with meetings in Chicago, Santiago, London, and Tokyo predicted an estimated 54% decrease in CO 2 e emissions from round-trip air travel. The seven-hub meeting model with meetings in Chicago; Washington, DC; Dallas; Los Angeles; Santiago; London; and Tokyo was predicted to diminish the CO 2 e emissions of round-trip air travel by an estimated 71%.

Conclusion

The 2019 AOFAS annual meeting had an enormous carbon footprint and resulted in many individuals exceeding their annual allotted carbon budget (2.5 tons) according to the Paris Agreement. Hosting the meeting virtually greatly reduced the annual meeting carbon footprint, and our hub-based meeting models identified potential in-person alternatives for reducing the carbon footprint of conference attendance.

Clinical Relevance

Professional societies must consider our responsibility to decarbonizing the healthcare sector by considering innovative approaches-perhaps such as our multihub proposals-to decarbonize carbon-intensive annual meetings without stalling academic progress.

Also consider that if the medical event occurs at the start of a long-haul flight, volunteering may result in hours of ongoing clinical monitoring.

### Medical conferences in the era of environmental conscientiousness and a global health crisis: the carbon footprint of presenter flights to pre-COVID pediatric urology conferences and a consideration of future options [^0a6e5ceb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medical conferences are integral to academic medicine, with academic posters being a well-established medium for presenting research. However, conferences carry an ecological footprint due to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, traditional conference formats have recently not been possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we examine the carbon footprint associated with travel by presenting delegates to the Fall SPU conferences from 2013 to 2019, and the 2015 ESPU conference.

Methods

Online programs for the targeted SPU Fall meetings and the 2015 ESPU Annual Meeting were retrospectively reviewed. Variables collected included meeting location and presenter home base. Distance traveled by the presenter, and likely CO 2 e of this return trip were estimated using online calculators. Analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis-H test with pairwise comparisons to detect differences in round trip distances and CO 2 e between meeting locations.

Results

Six Fall SPU conferences and one ESPU conference were reviewed. The majority of presenters were from the region (North America and Europe, respectively), for both SPU and ESPU. The median round trip distance was 2596.34 miles (IQR 1420.96–4438.30), and the median CO 2 e 0.61 metric tons (IQR 0.36–1.02). We found that the distances traveled to conferences in the Western USA and Europe were slightly further than those to conferences in Central Canada and the Southern US. The difference in CO 2 e between these locations did not achieve statistical significance.

Conclusion

Presenter travel to and from pediatric urological conferences generates an important carbon footprint and may not be possible in the medium-term future due to a global pandemic. We should explore strategies to allow meetings and knowledge exchange to continue whilst reducing the need for travel and the ecological burden of conferences.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^9cd4fd50]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Drone sizes and ranges

To estimate the energy use and environmental impacts of drone delivery, we first model the energy use and performance of multicopter drones. The use case consists of a single drone carrying a single package from warehouse to destination, and then returning empty to the warehouse. We base the analysis on two representative commercial drones: a small quadcopter (3D Robotics' Iris), designed to carry up to 0.5 kg, and a large octocopter (Turbo Ace's Infinity 9) designed to carry up to 8.1 kg. These provide useful bounds in the performance of current commercial designs. To estimate the energy used by a drone on a delivery trip, we extend a known analytical model, based on conservation of momentum, of the theoretical minimum power demand by copters. The model includes two empirical parameters: an overall power efficiency, η (compared to the theoretical minimum), and effective drag coefficient for the drone body and rotors, C D, body. These are derived from measurements of 1073 flight segments of the quadcopter in several outdoor test campaigns (see Methods for model details and flight conditions). Parameters thus account for moderate wind (0–7 m/s) at random orientation to the direction of travel.

The energy used by the drone to deliver a package depends on the speed of travel. Figure 1a shows the measured energy use per distance traveled over a range of velocities for our test unit quadcopter. Comparable results from the analytical model are shown with two different power efficiencies. At low velocities, a power efficiency, η, of about 50% fits the data well (also with different payload masses, see Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). At higher speeds, the power efficiency appears to increase to about 70% (likely due to translational lift, a well-known effect in helicopter dynamics). We use the higher value in further analysis. The effective drag coefficient, C D, body, also varies with velocity (Supplementary Fig. 3). We use the best-fit value at higher velocities, C D, body = 1.5, in further analysis. Figure 1b shows the model results for the quadcopter and octocopter in the two relevant flight conditions (with and without a package).

### Cost4Visit: a cross-sectional cohort study on hidden costs among surgical patients and relatives for in-person and video visits [^80beac3a]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Round-trip travel time exceeded an hour, which is still short considering the tertiary referral nature of the clinic. Travel time, influenced by population and geography, affects the calculated travel time saved by a video visit across various surgical studies. A study in upper extremity surgery patients, conducted at an academic level-I trauma centre in Danville (USA) covering a large service area of approximately 25 000 square miles, reported 85 min travel time saved, whereas 39 min were saved in a vascular surgery patient cohort at a tertiary centre in Detroit.

Besides time and financial benefits of video visits for patients, the reduction of CO 2 emissions has important environmental and societal implications. Here, patient-travel emission savings in the video visit group were 1329 kg CO 2− eq and 14 kg CO 2− eq on average per video visit (CO 2 emission factor of 0.17431/km of an average petrol-burning car). This concords with the reported 11.2 kg emission savings of a vascular surgery video visit and the same greenhouse gas emission savings of orthopaedic and trauma surgery video visits. Although there are other carbon-intensive hotspots in the surgical setting, such as material production and consumables, transportation-related carbon emissions from patient travel — which are significantly mitigated when shifting from in-person to video — will have a large impact on reducing the healthcare sectors' carbon footprint and expenses for society.

For a fair comparison, however, the IT's footprint associated with a video visit should be considered as well, with internet data use and consumed energy being the main contributors.1 hour of video call from a desktop emits 52 g CO 2, equivalent to travelling less than 1.5 km.

The environmental benefits of VC are particularly relevant when considering the 'alleged' frequent need for in-person visits for certain vulnerable patient groups, such as those with advanced cancer or elderly. Studies show that patients with advanced GI cancers spend a quarter of their remaining time on in-person contact with their healthcare providers. Similarly, older adults in traditional Medicare spend an average of 3 weeks per year receiving ambulatory care. Shifting visits to video could greatly reduce the environmental impact of patients and companions travel.

### Five careers and eight airplanes: an oral history of John geyman, MD [^dfbf5294]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Each generation has an obligation to remind succeeding ones about the people, ideas, and events that have gotten us to this point. This essay and an accompanying oral history trace the origins of family medicine through the life of someone who helped found it — John P. Geyman, MD. He is one of the most published family physicians in the United States. In addition to being a rural family physician, he was one of the first residency directors in family medicine and the first editor of the discipline's first academic journal. His career weaves 4 themes together in interesting and creative ways: commitment to the work of clinical practice, a sense of responsibility for strengthening clinical education, a belief that clinical care should be based on science and delivered within a rational system of health care, and a love of flying. His story also exemplifies the generation of general practitioners who started family medicine but who retained both a personal understanding of the complex nature of independent practice and a reliance on community.

### How coronavirus disease will change the face of travel medicine [^22adf5ce]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current article will review how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has changed travel and travel medicine.

Recent Findings

Travelers spread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 globally and continue to spread variants. The characteristics of the virus, the place, and time created a perfect storm that allowed the virus to quickly spread globally. The virus spread by every mode of travel with risk of transmission influenced by proximity to an infected person, duration of trip, physical characteristics of the space, and ventilation. Superspreading events were common; a small percentage of infected people accounted for most of transmission. The travel and tourist industry was devastated as lockdowns and quarantines severely restricted domestic and international travel. A trip includes multiple segments and shared sequential spaces, mostly indoors. Creating safe travel requires attention to all segments of a trip.

Summary

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected every part of travel and travel medicine. The rapid development of multiple safe and effective vaccines and their deployment is allowing resumption of travel, yet many populations lack access to vaccines, and high levels of transmission continue in many areas. Providing documentation of vaccination or immunity in a consistent, verifiable, interoperable system is one of many active issues.

Adventure travel pre-travel planning and guided trip considerations — "During the pre-travel consultation, in addition to providing routine travel medicine advice, gather extra information and discuss precautions for adventure travel". For trip assessment, "Obtain details about the type, length, and remoteness of the trip". Even when joining guided trips, the text states to "encourage participants to ask trip organizers about: contingency plans for emergencies; guide experience and medical training; recommendations for medications and medical supplies to be carried by participants; types of medical kits (see Sec. 1, Ch. 9, Travel Health Kits) and safety equipment carried by guides; and types of recommended insurance (see Sec. 5, Ch. 1, Travel Insurance, Travel Health Insurance, and Medical Evacuation Insurance)". It further directs to "Confirm that the experience, fitness, and skill level of the participant matches the trip type", that "Novices at diving, mountaineering, sailing, or skiing should participate in instructional trips", and to "Encourage people with less experience or who are visiting a location for the first time to go on a guided trip".

### Reducing the carbon footprint of academic conferences: the example of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene [^6d1b92d4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

We calculated carbon emissions associated with air travel of 4,834 participants at the 2019 annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Together, participants traveled a total of 27.7 million miles or 44.6 million kilometers. This equates to 58 return trips to the moon. Estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions were 8,646 metric tons or the total weekly carbon footprint of approximately 9,366 average American households. These emissions contribute to climate change and thus may exacerbate many of the global diseases that conference attendees seek to combat. Options to reduce conference travel-associated emissions include 1) alternating in-person and online conferences, 2) offering a hybrid in-person/online conference, and 3) decentralizing the conference with multiple conference venues. Decentralized ASTMH conferences may allow for up to 64% reduction in travel distance and 58% reduction in CO 2 e emissions. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and the clear association between global warming and global health, ways to reduce carbon emissions should be considered.

### Norovirus outbreaks among Colorado river rafters in the grand canyon, summer 2012 [^fc09deba]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the incidence and causative agent of the recurrent outbreaks of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) among different rafting groups on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon National Park during the 2012 summer season.

Methods

Confidential illness reports were completed by all individuals with symptoms of AGI, and samples of fecal matter and vomitus, surface swabs of rafting equipment, and environmental swabs at stops along the hiking corridor were collected and tested for the presence of norovirus using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

Results

During the active outbreak period between May 9 and July 9, 2012, 97 rafters (1.4%) from 10 trips (2.9% of all trips) declared AGI symptoms. AGI incidence within the 10 infected trips varied from 6% to 88%. Outbreaks occurred in 3 distinct temporal clusters that involved 2 different genogroups of norovirus. All available toilet fecal samples (5 samples) were positive for norovirus RNA: 1 with genogroup I (GI) and 4 with GII. The vomitus sample tested positive for GI. None of the fomite samples from rafting equipment or from the hiking corridors were confirmed for norovirus.

Conclusions

The results suggest that norovirus may have been introduced by ill or asymptomatic individuals actively shedding the virus in their vomitus or feces, and spread within, or between, river trips by different modes of transmission. This study reinforces the importance of appropriate guidance and practice regarding norovirus prevention and the necessity of postoutbreak containment in relatively isolated groups of individuals.

### Why climate action is global health action [^358d3e9c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

OUR OWN EMISSIONS ARE HARMING GLOBAL HEALTH

The activities and operations of global health institutions generate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to global warming. In our field, greenhouse gas emissions come from energy used to power laboratories, clinics, data centers, animal facilities, and other buildings; fuel burned during commuting and air travel; embodied carbon in equipment and consumables; and emissions supported by financial holdings associated with the fossil fuel industry. Health care accounts for approximately 5% of national carbon footprints. In 2019, the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with air travel to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) annual meeting was an estimated 8,646 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, which is approximately the same amount of carbon dioxide released from burning 20,017 barrels of oil. In comparison, the emissions associated with the virtual conference in 2021 was approximately 1.3 metric tons or 3 barrels of oil.

### The health risks and benefits of cycling in urban environments compared with car use: health impact assessment study [^7c5bcad5]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Finally, there are many other benefits and some potential risks associated with cycling that were not integrated in this assessment. We estimated savings in carbon dioxide emissions but did not measure reductions in other emissions or the potential associated health effects or cost savings of reductions in emissions. Based on the small 4% reduction in car journeys in Barcelona according to our calculations on shift in travel mode, it is unlikely that savings on emissions would be sufficient to have a meaningful effect on population exposures and their health implications, especially considering the high uncertainty associated with estimating health impacts of probable unequal distribution of reduction to exposures. Considering possible larger implications of cycling on shifts in mode of travel (for example, a trend phenomenon leading to more cycling in general in the city) and the increase in replacement of car journeys by cycling trips over the years, it may be worth accounting for changes in exposures in the general population in future work. A similar argument can be made about reductions in exposure to road traffic crashes and noise that can accompany a reduction in car use — for example, fewer cars on the road increases traffic safety for the general population. Future assessments may take such effects in the general population into account, along with other exposures or behaviours potentially affected by the active travel policy, such as heat or recreational cycling. Other future improvements in the modelling framework include estimating morbidity, given that mortality represents only a part of the underlying groups of diseases associated with the three main domains. Morbidity also involves greater uncertainty in the calculations but can show larger effects on public health for both risksand benefits. Furthermore, analyses of years of life lost or disability adjusted life years are likely to show even more pointedly the benefits of the policy, given the numbers of avoided deaths in relatively young populations. Follow-up of this work should also include a more detailed uncertainty and variability analysis, so that the distribution in the population of exposures and behaviours and different categories of demographics and health status can be accounted for rather than providing only central estimates (albeit with sensitivity analyses).

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^4767fece]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy — key transportation and health terms are defined. Greenhouse gas emissions are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O); some greenhouse gases such as CO2 occur naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes and human activities, while other greenhouse gases (e.g., fluorinated gases) are created and emitted solely through human activities. Health impact assessment (HIA) is defined as a method by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects — and distribution of those effects — on the health of the population. High occupancy vehicle lane is an exclusive road/traffic lane limited to buses, van/carpools, & emergency vehicles. The United States Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956, the fund has accounts including the 'Highway Account', the 'Mass Transit Account' and the 'Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund', and money in the fund is raised via a federal fuel tax per gallon on gasoline and diesel fuel and related excise taxes. Public transportation is transportation by bus, rail, or other conveyance, either publicly or privately owned, which provides to the public general or special service on a regular and continuing basis and is also known as mass transportation, mass transit and transit. The Safe Routes to Schools Program is a Federal-Aid program of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration created by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users Act (SAFETEA-LU), and its purposes are to enable and encourage all children to walk and bicycle to school, to make bicycling and walking to school a safer and more appealing transportation alternative, and to facilitate planning, development, and implementation of projects and activities that will improve safety and reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the vicinity (approximately 2 miles) of primary and middle schools (Grades K-8). Safety audits and assessments are a method by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the safety of the population. Shared-use paths are a path physically separated from motor vehicle traffic by an open space or barrier and either within a highway right-of-way or an independent right-of-way, used by bicyclists, pedestrians, joggers, skaters and other non-motorized travelers. Transit-oriented development is compact, mixed-use development near transit facilities with high-quality walking environments.

Results

Comparison with the state-of-the-art conference LCA studies

Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 summarize and compare the state-of-the-art conference LCA studies. Previous LCA studies mainly focused on quantifying the carbon footprint of in-person conferences, while only two of them presented results for other impact categories using the LCIA method, including CML2001, USEtox, Eco-Indicator 99, and UBP 97. Half of them focused exclusively on round-trip transportation, while the rest considered life cycle stages of preparation, execution, catering, accommodation, and transportation –. However, due to differences in assumptions associated with in-person conferences (e.g. duration, size, and locations of the conference, geographical distribution of participants, transportation mode, system boundary, and selection of characterization factors), the carbon footprint ranges from 92 to 3 540 kg CO 2 equivalent per capita. All of these studies identified transportation as the environmental hotspot. The conference site and geographical distribution of participants determine the transportation distance and mode for participants. From those who reported the average transportation distance, the average round-trip transportation distance varies from 1 980 kmto 9 564 km. However, the average distance does not illustrate the complete picture of the participant transportation. It was found that the 10–20% of participants with the most polluting trips contribute to a substantial portion (20–70%) of the total transportation-induced emissions –. These values depend on the distribution of participants, which reveals whether the conference is more localized or more internationalized. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, most participants are from the region where the conferences are held. The conference location is also important in determining the transportation profile. A conference location with better train connection to other major cities is capable of allowing more participants to transport by train and thus has more potential of reducing carbon footprint. In contrast, a conference located in the southern hemisphere usually performs much worse in terms of the carbon footprint than the northern hemisphere. Bossdorf et al. suggested food and accommodation accounted for 18% and 13% of the total carbon footprint, respectively. On the other hand, owing to the exclusive vegetarian menu and the much higher transportation emissions, Astudillo and Azarijafari reported that food and accommodation only accounted for 1% and 2% of the total carbon footprint.

### The role of energy storage in deep decarbonization of electricity production [^4d6ad262]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We examine nine energy storage technologies that have suitable characteristics for renewable integration- and curtailment-related applications: PHS, ACAES, DCAES, and PbA, VRB, Li-ion, NaS, PSB, and ZNBR batteries. These technologies are characterized by their round-trip efficiencies, service lives, and capital costs, which are summarized in Table 4 and obtained from a comprehensive literature review. The service lives of the technologies are accounted for when annualizing their capital costs. This annualization makes the capital costs of the technologies comparable to the cost of power system operations, which are modeled over a single-year period for each year that is studied. Because we only have data starting from 20 April 2010, we subannualize the capital cost in this year to make the capital and operating costs comparable.

Table 4
Technical characteristics of energy storage technologies

a The efficiency of DCAES is modeled differently than those of other technologies. Each MWh of stored electricity can produce 1.39 MWh of electricity when discharged with 4.20 MMBTU of natural gas being consumed in the process,

The round-trip efficiency of DCAES is modeled differently than those of the other energy storage technologies. The other technologies are pure energy storage, in the sense that they each use electricity as the sole energy input. DCAES uses electricity when charging but combusts natural gas when discharged. Each MWh of electricity that is stored in a DCAES system is assumed to produce 1.39 MWh of electricity when discharged but uses 4.20 MMBTU of natural gas in doing so. This natural gas combustion is assumed to result in CO 2 emissions of 0.058 ton MMBTU −1. The direct cost of the natural gas that is consumed by the DCAES is computed using the values that are reported in Table 3.

### Outbreak of acute gastroenteritis among rafters and backpackers in the backcountry of grand canyon national park, April-June 2022 [^f2892e4c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

On May 11, 2022, the National Park Service (NPS) Office of Public Health (OPH) and Coconino County Health and Human Services (CCHHS) in Flagstaff, Arizona contacted CDC about a rising number of acute gastroenteritis cases among backcountry visitors to Grand Canyon National Park (Grand Canyon). The agencies reviewed illness report forms, assessed infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, and distributed a detailed survey to river rafters and hikers with backcountry permits (backpackers) who visited the Grand Canyon backcountry. During April 1–June 17, a total of 191 rafters and 31 backpackers reported symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. Specimens from portable toilets used by nine river rafting trip groups were tested using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and test results were positive for norovirus. Norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis is highly transmissible in settings with close person-to-person contact and decreased access to hand hygiene, such as backpacking or rafting. IPC assessments led to recommendations for regular disinfection of potable water spigots throughout the backcountry, promotion of proper handwashing with soap and water when possible, and separation of ill persons from those who are not ill. Prevention and control of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in the backcountry requires rapid reporting of illnesses, implementing IPC guidelines for commercial outfitters and river rafting launch points, and minimizing interactions among rafting groups.

### Finding gaps in the national electric vehicle charging station coverage of the United States [^07569475]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Several papers assess the value consumers place on the ability to take trips beyond the range of a typical EV. Melaina et al. (2013) conducted a discrete choice survey and found diminishing cost penalties for the inability to complete long-distance trips in an EV; this study demonstrates that although only 0.1% of trips are farther than 500 miles, having the option to travel long distances matters to consumers. The inability to do so imposes significant ($1000–$2000) cost penalties. Hidrue et al. (2011) looked at the value of extending EV battery range to consumers, finding that survey respondents were willing to pay up to $75 per additional mile of driving range, with a decreased willingness to pay as the range increases. We define the long-distance range we consider as 500 miles given the importance long-distance viability is to consumers, combined with the infrequency of consumers traversing the entire U.S.

Decarbonizing the light-duty vehicle sector is imperative to meet climate goals. Hoehne et al. (2023) outlined pathways to decarbonize U.S. passenger and freight vehicles using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Transportation Energy & Mobility Pathway Options (TEMPO) model for EV adoption and associated emissions under varying assumptions. Charging station infrastructure is an important driver of EV adoption, but is just one tool available for decarbonizing transportation –. Mulrow and Grubert (2023) highlighted the potential impact of changing behavior, such as decreasing total miles traveled, on overall vehicle emissions. Aguilar et al. (2024) found that if 50% of EVs in Europe implemented vehicle-to-grid technology, they could meet the full demand for battery storage in Europe, reducing infrastructure build-out. Ren et al. (2023) found that although EVs have fewer emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles over the vehicle lifetime, their greenhouse gas emissions are front-loaded due to battery manufacturing. Therefore, efforts should strategically replace high-emitting and high-mileage internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs.

International business traveler — In 2017, approximately 4.8 million US residents traveled overseas for business; despite the slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Business Travel Association predicted in 2023 that business travel, although recovering more slowly than leisure travel, would exceed pre-pandemic levels by 2024. Globalization and offshore manufacturing have expanded travel to an increasing number of countries worldwide, including many countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America; some companies are using webconferencing and online and hybrid meetings to cut travel budgets, and such approaches have the benefit of cost savings and a lower carbon footprint. Business travelers include people traveling for conventions, research, work-related training, and volunteer work, and some combine work with tourist activities by bringing a friend or family member or by extending their business trip to include a leisure component. For business travelers, the likelihood of an adverse health event increases with the number of trips made to at-risk areas, the length of time spent at the destination, and lifestyle at the destination. Many international business travelers take multiple trips each year.

### The mortality cost of carbon [^ca3f3c95]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Like the SCC, the MCC is useful for determining the social impact of new marginal activities or projects that produce greenhouse emissions, or, equivalently, the benefit from forgoing these activities. In the central estimate, we find that the 2020 MCC is 2.26 × 10⁻⁴ lives per metric ton as shown in Table 1, with the low (< 10th percentile) to high (> 90th percentile) estimate ranging from −1.71 × 10⁻⁴ to 6.78 × 10⁻⁴ (see the "Methods" section for more details on the uncertainty in the mortality estimate). This implies that reducing (increasing) emissions by 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020 saves 226 lives (causes 226 excess deaths) in expectation from 2020 to 2100 in the baseline emissions scenario. One million metric tons is roughly equal to the average annual emissions of 35 commercial airliners, 216,000 passenger vehicles, and 115,000 homes in the United States. The MCC implies that removing (adding) a year's worth of carbon dioxide emissions from an average coal-fired powerplant in the United States in 2020 saves 904 lives (causes 904 excess deaths) in expectation from 2020 to 2100 (refs.).

### The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand [^7960b0cd]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Modal shift magnitudes and emissions

Most municipal regions choose to set targets on the basis of the numbers of trips done by different modes rather than distances. Given that the amount of tailpipe emissions is proportional to distance travelled and not number of trips, it is hard to calculate whether such targets are sufficient. In order to account for this, the National Travel Survey (2019)was used. The dataset was restricted to only trips that both began and ended in the Greater London Region. A random selection of trips was then selected in line with the number of trips being expected to be modally shifted in order to calculate how much of the total vehicle mileage was avoided this way. This was repeated 2000 different times and averaged in order to determine how many vehicle-miles would be displaced under different trip modal shift rates. It should be noted that limiting to trips beginning and ending in Greater London limits our study to ignore longer trips which make up disproportionately large contributions to emissions. However, it is unclear how to categorise them to London and the policies being discussed were those that would apply within the GLA region.

To calculate replacement mode emissions, the difference between distance driven in the baseline case, which assumes a 20% increase in 2050 from 2019, and distance driven in the modally shifted case, is calculated. This distance is multiplied by an average emissions intensity in gCO 2 /km of non-car modes. This intensity is calculated by using the modal share for London in 2019, normalising without the car mode, and multiplying the proportion of modes of a given journey, e.g. walk, cycle, rail and bus, by the appropriate emissions intensity of that mode. The average London occupancy for rail and busses is assumed, taken from UK Government reporting. The emissions intensities include embedded emissions from infrastructure, vehicles and active travel equipment. Busses are assumed to instantly convert to electrical busses and decarbonise at the pace of the electrical grid decarbonisation assumed in other parts of the model. The values used are given in Supplementary Note 14.

The percentage of travel by each mode and public transport occupancies are assumed to stay constant at London's current levels and busses are assumed to be electric with emissions decarbonising at the rate of the electrical grid assumed in the model.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^55487aff]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have shown that transport of goods per tonne-km by conventional aircraft is about four times more carbon-intensive than transport by truck, which is in turn about 10 times more carbon-intensive than transport by rail. A delivery system based on drones carrying single packages promises a new class of delivery speed — Amazon has claimed 30 min from time of purchase. If it follows the trend set by other modes, this large increase in speed could come at the cost of another order-of-magnitude increase in energy intensity and carbon emissions. However, small, battery-powered drones can be considerably more efficient than the fossil-fueled vehicles they replace.

Most drones for military and government applications have been larger, fixed-wing (airplane-style), fossil-fueled designs. Fixed-wing aircraft are inherently more energy efficient and can have much longer ranges than rotary wing copters, and this holds true for small drones. However, these fixed-wing drones are physically much larger than copters of comparable payload capacity, they require runways for takeoff and landing, are more constrained in the weight and size of packages they can carry, and can only deliver packages from an altitude, while moving, which is not as suitable for precise urban deliveries. Drone deliveries have also been considered for places with poor road networks, for example delivering supplies to villages in rural Africa. This would require longer-range fossil-fueled drones, and fixed-wing drones making airdrops of larger payloads are more plausible for this application. However, drone deliveries are also likely to appear in urban developed markets.

In most prototypes and media depictions so far, drones for package delivery have appeared as four- or eight-rotor, battery-powered copters capable of carrying up to 4.5 kg (10 lbs). The multicopter models currently available typically have flight times of 10–15 min before draining the onboard batteries, leading to very limited delivery ranges. Larger batteries, new battery technologies, and other energy storage methods would affect the range and energy efficiency of these drones. Google has announced a novel hybrid design, capable of both hovering and fixed-wing flight. Although not meant for package delivery, another hybrid prototype has been revealed by Sony. However, to date, information about this type of drone is limited and commercial models are not available.

### Outbreak of acute gastroenteritis among rafters and backpackers in the backcountry of grand canyon national park, April-June 2022 [^61f12c45]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Commercially operated Colorado River rafting trips are allowed within the Grand Canyon during April–October. OPH surveillance of river rafting trip illnesses requires that guides on commercially operated trips report the occurrence of fewer than three illnesses at each trip's end, contact the NPS by satellite phone as soon as possible when three or more illnesses occur, and complete an illness report form for each ill person. Private rafting trip guides must report illnesses within 7 days after completing the trip. Backpackers are encouraged to report illnesses.

During April–May 2022, approximately 4,770 rafters visited the Grand Canyon backcountry. † On April 8, 2022, OPH was notified by a commercially operated rafting group within Grand Canyon of seven persons experiencing vomiting or diarrhea. After nine additional rafting trips (173 rafters), multiple cases of acute gastroenteritis were reported. OPH and CCHHS contacted CDC on May 11, 2022. By May 21, thirteen additional rafting trips with 102 reported cases of acute gastroenteritis were documented, and several backpackers reported symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. A specific source of virus transmission had not been identified. On May 24, 2022, NPS requested CDC assistance, and an investigation was initiated.

A case of acute gastroenteritis was defined as vomiting or diarrhea (at least three loose stools during a 24-hour period) < 24 hours before trip launch through 3 days after the end of the trip in a person who participated in a river rafting trip or backcountry backpacking in the Grand Canyon during April 1–June 17, 2022. A detailed survey was distributed by email to all backpackers, river rafters on private and commercially operated trips with one or more ill persons, and river rafters on commercial trips with no reported ill persons during the same period. Survey responses were linked to illness report forms of previously reported illnesses to deduplicate. The survey closed on July 8, 2022. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. §

### Quadratic-soliton-enhanced mid-IR molecular sensing [^934e227d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Simulton dynamics responsible for sensing.

a Experimental power spectral densities demonstrate reduced power across the entire simulton spectrum with the addition of sample despite the relatively narrow CO 2 absorption feature. b In the far above threshold conventional regime, like other general multi-mode lasers, power in non-absorbing modes increases with the addition of sample, largely compensating the loss in the absorbing modes. c Schematic depiction of the temporal dynamics of cavity simulton formation which enable the sensing enhancement mechanism. Additional loss in the round trip limits the ability of the simulton to deplete the pump and accelerate, leading to a reduced gain for all modes at steady-state. d Simulated steady-state pulse position as a function of gas concentration (left). Comparison with the theoretical gain window (right) shows the simulton moving further towards the gain window edge as the sample concentration is increased, in accordance with (c).

This collective response of the spectral modes of the simulton to the addition of sample results from the interplay between the energy and timing requirements of simulton formation. This interplay is shown in Fig. 3 c, where the formation of the simulton pulses over multiple round trips in the resonator is schematically depicted for two different values of the absorption. Due to the round-trip delay, Δ T R T, required for stable simulton formation, the newly formed pulse slowly falls out of the gain window, determined by the pump pulse and walk-off length, until it has grown enough to experience a sufficiently strong nonlinear acceleration to compensate the delay. The addition of a small amount of loss in the round trip to the signal will reduce the amount of acceleration and, correspondingly, the amount of gain experienced by all spectral modes of the simulton at steady-state as it interacts with the pump in the nonlinear crystal, leading to a spectrally uniform reduction of power despite the relatively narrow absorption spectrum, as shown in the measured spectrum of Fig. 3 a.

### Telemedicine and the environment: life cycle environmental emissions from in-person and virtual clinic visits [^d3666944]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Data sources and assumptions

Stanford Health Care's Digital Health Care Integration team collected data on the number of in-person, phone, and video visits across SHC, by department, from 2019 through 2021. These data included the number of visits to each department and the duration of each visit in minutes, shown in SI Table 2. Though we did not collect exact data on the mode or distance traveled by patients, we calculated the average distance between the patient's ZIP code and the ZIP code of the clinic visited. Any one-way distance greater than 250 miles (402 km) was assumed to be taken via airplane, while anything less than this value was assumed to be traveled by passenger car. The round-trip distance per patient was used to estimate emissions.

A list of basic supplies typically found in more patient visits was generated by the study team. These include one surgical mask, worn by the care provider for an estimated 10 cases; a serving of hand sanitizer; tissue to cover the exam table; and a sanitizing wipe to clean the exam room after the patient's visit. The material components of each product were directly measured or estimated from literature. We assumed all products were manufactured in China and shipped approximately 3000 km by boat. We estimated a 40 km distance for distribution by freight truck before arrival at the clinic. All products were disposed in a sanitary landfill approximately 40 km from the clinic by truck. Of note, distances may vary by the exact clinic location, thus an average was assumed.

SHC's engineering team provided record of electricity, gas, steam, and chilled water consumption across SHC's clinics in 2020. These values were divided by the total surface area of the clinical space represented in the data and the number of minutes in a year (assumed to be 525,600 though this may artificially reduce the actual energy intensity of a clinical visit, as it assumes lights and equipment are drawing electrical power after hours). We then multiplied this 'energy intensity' by the floor area of an exam room, assumed to be a 10′ × 10′ space (or 9.3 m 2), and the duration of the clinic visit, as captured in the medical records. As some buildings consumed varying quantities of energy, we included these ranges in one of our sensitivity analyses, described below.

### The health risks and benefits of cycling in urban environments compared with car use: health impact assessment study [^6aaf6555]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Not all assumptions and data inputs, however, could be tested in the sensitivity analysis, as some remain difficult to quantify owing to lack of knowledge in the research area or the added complexity for modelling, going beyond the scope of this first pass assessment. For example, the benefits of physical activity may be a function of baseline levels of physical activity and health status, although the shape of dose-response functions for changes in physical activity at different baseline levels is not well established, especially for active travel. It is possible that people who had more sedentary lifestyles could have benefited more from the shift to cycling than those who already participate in sports and exercise activities, but we did not have this information.

If shifts in mode of travel were generated predominately from walking and public transit, the savings in carbon dioxide emissions would also be lower than our estimations. Hence we could potentially be over-estimating benefits of the Bicing initiative on carbon dioxide emissions in our central calculations of value. However, we did not consider the possible positive effects of the Bicing initiative in encouraging cycling not using Bicing thus triggering a larger number of shifts in mode of travel, nor the potential for cycling trips to replace longer trips in vehicles (there may be a leveraging effect of the cycling policy), which would all lead to estimating greater benefits on emissions. Another factor not accounted for in the analysis is the ability of cyclists to choose less trafficked routes, hence reducing their exposures. In Barcelona, however, bicycle lanes tend to be situated in roads with heavy traffic and these present likely travel routes for cyclists. Anyhow, varying the exposure concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in the sensitivity analysis had minor effects on overall mortality.

### Bone densitometry in children and adolescents [^304cf989]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Risks and costs of densitometry — dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) exposure is described as having no known health risk and very low dose, but misinterpretation can lead to harm. Exposure to the very low doses of ionizing radiation with DXA poses no known health risk, and the estimated 5 to 6 μSv from a spine and whole-body DXA scan is far less than the 80 μSv accumulated during a round-trip transatlantic flight. More concerning is the potential risk of misdiagnosis if DXA data are not interpreted by skilled professionals; in one study, errors were present in 88% of scans and 62% involved misdiagnosis of osteoporosis due to inappropriate T-score use, which can result in unnecessary pharmacologic therapy and activity restrictions.

### Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: urban land transport [^107ad20b]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

We used Comparative Risk Assessment methods to estimate the health effects of alternative urban land transport scenarios for two settings-London, UK, and Delhi, India. For each setting, we compared a business-as-usual 2030 projection (without policies for reduction of greenhouse gases) with alternative scenarios-lower-carbon-emission motor vehicles, increased active travel, and a combination of the two. We developed separate models that linked transport scenarios with physical activity, air pollution, and risk of road traffic injury. In both cities, we noted that reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through an increase in active travel and less use of motor vehicles had larger health benefits per million population (7332 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] in London, and 12 516 in Delhi in 1 year) than from the increased use of lower-emission motor vehicles (160 DALYs in London, and 1696 in Delhi). However, combination of active travel and lower-emission motor vehicles would give the largest benefits (7439 DALYs in London, 12 995 in Delhi), notably from a reduction in the number of years of life lost from ischaemic heart disease (10–19% in London, 11–25% in Delhi). Although uncertainties remain, climate change mitigation in transport should benefit public health substantially. Policies to increase the acceptability, appeal, and safety of active urban travel, and discourage travel in private motor vehicles would provide larger health benefits than would policies that focus solely on lower-emission motor vehicles.

### Celestial versus terrestrial travel-an analysis of spaceflight fatalities and comparison to other modes of transportation [^fe185270]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

With the advent of commercial human spaceflight, it is important to analyze the historical safety of humans traveling to, in, and from space. We break down the fatality rates of human spaceflight and compare them to those of several terrestrial transportation modes. We created a database of human space travel, containing the vehicles, launches, and the total time and distance traveled. For the 4 fatal space missions and 18 fatalities, we determined the fatality rates, calculated by several methods, including rates per trip, person, and distance traveled, stratified by the mission segment affected. Two of the 326 launches did not reach space, and 8 others were suborbital. There have been 1285 person-launches to space; the total time in space is estimated to be 55,939 person-days; and the total distance traveled is approximately 23.5 billion person-miles. One fatal trip occurred on the way to orbit and the other 3 during the return. There has yet to be a fatality in orbit, and there have been none on any space flight since 2003. The per-trip and per-person fatality rates are 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, but the per mile rate is much lower, depending on the flight segment.

### Single drop cytometry onboard the international space station [^dd8a285b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Under National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans, humans are to travel to Mars in the 2030s. For humans to explore Mars, the journey is a 1.8-billion-kilometer round-trip journey, requiring a total of 760–850 days. This is greater than the 1000× more distance traveled and close to the 100× more duration than Apollo 11, which was 1.534-million-kilometers round-trip and just over 8 days. The human health risks are significant, including space radiation exposure, bone loss, circadian rhythm changes, spaceflight psychological hazards, cardiac remodeling, vision changes, hematological dysfunction, and neurological changes. Unexpected, acute, life-threatening medical conditions can arise that require emergent diagnostic assessment and medical intervention, such as the case of an obstructive jugular venous thrombosis on the International Space Station (ISS). The risk of inflight medical conditions is among the most concerning for a Mars mission per NASA's Human System Risk Board. For humans to become an interplanetary species, these risks need to be studied and managed. In-flight clinical decision-making can benefit from immediate and abundant diagnostic information, available from drops of blood or other biological specimens that can be easily and frequently obtained. Separately, the analysis of biological samples is a component of spaceflight research, but currently, the samples are downmassed, which can result in sample transportation artifacts. This process takes months and during this time, the samples can be subject to unpredictable storage conditions, resulting in degradation or alteration. This was highlighted in the monozygotic twin study where samples had unavoidable transit time and unknown transit conditions (vibration and temperature). Our current understanding of spaceflight medicine and biology is thus limited by this approach, and while sample downmass, however imperfect, is an option for studies in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), it would be near impossible for long-duration, deep space exploration missions.

### Carbon cost of pragmatic randomised controlled trials: retrospective analysis of sample of trials [^3df2617e]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

All randomised controlled trials that were funded by the Health Technology Assessment programme during 2002 and 2003 were eligible for inclusion in the study. We stipulated that the final report of the project must have been submitted by September 2008 to ensure that the trials were complete before data collection began.

We used information that is routinely held by NETSCC. The main sources of data were the project files and the published monograph, or the final report of the project if it had yet to be published. Project files are used for monitoring purposes and contain documents such as grant application forms, six monthly progress reports, extension requests, and minutes of steering group meetings.

Using the methods of the CRASH audit, the NHS footprinting report, and the greenhouse gas reporting protocol developed by the World Business Council, we compiled a list of elements of trials that we believed would generate CO 2 emissions and a list of the activities within each element that would generate the emissions. We searched the data sources for information on these activities and any other activities not included in the list that we believed had a CO 2 value. The box shows the elements and activities of trials for which we collected data.

We used standard conversion factors to convert the data into CO 2 values. The information contained in the data sources was not always sufficient to allow us to do the calculations. In these instances, we made informed assumptions to supplement the information and allow it to be converted into CO 2. The conversion factors and assumptions used are detailed below.

Transport

National travel — We used a conversion factor of 0.25 to calculate the CO 2 emissions per kilometre travelled. This conversion factor comes from the NHS footprinting report and accounts for the direct and indirect emissions from all modes of transport. We used Google maps UK to calculate all distances. We assumed that staff travelled to meetings from their workplace. In the absence of detailed information about travel, we calculated CO 2 from the amount of money spent on journeys. We used a conversion factor of 0.43 kg of CO 2 per pound spent, which we derived from the NHS footprinting report.

International travel — We calculated the CO 2 value of any flights that were made during the trial by using a CO 2 calculator available at the climate care website. The tool calculates the CO 2 emissions from a return flight between any two cities. We assumed that travellers departed from the nearest airport to their place of work and flew directly to the airport of the city to which they were travelling.

### Unusual forms of immature sporulating coccidioides immitis diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy [^6e803e8b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is an endemic infection acquired by inhalation of the spores (arthroconidia) of the thermally dimorphic fungus, Coccidioides immitis. The arthroconidia transform into spherical cells called mature spherules in the lung. Immature spherules and other atypical forms of immature C immitis have rarely been found in vivo. We report on a case that presented unusual forms of immature sporulating C immitis in a fine-needle aspiration specimen. A 36-year-old Chinese woman, living in New Jersey for the past 10 years, presented with fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, and an abnormal chest radiograph approximately 9 months after a brief vacation trip to the Grand Canyon in Arizona. She was treated with antibiotics for 4 weeks without improvement. Subsequent chest computed tomography showed a 3-cm cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed diverse morphologic forms of a fungus that was confirmed by culture as immature sporulating C immitis.

### Transportation costs impede sustained adherence and access to HAART in a clinic population in southwestern Uganda: a qualitative study [^817c29cf]. AIDS and Behavior (2010). Low credibility.

Difficult Choices

Another major theme that appeared repeatedly across the sample was that transportation costs forced participants into having to make serious sacrifices in other essential arenas. Despite the above-cited examples of non-adherence, patients generally expressed their determination to sustain treatment and reported that saving money for transportation came above all else. One woman noted that she and her husband, who was also infected, "sacrifice as much as we can" to obtain the money for the round-trip fare. "It's only natural that we'd want to be alive and living", she added. "So what we do, before our medicine gets finished, we do everything to make sure that there is money for transport to bring us".

For almost all the respondents, "doing everything" to secure transportation money meant spending less on other needs. Many were deeply aware that their determination to keep their medication appointments meant less money for family essentials. One woman, a 34-year-old living with her parents since separating from her husband three years before, said she spent the money on transportation to get her medication even when she had no food: "It happens sometimes that I regret that I'm spending 500 shillings on a boda–boda when I know that back home there is nothing to eat. But then I do not have a choice".

A 44-year-old woman with four children, whose husband died in 2001, acknowledged that she also felt conflicted when she hired a boda–boda to bring her to clinic. "I feel bad when I have to spend that money on transport when I could have spent it on something else… [but] I must come to pick up my medicine", she said. "I can give up any other thing, but do not think I can give up my medicine. It would take first priority if I had to choose between it and something else". An unmarried 26-year-old, who had been deserted by the father of her two children, said: "Sometimes I have to do without maybe salt, paraffin, kerosene, so that I can get the transport to come here".

### A measurement strategy to address disparities across household energy burdens [^39444f43]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Energy inequity is an issue of increasing urgency. Few policy-relevant datasets evaluate the energy burden of typical American households. Here, we develop a framework using Net Energy Analysis and household socioeconomic data to measure systematic energy inequity among critical groups that need policy attention. We find substantial instances of energy poverty in the United States - 16% of households experience energy poverty as presently defined as spending more than 6% of household income on energy expenditures. More than 5.2 million households above the Federal Poverty Line face energy poverty, disproportionately burdening Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities. For solar, wind, and energy efficiency to address socioeconomic mobility, programs must reduce energy expenditures by expanding eligibility requirements for support and access to improved conservation measures, efficiency upgrades, and distributed renewables. We recommend the United States develop a more inclusive federal energy poverty categorization that increases assistance for household energy costs.
