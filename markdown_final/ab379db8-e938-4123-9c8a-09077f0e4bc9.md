## Question

Circumferential External Hemorrhoids management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of circumferential external hemorrhoids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and clarifying whether most cases are truly external versus combined disease. Then, I should verify initial assessment priorities, including urgency, thrombosis, prolapse grading, and the need for endoscopic evaluation when bleeding is present. Next, I will review conservative measures and their limits in circumferential disease, followed by the role and limitations of office procedures. After that, I will examine definitive surgical options, their indications, techniques, outcomes, and complications, and then decide how to select among them across clinical scenarios. Finally, I will outline technical pearls to prevent stenosis, postoperative care, special/adjunct options like laser hemorrhoidoplasty, and strategies to prevent recurrence with appropriate follow-up, while continuously cross-checking against guideline statements and high-quality trials where available [^113Nr2GA] [^112MKBGH] [^1129qLeH].

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification, because if I mislabel "circumferential external hemorrhoids", I might choose a suboptimal pathway. True isolated circumferential external hemorrhoids are unusual; most extensive circumferential presentations include combined internal-external disease and often correspond to advanced prolapse, typically Goligher grade III–IV, with external skin tags, hygiene issues, and sometimes acute thrombosis, so I should frame management accordingly rather than as a purely external entity [^112MKBGH] [^113AF9vT] [^113Nr2GA].

> Next, I should review the initial assessment and severity stratification. I need to check symptom duration to distinguish acute presentations, especially if < 72–96 hours, from chronic prolapse, verify the presence of thrombosis or necrosis which may mandate urgent intervention, grade the degree of prolapse, assess external component burden including skin tags, and document sphincter tone/incontinence history. Hold on, I should also verify when endoscopic evaluation is necessary; in patients with rectal bleeding, selected individuals warrant complete colon evaluation to exclude alternate sources, so the diagnostic workup is part of safe care and informs timing and setting of intervention [^1129qLeH] [^114osNbK] [^113Nr2GA].

> Now, for acute thrombosis, I was initially going to say "incision and drainage" might help, but wait, let me verify because guidelines differ. The AAFP and ASCRS endorse early excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids in selected patients seen within 2–3 days, with evidence that excision accelerates symptom resolution compared with conservative care, while WSES/AAST specifically advises against simple incision and drainage due to bleeding and high recurrence, and ACG allows either complete excision or incision/evacuation within the first four days, highlighting practice variability that I should reconcile with patient factors and local expertise [^1139mGGp] [^111wfR2E] [^112zbyiz] [^116rKskB] [^116N2x7f] [^116UkJZh] [^112zEGJi].

> For non-thrombosed or subacute presentations, I need to ensure that first-line conservative therapy is optimized, recognizing it is unlikely to definitively resolve true circumferential disease. Fiber and water intake, stool normalization, and behavioral measures like limiting straining are foundational and guideline-endorsed, and pharmacologic symptom relief including flavonoids can be considered given minimal harm, though benefits are modest and relapse is common when stopped, so I should present these as supportive rather than curative in circumferential prolapse [^114scXLx] [^113d8Frc] [^112MKBGH] [^116tNruW].

> I was about to suggest office-based procedures as an intermediary, but hold on, I should verify their role in circumferential disease. Rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation target internal columns and are recommended for grades I–III internal hemorrhoids; they do not treat external skin tags or circumferential external burden and have higher recurrence in advanced disease, with recent randomized data in grade III showing markedly higher recurrence with RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy at 12–24 months, so for circumferential external or combined disease I should avoid relying on office therapy as definitive treatment [^112hNpeN] [^1128nXNW] [^116kpfDa] [^113o43LW].

> Let me now examine definitive surgical options, starting with modified Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy for circumferential prolapse with external components. This excisional approach allows removal of pathologic cushions while preserving mucocutaneous bridges to reduce stenosis risk, with optional partial lateral internal sphincterotomy in hypertonia; large series report low rates of bleeding, stenosis, and gas incontinence, and this aligns with ASCRS guidance to perform hemorrhoidectomy in selected patients with external hemorrhoids or symptomatic combined internal-external grade III–IV disease [^111GjE9f] [^113Nr2GA].

> I need to consider the scenario of massive circumferential thrombosis with edema, ulceration, or gangrene, where piecemeal excision may be inadequate. Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy, a modernized Whitehead-type reconstruction from a submucoanodermal plane with zigzag flap, provides a "view from inside" to precisely excise diseased venous plexus while preserving overlain tissues; prospective experience suggests operative efficiency and completeness, and this approach is consistent with urgent excision in acute hemorrhoid crisis with necrosis or evolving sepsis after initial stabilization measures [^113oRDsL] [^116THuDu].

> But wait, what if the dominant issue is circumferential mucosal prolapse with minimal external tags? In that focused scenario, circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy can reduce postoperative pain and hasten recovery, yet it carries higher long-term symptomatic prolapse and functional issues than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and, critically, it does not address external skin tags, so patient selection must be meticulous and counseling explicit about recurrence and unique risks such as urgency or stenosis with staple line fibrosis [^115XGDJo] [^112RBNsL] [^1128nXNW].

> Let me synthesize procedure selection without overgeneralizing. For circumferential prolapse with prominent external components and skin tags, a modified Ferguson-style circumferential excisional strategy is favored to address the entire circumference while preserving bridges to prevent stenosis; for extensive acute circumferential thrombosis with tissue compromise, a circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy in the submucoanodermal plane is appropriate; and for primarily mucosal circumferential prolapse with limited external disease, stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be considered with full disclosure of recurrence and functional trade-offs and a plan to manage residual external tags if symptomatic [^111GjE9f] [^113oRDsL] [^115XGDJo] [^113Nr2GA].

> I should double-check technical considerations that reduce complications. Preventing anal stenosis requires maintaining adequate mucocutaneous bridges in Ferguson-type excision or employing an irregular or zigzag flap in circumferential reconstruction, and assessing sphincter tone preoperatively is essential because selected patients with hypertonia may benefit from partial lateral internal sphincterotomy; in combined approaches for internal-dominant disease, Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation may reduce pain but can increase recurrence relative to excision, so its use should be adjunctive and individualized rather than routine in circumferential external disease [^111GjE9f] [^113oRDsL] [^11283odS].

> Next, I should review postoperative management to minimize pain, constipation, and wound issues. Multimodal analgesia with careful opioid-sparing strategy, aggressive stool softening with fiber to prevent suture line trauma, sitz baths, and pragmatic wound care are cornerstones; routine prolonged antibiotics and extensive dressings are not recommended, and limited absorbable packing can be used selectively, which aligns with broader perioperative principles and specific proctologic postoperative guidance, though topical anti-inflammatory suppositories are not advised as routine [^114oBmgs] [^114FwjAs] [^114zqTLS] [^116r287c] [^117BsQG5].

> I will now examine special and adjunct options, but I need to be cautious about scope creep. Laser hemorrhoidoplasty is recommended as a single intervention mainly for grade 2–3 internal disease and can be considered after recurrence; it is not a first-line solution for true circumferential external disease, and management of external hemorrhoids or skin tags alongside laser should be individualized to patient expectations rather than assumed standard of care, which reinforces that LHP is an adjunct in this context rather than a replacement for excisional surgery when tags and circumferential external components predominate [^113Tum91] [^113E7bgq] [^114XhBsK] [^111ouZ4b].

> Let me reconsider recurrence prevention and follow-up because this often determines long-term satisfaction. Constipation and straining are common and modifiable, with nearly half of surgical candidates in contemporary RCTs meeting Rome IV criteria, so durable fiber and bowel habit optimization, weight management, and pelvic floor therapy when indicated are essential; schedule structured follow-up to detect stenosis, incontinence, or recurrent tags, and educate patients that excisional hemorrhoidectomy offers lower recurrence than office-based ligation in higher grades, which should guide expectation-setting and shared decision-making [^117QFtBC] [^112MKBGH] [^111NZyk2] [^113o43LW].

> In summary, I need to ensure we match the intervention to the morphology and acuity. Definitive management of circumferential external or combined circumferential disease is surgical, with modified Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy preferred for circumferential prolapse with external tags, circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy indicated for extensive acute thrombosis or necrosis, and circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy reserved for select patients with predominantly mucosal prolapse and minimal external disease after careful counseling; conservative measures and office procedures remain supportive or temporizing but are insufficient for definitive control in true circumferential external presentations, and postoperative bowel management is critical to outcomes and patient comfort [^113Nr2GA] [^1128bFBY] [^111GjE9f] [^113oRDsL] [^115XGDJo].

Circumferential external hemorrhoids are best managed with a **stepwise approach** [^112MKBGH], starting with conservative measures, including fiber, fluids, sitz baths, and topical agents [^114scXLx] and escalating to surgery if symptoms persist or complications arise. For acute thrombosis, **early excision** within 72 hours [^1139mGGp] is preferred for rapid relief [^111wfR2E] and lower recurrence [^112zbyiz], whereas after 72 hours, conservative care is reasonable. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the **gold standard** [^113Nr2GA] for extensive disease, with stapled [^115XGDJo] or laser options [^111ouZ4b] for select cases. Office procedures are **not recommended** for circumferential external disease [^113Nr2GA] [^116kpfDa]. Postoperative care focuses on pain control, stool softeners [^114oBmgs], and infection prevention, with **close follow-up** to monitor for recurrence or complications [^111NZyk2].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **initial approach** [^114scXLx] for circumferential external hemorrhoids, particularly in patients without acute thrombosis or severe symptoms. The following measures are **recommended**:

- **Dietary and behavioral modifications**: Increased dietary fiber intake, adequate hydration, and avoidance of straining during defecation are primary first-line therapies [^114scXLx].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Topical agents, such as corticosteroids and local anesthetics, may provide symptomatic relief [^113d8Frc]. However, their use should be limited due to potential side effects with prolonged use.

- **Sitz baths**: Warm water sitz baths can help reduce pain and inflammation [^111DKR4P].

Conservative management is **generally effective** for mild to moderate symptoms but **may be insufficient** for severe or thrombosed circumferential external hemorrhoids [^112MKBGH].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical intervention is **indicated** [^113Nr2GA] for circumferential external hemorrhoids **when conservative measures fail** or when complications such as thrombosis, severe pain, or significant prolapse occur. The following surgical options are **available** [^116NshuA]:

---

### Excisional hemorrhoidectomy

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is considered the **gold standard** [^113Nr2GA] for circumferential external hemorrhoids, particularly in cases of extensive disease or acute thrombosis. This procedure involves the complete excision of hemorrhoidal tissue, providing **definitive treatment** with low recurrence rates [^112MKBGH]. **Indications** include symptomatic circumferential external hemorrhoids, acute thrombosis, and recurrent or highly symptomatic hemorrhoids [^113Nr2GA]. **Outcomes** include effective symptom relief and low recurrence rates, but are accompanied by significant postoperative pain and a longer recovery time [^1128nXNW].

---

### Stapled hemorrhoidopexy

Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is **primarily indicated** for internal hemorrhoids [^1128nXNW] but may be considered in **selected cases** of circumferential external hemorrhoids with significant internal components. This procedure involves the circumferential excision of prolapsed mucosa and submucosa, repositioning hemorrhoidal tissue above the dentate line. **Indications** are limited to such cases. **Outcomes** include less postoperative pain and faster recovery compared with excisional hemorrhoidectomy [^1128nXNW], but at the cost of higher recurrence rates and potential complications such as rectal stenosis and persistent pain [^115XGDJo].

---

### Laser hemorrhoidoplasty

Laser hemorrhoidoplasty is a **minimally invasive** technique [^113Tum91] that uses laser energy to shrink hemorrhoidal tissue. It is primarily indicated for internal hemorrhoids but may be considered in **selected cases** of circumferential external hemorrhoids. **Indications** are based on surgeon expertise and patient expectations [^111ouZ4b]. **Outcomes** include reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery, but long-term data are limited and there is potential for recurrence [^111ouZ4b].

---

## Management of acute thrombosis

Acute thrombosis is a **common complication** of circumferential external hemorrhoids, characterized by severe pain and swelling. Early surgical excision within **72 hours** of symptom onset [^1139mGGp] provides rapid symptom relief [^111wfR2E] and lowers recurrence rates [^112zbyiz]. Conservative management is appropriate for patients presenting **after 72 hours** [^116N2x7f] and includes analgesics, topical agents, and sitz baths.

---

## Postoperative care and follow-up

Postoperative care is **essential** to ensure optimal recovery and prevent complications:

- **Pain management**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and topical anesthetics [^111DKR4P].

- **Stool softeners**: To prevent constipation and reduce strain during defecation [^114oBmgs].

- **Wound care**: Regular cleaning, sitz baths, and monitoring for infection [^113Nr2GA].

- **Follow-up**: Regular follow-up visits to monitor healing, manage complications, and provide patient education.

---

## Complications and recurrence

Potential **complications** include:

- **Pain**: Common after excisional hemorrhoidectomy [^1128nXNW].

- **Bleeding**: May occur postoperatively [^115XGDJo].

- **Infection**: Rare but possible [^114oBmgs].

- **Recurrence**: Lower with excisional hemorrhoidectomy, higher with stapled hemorrhoidopexy and laser hemorrhoidoplasty.

---

Circumferential external hemorrhoids are managed with a **stepwise approach**, beginning with conservative measures and escalating to surgical intervention as needed [^114scXLx]. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the **gold standard**, while stapled hemorrhoidopexy and laser hemorrhoidoplasty are alternatives for selected cases [^112MKBGH].

Few data exist on the actual recurrence rates of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. We aimed to determine the incidence of recurrence, intervals to recurrence, and factors predicting recurrence of thrombosed external hemorrhoids after conservative or surgical management.

Two hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids treated from 1990 to 2002 were identified. Recurrence was defined as the complete resolution of the index lesion with the subsequent return of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid and did not include patients with chronic symptoms. Data were gathered retrospectively, and multiple potential risk factors were reviewed.

The index thrombosed external hemorrhoid was managed conservatively in 51.5 percent of cases and surgically in 48.5 percent. There were no differences between groups in gender, age, or race, and 44.5 percent of all patients had a prior history of thrombosed external hemorrhoid. A prior history was less common in the conservative group than in the surgical group (38.1 percent vs. 51.3 percent; P < 0.05). The frequency of pain or bleeding as the primary complaint was higher in the surgical group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.002, respectively). In addition, the surgical group was more likely to report all three symptoms of pain, bleeding, and a lump (P < 0.005).

Mean follow-up was 7.6 months, with the range extending to 7 years. Time to symptom resolution averaged 24 days in the conservative group vs. 3.9 days in the surgical group (P < 0.0001). The overall incidence of recurrence was 15.6 percent.

### Rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids: Is the procedure effective for the immunocompromised, hemophiliacs and pregnant women [^116hafLX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease, one of the most common conditions of the perianal region, is defined as the symptomatic enlargement and/or distal displacement of the normal functional structures called anal cushions, at which point they begin to prolapse, bleed, or become strangulated. It is characterized by remarkably dilated, thin-walled vessels within the submucosal arteriovenous plexus, with absent or nearly-flat sphincter-like constriction of the vessels.

- **Classification**: In 1980, Goligher classified internal hemorrhoids according to the severity of examination findings: grade I – bleeding only, without prolapse; grade II – prolapse that reduces spontaneously with or without bleeding; grade III – prolapse requiring manual reduction, with or without bleeding; and grade IV – irreducible prolapse of hemorrhoidal tissue.

- **Treatment options**: Treatment choices include conservative, non-surgical, and surgical options. Conservative management consists of diet and lifestyle modifications such as a high-fiber diet, increased water intake, avoidance of prolonged straining, and medical options with oral flavonoids and topical ointments. Office-based options include rubber band ligation (RBL), cryosurgery, and infrared coagulation, among others. Surgical treatment is reserved mainly for patients in whom the conservative therapeutic approach has failed or for patients with advanced disease (grade IV).

RBL is considered the most effective, painless, office-based option for grade I-III hemorrhoids, easily performed on an outpatient basis. It consists of positioning elastic bands above the dentate line to restrict blood flow to the affected area, leading to the necrosis and eventual detachment of the hemorrhoidal tissue.

### A modified Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy for circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoids with skin tags [^111GjE9f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a modification of the Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy for circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoids. This paper details the operative procedure and compares the results with other radical methods for patients with circumferential hemorrhoidal disease.

- **Methods**: A total of 738 patients (mean age, 43 years; range, 19–83 years) were treated with our modified Ferguson method under sedative analgesia between 1989 and 2004. Of these patients, 576 had Grade III hemorrhoids, and 162 had Grade IV hemorrhoids. Additionally, 131 patients underwent a partial lateral internal sphincterotomy to correct anal hypertonia.

- **Results**: Postoperative bleeding occurred in 16 patients, with 3 requiring surgical hemostasis. Fecal impaction occurred in 11 patients, and wound complications were noted in 6 patients. Thirty-two patients needed bladder catheterization due to acute urinary retention. The median follow-up was 13.2 months in our outpatient department. One patient developed mild gas incontinence, five developed anal stenosis, and three experienced an anal fissure. Only three patients had reskin tags, which did not affect their quality of life.

- **Conclusions**: Our modified Ferguson method represents a viable choice for the radical treatment of circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoids. It is easy to perform, has few complications, and provides satisfactory results.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^116wBVUc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

The optimal management strategy for grade III hemorrhoids remains a subject of ongoing debate. Hemorrhoidectomy is the criterion standard, but rubber band ligation offers a less invasive outpatient alternative. Treatment variability persists due to a lack of consensus on the preferred strategy.

- **Objective**: To directly compare the effectiveness of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids.

- **Design**: Open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled noninferiority trial.

- **Settings**: Multicenter study across 10 Dutch hospitals from October 2019 to September 2022.

- **Patients**: Patients (aged 18 years or older) with symptomatic grade III (Goligher) hemorrhoids were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included prior rectal/anal surgery, more than one rubber band ligation/injection within the preceding three years, rectal radiation, preexisting sphincter injury, IBD, medical unfitness for surgery (ASA higher than 3), pregnancy, or hypercoagulability disorders.

- **Interventions**: Randomized 1:1 to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy, with up to two banding sessions allowed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Primary outcomes included 12-month health-related quality of life and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes included complications, pain, work resumption, and patient-reported outcome measures.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned (47 rubber band ligation vs. 40 hemorrhoidectomy). Rubber band ligation was not noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in quality-adjusted life years (–0.045; 95% CI, –0.087 to –0.004). Recurrence rates also reflected this finding.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^112nkkP9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoids are normal structures of the human body. Internal hemorrhoids arise from the internal hemorrhoidal plexus, while external hemorrhoids arise from the external plexus. The anatomical boundary that divides the internal from the external hemorrhoidal plexus is the dentate line.

The normal internal hemorrhoidal plexus consists of three soft engorgements, referred to as anal cushions or "hemorrhoids". Consequently, the term "internal hemorrhoids" does not signify a state of disease if viewed in its strict literal definition. However, in clinical practice, the term "internal hemorrhoids" is used to describe solely the disease resulting from the abnormal enlargement of anal cushions, i.e. their transformation to anal nodules. More precisely, this definition is limited to symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease: anal cushions are named "hemorrhoids" when they bleed and/or prolapse.

The internal hemorrhoidal plexus is placed submucosally above the dentate line and below the anorectal ring. It extends from the upper border of the anatomical anal canal to the upper border of the surgical anal canal. Therefore, it is located outside the anatomical anal canal. It is covered by transitional columnar epithelium and originates embryologically from the cloacal part of the anal canal, which contains both ectodermal and endodermal elements. This epithelium is approximately 1 cm long and, as anatomically authentic rectal epithelium, it secretes mucus and is not innervated by visceral pain fibers.

### Novel endoscopic delivery modality of infrared coagulation therapy for internal hemorrhoids [^1124a8fG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Symptomatic internal hemorrhoid engorgement is a common human condition. Symptoms may include bleeding, itching, burning, tissue prolapse, and fecal seepage. Internal hemorrhoids that are unresponsive to dietary modification and topical and suppository agents may be treated with rubber band ligation, coagulation therapy (infrared beam, electric current, CO₂ laser, ultrasonic energy, cryotherapy), or sclerosing agents. These treatment options require the use of an anal retractor, adequate lighting, and specialized instruments. These requirements often restrict the utilization of these treatment options at the time of screening colonoscopy for rectal bleeding, which delays treatment of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, this represents an inefficient use of time and resources for the patient, physician, and potentially the healthcare system.

The endoscopic infrared coagulator is a novel and attractive alternative to standard infrared coagulation because it can be performed at the same time as the lower endoscopy through the accessory channel of the endoscope. Endoscopic delivery of infrared coagulation offers improved lighting and visualization compared with anoscopic-guided therapy for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. After a single session of endoscopic infrared coagulation, patients in this study experienced a statistically significant improvement in their symptoms related to internal hemorrhoids.

The authors readily acknowledge that there are several limitations to this preliminary study. This study utilizes the patients as their own internal controls.

### Multicenter analysis of the efficacy and factors related to recurrence of endoscopic sclerotherapy for internal hemorrhoids: A large-sample, retrospective cohort study [^114KcxK9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Internal hemorrhoids are common, and while endoscopic sclerotherapy is emerging as a treatment, large-scale, multi-center data on its efficacy, safety, and recurrence rates are lacking. We summarized three-center large-sample endoscopic hemorrhoid sclerotherapy data, assessing efficacy, complications, and recurrence, and analyzing recurrence factors such as severity and lifestyle.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis of patients with internal hemorrhoids treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy at three centers from December 2018 to December 2022 was conducted. Clinical and follow-up data were collected to assess hemorrhoid grading, treatment efficacy, complications, and recurrence rates. The recurrence rate, recurrence time, and related factors for different hemorrhoid grades were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 1,147 patients underwent the procedure: 637 at Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University, 177 at No. 964 Hospital, and 333 at Third Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University. The overall effective rate was 92.85% (1,065/1,147). Postoperative safety measures showed the effective group had significantly lower pain (1 (0,1) vs. 2 (2,3)), bleeding (0 (0,1) vs. 2 (1,3)), and urination scores (0 (0,0) vs. 0 (0,1)) compared to the ineffective group. The overall recurrence rate was 12.21% (130/1,065), with follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 49 months (mean: 25.61 ± 13.23 months). Recurrence time was earlier with increasing hemorrhoid grade (p < 0.05). Temporal analysis revealed that for Grades I, II, and III, recurrence rates within one year were 28%, 39.78%, and 75%, respectively.

### Benign anorectal disease: Hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^116THuDu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment is indicated for grade III or IV internal hemorrhoids and for thrombosed external hemorrhoids with persistent symptoms. Excision is recommended within the first 48 hours of symptoms for thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Incision and drainage are ineffective, and complete excision of the hemorrhoid with the associated external skin is advised. This procedure can take place in the clinic or in an emergency care setting with local anesthesia. A retrospective review of 231 patients comparing excision to non-operative treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids showed that symptoms resolved on average in 3.9 days with excision compared to 24 days in the non-operative group. Moreover, recurrence was less likely with excision.

An acute hemorrhoid crisis is rare and presents as beefy red, ulcerated, or necrotic hemorrhoids on examination. This occurs when internal hemorrhoids prolapse and become incarcerated due to sphincter spasm, which warrants hospital admission. It is common for thrombosed external hemorrhoids to occur. Most patients with an acute hemorrhoid crisis benefit from hospitalization and conservative management, including bowel rest, pain control, and sitz baths. Necrotic hemorrhoids and/or perineal sepsis are indications for urgent exploration and excision.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: Analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^114BEnh1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

In the design of this trial, we initially hypothesized that "up to 2 RBL treatments are noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in terms of quality of life and recurrence risk, whereas being more cost-effective". Our findings challenge this assumption, showing that while RBL offers lower upfront costs, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced recurrence and improved quality of life. For patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy may be more cost-effective than RBL, and therefore, caution is needed before discarding it as a routine first-line treatment solely based on rising health care costs or limited operating room availability.

### Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy for extensive acute thrombosis: a 14-year experience [^113oRDsL]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Recurrence and/or complications after 3-quadrant hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy remain a challenging problem, especially for massive hemorrhoidal thrombosis leading to edema, ulceration, and/or gangrene. To address this, we developed a further modification of the Whitehead procedure, termed circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy. This procedure allows access to a submucoanodermal/skin workspace, providing a "view from inside" the hemorrhoidal disease, and facilitating the precise excision of even each hemorrhoidal vein while preserving the overlying normal tissues.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to describe the circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy procedure and to demonstrate its results in patients with total hemorrhoidal thrombosis.

- **Design, settings, patients**: This prospective, descriptive study was conducted with 294 consecutive patients who underwent urgent circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy at our coloproctological center from January 1996 to June 2009.

- **Intervention**: Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy involves the stripping and excision of hemorrhoids from the submucoanodermal space, with reconstruction of the anal canal by using an undermined, irregular/zigzag-shaped mucoanodermal flap and accurately trimmed skin.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were the surgical outcomes and complications.

- **Results**: The mean patient age was 41.7 years for both sexes, comprising 215 men and 79 women. The mean operative time was 26.4 minutes (range, 17–43 minutes).

### Hemorrhoidectomy for thrombosed external hemorrhoids [^114oBmgs]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

External hemorrhoids represent distended vascular tissue in the anal canal distal to the dentate line. Persons with thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually present with pain on standing, sitting, or defecating. Acutely tender, thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be surgically removed if encountered within the first 72 hours after onset. Hemorrhoidectomy is performed through an elliptic incision over the site of thrombosis, with removal of the entire diseased hemorrhoidal plexus in one piece. Caution must be exercised to avoid cutting into the muscle sphincter below the hemorrhoidal vessels. Infection after suture closure is rare due to the rich vascular network in the anal area. Stool softeners must be prescribed postoperatively to help prevent tearing at the suture line. Training and experience in general and skin surgery are necessary before the physician attempts this procedure unsupervised.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^113AF9vT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). High credibility.

Goligher's classification of internal hemorrhoids is a clinical tool designed for the grading and management of internal hemorrhoids. This classification system is based on the physical findings of hemorrhoidal vessels and their behavior during a Valsalva maneuver — a forced exhalation against a closed airway often used in clinical settings to evaluate the condition of the heart and lungs.

- **Primary components**: The classification system includes the prominence of hemorrhoidal vessels and the presence and degree of prolapse. Hemorrhoids are classified into four grades.
	- **Grade I**: Characterized by prominent hemorrhoidal vessels without prolapse.
	- **Grade II**: Hemorrhoids prolapse with a Valsalva maneuver but reduce spontaneously.
	- **Grade III**: Hemorrhoids also prolapse with a Valsalva maneuver but require manual reduction.
	- **Grade IV**: Hemorrhoids are chronically prolapsed and cannot be manually reduced.

The clinical utility of Goligher's classification lies in its ability to guide treatment decisions. The grade of hemorrhoids can influence the choice of therapeutic interventions, ranging from conservative management for lower grades to surgical interventions for higher grades. This classification system also provides a standardized language for clinicians to communicate about the severity and management of internal hemorrhoids.

### Hemorrhoids: Diagnosis and treatment options [^114MqQ26]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Many Americans between 45 and 65 years of age experience hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal size, thrombosis, and location (i.e. proximal or distal to the dentate line) determine the extent of pain or discomfort. The history and physical examination must assess risk factors and clinical signs indicating more concerning disease processes. Internal hemorrhoids are traditionally graded from I to IV based on the extent of prolapse. Other factors such as the degree of discomfort, bleeding, comorbidities, and patient preference should help determine the order in which treatments are pursued.

- **Medical management**: Includes stool softeners, topical over-the-counter preparations, and topical nitroglycerine.
- **Dietary modifications**: Increased fiber and water intake.
- **Behavioral therapies**: Sitz baths. These are the mainstays of initial therapy.

If these are unsuccessful, office-based treatment of grades I to III internal hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation is the preferred next step because it has a lower failure rate than infrared photocoagulation. Open or closed (conventional) excisional hemorrhoidectomy leads to greater surgical success rates but also incurs more pain and a prolonged recovery than office-based procedures; therefore, hemorrhoidectomy should be reserved for recurrent or higher-grade disease. Closed hemorrhoidectomy with diathermic or ultrasonic cutting devices may decrease bleeding and pain. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy elevates grade III or IV hemorrhoids to their normal anatomic position by removing a band of proximal mucosal tissue; however, this procedure has several potential complications.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^115xWbsd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition characterized by symptoms such as bleeding, pain, itching, soiling, and prolapse, which can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). In the Netherlands, its prevalence is 13.4 per 1000 patients. The Goligher classification system categorizes hemorrhoids by the degree of hemorrhoidal prolapse and guides treatment strategies.

Grade III hemorrhoids represent a particularly complex management scenario due to inconclusive guidelines regarding the optimal treatment strategy. Although hemorrhoidectomy is traditionally considered the criterion standard, rubber band ligation (RBL) offers a simpler, less invasive outpatient alternative with fewer complications and lower patient burden. However, RBL has a recurrence rate of up to 50%, potentially requiring repeat procedures. Although hemorrhoidectomy generally has lower recurrence rates, it is associated with more postoperative discomfort and a longer recovery period.

A consensus on the best treatment strategy for grade III hemorrhoids is lacking, leading to variability in clinical practice. In 2016, two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared stapled hemorrhoidopexy with hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidal artery ligation with RBL. However, a direct comparison of RBL with hemorrhoidectomy is still missing. The present study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy in grade III hemorrhoids, focusing on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and recurrence rates, and incorporating patient-reported outcomes.

### Benign anorectal disease: Hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^114JGtXN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The prevalence of self-reported hemorrhoids in the US is 4–8%; about one-third of these cases present for treatment. Epidemiological data from the UK demonstrate a hemorrhoid prevalence of 13–36% within the general population, which is probably an overestimate. Based on screening colonoscopy data, about 38% of the population has hemorrhoids, and only 44% of those with hemorrhoids on colonoscopy report symptoms. Middle age (45–65 years old) and obesity are the primary risk factors.

Hemorrhoidal columns are normal anatomical clusters of vascular and connective tissue, smooth muscle, and overlying epithelium located in the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior anal canal, serving in providing continence. They become pathological when engorged and subsequently symptomatic. Internal hemorrhoids are proximal to the dentate line, covered in columnar epithelium, and have visceral innervation. Internal hemorrhoids are clinically classified based on symptoms:

- **Grade 1**: Hemorrhoids do not prolapse.
- **Grade 2**: Prolapse with straining.
- **Grade 3**: Require manual reduction to reduce prolapse.
- **Grade 4**: Irreducible.

External hemorrhoids are perianal subcutaneous venous plexuses distal to the dentate line, somatically innervated, and covered by squamous epithelium. External hemorrhoids may become pathological when these venous plexuses spontaneously rupture, resulting in a painful subcutaneous hematoma or "thrombosed external hemorrhoid".

The etiology of hemorrhoids was originally thought to be caused by portal hypertension; however, the most popular modern theory is still under exploration.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^1144fP6M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected, and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment.

Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic. Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus. It encourages clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decision.

### Conservative and surgical treatment of haemorrhoids [^114M5hbA]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The management of haemorrhoids has evolved rapidly over the past few decades. Several new treatments have been proposed to reduce patients' postoperative pain, time to return to normal life, and the risk of early and late complications, as well as the recurrence rate. Although conservative treatment based on dietary and lifestyle changes can help the majority of patients, and rubber band ligation and phlebotonic drugs can effectively treat grade I and II haemorrhoids, surgery is required for the most advanced stages. Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy is considered the gold-standard approach for grade IV haemorrhoids.

An increasing number of minimally invasive treatment options, including mucopexy with or without mucosal resection and haemorrhoid artery ligation, have been proposed for the management of grade III haemorrhoids. These approaches aim to correct the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the etiology of haemorrhoids. While there is an increased risk of recurrence associated with these minimally invasive and less painful treatments, the sparing of the sensitive anoderm and a rapid return to normal life without pain are greatly appreciated by patients.

An algorithm for the management of haemorrhoids using evidence-based medicine is also presented here.

In this study, 738 patients were screened between August 2011 and November 2013, and 438 patients were excluded because of nonconsent, alternative surgeries, hemorrhoidal management procedures, or other reasons [figure not included]. The average follow-up time in this study was 63.5 months (range, 48–75 months) in the PSH group and 60 months (range, 48–75 months) in the CSH group. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1, showing that the two groups were well matched in age, sex, duration of disease (rounded to the half-year), degree of severity of the hemorrhoids, and preoperative Jorge-Wexner incontinence score.

- **Early postoperative outcomes in patients receiving PSH and CSH**: The median operative time was comparable between the groups: 20 minutes (range, 8–60 minutes) in the PSH group versus 20 minutes (range, 5–60 minutes) in the CSH group (p = 0.705). Of the total patients in each study arm, the incidence of intraoperative bleeding from the staple line requiring hemostatic sutures was significantly lower in the PSH group (12% (18/150)) compared with the CSH group (75% (112/150); p = 0.001). There was a slight but significant difference in estimated blood loss between the two groups (PSH group, 10 mL (range, 5–25 mL) vs. 20 mL (range, 5–100 mL); p = 0.001). The length of the resected rectal tissues was 4.00 cm (range, 3.00–5.50 cm) in the PSH group and 3.25 cm (details truncated).

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^112zEGJi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Focusing on thrombosed hemorrhoids, the studies comparing non-operative management (NOM) and surgery led to contrasting results. A prospective study from Allan et al. compared the outcome of urgent hemorrhoidectomy with conservative treatment for prolapsed thrombosed internal hemorrhoids and found that conservative treatment was associated with shorter patient stay and less anal sphincter damage compared with operative treatment. On the other hand, other studies suggest that surgery may be superior to conservative management, but the correct duration of NOM and the timing for surgery are not known, as confirmed by the literature research performed by Chan et al. Patients treated conservatively will eventually have a resolution of symptoms, but the recurrence rate is high and there is some evidence that surgical excision may result in more rapid symptom resolution, lower incidence of recurrence, and longer remission intervals. Simple incision of thrombosed hemorrhoids with clot removal used to be a popular procedure but has been abandoned by most specialists because of persistent bleeding and the significantly higher recurrence rates seen. A randomized prospective study by Cavcić et al. divided 150 patients with acutely thrombosed hemorrhoids into three different arms: topical application of 0.2% nitroglycerin, incision and evacuation of thrombus, and excision of the hemorrhoid; the analysis of pain scores on day 4 after treatment showed that thrombus evacuation provided the worst results. Another study from Greenspoon et al. retrospectively reviewed 231 patients who underwent the procedure.

### Long-term outcome of rubber band ligation for symptomatic primary and recurrent internal hemorrhoids [^11134Jwd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Rubber band ligation therapy for symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease has been used for many years and is a well-accepted treatment modality, but information on long-term outcomes is limited. Our goals were to determine the safety and long-term efficacy of this treatment.

A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing rubber band ligatures for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids in a single practice was conducted. Information on presenting symptoms, the number of bands applied, response to therapy, complications encountered, length of follow-up, interval to resolution of symptoms when applicable, and subsequent therapy were documented. Supplemental information was obtained from telephone follow-up. Outcome was categorized as success or failure. Success was defined as permanent relief of symptoms for the follow-up period or marked improvement in symptomatology with rare manifestation of bleeding (equal to or more than 100 days). Failure was defined as modest improvement (decreased but not complete relief of symptoms) or no improvement in symptoms.

A total of 805 patients underwent 2,114 rubber band ligatures. The most common presenting symptoms were bleeding in 731 patients (90.8 percent) and prolapsing in 382 patients (47.5 percent). The median number of bands placed was two (range, 1–17). The median time between bandings was 4.7 weeks (range, 1.1–35.6 weeks). Median follow-up time was 1,204 days (range, 14–9,571 days). Excluding 104 patients lost to follow-up (those who never returned after initial treatment), success was obtained in 70 percent of the cases.

### Common design and data elements on rectal artery embolization for treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoidal disease: An interactive systematic review of clinical trials [^114nH7kk]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

Internal hemorrhoids (IH) are a common medical condition that can result in morbidity secondary to bleeding and discomfort. Treatment for IH has traditionally consisted of dietary and conservative medical management, focal treatments including banding and sclerotherapy, or hemorrhoidectomy. Recently, rectal artery embolization (RAE) has been studied as a potential treatment for bleeding predominant IH. We performed a common design and data element analysis of studies that report on RAE.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a qualitative systematic literature review for rectal artery embolization (RAE) for symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease. The screening process involved five online databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, DOAJ, and Scopus). Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was examined for active, unpublished completed studies. The initial search yielded 2000 studies, with 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria after screening and assessment. The included studies comprised one RCT, one case series, one pilot study, and 12 cohort studies.

- **Results**: The population analysis revealed a male predominance across all studies, with varying cohort sizes. The baseline Goligher hemorrhoid grade was utilized in 80% of studies. The majority (73.3%) employed a transfemoral approach, and coils were the primary embolic material in 60% of studies; 26.6% used a combination of coils and particles, and 6.6% used particles only. Patient selection criteria highlighted RAE's applicability for high surgical risk patients and those with anemia, chronic hematochezia, or treatment-refractory IH.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^111m2SrT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

One major goal of the conservative treatment of hemorrhoids is to normalize stool consistency; both diarrhea and constipation are clinically significant causes and triggering factors of symptoms in hemorrhoidal disease. Their management is as invaluable as the treatment of hemorrhoids itself. The remaining elements of conservative therapy, such as avoiding straining during defecation, have been proven to limit the prolapse of hemorrhoids.

Increased anal pressure is very important in the pathophysiology of hemorrhoids and is a frequent clinical sign, often manifested as anal spasm during rectal examination. This increased anal pressure provides the rationale for using topical nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment in the treatment of pain due to internal hemorrhoids. Intra-anal pressure typically returns to normal after hemorrhoidectomy.

- **Mode of action of flavonoids**: The primary action of flavonoids, especially the micronized variants that are easily absorbed, is by increasing the impaired vascular tone. They are also believed to relieve congestion inside sinusoids by reducing venous capacity and decreasing capillary permeability, thereby facilitating lymphatic drainage and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of flavonoid treatment in both chronic and acute hemorrhoidal disease. In chronic disease, conservative therapy with a micronized purified flavonoid fraction has been found beneficial in alleviating hemorrhoidal symptoms and preventing disease relapse in the majority of patients.

Before randomization, all patients received conservative treatments, including dietary counseling, stool hygiene, toilet habits, fiber supplementation, and local therapies such as vasoconstrictors, prescribed at the surgeon's discretion per the pragmatic study design.

- **Rubber band ligation**: The details of the RBL procedure are outlined in the study protocol. In brief, up to two RBL sessions were permitted if symptoms persisted after the initial procedure, allowing flexibility in addressing ongoing symptoms, consistent with standard clinical practice. Given that RBL treatment often entails repeated sessions for grade III hemorrhoids, this study hypothesized that repeated RBL (up to two sessions) would be noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy regarding HR-QoL and recurrence rates while being more cost-effective.

- **Hemorrhoidectomy**: Hemorrhoidectomy was performed using either the open technique or the closed technique, both of which are aimed at excising hemorrhoidal cushions using electrocautery. A more detailed description of both techniques can be found in the published study protocol.

- **Data collection**: Clinical data were collected at baseline, intervention, and 6-week follow-up, with some assessments conducted by phone due to COVID-19. Data included demographics, medical history, Rome IV criteria for chronic constipation, pelvic floor physiotherapy, symptom duration, and previous treatments. Procedural data covered intervention details and complications. The postoperative period covered the first 90 days after treatment, recording complications such as bleeding requiring intervention.

This considerable pain has led to the development of various nonsurgical treatment options intended for patients with symptoms primarily related to internal hemorrhoid disease. These nonsurgical methods include rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation, bipolar diathermy, direct electrotherapy, sclerotherapy, and cryotherapy. All these treatments result in fibrosis, scarring, shrinkage, and fixation of the internal hemorrhoid cushions, thereby minimizing symptoms of internal hemorrhoid disease.

Patients with hemorrhoid disease are often advised to undergo a colonoscopy before beginning treatment to rule out potential neoplastic sources within the colon and rectum as the cause of their symptoms. Currently, nonsurgical treatment options for internal hemorrhoid disease cannot be performed without the use of an anal retractor (anoscope), a dedicated lighting source, and specialized instruments. Moreover, these nonsurgical treatments are frequently conducted at different times and locations from the colonoscopy, leading to inefficiency in terms of time and cost for the endoscopist, the endoscopy facility, and the patient.

### Common design and data elements on rectal artery embolization for treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoidal disease: An interactive systematic review of clinical trials [^115kqZyH]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). High credibility.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) have established evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease, which were updated in 2024 and 2020, respectively. These guidelines outline a systematic approach to the diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease, as well as a treatment approach based on hemorrhoidal grades (I–IV) in the Goligher classification system. There are numerous medical options (dietary measures, phlebotonics), office-based procedural options (rubber band ligation [RBL], infrared photocoagulation, bipolar diathermy, sclerotherapy), and surgical treatments (hemorrhoidectomy, hemorrhoidopexy, transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization) available, with well-established safety and efficacy profiles. However, high recurrence rates of bleeding are not uncommon after standard care therapies, which has prompted investigation into new therapeutic approaches.

Histopathologic evaluation has identified that hemorrhoids are vascular structures arising from channels of arteriovenous connective tissues with arterial supply from the superior, middle, and/or inferior rectal (hemorrhoidal) arteries and drain into the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. Based on this observation that there are arteriovenous connections within hemorrhoids with an arterial inflow to the corpus cavernosum recti, Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) was introduced as a treatment option for internal hemorrhoids. Doppler-guided hemorrhoid artery ligation is performed via…

### Hemorrhoids [^111DKR4P]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with hemorrhoids experience only mild symptoms that can be treated with nonprescription topical preparations. Patients usually seek treatment when symptoms increase. Internal hemorrhoids typically present with prolapse or painless rectal bleeding, while external hemorrhoids may also bleed and can cause acute pain if thrombosed.

Medical therapy should be initiated with stool softeners and local therapy to relieve swelling and symptoms. If medical therapy is inadequate, surgical intervention is warranted.

- **Treatment strategies for different grades of hemorrhoids**:
	- Rubber band ligation is the treatment of choice for grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. For grade 3 hemorrhoids, rubber band ligation, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, or stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be performed. Rubber band ligation causes less postoperative pain and fewer complications than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy but has a higher recurrence rate.
	- Excisional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is recommended for treatment of grade 4 hemorrhoids. Although stapled hemorrhoidopexy offers faster postoperative recovery, it has a higher recurrence rate.

Postoperative pain from excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, fiber supplements, and topical antispasmodics. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be managed either conservatively or through excision.

Treatment outcomes and clinical success rates in internal hemorrhoid management

Various outcome assessments have been utilized to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for hemorrhoids, with clinical success rates serving as a primary measure of effectiveness. Studies such as those conducted by Sun et al. (2018), Puchol et al. (2020), and Küçükay et al. (2021) have consistently reported high clinical success rates ranging from 83.4% to 93%. Clinical success encompasses a range of factors including symptom resolution, improvement in quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, outcome assessments such as the Goligher's grading system (GPS), French Bleeding Score (FBS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, and quality of life scores (QOLS) have been detailed for quantifying treatment outcomes.

### Insights into the management of anorectal disease in the coronavirus 2019 disease era [^117538Lu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoids and anal fissure

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays for elective procedures, which can impact the proctological management of advanced hemorrhoids. In this situation, telemedicine can be a possible alternative. Traditional risk factors for hemorrhoids include constipation, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle, which have all increased during the pandemic. This increase adds to the physical and psychological problems of this population.

Hemorrhoids are typically a benign condition that mostly improve with conservative management, although some cases require surgical intervention. If surgery is delayed in these cases, it can lead to disease progression and complications such as bleeding and pain. Traditionally, hemorrhoids are treated with office procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation, as well as operating room procedures like hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy for advanced cases. Emergent hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for cases with acute thrombosis and strangulation. There are no disease-specific guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids; all office and elective procedures should be rescheduled during the pandemic.

A recent study has shown that patients with a diagnosis of chronic hemorrhoids before the pandemic experienced a worsening of symptoms during the pandemic compared to recently diagnosed cases. Patients were reasonably satisfied with the implementation of telemedicine. Lifestyle changes, including physical activity and weight loss, have led to improvements in the hemorrhoid severity score.

### Rethinking what we know about hemorrhoids [^111tutFW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Although hemorrhoids are responsible for considerable economic cost and personal suffering, they have received surprisingly little research attention. In the United States, hemorrhoids are the third most common outpatient gastrointestinal diagnosis, with nearly 4 million office and emergency department visits annually. The etiology of hemorrhoids is speculative. A low-fiber diet and constipation have historically been thought to increase the risk for hemorrhoids but have not been proven.

Symptoms commonly attributed to hemorrhoids include bleeding, pain, pruritus, fecal seepage, prolapse, and mucus discharge. Research has found that these symptoms are equally reported by patients with and without hemorrhoids. Medical therapies for hemorrhoids have not been formally studied except for fiber, where the results have been inconsistent. A number of office-based interventions, such as rubber band ligation and infrared coagulation, are widely used and economically favorable for practitioners. Surgical procedures are effective at eliminating hemorrhoids but may be painful.

Given the burden of the disease and numerous gaps in our understanding, the time has come for targeted research to understand the cause, symptoms, and best treatment for patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

### Partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy versus circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy for grade III to IV prolapsing hemorrhoids: A randomized, noninferiority trial [^116YQ3tr]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

In summary, the 5-year recurrence rates were similar in patients with grade III to IV hemorrhoids treated with PSH or CSH. However, PSH was associated with reduced postoperative pain and urgency, better postoperative anal continence, and minimal risk of rectal stenosis. Additional analysis indicated that PSH is a clinically effective procedure, particularly in grade III hemorrhoids, with less efficacy in more advanced hemorrhoidal prolapse. New single-fire devices may provide better management for more extensive hemorrhoidal prolapse.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1146VGWC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with complicated hemorrhoids, we recommend non-operative management as the first-line therapy, including dietary and lifestyle changes, such as increased fiber and water intake, along with adequate bathroom habits (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).

For patients with complicated hemorrhoids, we suggest administering flavonoids to relieve symptoms (weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 2B).

In cases of thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, we recommend the use of a topical muscle relaxant (weak recommendation based on low quality evidence, 2C).

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of NSAIDs, topical steroids, other topical agents, or the injection of local anesthetics for complicated hemorrhoids based on the current literature.

Medical and pharmacological therapies are the most widely adopted treatment for complicated hemorrhoids and are supported by several studies. A Cochrane review from 2005 investigated the role of laxatives in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. It included seven randomized trials with a total of 378 participants assigned to either fiber or a non-fiber control group. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives, in the form of fiber, had a beneficial effect in treating symptomatic hemorrhoids, particularly in reducing bleeding. However, the authors cautioned that the risk of publication bias and the moderate quality of the included studies might limit the strength of the meta-analysis results. Another meta-analysis from the same author focusing on…

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^113o43LW]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Recurrence rate

At 12 months, recurrence was observed in 48.8% of rubber band ligation (RBL) participants versus 6.1% in the hemorrhoidectomy group, with an absolute risk difference (ARD) of 43% (95% CI, 25%–60%; p < 0.001), exceeding the noninferiority limit of 10%. Self-reported recurrence was higher in the RBL group (24%) compared to none in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 24%; 95% CI, 10%–37%; p = 0.003). In addition, 26% of RBL participants required more than one additional treatment, compared to 3% in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 23%; 95% CI, 9%–37%; p = 0.006). Specifically, 3 RBL participants (6.5%) underwent multiple RBL sessions (3×, 3×, and 6×), 3 participants (6.5%) underwent 1 extra RBL session followed by hemorrhoidectomy, and 6 participants (13%) underwent immediate hemorrhoidectomy after initial RBL failure. Thirteen RBL participants (28%) underwent one repeated RBL session, as was allowed by the study protocol.

At 6 weeks, 26% of RBL participants and 4.5% of hemorrhoidectomy participants reported unchanged or worsened symptoms (ARD 22%; 95% CI, 2%–42%). At 6 months, these rates were 7.9% versus 3% (ARD 5%; 95% CI, –5% to +15%). At 24 months, self-reported recurrence was 29.7% in the RBL group versus 6.7% in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 23%; 95% CI, 6%–40%).

Complications

Postoperative complications were observed in 6% of patients in the RBL group and 12% of patients in the hemorrhoidectomy group, with similar rates of serious adverse events.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^117QFtBC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Dutch guidelines for grade III hemorrhoids include shared decision-making, presenting hemorrhoidectomy or initial RBL as options, and recommending surgery if symptoms persist after 4 RBL sessions. In our study, only one patient exceeded this threshold, opting out of surgery.

In the hemorrhoidectomy group, one patient required a second Ligasure procedure, which successfully resolved symptoms. No differences in outcomes were observed between open and closed excisional techniques. Self-reported recurrence rates in this study were lower than those reported in the eTHoS trial (0% vs. 14% at 12 months and 6.7% vs. 25% at 24 months), likely due to our focus on grade III hemorrhoids. Conversely, recurrence rates were higher than those reported in our previous meta-analysis (31% for RBL vs. 6% for hemorrhoidectomy). However, the studies included in the meta-analysis were of poor quality, particularly in their definitions of recurrence and follow-up periods.

The skewed treatment allocation (47 vs. 40) resulted from stratification by the center with permuted blocks of random sizes, but baseline characteristics remained comparable. Notably, 42% of patients met the Rome IV criteria for functional constipation, emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying bowel issues when planning hemorrhoid treatment. The shorter waiting time for RBL intervention may provide an advantage in quickly managing severe symptoms. However, the median waiting time for surgery in our study (50 days; IQR, 27–88) was still shorter than reported in other studies.

Both groups experienced minimal complications.

### Endoscopic approaches to the management of hemorrhoids [^113SyWUS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine literature from the past five years regarding the status and future perspectives of endoscopic management of internal hemorrhoids.

Recent findings reveal that, despite the significant burden of hemorrhoidal diseases, research in this area — particularly on endoscopic treatment approaches — has been limited. Over the last five years, novel data has emerged on cap-assisted endoscopic sclerotherapy (CAES), which is expected to gain increased attention. Endoscopists have adopted rubber band ligation as endoscopic rubber band ligation (ERBL), showing satisfactory results for treating symptomatic hemorrhoids, although minor post-procedure complications are common. Further data is needed to compare ERBL, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and CAES head-to-head. Other methods, such as coagulation, remain understudied in the endoscopic context and warrant further exploration.

Meaningful comparisons between treatment methods for internal hemorrhoids are challenging due to variations in interventional techniques, differences in hemorrhoid grading, and the lack of standardized clinical trials. The Goligher classification alone is inadequate for determining the management of symptomatic hemorrhoids, indicating the need for revision.

In summary, gastroenterologists have the potential to play a larger role in managing internal hemorrhoids with flexible endoscopy. However, endoscopic treatment options require further study to enhance evidence and practice in this field.

While conventional risk-of-bias assessments for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quality score evaluations for observational studies are common practices in systematic reviews, recommended by the PRISMA guidelines, the scope of this review required a nuanced approach. Our primary objective does not involve assessing the outcomes of specific interventions; instead, the analysis focuses on methodologies, reporting practices, and the identification of common data elements in clinical trials of superior rectal artery embolization (RAE) as a treatment for hemorrhoidal disease. The intent is to enhance consistency, transparency, and future comparability of trial outcomes among studies.

### Randomized controlled trial comparing rubber band ligation with stapled haemorrhoidopexy for grade II circumferential haemorrhoids: Long-term results [^113wULup]. Colorectal Disease (2010). High credibility.

An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of haemorrhoids has resulted in the introduction of new surgical techniques, including stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH). This randomized controlled trial compared the long-term effectiveness of SH with rubber band ligation (RBL) in the treatment of grade II circumferential symptomatic haemorrhoids.

A consecutive cohort of patients was randomly allocated to either SH or RBL. Data on haemorrhoidal symptoms, Cleveland continence scores, sphincter assessment, SF-36, EQ-5D, HAD score, and prior treatment history were assessed at enrollment and reassessed by long-term postal questionnaire. The details were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 from Microsoft Access.

Sixty patients were allocated by computer block randomization. Both groups were balanced for age, sex, and symptoms. Recurrence favored SH [3 vs. 11; OR 0.18, 95% CI (0.03 to 0.86), P = 0.028] at 1 year and, at a mean of 40.67 (31–47) months [4 vs. 12; OR 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.95); P = 0.039]. SH patients experienced prolonged pain [Median (IQR) = 7 (5, 7) vs. 3 (1, 7), P = 0.008] and took a longer time to return to work [6 (3, 7) vs. 3 (1, 6) days, P = 0.018]. There was no significant difference in quality of life.

Stapled haemorrhoidopexy achieved better disease control at 1 year without any major complications. This was sustained in the long term. Further studies with greater patient numbers are needed to confirm this study.

### Hemorrhoidal disease: A review [^112MKBGH]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Hemorrhoidal disease, a pathology of the tissue lining the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the US. It may impair quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse.

- **Observations**: Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed. Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into the anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible).

	- External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (e.g. flavonoids, which are thought to improve venous tone) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions.

	- Rubber band ligation — involving placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow — resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20% of cases.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: Analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^1164AUxP]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life and healthcare costs. While rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy are common treatments for grade III hemorrhoids, comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited.

- **Objective**: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of rubber band ligation compared to hemorrhoidectomy from a societal perspective within the context of the HOLLAND trial.

- **Design**: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

- **Settings**: Ten Dutch hospitals participating in the HOLLAND trial.

- **Patients**: Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids randomized to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy.

- **Interventions**: Rubber band ligation (up to two sessions) or excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months from a societal perspective.

- **Results**: Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (33 hemorrhoidectomy, 46 rubber band ligation). Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in better clinical outcomes with a QALY difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04–0.13) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%-51.7%). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1,364; 95% CI, 895–1,834; p < 0.001), as were societal costs (€1,984; 95% CI, -132–4,101; p = 0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio for hemorrhoidectomy was €24,042 per QALY gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5,918 per recurrence avoided. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000.

### Effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal dissection in the management of internal hemorrhoids: a retrospective cohort study [^112ayvuV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Improvement in internal hemorrhoids is frequently observed after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for rectal intraepithelial neoplasia. This study investigated the effectiveness of rectal ESD in the management of internal hemorrhoids.

- **Objectives**: Twenty-three patients who underwent ESD for tumors adjacent to the dentate line and associated with internal hemorrhoids were included.

- **Design**: A single-arm, retrospective multi-center study.

- **Methods**: The focal improvement (at the scarring area after ESD) and complete improvement rates of hemorrhoids at follow-up colonoscopies were evaluated.

- **Results**: Most patients (87%) had mild hemorrhoids. The focal and complete improvement rates of hemorrhoids were 83% and 48%, respectively. Complete improvement rates were 75% (3/4), 42% (5/12), and 43% (3/7) for tumors involving ⩾1/2, between 1/4 and 1/2, and < 1/4 of the circumference at the dentate line, respectively. No recurrence was observed after initial improvement, with a median observation period of 35 months.

- **Conclusion**: ESD may be an effective treatment for internal hemorrhoids.

### Partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy versus circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy for grade III to IV prolapsing hemorrhoids: A randomized, noninferiority trial [^115XGDJo]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

The circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy (CSH) technique was first introduced for the management of symptomatic hemorrhoids by Longo in 1998. Our previous systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the CSH technique is an effective procedure for reducing principal hemorrhoidal symptoms, although there is a reported higher rate of symptomatic prolapse over time compared with conventional hemorrhoidectomy.

Although CSH procedures are associated with less postoperative pain compared with conventional hemorrhoidectomy, a small but significant number of patients experience unrelenting discomfort. It is postulated that excessive fibrosis around the staples may be an important cause of persistent proctalgia. Functional issues, including new-onset fecal urgency and difficulty in defecation, likely result from the inflammatory response to staple deployment. In some cases, a fixed fibrotic element leads to significant postoperative anorectal stenosis. Rarely, a rectovaginal fistula may develop secondary to the occurrence of hematoma within the rectovaginal septum.
