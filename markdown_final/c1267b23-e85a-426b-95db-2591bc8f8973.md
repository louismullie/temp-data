## Question

Kenalog in scar post mammoplast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of Kenalog (triamcinolone acetonide) injections for scar management after reduction mammaplasty, including when to use it, dosing, technique, alternatives, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and typical scar patterns after reduction mammaplasty. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and mechanism of action of intralesional triamcinolone. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for efficacy and recurrence control. After that, I need to check guideline positions and consensus on dosing, intervals, and technique. I will then examine alternatives and combination therapies, including 5-FU, verapamil, botulinum toxin, and lasers. Finally, I should confirm safety, contraindications, and special considerations in the postoperative breast setting, and synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. After reduction mammaplasty, patients may develop hypertrophic scars or, less commonly, keloids, particularly along inframammary and vertical incisions. These scars can cause pruritus, pain, contracture, and cosmetic distress, and they warrant early, evidence-based management to optimize outcomes and patient satisfaction [^114Td4Mz].

> I need to check the pharmacology and mechanism. Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide suppresses fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, downregulates inflammatory cytokines, and induces vascular dysfunction and endothelial cell apoptosis, which together reduce scar height, erythema, and pruritus; these effects underpin its longstanding role as a first-line intralesional therapy for pathologic scars [^1148YAwx] [^113nDy68].

> Next, I should review the evidence for efficacy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of response. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show that intralesional triamcinolone produces 50–100% regression in many keloids and hypertrophic scars, with improvements in height, pliability, and vascularity; however, recurrence can approach 50% at 5 years without adjuvant strategies, underscoring the need for combination therapy in higher-risk lesions [^113nDy68] [^1148YAwx] [^114W9CpB].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positioning and dosing. International consensus and contemporary algorithms recommend triamcinolone as first-line for keloids and as a key adjuvant for hypertrophic scars, with typical dosing of 10–40 mg/mL per lesion, spaced about 4 weeks apart. Expert Delphi consensus favors 40 mg/mL for non-facial keloids and advises limiting cumulative per-session dose to around 80 mg to mitigate systemic risk, using 1 mL syringes and 25–27 gauge needles for precise intralesional delivery [^113nDy68] [^111mGtCj] [^114Td4Mz].

> Let me consider alternatives and combinations, because monotherapy may underperform in some cases. I should double-check the data on 5-fluorouracil plus triamcinolone: multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show superior efficacy and lower recurrence versus triamcinolone alone, with fewer telangiectasias; needle-free pneumatic jet injection of TAC+5-FU has also shown meaningful volume and height reductions after a single session in hypertrophic scars, which may be useful for patients with needle aversion [^113yi9WD] [^115DLHvw] [^114C6nmg]. But wait, what if steroid adverse effects are a concern? Verapamil appears safer than triamcinolone with less atrophy and telangiectasia, though efficacy is mixed across trials; some meta-analyses suggest comparable outcomes albeit slower response, so verapamil is a reasonable alternative when steroid side effects limit therapy [^116NUHna] [^1153FKDF]. I should also review botulinum toxin combinations: meta-analyses and translational work suggest TAC+BTX-A improves effective rates and symptom scores versus BTX-A alone, plausibly via tension modulation and fibroblast signaling, though thickness gains are modest and more robust trials are needed [^113o8xVX] [^114E9kwJ]. Finally, lasers and laser-assisted drug delivery can augment steroid penetration and reduce recurrence; pulsed-dye laser targets vascularity, while fractional ablation can facilitate topical or intralesional drug delivery, though optimal protocols are still evolving [^117AA9xG] [^1145ei48] [^113GdjZM].

> I will now examine safety and contraindications, and I need to ensure I separate local from systemic risks. Local adverse effects include dermal atrophy, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, steroid acne, and sterile abscess; these risks rise with higher concentrations and volumes, so using the lowest effective dose and avoiding superficial or perilesional injection is prudent [^117T94og] [^116YsMsj]. Systemic risks are uncommon with limited cumulative dosing but can include HPA axis suppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and immunosuppression; rare anaphylaxis has been reported, and patients with active infections, uncontrolled diabetes, or hypersensitivity should avoid intralesional steroids; additionally, avoid injection through or into infected tissue and screen for latent or active infections when clinically indicated [^112YnoUg] [^111mpo9G] [^111tYuXY].

> But wait, what about the specific post-mammaplasty context? I should confirm whether chronic systemic steroid use affects wound healing and whether that informs intralesional use. The ASPS reduction mammaplasty guideline notes that chronic systemic corticosteroids are associated with wound healing difficulties; however, this pertains to systemic exposure rather than limited intralesional dosing, so judicious intralesional triamcinolone remains acceptable for pathologic scars when indicated, with attention to timing and technique to minimize local complications [^113xaUEX] [^115bxPiK].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First-line for established hypertrophic scars after reduction mammaplasty is intralesional triamcinolone at 10–40 mg/mL, typically 20–40 mg/mL for thicker keloids, injected intralesionally at 4-week intervals for 2–4 sessions, using a 1 mL syringe and 25–27 gauge needle; limit total per-session dose to about 80 mg and avoid superficial or perilesional deposition to reduce atrophy and telangiectasia risk [^111mGtCj] [^113nDy68]. If response is suboptimal or recurrence risk is high, escalate to combination therapy with 5-FU plus triamcinolone, which improves efficacy and reduces recurrence compared with triamcinolone alone; consider BTX-A combinations or laser-assisted delivery in refractory cases, and integrate silicone-based therapy for prevention and maintenance given its favorable safety profile and supportive, albeit low-certainty, evidence [^113yi9WD] [^113o8xVX] [^113Jg2sU]. I should confirm that silicone gel sheeting or similar pressure/modulating dressings are initiated early for new or evolving scars as an adjunct to reduce progression and symptoms, especially in patients with darker skin types or known scarring propensity [^116rcH7d] [^113Jg2sU].

> Hold on, I should verify timing relative to surgery. For keloids, postoperative intralesional steroid injection after excision reduces recurrence compared with pre- or intraoperative injection; translating this principle, initiating intralesional therapy about 2–4 weeks after wound maturation allows assessment of scar trajectory while intervening before fibrosis consolidates, though exact timing should be individualized to incision integrity and healing quality [^111Xbt42].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and monitoring are explicit. Assess scar height, pliability, erythema, and symptoms at each visit using standardized scales such as VSS or POSAS when feasible. Document with serial photos and consider objective measures like ultrasound or 3D imaging for research or equivocal cases. Counsel patients on expected course, potential adverse effects, and the possibility of multiple sessions or combination therapy to optimize outcomes and minimize recurrence [^114W9CpB] [^113SaKML].

Kenalog (triamcinolone acetonide) is effective for **reducing scar thickness, pruritus, and pain** after reduction mammaplasty, with typical dosing of 10–40 mg/mL every 4–6 weeks until flattening or symptom control [^111mGtCj]. Local adverse effects include **atrophy, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, and rare infection**; systemic effects are uncommon with limited total dose [^114W9CpB] [^112YnoUg]. For enhanced efficacy and lower recurrence, **combine with 5-FU or botulinum toxin**, and consider silicone gel or pressure therapy as adjuncts [^113yi9WD] [^113o8xVX] [^1164Aa9T]. Avoid injections in active infection, and monitor for atrophy and pigment changes; if recurrence occurs, repeat or combine therapies [^111mpo9G] [^117T94og] [^115pvsCj].

---

## Indications for Kenalog injection in scar management

Kenalog is indicated for **hypertrophic scars and keloids** — common after reduction mammaplasty — characterized by raised, firm, erythematous, pruritic, or painful scars [^1148YAwx]. It is also used for symptomatic relief of pruritus, pain, and tenderness associated with pathological scarring [^114JXENL].

---

## Mechanism of action

Triamcinolone acetonide exerts **anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immunosuppressive effects** that reduce fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, thereby flattening and softening scars [^112x5GKG]. It also decreases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, reducing vascularity and erythema [^1148YAwx].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting Kenalog injection

Multiple studies and meta-analyses demonstrate the **efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone** for hypertrophic scars and keloids:

- A systematic review and meta-analysis showed significant improvements in scar height, vascularity, and pliability with intralesional triamcinolone compared to placebo or other agents [^114W9CpB].
- Combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) significantly improves efficacy and reduces recurrence compared to triamcinolone alone [^113yi9WD] [^115DLHvw].
- Botulinum toxin A combined with triamcinolone enhances scar reduction by suppressing fibroblast proliferation and tension [^113o8xVX] [^114E9kwJ].

---

## Recommended dosage and injection technique

- **Concentration**: 10–40 mg/mL, with 20–40 mg/mL commonly used for hypertrophic scars and keloids [^111mGtCj].
- **Volume**: 0.1–0.5 mL per injection site, depending on scar size.
- **Frequency**: Every 4–6 weeks until flattening or symptom control is achieved, typically requiring 2–5 sessions [^111mGtCj].
- **Technique**: Intralesional injection using a 25–30 gauge needle, injecting into the mid-dermis to avoid superficial placement that increases risk of atrophy [^111mGtCj].

---

## Potential side effects and complications

Local side effects include **skin atrophy, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, steroid acne, and rare infection** [^116YsMsj]. Systemic effects are uncommon with limited total dose but may include transient adrenal suppression with repeated high-dose injections [^116YsMsj].

---

## Comparison with alternative treatments

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Recurrence rate** | **Side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Kenalog (triamcinolone) | High | Moderate (20–50%) | - Local atrophy <br/> - Hypopigmentation <br/> - Telangiectasia |
| 5-FU + triamcinolone | Very high | Low (10–20%) | - Local irritation <br/> - Ulceration |
| Botulinum toxin + triamcinolone | High | Moderate | - Temporary muscle weakness <br/> - Injection pain |
| Silicone gel sheeting | Moderate | Moderate | Minimal |
| Surgical excision | High | High (45–100%) | - Recurrence <br/> - Wound complications |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **intralesional corticosteroids as first-line therapy** for hypertrophic scars and keloids, with combination therapy (e.g. 5-FU or botulinum toxin) for enhanced efficacy and reduced recurrence [^115DLHvw] [^113o8xVX]. Silicone gel sheeting and pressure therapy are recommended as adjuncts to optimize outcomes [^115r4D8Z].

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

Kenalog injection is appropriate for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic scars or keloids after reduction mammaplasty, particularly those with raised, firm, pruritic, or painful scars. Contraindications include **active infection at the injection site, hypersensitivity to triamcinolone, and uncontrolled diabetes or immunosuppression** [^111mpo9G].

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence rates

Long-term outcomes are generally favorable, with significant reductions in scar thickness, pruritus, and pain. Recurrence rates vary: **20–50% for triamcinolone alone** and 10–20% with combination therapy (e.g. 5-FU) [^1148YAwx] [^115DLHvw].

---

## Practical considerations for clinicians

- **Patient counseling**: Discuss expected outcomes, potential side effects, and the need for multiple sessions [^111mGtCj].
- **Injection technique**: Use intralesional injection to minimize superficial atrophy and hypopigmentation [^115aGBup].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up to assess response and manage side effects [^111mGtCj].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider silicone gel sheeting, pressure garments, or combination therapies to enhance results [^113Jg2sU] [^115pvsCj].

---

Kenalog injection is effective for managing hypertrophic scars and keloids after reduction mammaplasty, providing significant symptom relief and cosmetic improvement. Combination therapies and adjunctive measures can enhance outcomes and reduce recurrence, while careful patient selection and injection technique minimize side effects [^114W9CpB] [^113yi9WD].

### Silicone gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars [^113Jg2sU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Keloid and hypertrophic scars are common and are caused by a proliferation of dermal tissue following skin injury. They cause functional and psychological problems for patients, and their management can be difficult. The use of silicone gel sheeting to prevent and treat hypertrophic scarring is still relatively new and started in 1981 with treatment of burn scars.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of silicone gel sheeting for:(1) prevention of hypertrophic or keloid scarring in people with newly healed wounds (e.g. post surgery);(2) treatment of established scarring in people with existing keloid or hypertrophic scars.

Search Methods

In May 2013 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL for this second update.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, or controlled clinical trials, comparing silicone gel sheeting for prevention or treatment of hypertrophic or keloid scars with any other non surgical treatment, no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed all relevant trials for methodological quality. Three review authors extracted data independently using a standardised form and cross-checked the results. We assessed all trials meeting the selection criteria for methodological quality.

Main Results

We included 20 trials involving 873 people, ranging in age from 1.5 to 81 years. The trials compared adhesive silicone gel sheeting with no treatment; non silicone dressing; other silicone products; laser therapy; triamcinolone acetonide injection; topical onion extract and pressure therapy. In the prevention studies, when compared with a no treatment option, whilst silicone gel sheeting reduced the incidence of hypertrophic scarring in people prone to scarring (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.98) these studies were highly susceptible to bias. In treatment studies, silicone gel sheeting produced a statistically significant reduction in scar thickness (mean difference (MD) -2.00, 95% CI -2.14 to -1.85) and colour amelioration (RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.15) but again these studies were highly susceptible to bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak evidence of a benefit of silicone gel sheeting as a prevention for abnormal scarring in high-risk individuals but the poor quality of research means a great deal of uncertainty prevails. Trials evaluating silicone gel sheeting as a treatment for hypertrophic and keloid scarring showed improvements in scar thickness and scar colour but are of poor quality and highly susceptible to bias.

Postoperative Management and Follow-up

Postoperative treatment included antibiotics and difluprednate 0.05% (Durezol, Alcon, Geneva, Switzerland) 4 times a day for the first week, the latter of which was tapered over 4 weeks. The bandage contact lens was removed 1 week after surgery. Patients who were observed to have conjunctival injection at the operative site or any apparent fibrovascular tissue regrowth in the area of the gap or reconstructed semilunar fold postoperatively were administered an injection of ∼0.3 mL triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY), which was performed after concentrating the triamcinolone acetonide solution by allowing the 40-mg particulate in 1 cc to settle out of solution and decanting off the diluent. For patients with granuloma formation in the postoperative recovery period, the granuloma was excised, and triamcinolone was also injected. Recurrence was the primary outcome measure and was defined as postoperative fibrovascular regrowth on the conjunctiva or growth that extended across the limbus to the cornea. Complications such as pyogenic granuloma, scar formation, and epithelial defects were also recorded.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous outcome measures were described using mean ± SD (median, range). Categorical variables were described using frequencies (percentages). The Fisher exact test was used to compare in the incidence of postoperative complications by intraoperative MMC use, and the independent-samples Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare continuous best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and operative time by MMC use. Changes in preoperative and postoperative BCVA (Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution [logMAR]) were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A P value of < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

### Treatment of hypertrophic scars using laser and laser assisted corticosteroid delivery [^113GdjZM]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hypertrophic scars and contractures are common following various types of trauma and procedures despite skilled surgical and wound care. Following ample time for healing and scar maturation, many millions of patients are burdened with persistent symptoms and functional impairments. Cutaneous scars can be complex and thus the approach to therapy is often multimodal. Intralesional corticosteroids have long been a staple in the treatment of hypertrophic and restrictive scars. Recent advances in laser technology and applications now provide additional options for improvements in function, symptoms, and cosmesis. Fractional ablative lasers create zones of ablation at variable depths of the skin with the subsequent induction of a wound healing and collagen remodeling response. Recent reports suggest these ablative zones may also be used in the immediate post-operative period to enhance delivery of drugs and other substances. We present a case series evaluating the efficacy of a novel combination therapy that incorporates the use of an ablative fractional laser with topically applied triamcinolone acetonide suspension in the immediate post-operative period.

Methods

This is a prospective case series including 15 consecutive subjects with hypertrophic scars resulting from burns, surgery or traumatic injuries. Subjects were treated according to typical institutional protocol with three to five treatment sessions at 2- to 3-month intervals consisting of fractional ablative laser treatment and immediate post-operative topical application of triamcinolone acetonide suspension at a concentration of 10 or 20mg/ml. Three blinded observers evaluated photographs taken at baseline and six months after the final treatment session. Scores were assigned using a modified Manchester quartile score to evaluate enhancements in dyschromia, hypertrophy, texture, and overall improvement.

Limitations

Small sample size and lack of a control arm.

Results

Combination same session laser therapy and immediate post-operative corticosteroid delivery resulted in average overall improvement of 2.73/3.0. Dyschromia showed the least amount of improvement while texture showed the most improvement.

Conclusion

Combination same-session therapy with ablative fractional laser-assisted delivery of triamcinolone acetonide potentially offers an efficient, safe and effective combination therapy for challenging hypertrophic and restrictive cutaneous scars.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116X5LTW]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid Tape and Plaster

As with hypertrophic scars, corticosteroid tape and plaster is the first-line keloid therapy in the 2019 Japanese guideline. Its long-term, continuous application softens and then flattens the mass. It also reduces pruritus and erythema. Figure 5 shows a steroid plaster–treated keloid. However, in my experience, rapidly growing keloids cannot be stopped by steroid tape and plaster alone, and this therapy must be combined with triamcinolone acetonide injections or other methods. The greatest advantages of steroid tape and plaster are its painlessness and few side effects. Strong steroid (deprodone propionate) plaster, which is available only in Japan, is more effective than fludroxycortide tape. It should become available worldwide for treating pathologic scars.

Fig. 5.
Treatment of keloids using deprodone propionate plaster. (Left) Pretreatment view. (Right) Three years after starting deprodone propionate plaster. A 40-year-old woman developed a keloid on her left shoulder as a result of folliculitis. She was treated with deprodone propionate plaster for 24 hours/day. The patient changed the tape every day and continued to use it for 3 years. Six months after starting this therapy, the scar became soft. In the ensuing 3 years, the scar became almost flat.

Corticosteroid Ointment and Cream

Case series studies showed that multiple daily corticosteroid cream applications had excellent to good effects on existing keloidsand reduced recurrence to 14.3 percent when applied postoperatively. However, a limitation is that the cream is easily rubbed off.

Cryotherapy

Recent reviews, showed that cryotherapy (monotherapy or with triamcinolone acetonide injection) effectively reduces keloid size. Cryotherapy methods include direct contact, sprays, – and intralesional needles. However, supporting evidence is limited to case series studies.

Antitumor and Immunosuppressive Agents

Recent meta-analyses, reviews, and new randomized controlled trials – show that intralesional 5-fluorouracil injection is an effective keloid monotherapy and reduces postoperative recurrence. – They also show that 5-fluorouracil effectively reduces keloid elevation and erythema when combined with triamcinolone acetonide injections. – A meta-analysisreported that bleomycin injections improve keloids more effectively than triamcinolone acetonide and/or 5-fluorouracil injections.

### A prospective randomized trial of the efficacy of fibrin glue, triamcinolone acetonide, and quilting sutures in seroma prevention after latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction [^116H1YTt]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Donor-site seroma is the most common complication following latissimus dorsi flap breast reconstruction. Various agents and techniques have attempted to minimize seroma formation. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of different products and quilting sutures at seroma prevention.

Methods

This is a single-center, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of a consecutive series of breast cancer patients (n = 96) undergoing latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction performed by a single surgeon. Patients were randomized to receive (1) fibrin glue (Tisseel) (n = 23), (2) triamcinolone acetonide (n = 26), or (3) normal saline (control) (n = 27) sprayed into the donor site. The fourth arm included donor-site quilting sutures (n = 20). Outcomes included seroma, drain output, and days to last drain removal. Drain removal was standardized at less than 30 cc/day.

Results

All groups were matched evenly without differences in risk, procedures, or complications. The overall seroma rate was 31.3 percent (n = 30). The quilting group had significantly less drainage for weeks 1 (p = 0.006) and 2 (p = 0.050) postoperatively. Quilting statistically reduced the incidence of seromas to 5.0 percent (n = 1; p = 0.038) compared with other groups (control, 34.5 percent; fibrin, 27.6 percent; and triamcinolone, 37.6 percent). Drains were removed 10 days earlier with quilting (control, 35.5 days; fibrin, 39.5 days; triamcinolone, 37.4 days; and quilting, 25.8 days; p = 0.001). The incidence of all other complications was similar between groups.

Conclusion

The use of quilting donor sites significantly decreases the incidence of donor-site seromas and leads to earlier drain removal following latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction and maintains a low complication profile.

### Bimatoprost drug delivery with fractional laser and microneedling for the management of COVID-19 prone positioning-induced facial atrophy and hypopigmentation [^116dvc14]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report demonstrated a novel approach combining fractional resurfacing with transepidermal delivery of bimatoprost in a patient with Fitzpatrick phototype V who was experiencing atrophic, depigmented, hypopigmented scarring secondary to prone positioning in the setting of COVID-19 endotracheal intubation. Hypopigmented and depigmented scars such as the ones seen in this patient present a therapeutic challenge for dermatologists.

Prior studies support the use of topical bimatoprost following microneedling and/or ablative fractional laser for improving the appearance of hypopigmented scars. A study by Massaki et alfound that a mean of 4.5 fractionated 1550-nm erbium-doped laser sessions at 4- to 8-week intervals with subsequent topical bimatoprost helped improve hypopigmented scars. Patients in this study with scars on the face and neck underwent 10 and 4 sessions, respectively, of laser therapy followed by bimatoprost in order to experience 50% to 75% improvement of their scars. We were able to achieve this grade of response following only 1 session when a CO 2 laser was used to transepidermally deliver bimatoprost.

Bimatoprost, a synthetic prostaglandin F2α analog, is believed to induce hyperpigmentation by increasing melanocyte dendricityand stimulating tyrosinase, a rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis. Transepidermal drug delivery utilizes the permeability alterations induced by ablative resurfacing to increase the delivery of different substances into the skin. Similar approaches of laser-assisted transepidermal drug delivery have been published in the setting of triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog) delivery for necrobiosis lipoidica, triamcinolone delivery for alopecia areata, and 5-fluorouracil delivery for hypertrophic scars. This approach to repigmentation may be useful in patients of color who are prone to developing more visible hypopigmented and depigmented scars due to their increased melanin.

The findings of this case report are limited by the small sample size, lack of a control group, and the anecdotal nature of case reports. Nonetheless, these findings offer a new insight into achieving repigmentation of atrophic depigmented and hypopigmented scars. This case also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the management of COVID-19 and its sequelae. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of atrophic hypopigmented scars developing from facial pressure ulcers as a result of prone positioning so as to discuss a therapeutic approach.

### Acne scarring: a review and current treatment modalities [^111BahJm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne is a prevalent condition in society and often results in secondary damage in the form of scarring. Of course, prevention is the optimal method to avoid having to correct the physically or emotionally troublesome scars. However, even with the best efforts, scars will certainly arise. This article attempts to give a broad overview of multiple management options, whether medically, surgically, or procedurally based. The hope is that a general knowledge of the current available alternatives will be of value to the physician when confronted with the difficult task of developing a treatment plan for acne-scarred individuals, even in challenging cases.

### The safety and efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide for keloids and hypertrophic scars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114W9CpB]. Burns (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) is widely used for hypertrophic scars and keloids; however, TAC has variable efficacy and safety in different individuals.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional TAC for treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Data Sources

Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov prior to 25 March 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials in English that compared TAC with a placebo or other medications that are commonly used for intralesional injection in hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Data Extraction

Primary outcomes were reduction in scar height, vascularity, pliability, pigmentation, total scores on the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) or patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), telangiectasia, and skin atrophy. Secondary outcomes included overall scar improvement.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. In the short term, TAC was associated with a significant improvement in vascularity (MD: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.02) and pliability (MD: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.06) compared to verapamil. In the medium term, compared to TAC, 5-FU showed a significant improvement in scar height (SMD: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.15–1.75), while TAC led to a significant improvement in vascularity compared to 5-FU (MD: -0.45, 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.14). Compared to TAC, TAC+5-FU showed a significant improvement in pliability (SMD: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.17–1.78) and pigmentation (MD: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.12–0.78). Botulinum toxin type A resulted in significantly better pliability (SMD: 1.99, 95% CI: 0.98–3.00) compared to TAC. In the long term, compared to TAC, 5-FU led to a significant improvement in scar height (MD: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.17–0.93), but significantly less vascularity (MD: -0.35, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.05). Compared to TAC, TAC+5-FU produced a significant improvement in scar height (MD: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.12–1.88), pliability (MD: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.10–0.80), and pigmentation (MD: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.24–0.86).

Conclusion

TAC may be beneficial for the short-term treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids; however, 5-FU, 5-FU+TAC, and verapamil may produce superior results for medium- and long-term treatments. TAC injections at concentrations of 20 mg/ml or 40 mg/ml are more likely to result in skin atrophy compared to 5-FU or verapamil, and are more likely to cause telangiectasia than 5-FU, 5-FU+TAC, or bleomycin.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of intralesional triamcinolone and combination of triamcinolone with 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars: randomised control trial [^115DLHvw]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scar is challenging with no universally accepted mode for permanent ablation. Conventional therapies yield unpredictable results, significant complications and require elaborate hardware.

Objective

The objective was to establish the safety and efficacy of intralesional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Place and Duration

It was conducted at the Jinnah Burn and Reconstructive Surgery Center/Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore, Pakistan from May 2012 to March 2013.

Subjects and Methods

We included 120 patients divided in two groups. The group A patients received intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) and the group B patients received both 5-FU and TAC. 8 injections at a week interval were given and patients were evaluated at the start of treatment and then at 4th and at 8th week during the treatment and then 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Patents were assessed for mean reduction in scar height, efficacy and complications.

Results

Total of 108 patients completed the study. The mean reduction in the scar height in group B (5-FU+TAC) 1.144+.4717 was markedly better than that of group A (TAC alone) 1.894+1.0751 (t = 4.781, p = .000). The efficacy (defined previously as > 50% reduction in initial scar height) was superior in group B 44 (77.2%) than that of group A 25 (49.0% (X2 = 9.260, p = .002). Recurrence was seen in 39.2% (20) of patients of the group A while in only 17.5% (10) of the cases of group B (P = 0.012). Mean follow up was of 22 months.

Conclusion

5-FU+TAC is safe, easy to administer and effective treatment for problematic scars and has the lower rate of recurrence on larger follow up.

Corticosteroid Ointment and Cream

Randomized controlled trials on corticosteroid ointment and cream are lacking, but a case series studyshowed that triamcinolone acetonide injections of hypertrophic scar and keloid-excision sites combined with twice-daily 6-month corticosteroid ointment application yielded keloid and hypertrophic scar recurrence rates of 14.3 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively. These outcomes and good clinical experiences recently led several Japanese burn and scar societies, to recommend corticosteroid ointment and cream materials for superficial dermal burnsand hypertrophic scar prevention and treatment. However, since corticosteroid ointment and cream should be applied four times daily to generate steroid tape and plaster effects, patient education is necessary.

Laser

Two reviews, and a meta-analysisshowed that pulsed-dye laser significantly reduces hypertrophic scar erythema and pruritus – because its wavelength (585 to 595 nm) reaches the hypertrophic scar angiogenic region: its heat reduces hypertrophic scar blood flow and therefore inflammation. Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser (532/1064 nm) has similar effects, as shown by a review, a meta-analysis, case-series studies, and a randomized controlled trial. Randomized controlled trials showed that nonablative/ablative carbon dioxide fractional lasers have no beneficial effects. Fully ablative laser therapy is not recommended for pathologic scars because of high recurrence.

### Silicone gel sheeting for treating keloid scars [^116rmVz2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Keloid scarring is one of the most common types of pathological scarring. Keloid scars that fail to heal can affect a person's physical and psychological function by causing pain, pruritus, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical-grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for keloid scars. However, there is no up-to-date systematic review assessing the effectiveness of SGS for keloid scars. A clear and rigorous review of current evidence is required to guide clinicians, healthcare managers and people with keloid scarring.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of keloid scars compared with standard care or other therapies.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was December 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people with any keloid scars and assessed the effectiveness of SGS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary.

Main Results

Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes were 16 and 20 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in causes for scarring (e.g. surgery, infected wounds, and trauma), site (e.g. chest and back), and ages of scars. The duration of follow-up was three and four and a half months. The included studies reported three comparisons; SGS compared with no treatment, SGS compared with non-silicone gel sheeting (a dressing similar to SGS but which does not contain silicone), and SGS compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide. One trial had a split-body design and one trial had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). The included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcome of scar severity measured by health professionals and no data were reported for severity of scar measured by patients or adverse events. For secondary outcomes some data on pain were reported, but health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were not reported. Both trials had suboptimal outcome reporting, thus many domains in the risk of bias were assessed as unclear. All evidence was rated as being very low-certainty, mainly due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. SGS compared with no treatment Two studies with 33 participants (76 scars) reported the severity of scar assessed by health professionals, and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity compared with no treatment (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). We are uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with no treatment (21 participants with 40 scars; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. SGS compared with non-SGS One study with 16 participants (25 scars) was included in this comparison. We are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity assessed by health professionals compared with non-SGS (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). We are also uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with non-SGS (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. SGS compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide One study with 17 participants (51 scars) reported scar severity assessed by health professionals, and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). This study also reported pain assessed by health professionals among 5 participants (15 scars) and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and twice for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently a lack of RCT evidence about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of keloid scars. From the two studies identified, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether the use of SGS compared with no treatment, non-SGS, or intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide makes any difference in the treatment of keloid scars. Evidence from the included studies is of very low certainty, mainly driven by the risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision due to small sample size. Further well-designed studies that have good reporting methodologies and address important clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes are required to reduce uncertainty around decision-making in the use of SGS to treat keloid scars.

### Treatment of hypertrophic scars using laser-assisted corticosteroid versus laser-assisted 5-fluorouracil delivery [^1145ei48]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

As the mortality of individuals suffering severe cutaneous injuries decreases, there is an increased need to improve the methods by which physicians treat the resultant scars. Fractional lasers, which create zones of ablation at variable depths, provide a powerful tool in the management of scar complications and deformities. After disruption of the normal skin barrier, these zones may be used to deliver drugs that may enhance scar resolution.

Objective

To determine the differences in clinical outcome for hypertrophic scars treated with laser-assisted corticosteroid delivery, as compared to laser-assisted 5-fluorouracil delivery.

Methods

In this prospective, double-blinded, single-subject study of 20 individuals with hypertrophic scars, subjects underwent 3 treatment sessions at 1-month intervals consisting of fractional ablative laser treatment, followed by postoperative application of either topical triamcinolone acetonide (20 mg/mL) or topical 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/mL).

Results

Three sessions of laser-assisted triamcinolone acetonide and 5-fluorouracil delivery both produced reductions in overall scar area. When compared with one another, there were no statistically significant differences in area reduction between the 2 modalities (p = .603). However, scars treated with 5-fluorouracil were not associated with side effects seen with corticosteroid therapy, such as dermal atrophy or telangiectasia formation.

Conclusion

As 5-fluorouracil was associated with fewer adverse events, these findings support the use of a nonsteroidal agent in the management of traumatic scars by laser-assisted therapy.

Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections

Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients receiving corticosteroids, including KENALOG-10. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles:

- If a KENALOG-10-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

- If a KENALOG-10-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including KENALOG-10. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with KENALOG-10. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-10, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid KENALOG-10 use in the presence of such infections unless KENALOG-10 is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic KENALOG-10 therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, KENALOG-10 withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-10, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating KENALOG-10 in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-10, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including KENALOG-10, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116LqUs2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the past decade, many high-quality studies have been conducted, and the level of evidence for many treatment or prevention regimens has strengthened. As reflected in my reprised review here, these changes have led to pathologic scar management strategies that now effectively and safely prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate these pernicious scars. However, given ethnic differences in pathologic scar propensity, prevention and treatment algorithms should be optimized for each human race by means of international collaboration.

### Capsule injection for the prevention of contracture [^116DAwmQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

From 1990 through 1999, 164 patients with prior augmentation mammaplasty underwent implant removal by the author, and 128 of the patients had the implants replaced. Of that group, 86 were noted on preoperative examination to have capsule contracture of grade III or IV. Patients with preoperative capsule contracture were offered the option of a postoperative injection of triamcinolone intended to prevent recurrent contracture. Patients who elected to have replacement with gel-filled implants were excluded. A total of 48 patients underwent injection of triamcinolone 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Of the remaining 38 patients, 12 were not offered injection because they selected gel-filled implants and 26 declined injection. Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 10 years (mean, 46 months), and no patient was followed up for less than 8 months. Of the 48 patients who received injections, two developed recurrent contracture, one at 3 years and one at 4.5 years. Of the 26 patients who declined injection, eight had recurrent contracture (three bilateral) within 12 months. These data suggest that in this high-risk group of patients, a postoperative injection of triamcinolone can reduce the risk of recurrent contracture.

### Comparative results in treatment of keloids with intralesional 5-FU / kenalog, 5-FU / verapamil, enalapril alone, verapamil alone, and laser: a case report and review of the literature [^115dcp1k]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The pathogenesis of keloids involves a hyperproliferative state due to molecular abnormalities, cellular driving pathways, such as TGF, VEGF, and the inactivation of proapoptotic genes. We reviewed the literature and compared various treatment combina- tions in the treatment of keloids in a one patient observation.

Methods and Materials

Treatment modalities consisted of: intralesional 5- uorouracil (5-FU)/triamcinolone (TMC), 5-FU/verapamil, enal- april alone, verapamil alone, and fractional carbon dioxide laser. Size, height, and softness of the keloid, pain, itching, and pain were assessed.

Results

5-FU based treatments proved to be more ef cacious than the other modalities. 5-FU + TMC demonstrated the largest reduc- tion in keloid height and rmness. The greatest degree of scar softening and average size reduction was achieved with 5-FU/ TMC (80% and 70% reduction, respectively), followed by 5-FU/verapamil (50% and 33% reduction, respectively). The same combinations led to the greatest reduction in scar height (70% and 33%, respectively). All treatments led to resolution of pain and itching in the keloid.

Conclusion

The favorable effects of the 5-FU + verapamil combination are new and deserve further exploration. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(11):1442–1447. </em>.

### Keloids: prevention and management [^114h3NAR]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Keloids result from an abnormal wound-healing process in which the normal regulatory pathways during tissue regeneration and scar remodeling are disrupted. While the pathogenesis of keloids continues to be investigated, numerous treatment options exist. Although prevention of keloid formation is the best management, early recognition of keloid formation is integral in treatment and prevention of recurrence. Surgical resection with adjuvant silicone gel sheeting or triamcinolone injection is common, but can still result in recurrence. New treatments include chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and mitomycin C. Although further clinical investigation is required for newer treatments, initial results are promising.

### Intramuscular triamcinolone: a safe, effective and underutilized dermatologic therapy [^112fMCYS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Although intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide has been available as a dermatologic therapy for many years, it is used sparingly or not at all by many dermatologists because of concern about its safety, as well as a lack of understanding of its specific therapeutic benefits. This case report discusses the efficacy and safety of intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide, along with description of the specific technique employed by the author, as well as the clinical indications and side effects seen by the author in his practice over time. The report describes the positive results attained in the treatment of many chronic, recalcitrant dermatologic conditions that cannot be adequately controlled by topical therapy alone. Because of its strong safety profile and unique therapeutic efficacy, intramuscular triamcinolone should be considered as a primary therapy for many chronic, steroid responsive, dermatologic conditions requiring a systemic approach.

### Evaluating the therapeutic success of keloids treated with cryotherapy and intralesional corticosteroids using noninvasive objective measures [^113SaKML]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intralesional corticosteroid injections combined with cryotherapy are considered a first-line therapy for keloids. However, objective evaluation on its efficacy is widely missing.

Objective

In this study, the authors evaluated the therapeutic benefits of cryotherapy directly followed by intralesional crystalline triamcinolone acetonide injections using ultrasound and a 3D topographic imaging device.

Materials and Methods

Fifteen patients with keloids were treated with cryotherapy and intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide for a total of 4 times at intervals of 4 weeks. Objective assessment was performed at each visit.

Results

After the last treatment, a significant average reduction of scar volume of 34.3% and an average decrease in scar height of 41.3% as determined by 3D imaging was observed compared with baseline. Ultrasound revealed an average reduction of scar height of 31.7% and an average decrease in tissue penetration depth of 37.8% when compared with baseline measurements.

Conclusion

Objective measurements of relevant keloid characteristics as height, volume, and penetration depth help in quantifying the therapeutic effect. The observed results confirm that intralesional injections of crystalline triamcinolone acetonide combined with cryotherapy represent a powerful approach to reduce scar height and volume significantly.

Type of Corticosteroid, Dosing Interval, and Equipment for ICA

Triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) (Kenalog, Kenacort) is the preferred corticosteroid for ICA in keloids (87%). Consensus was reached that 40 mg/mL is generally the preferred TAC concentration for treatment of non-facial keloids (78%). The participants agreed that if the required cumulative dose exceeds 80 mg of TAC per session for large or multiple keloids, (combining) other treatment options should be considered to prevent systemic adverse effects (96%). Consensus was reached on the suggested interval of 4 weeks between treatment sessions with TAC. Consensus was reached that a syringe with a small inner diameter, generally 1 mL syringes, should be used for ICA in keloids (78%). Moreover, the participants agreed that 25 gauge (orange, inner diameter 0.26 mm) or 27 gauge (medium grey, inner diameter 0.21 mm) needles are suggested for corticosteroid injection in keloids, but larger or smaller gauge needles can be considered on the basis of scar pliability and the use of any adjunctive measures such as laser pre-treatment.

Local Anesthesia

Consensus was reached that minimizing pain during ICA in keloids should be aimed for, as the treatment is often painful (83%). Participants agreed that the speed of corticosteroid needle injection should be taken into consideration in pain reduction (78%), and that topical anesthetics such as lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) cream prior to ICA in keloids are an adequate option for reducing needle puncture pain (87%), but that mixing the intralesional corticosteroid with a local anesthetic is not recommended for pain reduction (91%). No agreement was reached on the use of local skin cooling prior to ICA (52%), nor field block anesthesia prior to ICA (73%) for pain reduction.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of intralesional steroids in acute hidradenitis suppurativa lesions: a prospective study [^114K2fRV]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

Conventional therapies for HS do not always provide control of inflammation. A better understanding of the HS pathogenetic mechanisms has enabled to improve disease management with new unconventional treatments.

The lack of strong scientific evidence for the treatment of HS with intralesional steroids has led to its exclusion from the current treatment guidelines. A Canadian group reported the useful management of acute HS flares in 29% of their patients with a reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics. Riis et al. assessed the outcomes of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide 10 mg/mg in the management of acute HS lesions (inflammatory nodules and abscesses), and reported a significant reduction in VAS‐pain after 1 day, and in physician‐assessed edema, redness, and suppuration after 7 days with no adverse events.

In a multicenter retrospective clinical study including both acute and chronic lesions, a Spanish group reported a complete response to intralesional triamcinolone in 70.37% of lesions, partial improvement in 25.19% and no improvement in only six out of 135 lesions (4.44%). Adverse events were reported in four cases: one atrophic scar, one local hypopigmentation and aggravation of two lesions. In a prospective trial on 46 patients, another Spanish group reported clinical resolution in 28.3% of fistulous tracts, both clinical and ultrasound responses in 46.3% of fistulous tracts and no response in 28.3% of fistulous tracts after a single injection of triamcinolone 40 mg/ml at the 90‐day follow up. Pigmentation changes were reported in 25 patients.

Keloid is characterized by benign overgrowth of dermal collagen in response to skin injury in genetically predisposed individuals. Intralesional triamcinolone and bleomycin have been used with varying success in the treatment of keloids. To compare the efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone versus intralesional bleomycin in the treatment keloids. A total of 164 patients were randomized into two of 82 each. Group A received intralesional bleomycine and Group B received intralesional triamcinolone. Patients were scored at baseline and at the end of treatment for therapeutic response based on reduction on patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS). Mean baseline POSAS score was 91 ± 10.98 SD check in Group A and 90 ± 10.85 SD in Group B. POSAS score after 24 weeks 26 SD ± 11.91 in Group and 34 ± 12.28 in Group B. This difference was statistically difference. Intralesional bleomycin is more efficacious than intralesional triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of keloids.

### Comparison of intralesional verapamil versus intralesional corticosteroids in treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars: a randomized controlled trial [^115NPz2F]. Burns (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Keloids and hypertrophic scars are due to overgrowth of dermal collagen following trauma to the skin that usually cause major physical, psychological and cosmetic problems.

Methods

In this randomized controlled trial, with a paired design, 50 patients with 2 or more keloids were included. In the control group (50 lesions), intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (40mg/mL) was injected at three-week intervals for a total of 18weeks. In the other group (50 lesions), lesions were treated by verapamil (2.5mg/mL) with the same therapeutic sessions. Scar evaluation at each stage and at the end of 3months follow up was done by serial photographic records as well as by Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS).

Results

Mean zero VSS scores were achieved with only triamcinolone in respect of scar height (week 15th) and pliability (week 15th). No therapeutic event (parameter = 0) or significant improvement was seen in verapamil group.

Conclusion

Our results did not support verapamil's capability in treatment of keloid nor hypertrophic scars.

### An open, randomized, controlled, comparative study of the combined effect of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide and onion extract gel and intralesional triamcinolone acetonide alone in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids [^117BDMtX]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Various treatment regimens have been used in scars. The literature offers little consensus about appropriate therapy.

Objective

To compare intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) alone or combined with onion extract in keloidal and hypertrophic scars.

Materials and Methods

Fourteen patients were treated with intralesional TAC and onion extract gel, and 13 patients were treated with intralesional TAC alone. Findings were recorded and graded at each visit (weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20). The scores before treatment and at week 20 were compared.

Results

Twenty-seven patients [17 men (63%) and 10 women (37%) aged 15 to 73 (average age 28.1 ± 11.7)] were enrolled in the study. At baseline, the difference in the two treatment groups was not statistically significant (p > .05). At week 20, there was statistically significant improvement in both treatment groups (p < .05). TAC with onion extract was more effective than TAC alone in terms of pain-sensitiveness, itching, and elevation but not in erythema and induration. Treatment was well tolerated, without any adverse effect.

Conclusion

Treatment with intralesional TAC and onion extract and TAC alone were effective. Combined with onion extract gel, intralesional TAC appears to be superior to TAC alone in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

### Comparative efficacy of intralesional verapamil hydrochloride and triamcinolone acetonide in hypertrophic scars and keloids [^1153FKDF]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

There is not much level 1 evidence based literature to guide management of hypertrophic scars and keloids despite an array of therapeutic modalities at disposal. Intralesional (i/l) triamcinolone injections have remained a gold standard in non surgical management. Sporadic reports on use of i/l verapamil suggest its efficacy. Since verapamil has not found sufficient mention as an effective alternative modality, it was decided to undertake a randomized study which could also address some additional clinical parameters. A randomized, parallel group and observer blinded comparison with 40 patients (48 scars) was carried out to compare the effects of i/l triamcinolone (T) (22 scars) and verapamil injections (V) (26 scars). 1.5 mL was the maximum indicative volume decided in the study protocol for both the drugs (triamcinolone @40 mg/ml and verapamil @ 2.5 mg/ml). Patients included were aged between 15–60 years with scars ranging between 0.5–5 cm (but total area roughly < 6 cm(2)), and scars under 2 years duration. Patients with keloidal diathesis were excluded. Injections were scheduled every three weeks until complete flattening of the scar or eight sessions, which ever came earlier. No concomitant therapies like massage, silicone gel or pressure garments were used. Scar evaluation at each stage was done by serial photographic records as well as by Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). Comparative survival analysis between the two drugs was done using Kaplan Meier curves, and VSS scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon test and log rank test. Mean zero VSS scores were achieved with treatments in respect of scar height (T-12 weeks, V-21 weeks), vascularity (T-15 weeks, V-18 weeks) and pliability (T-15 weeks, V-21 weeks). The improvement in scar vascularity and pliability kept pace with decrease in scar height, in both the groups. There was not much difference in the rate of change of scar pigmentation with either drug but almost 60% patients in both the groups regained normal pigmentation. Our study adds to evidence of verapamil's capability in flattening the raised scars. With an extremely low cost and fewer adverse effects it deserves better positioning in the wide armamentarium against hypertrophic scars. It also offers several therapeutic possibilities to alternate with triamcinolone or be used simultaneously in larger (or multiple) scars.

Introduction

In plastic surgery, pathological scars like keloids and hypertrophic scars are considered illnesses. The pathological scar develops when fibroblasts proliferate uncontrollably within the wound and the deposition of an abundance of collagen fibers. This pathological change occurs after tissue injury healing. The skin surface is thicker than regular skin and is frequently characterized by pain, itching, swelling, and discomfort. Additionally, it frequently causes a significant load on people's mental and pathological health. Though keloids and hypertrophic scars can occur anywhere on the body, there are typically found on the front of the chest, the upper arms, the shoulder, the back, the earlobe, the belly, and the joints. It remains unclear what causes keloids and hypertrophic scars. Thus, there is no consensus on how best to manage this disease.

The primary treatments for pathological scars include surgery, radiotherapy, and drug injections. The local drug injections for pathological scar treatment typically include botulinum toxin A (BTA), triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), verapamil (VER), and bleomycin (BLM), but there are disputes about the choice and efficacy of these drugs. Therefore, how to effectively treat keloids is still a key clinical difficulty. Our findings may help guide physicians toward more effective scar treatments.

Steroids

Intralesional corticosteroid injections have been used to treat pathological scars since the mid-1960s, and they continue to play a primary role in the clinical management of HS and keloids. Evidence suggests that keloids regress 50–100% after corticosteroid injection; however, the rate of recurrence can be up to 50% after 5 years. The Updated International Clinical Recommendations on Scar Management recommend that intralesional corticosteroids be used as a second-line treatment for HS but as a first-line treatment for keloids. For HS, intralesional corticosteroids are an adjuvant to silicone treatment if a scar fails to improve after 2 months of silicone gel treatment or when the scar is severe or pruritic. Therefore, the administration of these steroids has occurred more often in keloid studies.

In addition to their well-described anti-inflammatory activity, the administration of corticosteroids promotes vascular dysfunction and EC death. Wu et al. reported that in situ injection of the corticosteroid triamcinolone promoted HS regression by downregulating VEGF expression. This mechanism underlies the use of glucocorticoids as a first-line therapy for the management of hemangiomas. In vitro studies have confirmed that dexamethasone and cortisol antagonize the development of endothelial sprouts and tube formation stimulated by PGF2a and VEGF. Further, prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids is toxic to ECs and triggers caspase-regulated cell death pathways. It is thought that the direct injection of glucocorticoids into scar tissue is effective, because it induces tissue necrosis by the same mechanism — inducing caspase-regulated cell death of ECs and vascular collapse.

There is currently a broad consensus that intralesional steroids are the preferred first-line therapy for treating isolated and small scars. However, due to the high incidence of recurrence, current clinical recommendations state that in situ steroid injections be combined with other modalities, such as PDL, irradiation, 5-FU, or cryotherapy. The rationale for this is to attenuate fibroblast proliferation and minimize recurrence.

### Scars: a review of emerging and currently available therapies [^114RaQBs]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

With the investigation and potential introduction of several novel scar-reducing therapies to the market within the next several years, it is germane to review both the pathophysiology of scarring and the safety and efficacy of currently available and emerging therapeutic agents.

Methods

An extensive review of the English-language literature was conducted using the MEDLINE database.

Results

A comprehensive review of the pathophysiology of scarring and scar management, including both emerging and currently available therapies, was completed. Current clinical studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of well-designed controls, and lack of standardized scar outcome measurement parameters.

Conclusions

A prominent challenge in the study of scar management is the paucity of well-designed, large, randomized, controlled studies examining existing scar-reducing techniques. The greatest improvement in scar-reducing protocols likely entails a polytherapeutic strategy for management. Further investigation into the role of inflammation in scarring is paramount to the development of improved scar-reducing agents. There is a need for large controlled trials using a polytherapeutic strategy that combines existing and novel agents to provide a standardized evidence-based evaluation of efficacy.

### Updated international clinical recommendations on scar management: part 1 – evaluating the evidence [^1154xhom]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is an ongoing need to standardize scar management by establishing safe and effective treatment options that can be applied in routine clinical practice.

Objective

To review available data on methods for preventing and treating cutaneous scarring.

Materials and Methods

Relevant scientific literature was identified through a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE database. Additional data and published studies were submitted for consideration by members of the International Advisory Panel on Scar Management.

Results

One of the most significant advances in scar management over the past 10 years has been the broader application of laser therapy, resulting in a shift in status from an emerging technology to the forefront of treatment. Accumulated clinical evidence also supports a greater role for 5-fluourouracil in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids, particularly in combination with intralesional corticosteroids. Encouraging data have been reported for newer therapies, including bleomycin, onion extract-containing preparations, imiquimod, and mitomycin C, although methodologic limitations in available studies merit consideration. In general, clinical and aesthetic outcomes seem to be enhanced by a combination approach to treatment.

Conclusion

Advances in therapeutic options and new study data necessitate a revision of algorithms for the prevention and management of cutaneous scarring.

### Keloid treatment: is there a role for acellular human dermis (alloderm)? [^114H4XSr]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Keloid management is faced with high recurrence rates. Keloid fibroblasts lack the normal negative feedback mechanism resulting in an exuberant scar formation. Alloderm doesn't undergo the same proliferative process as keloidal scar dermis.

Objective

To evaluate Alloderm as a treatment modality for keloids

Methods

A retrospective chart review of six patients with a total of eight large recurrent keloids was performed. Patients were treated with excision of the keloid followed by placement of Alloderm. Each patient was evaluated for recurrence and complications.

Results

During follow-up ranging from 1 month to 4(1/2) years there were 0% recurrences. Two out of 8 (25%) had residual induration. one of the two patients with residual induration, required an intralesional injection of kenalog at 6 months post-op.

Conclusion

Our results from this small study show that with the use of Alloderm after keloid excision, recurrence is low. Further study is warranted.

### Updated international clinical recommendations on scar management: part 2 – algorithms for scar prevention and treatment [^1164Aa9T]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 2002, an international advisory panel was convened to assess the scientific literature and develop evidence-based guidance for the prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring. Emerging clinical data, new treatment options, and technical advances warranted a renewed literature search and review of the initial advisory panel recommendations.

Objective

To update the management algorithm for pathologic scarring to reflect best practice standards at present.

Materials and Methods

Management recommendations were derived from clinical evidence amassed during a comprehensive literature search and from the clinical experience and consensus opinion of advisory panel members.

Results

A combination approach using multiple modalities provides the maximum potential for successful treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The advisory panel advocates a move toward more aggressive initial management of keloids, including earlier application of 5-fluorouracil. A growing body of clinical research supports a place in therapy for newer agents (e.g., bleomycin, onion extract, imiquimod, mitomycin C) and laser therapy (pulsed-dye, fractional) for scar management.

Conclusion

Prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring requires individualized care built upon the principles of evidence-based medicine and continues to evolve in step with technological and scientific advances.

### Triamcinolone acetonide, povidone iodine, isopropyl alcohol (P-care K80) [^111tYuXY]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Cases of serious anaphylaxis, including death, have been reported in individuals receiving triamcinolone acetonide injection, regardless of the route of administration.

Because Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, USP) are suspensions, they should not be administered intravenously.

Unless a deep intramuscular injection is given, local atrophy is likely to occur. (For recommendations on injection techniques, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Due to the significantly higher incidence of local atrophy when the material is injected into the deltoid area, this injection site should be avoided in favor of the gluteal area.

Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection are long-acting preparations, and are not suitable for use in acute stress situations.

To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with Kenalog-40 Injection or Kenalog-80 Injection and for a year afterwards.

Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including Kenalog -40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^113nDy68]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid Injection

Recent meta-analyses of four to 14 trials, a network meta-analysis of 23 trials, a systematic review of 11 studies, comprehensive reviews, and several new randomized controlled trials, show that intralesional corticosteroid can induce 50 to 100 percent regression of both hypertrophic scars and keloids. An international expert panel recommends triamcinolone acetonide at doses of 2.5 to 40 mg/site. The injections probably act by decreasing inflammatory cytokine production. However, disadvantages include injection-induced pain, systemic side effects (e.g. menstrual dysfunction, adrenocortical suppression, and cataracts and glaucoma), and local side effects (e.g. skin thinning and atrophy, steroid acne, capillary dilatation, and hypopigmentation).

Corticosteroid Tape and Plaster

Corticosteroid tape and plaster is a painless alternative to corticosteroid injections. When 60 hypertrophic scar and keloid patients were treated with fludroxycortide (weak steroid) tape, 20 percent of the 30 adults and 80 percent of the 30 children exhibited improved scar elevation and erythema and pruritus after 12 months. The strong pediatric response may reflect thinner skin. When the 24 nonresponsive adults were switched to deprodone propionate (stronger steroid) plaster, 70.8 percent demonstrated improved scar features after 6 months. Other observational studies and good clinical experiences with steroid tape and plaster have caused it to become a mainstay of scar-management protocols. Consequently, a Japanese guidelinerecently recommended that corticosteroid tape and plaster should be the first-line hypertrophic scar and keloid therapy. Figure 3 depicts a deprodone propionate plaster–treated hypertrophic scar. Tape and plaster should be used continuously as early as possiblefor at least 3 months. If unsuccessful, it should be replaced with stronger treatments.

Fig. 3.

A 50-year-old woman had several hypertrophic scars as a result of cesarean delivery. She was provided with deprodone propionate plaster and told to apply it 24 hours per day until further notice. She was instructed to peel it off while taking a bath and then reapply it. When the plaster lost its adhesiveness, it was replaced by a new plaster. After 6 months, the scar became soft. After 3 years, the scar became completely flat and its tone was close to that of the surrounding skin.

### ArteFill permanent injectable for soft tissue augmentation: II. indications and applications [^115aGBup]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Granuloma Formation

With third-generation ArteFill, true granuloma formation is a rare event and has not occurred to date in the more than 15,000 ArteFill patients treated in the U.S. The incidence of granuloma formation with the second-generation product Artecoll was 0.02% (1:5000), with manifestation from 6 months to 6 years after treatment. Granulomas can develop after the injection of any dermal filler at a rate of 0.01–1.0% but can be treated effectively with intralesional corticosteroid (Kenalog ®) injections. Granulomas are an overreaction of the body's cellular defense system. Therefore, surgical removal of true granulomas is the least one should consider since their borders are not confined and recurrences are almost predictable.

Treatment of Complications

Implant nodules, hypertrophic scarring, and misplaced ArteFill (Figs. 3, 19, and 26) react well to intralesional long-term crystalline corticosteroids. Local steroids inhibit fibroblast activity and collagen deposition, macrophage activity, and giant cell formation, as well as swelling, itching, and pain. A 1:1 mixture of lidocaine and triamcinolone = fluor-prednisolone (Kenalog ® or Volon-A ®) up to 20 mg/cc, or betamethasone (Diprosone ®) up to 5 mg/cc, can be injected safely through a 1-ml syringe with a Luer-lock and a 30G needle. The steroid must be injected strictly into the nodule while guiding the needle tip back and forth. Corticosteroids injected into the surrounding soft tissue, especially fat, may cause temporary or, rarely, permanent skin atrophy. Should atrophy occur, a temporary filler such as hyaluronic acid will level the indentation until natural recovery occurs, usually within 3–12 months.

### Efficacy of Nd: YAG laser and intralesional triamcinolone injection combination therapy in the postoperative management of keloids [^112x5GKG]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Keloids are characterized by scar protrusion, itching sensation, redness, and extension of lesion beyond the original site of skin damage. These lesions cause undue emotional stress and lower the quality of life of many patients. Unfortunately, the exact pathogenesis of keloids has not yet been clearly elucidated. Many hypotheses have been proposed including increased levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)- β and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, dysregulation of collagen turnover, fibroblast proliferation due to mechanical stretch, genetic immune dysfunction, and immune reaction to sebum. However, these hypotheses do not fully explain the development of keloids in every case.

Due to the unclear pathogenesis of keloids, no single, universally accepted treatment exists. Various treatment modalities have been proposed, including intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection (TAC), ablative and non-ablative laser therapies, compression garments, silicone gel and sheets, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, and surgical excision. Other intralesional therapies like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and bleomycin have also recently been introduced. Each of these treatments has its own strengths and limitations, and growing evidence supports a multimodal treatment over a single mode of treatment in the management of keloids.

Of these various treatment modalities, intralesional TAC remains the first-line therapy of keloids in many cases. Triamcinolone is known to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis via many different mechanisms. Side effects apart from injection-related pain include hypopigmentation, skin atrophy, and telangiectasis, but these often resolve without additional treatment. Systemic side effects like Cushing's syndrome are rare but still warrant attention.

Various laser therapies for keloids have been developed, albeit with mixed evidence. Laser treatment, typically less painful than intralesional injection, is recognized for both its therapeutic and preventive effects in keloid management. Nd:YAG 1064nm non-ablative laser is known to inhibit collagen synthesis in fibroblast cultures, and evidence supports its use in the clinical setting as well.

In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of combination therapy with intralesional TAC and Nd:YAG laser therapy compared with intralesional TAC monotherapy following surgical excision of keloids.

### Ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of triamcinolone acetonide for treating capsular contracture in patients with augmented and reconstructed breast [^112FFEwm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate ultrasound (US)-guided treatment of capsular contracture (CC) in patients with reconstructed/augmented breast.

Methods

Twenty-five patients with grade IV CC were treated with peri-implant US-guided injection of triamcinolone acetonide. Before/after treatment, maximum capsular thickness (MCT) was measured by ultrasound and pain assessed with visual analogue score (pain-VAS). Patients with pain relief at 1 month were considered early responders (ERs). Another injection was performed in patients without pain relief at 1 month (late responders, LRs).

Results

One patient (treated with chemo-radiotherapy) experienced severe pain and local reaction after the second injection, requiring surgery. Twenty-four patients had baseline MCT of 1.8 ± 0.3 mm and pain-VAS of 4.9 ± 0.5, the baseline MCT of 19 ERs (1.7 ± 0.2 mm) being significantly lower than that of 5 LRs (2.1 ± 0.2 mm) (p = 0.030). ERs had significantly reduced MCT and pain-VAS at one (1.1 ± 0.3 mm; 1.5 ± 0.5) and 6 months (1.1 ± 0.2 mm; 0.9 ± 0.7, respectively) (p < 0.001). At 1 month, LRs had a significantly reduced MCT (1.6 ± 0.1 mm, p = 0.042) but non-significantly changed pain-VAS (4.7 ± 0.2); 5 months later, MCT reached 1.0 ± 0.1 mm, pain-VAS reached 0.8 ± 0.5 (p < 0.044). Significant correlation between the relative variation of MCT and pain-VAS (1 month/baseline) was found.

Conclusions

US-guided injection of triamcinolone acetonide is effective in treating grade IV CC.

Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections

Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients receiving corticosteroids, including KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles:

- If a KENALOG-40- or KENALOG-80- treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

- If a KENALOG-40- or KENALOG-80-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80 use in the presence of such infections unless KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

### International clinical recommendations on scar management [^115r4D8Z]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Many techniques for management of hypertrophic scars and keloids have been proven through extensive use, but few have been supported by prospective studies with adequate control groups. Several new therapies showed good results in small-scale trials, but these have not been repeated in larger trials with long-term follow-up. This article reports a qualitative overview of the available clinical literature by an international panel of experts using standard methods of appraisal. The article provides evidence-based recommendations on prevention and treatment of abnormal scarring and, where studies are insufficient, consensus on best practice. The recommendations focus on the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids, and are internationally applicable in a range of clinical situations. These recommendations support a move to a more evidence-based approach in scar management. This approach highlights a primary role for silicone gel sheeting and intralesional corticosteroids in the management of a wide variety of abnormal scars. The authors concluded that these are the only treatments for which sufficient evidence exists to make evidence-based recommendations. A number of other therapies that are in common use have achieved acceptance by the authors as standard practice. However, it is highly desirable that many standard practices and new emerging therapies undergo large-scale studies with long-term follow-up before being recommended conclusively as alternative therapies for scar management.

### Comparing combination triamcinolone acetonide and 5-fluorouracil with monotherapy triamcinolone acetonide or 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of hypertrophic scars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yi9WD]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Keloids and hypertrophic scars cause physical and psychosocial problems. A combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) may enhance the treatment of pathologic scars, although the evidence base is limited. The authors compared the efficacy and complication rates of combination intralesional TAC and 5-FU with those of monotherapy intralesional TAC or 5-FU for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL were searched by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was treatment efficacy (51% to 100% improvement). Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results

Of 277 articles screened, 13 studies were included, comprising 12 randomized control trials and one nonrandomized study. Six studies compared combination intralesional therapy versus monotherapy 5-FU, and nine studies compared combination intralesional therapy versus monotherapy TAC. The combined group demonstrated superior objective treatment efficacy compared with the monotherapy TAC group (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.22 to 5.35; I² = 0%; P < 0.00001) and monotherapy 5-FU group (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 2.21 to 7.87; I² = 0%; P < 0.0001). Telangiectasia was less frequent in combination therapy (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.52; I² = 0%; P = 0.0003) compared with monotherapy TAC.

Conclusions

Combined intralesional TAC and 5-FU administration demonstrated superior treatment efficacy outcomes compared with monotherapy TAC or 5-FU. Patient-reported outcome measures should be incorporated in the design of future research to justify clinical recommendations.

Clinical Relevance Statement

Combined TAC and 5-FU has demonstrated superior treatment efficacy outcomes compared to monotherapy TAC or 5-FU in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids.

### Sonographically guided percutaneous intralesional triamcinolone injection: a new treatment for mammillary fistulas: preliminary results [^115jwHBx]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a new procedure, sonographically guided intralesional triamcinolone injection, for the treatment of mammillary fistulas. Six patients with mammillary fistulas were enrolled in this prospective study. Clinical improvement was rapid after the first triamcinolone injection. The initial response to treatment was assessed as complete in 4 cases, and the remaining 2 cases resolved successfully with additional injections. On the basis of the excellent results obtained in this study, it is thought that intralesional triamcinolone injection may be a good alternative to surgery.

### Efficacy and safety of verapamil vs triamcinolone acetonide for keloids and hypertrophic scars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116NUHna]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars remains a challenge. Although triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) is one of the most common and effective treatments for keloids and hypertrophic scars, TAC is not effective in some patients, and some may even experience adverse outcomes. Verapamil might be considered a safe alternative to TAC. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of verapamil and TAC for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars. Three databases (Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL database) were electronically searched from 1997 to December 2019. Article selection was limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Two authors independently assessed the selection of studies, risk of bias, and extracted the data. Mean differences (MDs) were computed for continuous variables, risk ratios (RRs) were computed for dichotomous variables, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for both assessments. Five RCTs were included, comprising a total of 215 patients (273 scars). Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) parameters (such as height, vascularity, pliability, and pigmentation) were reported as the outcome measures and provided detailed values in four studies. No significant differences were observed between verapamil and TAC in the reduction of height (MD 0.57, 95% CI -0.94 to 2.08, P = 0.46), vascularity (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.42 to 1.02, P = 0.41), pliability (MD 0.67, 95% CI -1.12 to 2.47, P = 0.46), and degree of pigmentation (MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.69, P = 0.61). Adverse outcomes were reported in four studies. The results showed that the incidence of telangiectasia and skin atrophy that used verapamil was significantly lower than that for TAC. Concerning the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars, even though verapamil was safer than TAC, TAC worked faster than verapamil. Furthermore, we did not find any clear evidence that verapamil was more or less effective than TAC. Considering the high degree of safety of verapamil, we suggest that verapamil might be used as an alternative treatment when TAC results in adverse outcomes.

Cardio-Renal

Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when they are used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS). All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.

Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients.

There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Amphotericin B injection and potassium- depleting agents).

Endocrine

Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment.

Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage.

Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosteroids, including KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

- Reduce resistance to new infections

- Exacerbate existing infections

- Increase the risk of disseminated infections

- Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections

- Mask some signs of infection

Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages.

Monitor for the development of infection and consider KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.

Do not administer KENALOG-40 and KENALOG-80 by an intraarticular, intrabursal, or intratendinous route in the presence of acute local infection.

Tuberculosis

If KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of the disease may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged KENALOG-40 or KENALOG-80 therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.

### Triamcinolone acetonide, povidone-iodine, isopropyl alcohol (P-care K40G) [^115QsbZ4]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Cases of serious anaphylaxis, including death, have been reported in individuals receiving triamcinolone acetonide injection, regardless of the route of administration.

Because Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, USP) are suspensions, they should not be administered intravenously.

Unless a deep intramuscular injection is given, local atrophy is likely to occur. (For recommendations on injection techniques, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Due to the significantly higher incidence of local atrophy when the material is injected into the deltoid area, this injection site should be avoided in favor of the gluteal area.

Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection are long-acting preparations, and are not suitable for use in acute stress situations. To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with Kenalog-40 Injection or Kenalog-80 Injection and for a year afterwards.

Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.

The literature on keloids is replete with authors expressing frustration with treatment results. Triamcinolone is effective in shrinking keloids and preventing their recurrence following excision, if delivered successfully. Strategies for effective delivery of drug are presented: recommended needle size, use of metal syringe, slow injection to avoid skin rupture, and delayed withdrawal of needle after injection. The futility of expecting pedunculated keloids to be completely flattened by steroid injection alone is mentioned.

### Concerns about the discontinuation of triamcinolone acetonide in the management of keloid and hypertrophic scars [^115BBp9U]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), a synthetic glucocorticoid, is commonly administered as an intralesional injection for patients who present in our clinics with keloid or hypertrophic scars (HTS). The use of TAC (i.e. Adcortyl® or Kenalog® supplied by Bristol-Myers-Squibb) for this purpose is also supported by many studies. 1 It therefore comes with great disappointment to learn the decision from Department of Health and Social Care to withdraw the license for use of Adcortyl® and Kenalog® in the UK, especially as there are limited studies evaluating the suitability of alternatives. 1,3 However, we encourage the investigation into the potential therapeutic effects of benzyl alcohol (15mg/ml), an excipient in Adcortyl® and Kenalog®, in the treatment of keloids and HTS in the future. 5.

### Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars [^116iJEj1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Each year, in high-income countries alone, approximately 100 million people develop scars. Excessive scarring can cause pruritus, pain, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement, and can dramatically affect people's quality of life, both physically and psychologically. Hypertrophic scars are visible and elevated scars that do not spread into surrounding tissues and that often regress spontaneously. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical-grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for hypertrophic scars.

Objectives

To assess the effects of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of hypertrophic scars in any care setting.

Search Methods

In April 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any hypertrophic scars and assessed the use of SGS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary.

Main Results

Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 60 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow-up, and scar site. We report 10 comparisons, SGS compared with no SGS treatment and SGS compared with the following treatments: pressure garments; silicone gel; topical onion extract; polyurethane; propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting; Kenalog injection; flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser; intense pulsed light and Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). Six trials had a split-site design and three trials had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). Included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcomes of severity of scarring measured by health professionals and adverse events (limited data reported by some included studies, but further analyses of these data was not possible) and no data were reported for severity of scarring reported by patients. For secondary outcomes some pain data were reported, but health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness were not reported. Many trials had poorly-reported methodology, meaning the risk of bias was unclear. We rated all evidence as being either of low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, all in single studies. SGS compared with no SGS Seven studies with 177 participants compared SGS with no SGS for hypertrophic scars. Two studies with 31 participants (32 scars) reported severity of scarring assessed by health professionals, and it is uncertain whether there is a difference in severity of scarring between the two groups (mean difference (MD) -1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.77 to 0.12; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for serious imprecision). One study with 34 participants suggests SGS may result in a slight reduction in pain level compared with no SGS treatment (MD -1.26, 95% CI -2.26 to -0.26; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). SGS compared with pressure garments One study with 54 participants was included in this comparison. The study reported that SGS may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.99 to -0.81; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). SGS compared with silicone gel One study with 32 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with silicone gel (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.88 to 1.68; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, twice for imprecision). SGS compared with topical onion extract One trial (32 participants) was included in this comparison. SGS may slightly reduce severity of scarring compared with topical onion extract (MD -1.30, 95% CI -2.58 to -0.02; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and once for imprecision). SGS compared with polyurethane One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on the severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with polyurethane (MD 0.50, 95% CI -2.96 to 3.96; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for imprecision). SGS compared with self-adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting One study with 38 participants was included in this comparison. It is uncertain if SGS reduces pain compared with self-adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.06). This is very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for imprecision and once for indirectness. SGS compared with Gecko Nanoplast One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast (MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.28 to 1.68; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. There was a lack of reportable data from the other three comparisons of SGS with Kenalog injection, flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser or intense pulsed light.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. None of the included studies provided evidence on severity of scarring validated by participants, health-related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision-making in the use of SGS to treat hypertrophic scars.

Interventional Approaches

Trigger Point Injection

Prior to the use of injections with corticosteroids, various trigger point injections with local anesthetics and clonidine can be used as potential treatment options. In one study by Glynn et. al, the use of epidural clonidine for the management of surgical scar pain was studied and used. In the study, the use of clonidine at a dose of 150mcg provided equal pain relief for a longer duration when compared to the use of 5mg of morphine. Additionally, trigger point injections with anesthetics are also potential treatment options for painful scar syndrome. A study by Papayannis et al discusses a case series where four patients were treated with 1% lidocaine up to 20mg to treat post-surgical scar tissue pain after various procedures. In this case, the intensity of pain was reduced for all patients post-injection as well as during the 3-month follow-up visit. Both the use of trigger point injections with local anesthetics as well and clonidine are potential treatment options to treat painful scar syndrome.

Corticosteroid Injection

Corticosteroid injection of a painful scar can diminish pruritus and pain. The mechanism is the inhibition of fibroblast growth and decreasing alpha-2 macroglobulin levels, which leads to collagen degradation. Depending on the amount, high dosing of corticosteroid may lead to hypopigmentation, dermal atrophy, telangiectasias, necrosis, and ulceration. Long-acting synthetic glucocorticoids such as triamcinolone are used. Synthetic topical steroids have been applied. Most clinical improvements noted in aesthetic improvements with minimal reporting on pain reduction.

Botox Injection

Botulism toxin inhibits acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerves in the skin and is thought to decrease the stimulation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors through calcitonin gene-related peptide release. Botulism toxin impacts the release of peptides from mast cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblastic concentrations, to reduce scar formation. One systematic review of literature from 1996 to 2014 of ten studies showed significant improvement in cosmetic outcomes with one study showing improvement in visual analogue scale. Concerns exist in methodological heterogeneity, lack of control groups, and subjective scales of measurement that make it challenging to conclude the benefit of botulism toxin for a painful scar. This is recommended by the French neuropathic pain recommendations as a second-line therapy, alongside high-concentration capsaicin.

### Triamcinolone acetonide, bupivacaine hcl, lidocaine hcl, sodium chloride, povidone iodine, isopropyl alcohol (P-care K40MX) [^117TmMQU]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Cases of serious anaphylaxis, including death, have been reported in individuals receiving triamcinolone acetonide injection, regardless of the route of administration.

Because Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, USP) are suspensions, they should not be administered intravenously.

Unless a deep intramuscular injection is given, local atrophy is likely to occur. (For recommendations on injection techniques, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Due to the significantly higher incidence of local atrophy when the material is injected into the deltoid area, this injection site should

be avoided in favor of the gluteal area.

Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection are long-acting preparations, and are not suitable for use in acute stress situations.

To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with Kenalog-40 Injection or Kenalog-80 Injection and for a year afterwards.

Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.

### Triamcinolone reduces seroma re-accumulation in the extended latissimus dorsI donor site [^113gmj47]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of donor site seroma after autologous latissimus dorsi (ALD) breast reconstruction is in the order of 70%. In the majority of cases the seroma recurs following an initial aspiration. We designed a double-blind randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that an intracavity injection of the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid triamcinolone would inhibit seroma re-accumulation.

Methods

We recruited 52 ALD breast reconstructions in 49 patients, of whom 41 involved immediate reconstruction and 11 delayed reconstruction. Patients exhibiting seromas at their first postoperative visit were randomised to receive either intracavity triamcinolone 80 mg (Group A, n = 29) or saline (Group B, n = 23), following seroma aspiration. We recorded the incidence of wound complications, total time (days) and number/volume of subsequent aspirations to dryness.

Results

Triamcinolone significantly reduced the need for any further aspiration (A = 16/29, B = 22/23), total number of aspirations (A: median = 1, interquartile range = 0–1; B: median = 4, interquartile range = 2–5; P < 0.0001), total volume aspirated (A: median = 30 ml, interquartile range = 0–80; B: median = 325 ml, interquartile range = 199–550; P < 0.0001), and total time to dryness (A: median = 12 days, interquartile range 7–17; B: median = 37 days, interquartile range 20–49; P < 0.0001). The incidence of adjuvant chemotherapy (A = 16/29, B = 9/23) and radiotherapy (A = 16/29, B = 10/23) was similar, and there was no effect upon donor site complications (Group A = 4/29, Group B = 2/23, P = 0.725). The mean follow-up time for patients in the steroid group was 264 days compared to 254 days for those in the placebo group. Steroid injections were well tolerated, and there were no infective complications.

Conclusion

Following initial aspiration, intracavity injection of triamcinolone significantly reduced seroma re-accumulation after ALD breast reconstruction.

### Manual fractional technology with COLaser combined with transdermal drug delivery for hypertrophic scar: a retrospective study [^115BhbMc]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

MFT with CO 2 laser combined with transdermal delivery of triamcinolone acetonide and 5-FU offers advantages such as convenience, high efficiency, minimal invasiveness, and superior clinical outcomes. Patient satisfaction rates could achieve 83.34%. For patients concerned about the significant trauma and high costs associated with traditional surgical resection, this combined treatment modality offers a more cost-effective and widely accessible alternative, aligning with the growing preference for minimally invasive or non-invasive procedures in modern surgical practice.

This study indicates that MFT with CO 2 laser combined with transdermal triamcinolone acetonide and 5-FU is effective. As there is currently limited literature on MFT with CO 2 laser, further clinical studies are necessary to establish standardized protocols. In this study, we have retrospectively reviewed and summarized the treatment parameters employed (Table 5). However, further optimization of drug concentration, laser parameters, and other specifics is necessary. Conducted as a retrospective study with a limited sample size, some patients experienced varied treatment intervals, introducing potential limitations. Future randomized controlled trials will incorporate different drug dosages or laser parameters to identify the optimal treatment regimen. Increasing the sample size and employing more objective parameters will ensure the accuracy and clinical applicability of the findings. A 6-month follow-up period sufficiently encompasses the rapid proliferative phase of hypertrophic scar formation. However, further investigation is necessary to evaluate long-term complications and recurrence rates.

### Comparison of fractional COLaser, verapamil, and triamcinolone for the treatment of keloid [^112rJL5u]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: Scar biology is a territory less understood. The search for ideal treatment of keloid continues. The aim of this study was to compare the role of CO 2 laser, triamcinolone (TAC), and verapamil in the treatment of keloid. Approach: A randomized parallel-group study was conducted in which 60 patients were randomly allocated to three groups from May 2017 to April 2018. First group received fractional CO 2 laser therapy, second group received triamcinolone, and third group received intralesional verapamil. Outcomes were evaluated using Vancouver scar scale score at 3 weekly intervals for 6 months. Results: There was a reduction in scar height, vascularity, and pliability in all the three groups. However, pigmentation was not completely resolved by any of the three modalities. The response was fastest in case of triamcinolone followed by verapamil and laser, which was statistically significant. There was reduction in pain and pruritus in all the three groups and lesser injection site pain with verapamil. There was some amount of charring with CO 2 laser. Innovation: Our study provides evidence that TAC has the fastest response in treating keloids when compared to other modalities. Scar pigmentation is the parameter that is not completely resolved by TAC, verapamil, or CO 2 laser. Conclusion: The study revealed that fractional CO 2 laser and verapamil are as efficient as triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) for treating keloids, except it takes longer for laser and verapamil to act compared to TAC. Verapamil can be used as an alternative treatment modality that is cost-effective with minimal adverse effects.

### Comparative evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and safety of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection vs intralesional radiofrequency with intralesional triamcinolone acetonide in treatment of keloids [^116jkzqr]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of keloid is difficult, so there is always a need for adequate and effective therapy. In this study, we explored and compared the efficacy and synergistic effect of combined intralesional radiofrequency (RF) and intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) with intralesional triamcinolone acetonide alone in the treatment of keloids. Sixty patients with keloid were divided in two groups of 30 patients each. In both groups total six sittings every 3weeks and post treatment follow-up every 6weeks was done. In group A, intralesional TAC was given. In group B, intralesional radiofrequency followed by triamcinolone was injected. In this study, there were 29 males and 31 females. In groups A and B, 73.4% and 80% of the patients, respectively, achieved grade 4 improvement at the end of 33weeks, but there was greater mean POSAS score decline in group B in comparison with group A at each visit compared to baseline. Six patients in group A while three in group B showed recurrence. Side effects were equal in number in both groups Thus both the studied modalities of treatment produced equal efficacy and safety but with less recurrence in group B.

### Complication rates from otoplasty at a tertiary facial plastic surgery center: a retrospective analysis [^117ARCRw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Concerning postoperative complications, we reported that 12/44 (14.11%) patients had post-otoplasty complications with the total number of reported complications among the operated ears being 17/85 (20%). Three patients had 2 different complications at the same time, and 2 patients had bilateral complications. This percentage of overall complications is similar to what has been found in other studies.

Recurrence was the most common complication in our study, reported in 4 (4.70%) ears and 4 (9.09%) patients: 3 in the right and 1 in the left side. Two of these patients underwent uneventful revision surgery, and the other 2 patients denied any further interventions. Notably, 3 out of the 4 patients who experienced recurrence complications were adults, and 1 of them was a smoker. In our case, the recurrence rate was slightly higher than that reported by Sadhra et al, who published a systematic review of otoplasty complications in 2017 and reported a recurrence rate of 5%.

Hypertrophic scars were seen in 3 (3.52%) ears and 2 (4.54%) patients, both of which were mild and did not require intervention, and overall patient satisfaction was good. One patient with bilateral hypertrophic scars was an adult and a smoker, and the other patient was a child, both of whom had type 4 Fitzpatrick skin. Our hypertrophic scar complication rate is slightly higher than those reported by Binet et al.

Keloid complications were reported bilaterally in 2 (2.35%) patients and unilaterally in 1 (2.27%) patient and was the most difficult complication to treat. The patients were managed with the standard 4 cycles of triamcinolone acetonide intralesional injection (Kenacort) followed by surgical excision and intraoperative intralesional 5-fluorouracil injection and application. Kenacort injection, 5-fluorouracil, and silicone gel were started 4 weeks postoperatively for a total of 5 cycles (at 2 weeks intervals) with good results and there was no recurrence for 1 year (Fig. 1).

Other Hypertrophic Scar Therapies

Other therapies have been proposed for hypertrophic scars. Some may also be suitable for keloids. The evidence level is generally low. One is adipose tissue transplantation by using lipotransfer and lipoinjection techniques. A recent reviewnoted that adipose-derived stem cells can secrete trophic factors that alter fibrotic and remodeling mediator expression. The evidence is too limited to justify changes in clinical practice. A recent reviewof case series studies showed that cryotherapy is safe and achieves good scar reduction, albeit with some adverse effects (depigmentation, recurrence, pain).

Recent meta-analyses and reviewsshow that 5-fluorouracil injections are effective as a monotherapy but reduce hypertrophic scar and keloid elevation and erythema better when combined with triamcinolone acetonide injections. Intralesional botulinum toxin type A (Botox; Allergan, Inc. Dublin, Ireland) injections may improve and prevent hypertrophic scars and keloids by suppressing scar tension and fibroblast activities. Recent randomized controlled trials, show that postsurgical Botox injections prevent hypertrophic scar development. A meta-analysis of 14 studiesshowed that, compared to placebo, Botox injections significantly improved hypertrophic scar and keloid appearance and width.

A meta-analysisof five trials showed that bleomycin injections improved hypertrophic scars and keloids more effectively than triamcinolone acetonide and/or 5-fluorouracil injections. A 14-study review on topical onion extract gel (a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) reported that 11 detected beneficial effects on hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Oral tranilast (an antiallergic drug) improves inflammatory diseases with few adverse effects. It has long been used in Japan to treat hypertrophic scars and keloids.– Randomized controlled trials showed that tranilast improved hypertrophic scars and keloids and reduced the redness of new postsurgical hypertrophic scars.

### Enhanced scar reduction with triamcinolone acetonide and botulinum toxin A combination therapy compared to botulinum toxin A monotherapy: a translational pilot study [^114E9kwJ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of combining triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) and botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in treating hypertrophic scars and keloids remains unclear.

Objectives

This pilot study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of BTX-A monotherapy and TAC + BTX-A combination therapy in improving scar conditions and to investigate potential mechanisms using a rat burn scar model.

Methods

This study was conducted between March 2022 and December 2024. Each patient's scar was randomly divided into two equal parts, with one part receiving TAC + BTX-A and the other BTX-A alone for three sessions at four-week intervals. Scar thickness was measured using calipers, and the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was used to assess scar condition. Pain and itchiness were evaluated using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), respectively, before each intervention (V1, V2, V3) and four weeks after the last session (V4). In the animal study, rats with burn scars were assigned to five groups: sham, untreated burn, TAC, BTX-A, and TAC + BTX-A. Scar thickness and expressions of α-SMA, TGF-β, CTGF, collagen I/III, laminin, and fibronectin were analyzed histologically.

Results

Clinically, both therapies reduced scar thickness, VSS, NRS, and VAS scores. However, combination therapy showed superior reductions in scar thickness (V2-V4) and VSS scores (V3, V4) compared to BTX-A monotherapy. No significant differences were observed in NRS and VAS scores. The animal study confirmed that combination therapy more effectively reduced scar thickness, TGF-β and CTGF levels, and the collagen I/III ratio, while increasing the laminin/fibronectin ratio.

Conclusions

TAC + BTX-A combination therapy enhances scar reduction by more effectively suppressing fibroblast proliferation and activation through TGF-β and CTGF downregulation, promoting scar remodeling.

### Update on scar management: guidelines for treating Asian patients [^116rcH7d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Following injury, Asian skin has a tendency towards hyper-pigmentation and scar formation, and therefore the prevention of scarring is particularly important in Asian patients. Since publication of an International Clinical Recommendation on Scar Management in 2002, there have been numerous publications in the field of scar management. Advances in understanding scar formation have also led to the introduction of new treatments as well as a better understanding of established therapeutic options.

Methods

A literature search for abstracts, clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating scar prevention and treatment was performed using PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Based on this data a panel of experts formulated treatment recommendations for Asian patients.

Results

Following surgery, scar prevention should be initiated in all Asian patients due to the high risk of poor scars. There is strong evidence for the efficacy of silicone based products, and due to their ease of use, they can be considered first-line therapy. Silicone gel (versus silicone gel sheets) products have demonstrated efficacy. For patients who fail to respond to first-line therapy, intralesional steroid injections, radiation therapy, and intralesional 5-flourouracil injections have achieved widespread acceptance. Laser treatments have been increasingly used, although the evidence remains largely anecdotal without a clear consensus on optimal wavelength, or amount of energy. Surgical approaches have increased in sophistication with recognition of the impact that tension has on scar formation.

Conclusion

Updated scar management recommendations will benefit practitioners making decisions regarding optimal, evidence-based treatment strategies for their patients.

### Comparative efficacy and recurrence risk of intralesional therapies for hypertrophic scars and keloids: a network meta-analysis [^112kmsFi]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic scars and keloids are fibroproliferative disorders arising from aberrant wound healing, often leading to aesthetic disfigurement, functional impairment, and psychosocial burden. Intralesional therapies remain a mainstay of treatment, yet the comparative efficacy and recurrence profiles of different agents have not been definitively established. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), Cochrane Library (Wiley, Hoboken, NJ), US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and Google Scholar (Alphabet, Inc, Mountain View, CA) from inception through May 2025, restricted to English-language publications, to identify randomized controlled trials comparing two or more intralesional treatments for hypertrophic scars or keloids. Twenty-four eligible trials were included in a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis integrating direct and indirect comparisons. Pooled estimates demonstrated that triamcinolone acetonide combined with 5-fluorouracil (TAC+5-FU) achieved the most consistent improvements in treatment efficacy and recurrence control. Botulinum toxin A (BTA) ranked highest in treatment response but did not significantly reduce recurrence risk. Verapamil (VER) was associated with significantly lower efficacy compared with TAC, whereas bleomycin (BLM) and 5-FU monotherapies provided intermediate outcomes without statistical superiority. Overall, TAC+5-FU offered the most favorable balance between efficacy and recurrence reduction, while BTA showed strong response efficacy. These findings provide a comprehensive synthesis of intralesional therapies for hypertrophic scars and keloids, support the consideration of combination regimens in scar management, and underscore the need for further well-designed head-to-head trials with standardized endpoints to refine individualized treatment strategies.

### Efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide combined with botulinum toxin A in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a meta-analysis [^113o8xVX]. Burns (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triamcinolone acetonide (TCA) combined with botulinum toxin type A (BTA) for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Methods

A comprehensive search of randomized controlled trials published before September 2023 was conducted across the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. The analysis involved calculating pooled weighted mean difference (WMD), pooled risk ratios (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Inclusive of 11 studies with a total of 561 patients, the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the effective rate between the BTA+ TCA and control groups (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.14–1.44). Moreover, BTA+ TCA demonstrated a significant improvement in Visual Analog Scale scores (WMD = -1.69, 95% CI = -2.72 - -0.66) and Vancouver Scar Scale scores (WMD = -1.46, 95% CI = -1.90 - -1.02) compared to the control group. However, no statistically significant difference in scar thickness was observed between the BTA+ TCA and control groups (WMD = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.30–0.09).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis showed that the combined use of BTA and TCA demonstrates high effectiveness in scar treatment, but its influence on scar thickness is limited. Future research should further explore the sources of heterogeneity and validate the long-term effects and safety of this therapy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for keloids and hypertrophic scars, more specifically with respect to management of inadequate response, AAFP 2009 guidelines recommend to offer combination therapy (surgery, silicone sheeting, and corticosteroid injections) as a second-line option when first-line treatments for keloids and hypertrophic scars fail.

### Efficacy of Nd: YAG laser and intralesional triamcinolone injection combination therapy in the postoperative management of keloids [^1144BFxY]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Keloids, characterized by protruding scars that extend beyond the original skin damage site, cause significant emotional stress and reduced quality of life. Their exact pathogenesis remains unclear, with various hypotheses including growth factor imbalances and extracellular matrix changes. No single treatment is universally accepted, but multiple modalities like triamcinolone acetonide injection (TAC), laser therapies, and surgery are commonly used.

Methods

This retrospective study involved East Asian patients who underwent keloid scar excision between March 2019 and June 2022. Patients were divided into two groups: one receiving only TAC injections and the other a combination of TAC and Nd:YAG laser therapy. The efficacy of treatments was evaluated using the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), with follow-ups at six and twelve months after operation.

Results

The study involved 111 patients. Both treatment groups showed significant improvements in mVSS and POSAS scores, but the combination therapy group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in POSAS scores and lower recurrence rates at 12 months compared to the TAC-only group. However, there was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between the groups.

Conclusion

Dual therapy involving TAC injection and Nd:YAG laser treatment was more effective than TAC injection alone for managing keloid scars after surgery. This combination therapy showed better outcomes in preventing keloid recurrence and improving scar status at 12 months after operation, along with significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes.

### Recurrence and complications of peri-operative steroid injection of keloids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Xbt42]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Keloid scars are a particularly challenging fibroproliferative wound healing disorder with a variety of proposed management approaches including concurrent surgery and intralesional steroid injection. We aimed to identify the optimum time for triamcinolone injection of keloids, by comparing the recurrence and complication occurrence in patients who received pre-, intra- or post-operative injection. Studies reporting on the rate of recurrence and complication occurrence following treatment of keloid scarring with concurrent surgical excision and intralesional steroid injection were identified from the PubMed, Web of science and Embase databases. The I-squared (I 2) statistic was used to quantify the variability in study estimates due to heterogeneity and to determine whether the fixed or random effect models will be employed. Publication bias was visualized through funnel plots and tested with the Egger's test. We found that the recurrence rate was significantly lower with post-operative injection compared to intra-operative injection (p < 0.001) and pre-operative injection (p = 0.009). A significant difference between intra-operative and pre-operative injection was not found (p = 0.46). In conclusion, post-operative steroid injection after surgical excision results in lower keloid recurrence compared to pre- and intra-operative injection.

### Combining scar-modulating agents for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a systematic review [^115pvsCj]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Injury to the skin can cause abnormal wound healing and continuous inflammation that leads to the formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids. These lesions often cause significant negative impact on a patient's life due to aesthetic, physical, social, and psychological consequences. Numerous treatment modalities exist for these hypertrophic scars and keloids, which include silicone sheeting, pressure garments, intralesional injection/topical application of scar-modulating agents, laser therapy, and surgical excision. Due to increased efficacy, an evolving treatment paradigm encourages the use of multiple treatment modalities instead of one treatment modality. However, no gold standard treatment exists for these lesions, leaving many people with unsatisfactory results. Adding scar-modulating agents such as 5-Fluorouracil, bleomycin, or Botulinum Toxin A to triamcinolone monotherapy has emerged as a potential drug combination for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids. We sought to critically analyze the evidence that exists for the use of more than one scar-modulating agent. This was done by conducting a systematic review to determine the efficacy of these combined drug regimens. We found that many of these combinations show evidence of increased efficacy and fewer/similar adverse events to triamcinolone monotherapy. Triamcinolone and 5-Fluorouracil showed the strongest and most consistent evidence out of all combinations. With this review, we intend to encourage more research into unique drug combinations that may improve outcomes for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic scars or keloids.

### Long-term improvement in the appearance of hypertrophic scars following a single treatment with acoustic subcision – A single center proof-of-concept study [^113L1PVY]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparisons with other hypertrophic scar treatments

Ogawareported that randomized clinical trials show that intralesional corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide TAC or ILK) can induce 50%–100% regression (in adults) of both hypertrophic scars and keloids. Associated side effects include injection‐induced pain, systemic and local effects.

Haurani et al.conducted a prospective study on 24 patients with hypertrophic scars. They received intralesional injections with 50 mg of 5‐FU (50 mg/ml) and 10 mg of 1% lidocaine, once monthly for 10 consecutive months. A 65% reduction in scar volume was noted in all patients at the end of the treatment. Moreover, 86% of patients had partial or complete resolution of symptoms, which included pruritus, pain, and pressure.

Tanzi and Alsterstated "Significant improvement in hypertrophic scars is generally noted within [2] PDL [585 nm pulsed dye laser] treatments". Side effects include purpura and swelling, and patients should avoid sun exposure.

Acoustic subcision treatment results of > 55% improvement in scar height and volume and a mean of 80% of participants reporting improvement in symptoms is similar to results seen with current common treatments discussed above. The advantage of acoustic subcision over these common treatments is that acoustic subcision is noninvasive, with only mild pain during treatment requiring no anesthetics, that results in significant improvement after a single treatment with clinically meaningful symptom reduction.

Hypertrophic scars can resolve over time without treatment. The scars in this study were 2.2–3.6 years old and had never been treated. Ten of 11 scars showed statistically significant improvement 12 weeks after a single acoustic subcision treatment (p = 0.0025 for height, p = 0.0024 for volume). The authors believe that this is unlikely to be a coincidental occurrence of spontaneous remission of all 10 scars within 3 months of treatment when all had been stable for at least 2 years.

Limitations of this study include a small sample size, lack of a control group, all white participants, a single treatment session, and no keloid, burn or contracture scars were enrolled. Future research is planned to include more diverse participants and scar types, additional treatments per participant, and some form of control cohort. An additional study is planned to collect punch biopsy samples preacoustic and postacoustic subcision treatment to obtain histology to document that human scar fibrosis is indeed disrupted by acoustic subcision treatment as hypothesized by the authors.

### A one-time pneumatic jet-injection of 5-fluorouracil and triamcinolone acetonide for treatment of hypertrophic scars – A blinded randomized controlled trial [^114C6nmg]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with hypertrophic scars (HTS) risk reduced quality of life due to itching, pain, poor cosmesis, and restriction of movement. Despite good clinical efficacy, patients are often reluctant to undergo repeated needle injections due to pain or needle phobia.

Objectives

To evaluate the applicability of needle-free pneumatic jet injection (PJI) and assess changes in hypertrophic scars following a single PJI treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and triamcinolone acetonide (TAC).

Methods

Twenty patients completed this blinded, randomized, controlled, split-scar trial. The intervention side of the HTS received a one-time treatment with PJIs containing a mixture of TAC+5-FU injected at 5mm intervals (mean 7 PJI per HTS); the control side received no treatment. Assessments were made at baseline and 4 weeks posttreatment. Outcome measures included change in (1) Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) total score and subscores, (2) scar volume and surface area assessed by three-dimensional imaging, (3) skin microarchitecture measured by optical-coherence tomography (OCT), (4) photo-assessed scar cosmesis (0–100), (5) patient-reported pain and satisfaction (0–10), and (6) depiction of drug biodistribution after PJI.

Results

PJI with TAC+5-FU significantly decreased both HTS height (-1 VSS; p = 0.01) and pliability (-1 VSS; p < 0.01) with a nonstatistically significant reduction of -1 in total VSS score (0 in control; p = 0.09). On 3D imaging, a 33% decrease in scar volume (p = 0.016) and a 37% decrease in surface area (p = 0.008) was observed. OCT indicated trends towards smoother scar surface (Ra 11.1–10.3; p = 0.61), normalized dermal microarchitecture (attenuation coefficient: 1.52–1.68; p = 0.44), and a reduction in blood flow between 9% and 17% (p = 0.50–0.79). Despite advances in VSS subscores and OCT, no improved photo-assessed cosmesis was found (-3.2 treatment vs. -1.4 control; p = 0.265). Patient-reported pain was low (2/10) and 90% of the patients that had previously received needle injections preferred PJI to needle injection. Depositions of TAC+FU were imaged reaching deep into the scar at levels corresponding to the reticular dermis.

Conclusion

A single PJI injection containing 5-FU and TAC can significantly improve the height and pliability of HTS. PJI is favored by the patients and may serve as a complement to conventional needle injections, especially for patients with needle phobia.

### An update on the surgical management of pterygium and the role of loteprednol etabonate ointment [^111AKXMp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Strict attention should be paid to concomitant dry eye, in which case ipsilateral punctal occlusion, with a temporary collagen, long-lasting silicone, or even using electrocautery, should be strongly considered. Additional environmental, nutritional, and topical preservative-free tear replacement therapeutic measures to support dry eye therapy are also extremely important. LE suspension, gel, and ointment, are preferred choices for superficial punctate keratitis and dry eye.

Because pterygia are both actinic and inflammatory in nature, progressive or recurrent degeneration can be avoided with aggressive UV protection and anti-inflammatory therapy. First, a subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog ®; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY, USA) injection can be given immediately postoperatively in the operating room. Second, the patient must be warned to never expose the eyes to sunlight without wraparound UV sunglasses protection. Baseball-style caps, golf shades, or bonnet-style hats are also very useful. Third, aggressive postoperative application of topical steroids constitutes the mainstay of antirecurrence inflammation control and helps avoid scarring and neovascularization. Topical steroids should continue until all the signs of hypervascularity have vanished. The initial therapy with topical LE suspension or gel up to QID and LE ointment at bedtime is prescribed until the eye is completely "quiet", all hemorrhage has resolved, full comfort is restored, and all vasculature has returned to normal caliber. This may require up to 3 months in routine cases or much longer in complicated or high-recurrence-risk cases. Once the desired level of anti-inflammatory control has been achieved, the daytime LE treatment can be discontinued and the preservative-free ointment sustained at night (for up to 1 year postoperatively). This ensures compliance and avoids the appearance of limbal vascular tufts that lead to recurrence. For patients who experience difficulty with ointments, the mucoadhesive gel formulation provides sustained exposure to LE throughout the night as well as during waking hours.

### Within-patient, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide injections for the treatment of hypertrophic scar in adult burn survivors [^115WuANE]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Intralesional corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide [TAC]) injections have become one of the cornerstone treatments of hypertrophic scar (HSc). However, the evidence is of limited-quality, and published investigations have almost exclusively been performed in linear scars rather than hypertrophic burn scars. Thus, the aim of this study was to perform an appropriately powered, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of TAC injections on burn HSc compared with patient-matched usual care control scars. Fifty burn survivors with two scars (separated by nonscarred skin preferably on the contralateral side or an anatomically similar site) were selected based on high-frequency ultrasound thickness (> 2.034 mm to ensure that the site was outside of the range of normal scar). Pretreatment thickness measurements of the two sites were within 0.5 mm of each other, to ensure homogeneity and an erythema index > 300 to establish they were immature HSc. The sites were randomly assigned to treatment or control. The treatment HSc received a 10 mg/ml TAC. When necessary, the injection was repeated after 6 weeks and a third final injection 6 weeks later. Objective evaluation of thickness, elasticity, erythema, and melanin was obtained at the treatment and control sites at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up 6 weeks after the last injection. Thirty participants completed the study, reaching the required number for an adequately powered sample based on pilot study data analyses. Ten participants received only one injection, 27 received only two injections, and 13 received three injections of TAC. Analysis of covariance comparing the treatment vs control HSc posttreatment, controlling for pretreatment values and Fitzpatrick skin type, revealed a significant decrease in thickness and increase in elasticity of the treated compared with control HSc (P = 0.0003), but no significant difference in erythema or melanin. Pretreatment to posttreatment comparisons using paired t-tests revealed a significant decrease in thickness of both the treated and control HSc, an increase in elasticity of the treated HSc during the treatment period, but no significant change in the control HSc elasticity or erythema of either site, and a significant increase in melanin of both the treated (P < .001) and control (P = 0.02) HSc. A regression model for repeated measures, controlling for pretreatment values and skin type, revealed no significant change in thickness, elasticity, erythema, or melanin during the 6-week follow-up. Although thickness decreased at both the treated and control HSc across time, there was a significantly greater reduction at the TAC injected HSc and a significantly greater increase in elasticity. Melanin significantly increased at both the treatment and control site. There was no significant change during the follow-up period of any of the HSc characteristics.

### Triamcinolone acetonide, povidone-iodine, isopropyl alcohol (P-care K40) [^113zqH2U]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Cases of serious anaphylaxis, including death, have been reported in individuals receiving triamcinolone acetonide injection, regardless of the route of administration.

Because Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, USP) are suspensions, they should not be administered intravenously.

Unless a deep intramuscular injection is given, local atrophy is likely to occur. (For recommendations on injection techniques, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Due to the significantly higher incidence of local atrophy when the material is injected into the deltoid area, this injection site should be avoided in favor of the gluteal area.

Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection are long-acting preparations, and are not suitable for use in acute stress situations.

To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with Kenalog-40 Injection or Kenalog-80 Injection and for a year afterwards.

Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including Kenalog-40 Injection and Kenalog-80 Injection, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.
