## Question

Gabapentin raise estrogen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gabapentin raises estrogen levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about gabapentin's pharmacology and whether it has any plausible mechanism to increase estrogen. Then, I should verify what clinical trials and guidelines say about gabapentin's role in menopausal vasomotor symptoms and whether any studies measured estradiol. Next, I will check for any endocrine adverse effects that might suggest hormonal changes. After that, I should review drug–hormone interaction data to see if gabapentin alters estrogen pharmacokinetics. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and outline clinical implications for patients concerned about estrogen exposure or hormone-sensitive conditions.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Gabapentin is a GABA analog that binds the α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing calcium influx and modulating neurotransmitter release; it is not an enzyme inducer and does not meaningfully inhibit CYP450, so there is no clear mechanistic pathway by which it would increase estrogen synthesis or reduce estrogen metabolism, unlike hepatic enzyme–inducing antiseizure drugs that can lower estradiol bioavailability [^113x1fET] [^111fPfdj].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context. Gabapentin is recommended as a nonhormonal therapy for vasomotor symptoms precisely because it treats hot flashes without supplying estrogen; guidelines position gabapentin as an alternative when menopausal hormone therapy is contraindicated or declined, which would be inconsistent with an estrogen-raising effect [^116UiBZ9] [^111vPffY] [^115umj4z].

> I will now examine the head-to-head and randomized data. In a small RCT, gabapentin titrated to 2,400 mg/day reduced hot flash composite scores by about 71%, compared with 72% for conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/day; the similar magnitude across arms supports a non-estrogen mechanism of action rather than an estrogen-raising effect, and the trial did not report increases in estradiol with gabapentin [^112ptJnT] [^1142QL3v]. Larger RCTs in breast cancer populations likewise show efficacy at 900 mg/day without any signal of estrogen elevation, reinforcing a nonhormonal mechanism [^1175eDcD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for endocrine adverse effects that might hint at hormonal changes. Postmarketing and labeling reports list breast enlargement and gynecomastia with gabapentin, but these are rare and nonspecific; they do not demonstrate increased circulating estrogen and can reflect weight gain, fluid retention, or central neuroendocrine modulation rather than true estrogen elevation, so I should be cautious not to overinterpret them as hormonal increases [^115V3Hj5] [^111N7ytc] [^114uqg53].

> Next, I should review drug–hormone interaction data. I need to ensure gabapentin does not alter estrogen pharmacokinetics; coadministration studies with pregabalin show no effect on oral contraceptive steroid levels (norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol), and while those are pregabalin data, the pharmacologic class similarity and lack of CYP induction support that gabapentin would not be expected to increase estrogen exposure via metabolic interactions, which aligns with the absence of estrogen-raising signals in clinical use [^116CwCUH] [^113T6SsS].

> But wait, what if I'm conflating gabapentin with enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs that do lower estrogen? Let me reconsider and separate these. Hepatic enzyme inducers like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital can reduce bioavailable estradiol and impair contraceptive efficacy; gabapentin is not in that category, so it should not be expected to lower — or raise — estrogen via CYP induction, which further argues against an estrogen-raising effect from gabapentin [^111fPfdj] [^117SGiTx].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should double-check that nothing contradicts this. Across mechanism, clinical trials, guidelines, and interaction data, there is no evidence that gabapentin increases estrogen levels; it is a nonhormonal option for vasomotor symptoms and does not act as an estrogen agonist or metabolic enhancer of estrogen, so the answer is no, gabapentin does not raise estrogen [^116UiBZ9] [^113x1fET].

> Clinical implications: For patients with estrogen-sensitive conditions (for example, ER-positive breast cancer) or those avoiding estrogen, gabapentin remains an appropriate nonhormonal choice for hot flashes; typical effective dosing ranges from 900 to 2,400 mg/day in divided doses, with attention to adverse effects like dizziness and somnolence, and it can be used in breast cancer survivors when hormone therapy is contraindicated, consistent with oncology guidance [^116UiBZ9] [^111enftg] [^114iNxii].

Gabapentin **does not increase estrogen levels** in humans. It is a non-hormonal medication used for hot flashes and neuropathic pain, and clinical trials show it reduces hot flashes without affecting estrogen [^112ptJnT] [^111kuRd2]. Gabapentin does not bind estrogen receptors or alter estrogen metabolism, and there is **no evidence** that it increases estrogen in women or men [^113x1fET]. It is a nonhormonal option for vasomotor symptoms, especially in patients who cannot or prefer not to use hormone therapy [^116UiBZ9] [^111vPffY].

## Pharmacological properties of gabapentin

Gabapentin is a GABA analog that **does not bind estrogen receptors** or alter estrogen metabolism. It is **nonhormonal** and does not affect estrogen synthesis, secretion, or clearance [^113x1fET].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding estrogen levels

Clinical studies show gabapentin reduces hot flashes without changing estrogen levels. In a randomized trial of postmenopausal women, gabapentin reduced hot flashes comparably to estrogen, but **did not increase estrogen levels** [^112ptJnT]. Similarly, in women with breast cancer, gabapentin reduced hot flashes without affecting estrogen [^1175eDcD].

---

## Mechanism of action

Gabapentin reduces hot flashes via **neurotransmitter modulation**, not estrogen pathways. It modulates calcium channels and GABAergic transmission, reducing sympathetic outflow and stabilizing thermoregulatory circuits, thereby alleviating vasomotor symptoms without hormonal effects [^112YKFoy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend gabapentin as a **nonhormonal option** for vasomotor symptoms, especially when hormone therapy is contraindicated or declined. It is effective and safe for hot flashes without increasing estrogen [^116UiBZ9] [^111vPffY].

---

## Potential side effects and interactions

Gabapentin is generally well tolerated; common effects include dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue. It **does not interact with estrogen metabolism** or other hormonal therapies, making it suitable for patients using hormone replacement therapy or other hormonal treatments [^notfound].

### Gabapentin, estrogen, and placebo for treating hot flushes: a randomized controlled trial [^112ptJnT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of gabapentin, estrogen, and placebo in the treatment of hot flushes.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 60 postmenopausal women to assess the efficacy of estrogen and gabapentin in the treatment of moderate-to-severe hot flushes. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 0.625 mg/d of conjugated estrogens (n = 20), placebo (n = 20), or gabapentin titrated to 2,400 mg/d (n = 20) for 12 weeks. Participants recorded frequency and severity of baseline hot flushes on a hot flush diary for 2 weeks before randomization and for 12 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome measure was the weekly hot flush composite score, which takes into account both severity and frequency of hot flushes. Secondary outcome measures were differences in pre- and posttreatment scores pertaining to depression (Zung Depression Scale) and other climacteric symptoms (Greene Climacteric Scale).

Results

Intention-to-treat analysis showed that the reduction in the hot flush composite score for both estrogen (72%, P = .016) and gabapentin (71%, P = .004) was greater than the reduction associated with placebo (54%) at the conclusion of the 12th week. The extent of reduction in hot flush composite score, however, was not significantly different between estrogen and gabapentin (P = .63). No differences were seen between groups in the Zung Depression Scale, or in any of the Greene Climacteric subscales except for the Somatic Symptom cluster, which was significantly greater in the gabapentin arm than in the placebo arm. Despite a lack of group differences in adverse events, the Headache, Dizziness, and Disorientation cluster appeared with greater frequency in the gabapentin group. Estimation of the number needed to harm in this cluster suggests that these symptoms may occur with every fourth patient treated with gabapentin.

Conclusion

Despite the small scale of this study, gabapentin appears to be as effective as estrogen in the treatment of postmenopausal hot flushes.

### Hot flashes refractory to HRT and SSRI therapy but responsive to gabapentin therapy [^114Y9tGS]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

There is a need for alternative therapies for hot flashes, as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with increased rates of breast cancer and heart disease, and some women fail to respond to HRT. A 32-year-old woman with surgically-induced menopause experienced 20–30 severe hot flashes per day and failed to respond to various formulations of HRT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy for 17 years. She markedly responded to gabapentin therapy. Gabapentin, SSRIs, and estrogen may act at different cellular targets in the treatment of hot flashes.

### Efficacy and safety of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with vasomotor symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kuRd2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vasomotor symptoms are common among postmenopausal women and patients receiving hormone deprivation therapies, and emerging studies are exploring gabapentin's and pregabalin's effects as nonhormonal treatment options. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these 2 drugs.

Data Sources

Based on a preregistered protocol (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews -CRD42019133650), we searched 10 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Biological Medical Literature, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Journals Full-text Database [VIP], and Wanfang) as well as the World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform and reference lists of related literatures.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and randomized crossover studies exploring gabapentin and pregabalin among women patients with vasomotor symptoms were included.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement was followed. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed bias, and extracted data. Mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were assessed by random-effects models. Heterogeneities were assessed by I 2 statistics, and the quality of evidence was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Nineteen randomized controlled trials and 2 randomized crossover trials reporting results from 3519 participants were included. Gabapentin could reduce hot flash frequency (mean difference, -1.62, 95% confidence interval, -1.98 to -1.26 after 4 weeks; mean difference, -2.77, 95% confidence interval, -4.29 to -1.24 after 12 weeks) and composite score (standardized mean difference, -0.47, 95% confidence interval, -0.71 to -0.23 after 4 weeks; standardized mean difference, -0.77, 95% confidence interval, -1.15 to -0.40 after 12 weeks) compared with placebo. Both menopausal participants and patients with breast cancer benefited from treatment. Higher risks of dizziness and somnolence were found in the gabapentin group than in the control group (risk ratio, 4.45, 95% confidence interval, 2.50–7.94; risk ratio, 3.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.48, respectively). Estrogen was more effective in reducing hot flash frequency than gabapentin. No statistically significant difference in reduction of hot flash severity score was found between gabapentin and antidepressants. The trials comparing gabapentin or pregabalin with the other interventions were too limited to make a conclusion.

Conclusion

Favorable effects of gabapentin in relieving vasomotor symptoms were observed, compared with controls, but were less effective than those of estrogen. Evidence supporting the therapeutic effect of pregabalin is still lacking.

### Treatment of vasomotor symptoms [^115yNocP]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) related to the menopausal transition affect the majority of women and contribute to significant quality of life burden. Incidence, length, severity and report of symptoms vary by race, ethnicity, and coexisting health conditions. The pathophysiology of VMS is not fully understood and is likely multifactorial, involving changes in the hypothalamicpituitary-ovarian axis during the menopausal transition. Treatment approaches include lifestyle modifications, hormonal and non-hormonal therapies, including integrative and complementary medicine approaches. Systemic hormone therapy with estrogen is the most effective treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that treatment with SSRIs, SNRIs, and gabapentin is effective for many women who want to avoid hormone therapy. A shared decision approach to treatment decisions involves consideration of risks with treatment options and discussion of patient priorities.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116UiBZ9]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Gabapentin for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — several trials studying the dose of 900 mg (300 mg three times/d) showed that this has improved the frequency and severity of VMS, with possible adverse events including dizziness, unsteadiness, and drowsiness typically seen during the first week, improving during the second week and resolving by week 4. In a placebo-controlled trial, higher doses of gabapentin (titrated to 2,400 mg/d) were as beneficial as estrogen (conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/d) in reducing hot flash severity scores, though adverse events at this dose included dizziness, headache, and disorientation and black box warnings for all antiepileptic agents, including gabapentin, include uncommon suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The suggested dosing for gabapentin is 900 mg to 2,400 mg per day in divided doses (Level I; recommended).

### Menopause [^113Cy9hz]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Menopause is the time of life when menstrual cycles cease, and is caused by reduced secretion of the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Although menopause is a normal event for women, individual experiences vary, and some women seek medical advice for the management of symptoms. Many symptoms have been attributed to menopause, but only vasomotor dysfunction and vaginal dryness are consistently associated with this time of life in epidemiological studies. Other common symptoms such as mood changes, sleep disturbances, urinary incontinence, cognitive changes, somatic complaints, sexual dysfunction, and reduced quality of life may be secondary to other symptoms, or related to other causes. Trials of therapies for vasomotor dysfunction have shown improvements with oestrogen, gabapentin, paroxetine, and clonidine, but little or no benefit with other agents; adverse effects of these treatments must also be considered. Many questions about menopausal transition and its effects on health have not been adequately addressed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115uMd5v]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Gabapentin and pregabalin for VMS — dosing and comparative outcomes: Four RCTs confirmed moderate efficacy of gabapentin, and individual dose requirements vary widely and range from 300 to 1200 mg, with a single bedtime dose often used when hot flashes occur primarily at night. In one 6-week RCT, pregabalin (75–150 mg twice daily) decreased mean hot flash scores by 65 and 71%, compared with 50% by placebo, and was reasonably well tolerated. In a randomized, crossover, multicenter trial comparing venlafaxine vs gabapentin, 300 mg three times a day, both agents reduced hot flash scores by 66%, but two-thirds of patients preferred venlafaxine, and the quality of this comparative evidence is low due to imprecision.

### Gabapentin's effects on hot flashes in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^114Zp7Ah]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether treatment with the anticonvulsant gabapentin may be effective in reducing hot flash frequency and severity.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 59 postmenopausal women with seven or more hot flashes per day examining the effects of gabapentin 900 mg per day on hot flash frequency after 12 weeks of treatment. Subsequently, study patients were enrolled in a 5-week, open-label treatment phase, during which patients could increase the dose of gabapentin to 2,700 mg per day, if needed.

Results

After 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, intention-to-treat analysis showed that gabapentin 900 mg per day was associated with a 45% reduction in hot flash frequency and a 54% reduction in hot flash composite score (frequency and severity combined into one score) from baseline, compared with 29% (P = .02) and 31% (P = .01) reductions, respectively, for placebo. Four patients (13%) in the gabapentin group and one (3%) in the placebo group withdrew from the double-blind study because of adverse events. Fifteen patients (50.0%) in the gabapentin group reported at least one adverse event, compared with eight patients (27.6%) in the placebo group. Higher, open-label gabapentin dosing was associated with 54% and 67% reductions in hot flash frequency and composite score from baseline, respectively.

Conclusion

Gabapentin is effective in reducing hot flash frequency and severity in postmenopausal women.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^112HdgZT]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) systemic therapy algorithm — within "Systemic Hormone Therapy", clinicians should "Discuss benefits/ individualize according to patient preferences and comorbidities", then assess "Contraindicated? (e.g. estrogen-dependent cancer)". If contraindicated, the pathway directs to "Non-hormonal treatments for VMS" (e.g., "CBT", "SSRIs", "Gabapentin/Pregabalin", "Clonidine", "Oxybutynin", "Fezolinetant"). Additional branches include "Estrogen-only HT" and a contraception decision: "Contraception required?" with options "Continuous combined HRT", "Sequential combined HRT", "Combined COC (continuous use)", and "52mcg LNG IUS + Estradiol (transdermal or oral)". A note adds that "In women with pre-existing medical conditions, some HT options may be contraindicated or not recommended".

### Approach to the patient with menopausal symptoms [^112bnvcu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Many women experience menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years. Hot flashes, the most common symptom, typically resolve after several years, but for 15–20% of women, they interfere with quality of life. For these women, estrogen therapy, the most effective treatment for hot flashes, should be considered. The decision to use hormone therapy involves balancing the potential benefits of hormone therapy against its potential risks. Accumulating data suggest that initiation of estrogen many years after menopause is associated with excess coronary risk, whereas initiation soon after menopause is not. Therefore, most now agree that short-term estrogen therapy, using the lowest effective estrogen dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health. Short-term therapy is considered to be not more than 4–5 yr because symptoms diminish after several years, whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with longer duration of hormone therapy. A minority of women may need long-term therapy for severe, persistent vasomotor symptoms after stopping hormone therapy. However, these women should first undergo trials of nonhormonal options such as gabapentin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, returning to estrogen only if these alternatives are ineffective or cause significant side effects. Low-dose vaginal estrogens are highly effective for genitourinary atrophy symptoms, with minimal systemic absorption and endometrial effects.

### Gabapentin for the treatment of hot flashes in women with natural or tamoxifen-induced menopause: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115Giaj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Various nonhormonal agents have been used for the treatment of hot flashes in women with natural or tamoxifen-induced menopause. Some studies have reported that gabapentin appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment modality.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes, we performed a systematic review of all trials reporting on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in women with hot flashes and a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in this patient population.

Methods

For the systematic review, a literature search was conducted through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published in English from inception of the databases through November 2008. The reference sections of retrieved articles were searched, and a manual search of key journals and abstracts from major meetings in clinical pharmacology was conducted. To be included in the meta-analysis, RCTs had to compare gabapentin with placebo in the treatment of hot flashes in women with natural or tamoxifen-induced menopause, regardless of the sample size, dosage used, duration of treatment, or frequency of the episodes. Uncontrolled and openlabel trials were reviewed but excluded from the meta-analysis. The percent reduction in hot flash frequency (relative to baseline) and the composite score (summation of the number of hot flashes in each severity category multiplied by the severity score) were used as primary outcome measures. Dropout rates and the incidences of frequently reported adverse events (eg, dizziness/unsteadiness, fatigue/somnolence) were also investigated.

Results

The systematic review included 7 trials conducted in 901 patients between 2002 and 2008. Study sizes ranged from 22 to 420 patients, total daily doses of gabapentin ranged from 900 to 2400 mg, and titration periods lasted 3 to 12 days. All of the trials were conducted in North America (6 in the United States and 1 in Canada); 4 of the trials enrolled subjects with a history of breast cancer, whereas the remaining 3 trials only enrolled postmenopausal women. Four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Data were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) or relative risk (RR), with the associated 95% CI. Women assigned to gabapentin reported a significantly greater percent reduction in both the frequency of hot flashes (WMD = 23.72 [95% CI, 16.46–30.97]; P < 0.001) and the composite score (WMD = 27.26 [95% CI, 21.24–33.29]; P < 0.001), with significant between-study heterogeneity (I(2) = 97.8% and 95.6%, respectively). Dropouts due to adverse events were more frequent in women randomized to gabapentin than in controls (RR = 2.09 [95% CI, 1.13–3.85]; P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%). The risk of symptom clustering also was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the controls (dizziness/unsteadiness: RR = 6.94 [95% CI, 3.19–15.13]; P < 0.001; I(2) = 63.1%; and fatigue/somnolence: RR = 4.78 [95% CI, 2.23–10.25]; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%).

Conclusions

Comparisons of gabapentin and placebo revealed reductions of 20% to 30% in the frequency and severity of hot flashes with gabapentin, although data across the studies were too heterogeneous to provide a reliable summary effect. Clusterings of dizziness/unsteadiness and fatigue/somnolence were the most frequently reported adverse events associated with gabapentin and resulted in a higher dropout rate due to adverse events in the gabapentin-treated patients than in the controls. More studies are needed to consolidate the outcomes and elucidate useful details regarding this treatment.

This article focuses on the cause, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis of, and treatment options for vasomotor symptoms. In addition, it summarizes important points for health care providers caring for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with regard to health maintenance, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and vaginal atrophy. Treatment options for hot flashes with variable effectiveness include systemic hormone therapy (estrogen/progestogen), nonhormonal pharmacologic therapies (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, clonidine, gabapentin), and nonpharmacologic therapy options (behavioral changes, acupuncture). Risks and benefits as well as contraindications for hormone therapy are further discussed.

### Use of gabapentin for the management of natural or surgical menopausal hot flashes [^115MEFQt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature examining the use of gabapentin for treatment of hot flashes during natural or surgically induced menopause.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted via PubMed, MEDLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1948-November 2010) using the search terms gabapentin, hot flashes, and menopause. Literature was limited to English-language, human studies. Additional material was identified by reviewing reference citations of the articles retrieved.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies with data describing gabapentin for hot flash management during natural or surgically induced menopause were included. Any studies including women with a history of breast cancer were excluded. Four studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Synthesis

Gabapentin significantly decreased hot flash frequency and hot flash composite scores by 45–71% from baseline in the 4 trials included in this review. In 2 of the trials, gabapentin was comparable to hormone replacement therapy (71% vs 72%, respectively, p = 0.63) in decreasing hot flash composite scores at the end of 12 weeks and in decreasing hot flash frequency at the end of 8 weeks (58.9% vs 70.1%, p > 0.05). In all trials, the most common adverse effects with gabapentin were somnolence/drowsiness, unsteadiness, and dizziness. These adverse effects were most pronounced during the first 1–2 weeks of therapy, but resolved and were similar to those reported with placebo by week 4. These trials were short (< 12 weeks) and had small sample sizes; however, their results appear to show that gabapentin is safe and effective for short-term treatment of hot flashes in women who have entered menopause either naturally or surgically.

Conclusions

Gabapentin 600–2400 mg/day in divided doses may be a viable option for treating hot flashes in menopausal women who do not want to use hormone replacement therapy.

### Gabapentin for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes: a randomized controlled trial [^117BVxaW]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of gabapentin with placebo for the treatment of hot flashes in women who enter menopause naturally.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted across the greater Toronto area between March 2004 and April 2006 in the community and primary care settings. Eligible participants were 200 women in natural menopause, aged 45 to 65 years, having at least 14 hot flashes per week. Study participants were randomized to receive gabapentin 300 mg oral capsules or placebo three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the mean percentage change from baseline to week 4 in daily hot flash score, determined from participant diaries. Secondary outcome measures included changes in weekly mean hot flash scores and frequencies, quality of life, and adverse events.

Results

Of the 197 participants, 193 (98%) completed the study. Analysis was by intention to treat. Hot flash scores decreased by 51% (95% CI: 43%-58%) in the gabapentin group, compared with 26% (95% CI: 18%-35%) on placebo, from baseline to week 4. This twofold improvement was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The Menopause-Specific Quality-of-Life vasomotor score decreased by 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.1; P < 0.001) in the gabapentin group. These women reported greater dizziness (18%), unsteadiness (14%), and drowsiness (12%) at week 1 compared with those taking placebo; however, these symptoms improved by week 2 and returned to baseline levels by week 4.

Conclusions

Gabapentin at 900 mg/day is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for hot flashes.

Endocrine Society guideline — nonhormonal prescription therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS): For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is contraindicated, or who choose not to take MHT, we recommend SSRIs/SNRIs or gabapentin or pregabalin (if there are no contraindications). (1|⊕⊕⊕○) For those women not responding to or tolerating these nonhormonal prescription therapies, we suggest a trial of clonidine (if there are no contraindications). (2|⊕⊕○○) Several RCTs demonstrated that clonidine reduced hot flashes, but less effectively than the SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, and pregabalin, and with more side effects, and clonidine transdermal patches are preferred over tablets because of more stable blood levels.

Cervical cancer and breast cancer screening according to local and international guidelines should be encouraged.

Treatment‐induced premature ovarian insufficiency extends beyond menopausal symptoms and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Menopausal hormone therapy is often not contraindicated in many cancer survivors and is effective in treating vasomotor symptoms. Hormone therapy, however, may be contraindicated following breast cancer, especially in estrogen receptor‐positive disease and women over 50 years. Cognitive behavioral therapy, where available, offers a non‐pharmacological management strategy for menopausal symptoms and is effective in improving sleep and depressive symptoms and reducing bother due to vasomotor symptoms.

Non‐hormonal options for managing vasomotor symptoms include antidepressants and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, oxybutynin and clonidine. Vaginal lubricants are recommended to alleviate vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Low‐dose vaginal estrogen may be safely offered to patients with persistent genitourinary symptoms of menopause, after robust discussion on risks and benefits.

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^116CwCUH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

In Vitro Studies

Pregabalin, at concentrations that were, in general, 10-times those attained in clinical trials, does not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 enzyme systems. In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that pregabalin does not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 activity. Therefore, an increase in the metabolism of coadministered CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline, caffeine) or CYP 3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam, testosterone) is not anticipated.

In Vivo Studies

The drug interaction studies described in this section were conducted in healthy adults, and across various patient populations.

Gabapentin

The pharmacokinetic interactions of pregabalin and gabapentin were investigated in 12 healthy subjects following concomitant single-dose administration of 100-mg pregabalin and 300-mg gabapentin and in 18 healthy subjects following concomitant multiple-dose administration of 200-mg pregabalin every 8 hours and 400-mg gabapentin every 8 hours. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics following single- and multiple-dose administration were unaltered by pregabalin coadministration. The extent of pregabalin absorption was unaffected by gabapentin coadministration, although there was a small reduction in rate of absorption.

Oral Contraceptive

Pregabalin coadministration (200 mg three times a day) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (1 mg/35 µg, respectively) in healthy subjects.

Clonidine — comparative benefit, adverse effects, and recommendation: Clonidine has been shown to be modestly more beneficial than placebo but less beneficial than SSRIs, SNRIs, and gabapentin in reducing VMS; it is used infrequently because of adverse effects such as hypotension, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, sedation, and constipation, and sudden cessation can lead to significant elevations in blood pressure. Because other therapies are more effective with fewer adverse effects, clonidine is not recommended (Levels I-III; not recommended).

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism rapidly improves vasomotor symptoms with sustained duration of action [^112M6tUU]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

As per previous studies the placebo effect was sizeable (28% reduction in HF frequency, which is similar to the reported rate in the literature of 25%), and this is why it is critical for trials investigating new treatments for vasomotor symptoms to be placebo controlled. The treatment effect size of MLE4901 above that achieved by placebo (percentage point reduction compared with placebo) was, however, highly significant for all outcomes. Although direct comparison with other available treatments is problematic as outlined above, our data suggest that the treatment effect of MLE4901 is similar to that of hormone therapy, and superior to that achieved by standard prescription doses of paroxetine or gabapentin, - and thus is likely to be clinically meaningful.

Our results fit entirely with the preexisting data that have implicated NKB/NK3R signaling as a critical mediator of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. From the early work by Rance et al in postmortem brain specimens that demonstrated the marked hypertrophy and increased activity of hypothalamic neurons with upregulated NKB gene expression, to the more recent first report in a clinical trial of inducing typical flashes in premenopausal women by infusing NKB peripherally. Mechanistically, it seems clear that it is the subsequent increased activation of/input to the thermoregulatory autonomic pathway via increased NKB/NK3R signaling through the median preoptic nucleus in response to estrogen withdrawal that is critical. - This heightened signaling pathway can seemingly now be silenced by pharmacological blockade with an oral NK3R antagonist, and thus vasomotor symptoms can be attenuated to the significant benefit of otherwise deeply affected women. Moreover, this can be achieved rapidly, and without the need for estrogen exposure making it a more attractive, or even clinically possible, option for many women than conventional hormone therapy. Furthermore, there may be additional health benefits of treatment with a NK3R antagonist for postmenopausal women. Cardiovascular disease for example is increased in women after estrogen levels decline, and there is some evidence that administering an NK3R antagonist in rats reverses spontaneous hypertension and lowers heart rate, and that this effect is achieved by reducing midbrain dopaminergic signaling in the ventral tegmental area that highly expresses NK3R. The NK3R is also present on vasopressin neurons, and neurokinin B activity has been shown to be potentiated by thromboxane A2. This hypothesis would need to be tested in very large clinical trials that were adequately powered for cardiovascular endpoints but if possible they could be highly informative, and offer a novel treatment strategy for a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.

### A phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin in the management of hot flashes in men (N00CB) [^117HGB7E]. Annals of Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hot flashes represent a significant problem in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.

Materials and Methods

Via a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, men with hot flashes, on a stable androgen deprivation therapy program for prostate cancer, received a placebo or gabapentin at target doses of 300, 600, or 900 mg/day. Hot flash frequencies and severities were recorded daily during a baseline week and for 4 weeks while the patients took the study medication.

Results

In the 214 eligible patients who began the study drug on this trial, comparing the fourth treatment week to the baseline week, mean hot flash scores decreased in the placebo group by 4.1 units and in the three increasing dose gabapentin groups by, 3.2, 4.6, and 7.0 units. Comparing the three combined gabapentin arms to the placebo arm did not result in significant hot flash differences. Wilcoxon rank-sum P values for change in hot flash scores and frequencies after 4 weeks of treatment were 0.10 and 0.02, comparing the highest dose gabapentin arm to the placebo arm, respectively. The gabapentin was well tolerated in this trial.

Conclusion

These results support that gabapentin decreases hot flashes, to a moderate degree, in men with androgen ablation-related vasomotor dysfunction.

### Epilepsy and anti-seizure medications: secret agents for endocrine disruption [^113x1fET]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Reproductive and Endocrine Effects of Anti-Seizure Medications

Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can result in endocrine related side effects including polycystic ovaries, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and bone loss. Microsomal hepatic enzyme inducing anti-seizure medications (EIASM) may impact sex hormones and result in lower levels of bioavailable testosterone and estradiol and subsequently contribute to sexual dysfunction, menstrual irregularities, and problems with fertility. Some non-enzyme inducing ASMs such as valproic acid (VPA) are also associated with endocrine disturbances such as polycystic ovary and weight gain. Certain ASMs may contribute to sexual dysfunction by a variety of mechanisms. Anti-seizure medications have influence on the metabolism of the central and peripheral endocrine hormones and their binding proteins. Some hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme inducing ASMs increase the breakdown of biologically active testosterone resulting in hyposexuality in men and women with epilepsy. They also decrease bioavailability of estradiol, resulting in menstrual disorders, anovulatory cycles, and polycystic ovaries. Most of the non-enzyme inducing ASMs such as gabapentin, pregabalin, benzodiazepines (BZDs), and VPA enhance GABAergic transmission, which in turn has specific effects on sexual function.

Hepatic Enzyme Inducing ASMs

Carbamazepine (CBZ), phenobarbital (PB), and phenytoin (PHT) are all hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing ASMs (EIASMs). Oxcarbazepine (OXC) and topiramate (TPM) are weak hepatic enzyme inducers. Long-term treatment with these medications results in low levels of free testosterone and estradiol and therefore high levels of sex-hormone binding globulin concentrations in people with epilepsy. - This in turn may lead to menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and reduced fertility.

The effect of TPM on sexual function can be either central and related to interference at the limbic and cortico-striatal loop or through affecting peripheral spinal and autonomic neurons. Substitution or reduction in dose resulted in recovery of symptoms.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113FNRiL]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Nonhormone medications for vasomotor symptoms — evidence-based key points span antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anticholinergics, and hypnotics. SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate improvements in VMS, and gabapentin is associated with improvements in the frequency and severity of VMS. Because of significant AEs and no consistent studies showing greater benefit than placebo, clonidine is not recommended. Oxybutynin has been shown to reduce moderate to severe VMS, although in older adults, long-term use may be associated with cognitive decline. Given limited data, suvorexant is not recommended.

### Neuroendocrine considerations in the treatment of men and women with epilepsy [^115knPxB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Complex, multidirectional interactions between hormones, seizures, and the medications used to control them can present a challenge for clinicians treating patients with epilepsy. Many hormones act as neurosteroids, modulating brain excitability via direct binding sites. Thus, changes in endogenous or exogenous hormone levels can affect the occurrence of seizures directly as well as indirectly through pharmacokinetic effects that alter the concentrations of antiepileptic drugs. The underlying structural and physiological brain abnormalities of epilepsy and the metabolic activity of antiepileptic drugs can adversely affect hypothalamic and gonadal functioning. Knowledge of these complex interactions has increased and can now be incorporated in meaningful treatment approaches for men and women with epilepsy.

### Nighttime awakenings responding to gabapentin therapy in late premenopausal women: a case series [^114tpHUC]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Insomnia related to nighttime awakenings is known to be more prevalent in women than men. Three cases are presented here of late premenopausal women experiencing frequent nighttime awakenings that responded well to bedtime treatment with gabapentin. In one case, what started as isolated nighttime awakenings slowly progressed to awakenings accompanied by typical menopausal night sweats. This led to the theory that the initial isolated nighttime awakenings in this patient may have been secondary to a menopausal etiology related to low serum estradiol levels. In the subsequent 2 cases, early follicular phase serum estradiol was confirmed to be low. It is theorized that isolated nighttime awakenings in some premenopausal women may be caused by low serum estradiol, triggering events physiologically related to menopausal night sweats. Further research is needed to determine if low early follicular phase serum estradiol is associated with nighttime awakenings in premenopausal women not experiencing night sweats.

### Q-122 as a novel, non-hormonal, oral treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women taking tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor after breast cancer: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115Sg9W7]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are experienced by more than two-thirds of women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy. Safe and effective treatments are lacking. Q-122 is a novel, non-hormonal compound that has shown promise for reducing vasomotor symptoms by modulation of oestrogen-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Q-122 in women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy and experiencing vasomotor symptoms.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial at 18 sites in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Eligible participants were women, aged 18–70 years, taking a stable dose of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor following breast cancer and experiencing at least 50 self-reported moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to oral Q-122 100 mg or identical placebo, twice daily for 28 days. Randomisation was stratified by BMI (≤ 30 kg/m 2 or > 30 kg/m 2) and use of any of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, gabapentin, or pregabalin. Q-122 and placebo capsules were identical in appearance and containers identically labelled. During the double-blind treatment and analysis phases, the participants, investigators, clinical research organisation staff, and sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean percentage change from baseline in the Vasomotor Symptom Severity Score of moderate and severe hot flushes and night sweats (msVMS-SS) between Q-122 and placebo after 28 days of treatment. Primary analysis was by modified intention-to-treat and safety was assessed in all participants receiving at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03518138.

Findings

Between Oct 24, 2018, and Sept 9, 2020, 243 patients were screened, 131 of whom were randomly assigned and received treatment (Q-122 n = 65 and placebo n = 66). Q-122 resulted in a significantly greater mean percentage change in msVMS-SS from baseline over 28 days of treatment compared with placebo (least squares mean: Q-122–39% [95% CI -46 to -31] vs placebo -26% [-33 to -18]; p = 0·018). Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate and similar between the two groups (treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events in 11 [17%] of 65 patients in the Q-122 group vs nine [14%] of 66 in the placebo group); zero patients in the Q-122 group and two (3%) patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Q-122 is an effective and well tolerated non-hormonal oral treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy after breast cancer. Our results support the conduct of larger and longer studies of Q-122, with potential use extending to postmenopausal women who require an alternative to menopausal hormone therapy.

### Phase III trial of gabapentin alone or in conjunction with an antidepressant in the management of hot flashes in women who have inadequate control with an antidepressant alone: NCCTG N03C5 [^115VLyaZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Despite the utility of newer antidepressants for alleviating hot flashes, antidepressants do not work adequately enough in many patients. Gabapentin is a nonhormonal agent that also can reduce hot flashes. No data have been available to address whether the combination of both agents would more effectively alleviate hot flashes, compared with gabapentin alone, in patients with inadequate hot flash control with an antidepressant alone.

Patients and Methods

This was a randomized trial in which 118 patients with inadequate hot flash control on an antidepressant were randomly assigned to receive both an antidepressant and gabapentin versus being weaned off the antidepressant and receiving gabapentin alone. Patients were observed for 5 weeks (including a baseline week in which patients continued on their current antidepressant without gabapentin) during which time they completed validated daily hot flash diaries.

Results

Ninety-one patients provided complete data at the 5-week assessment. Regardless of whether or not the antidepressant was continued when gabapentin was started, there was an approximately 50% median reduction in hot flash frequencies (54%; 95% CI, 34% to 70% for combined treatment v 49%; 95% CI, 26% to 58% for gabapentin alone) and scores (56%; 95% CI, 26% to 71% for combined treatment v 60%; 95% CI, 33% to 73% for gabapentin alone).

Conclusion

Gabapentin seems to decrease hot flashes by approximately 50% in women with inadequate hot flash control who were using an antidepressant. This study saw no significant additional hot flash reduction from continuation of the antidepressant.

### Screening antiseizure medications to break the cycle between neuronal hyperexcitability and Alzheimer's disease [^111tpRfM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, acute ASM treatment generally reduced seizure severity following corneal kindling, but their efficacies varied by model and sex. In APP/PS1 mice, Levetiracetam was more effective and lamotrigine less effective in males compared to controls, whereas levetiracetam, valproic acid, and gabapentin showed greater efficacy in females. In male PSEN2–141I, all ASMs demonstrated similar efficacy compared to controls, while in females, lamotrigine and gabapentin were more effective than in controls. Notably, phenobarbital was effective across all model and control mice, and levetiracetam, valproic acid, and gabapentin showed elevated efficacy in the Alzheimer's disease model mice, highlighting these ASMs as promising candidates for further study. The sex differences identified in these studies may have important clinical implications and could reflect underlying hormonal influences on neuronal excitability, such as estrogen's modulation of synaptic function. Knox et al. did not evaluate the efficacy of chronic ASM treatments — a critical step in evaluating the long-term therapeutic potential of these drugs. Additionally, behavioral seizure monitoring may miss subtle alterations including non-motor epileptiform activity and changes in spectral power. Overall, these data demonstrate potent, yet heterogenous efficacies of ASMs on seizure control in aged Alzheimer's disease models, indicating their clinical potential and the possible benefits of a tailored approach to seizure control in the Alzheimer's disease population.

### Gabapentin for the management of hot flushes: a case series [^115c3EF4]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To audit the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant gabapentin on hot flushes in postmenopausal women.

Design

This was an open case series involving 11 postmenopausal women who were willing to take gabapentin for the relief of their hot flushes and were willing to keep a diary recording the number and intensity of their hot flushes, both before and during treatment. Gabapentin was started at a dose of 300 mg, to be taken at night, and the women were instructed to increase the dose up to 1,200 mg, according to symptom behavior.

Results

Eleven women agreed to participate for on average 53.22 days (range, 2–79 days), but two discontinued participation-one before starting treatment and one after 2 days-so there are complete data sets for nine women. Gabapentin was found to be extremely effective in reducing hot flush activity (P < 0.001; Fig. 1). A significant reduction in symptoms was observed with a dose of 300 mg/day (P < 0.001). Scores on the Green Climacteric Scale were significantly improved from a mean of 25.72 (range, 12–42) to 19.25 (range, 13–31; P < 0.001). Palpitations (P = 0.001), panic attacks (P = 0.0001), mood (P = 0.023), muscle and joint pains (P = 0.021), and paresthesias and loss of sensation in the extremities (P = 0.001) were also shown to improve with treatment.

Conclusions

In the present case series, gabapentin was well tolerated and could be a valuable alternative for the treatment of hot flushes in women with contraindications to hormonal replacement therapy. It would be particularly beneficial for women in whom aches and pains and paresthesias are also a significant feature of the climacteric syndrome.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1177tcB4]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Chronic pelvic pain affects 2–24% of women worldwide and evidence for medical treatments is scarce. Gabapentin is effective in treating some chronic pain conditions. We aimed to measure the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in 39 UK hospital centres. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy, which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin (titrated to a maximum dose of 2700 mg daily) or matching placebo for 16 weeks. The online randomisation system minimised allocations by presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, current use of hormonal contraceptives, and hospital centre. The appearance, route, and administration of the assigned intervention were identical in both groups. Patients, clinicians, and research staff were unaware of the trial group assignments throughout the trial. Participants were unmasked once they had provided all outcome data at week 16–17, or sooner if a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the study drug occurred. The dual primary outcome measures were worst and average pain scores assessed separately on a numerical rating scale in weeks 13–16 after randomisation, in the intention-to-treat population. Self-reported adverse events were assessed according to intention-to-treat principles. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISCRTN77451762.

Findings

Participants were screened between Nov 30, 2015, and March 6, 2019, and 306 were randomly assigned (153 to gabapentin and 153 to placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in both worst and average numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at 13–16 weeks after randomisation. The mean worst NRS pain score was 7·1 (standard deviation [SD] 2·6) in the gabapentin group and 7·4 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1·4 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and −1·2 (SD 2·1) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·20 [97·5% CI −0·81 to 0·42]; p = 0·47). The mean average NRS pain score was 4·3 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and 4·5 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1·1 (SD 2·0) in the gabapentin group and −0·9 (SD 1·8) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·18 [97·5% CI −0·71 to 0·35]; p = 0·45). More women had a serious adverse event in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (10 [7%] of 153 in the gabapentin group compared with 3 [2%] of 153 in the placebo group; p = 0·04). Dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances were more common in the gabapentin group.

Interpretation

This study was adequately powered, but treatment with gabapentin did not result in significantly lower pain scores in women with chronic pelvic pain, and was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo. Given the increasing reports of abuse and evidence of potential harms associated with gabapentin use, it is important that clinicians consider alternative treatment options to off-label gabapentin for the management of chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

### Nonhormonal management of hot flashes for women on risk reduction therapy [^111YFqtv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

Hot flashes are very common in women in menopause and can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Women on risk reduction therapy are particularly prone because treatments, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or oophorectomy, have the potential to exacerbate these symptoms. Hormonal treatments, despite the fact that they represent the most effective therapies, are not used for the treatment of hot flashes in these women because of concerns that they may increase the risk for breast cancer. As a result, several nonhormonal therapies have been tested in randomized placebo-controlled trials and shown to be effective, such as paroxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine, citalopram, gabapentin, and pregabalin. In addition, several nonpharmacologic therapies have been tested with various successes. An additional consideration is how some of those drugs, especially fluoxetine and paroxetine, interact with the metabolism of tamoxifen. This article discusses these issues, and provides some recommendations regarding use of nonhormonal therapies for treating hot flashes in women on risk reduction therapy, with an emphasis on pharmacogenomic considerations.

### Cardiovascular risk of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy [^112iStSh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) provide annual guidance for clinicians. The standard of medical care in 2022 highlights cardiovascular disease management in patients with diabetes, as well as management of complications of diabetes, including diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathic pain in diabetes can be severe and can impact quality of life. Pregabalin and gabapentin are recommended as pharmacologic treatments for diabetic neuropathy. While both medications were initially developed as anticonvulsants, pregabalin was approved to treat diabetic neuropathy in 2014 and gabapentin is often prescribed "off label" to treat diabetic neuropathy.

Both gabapentin and pregabalin can cause fluid retention by altering arterial myogenic tone. Although fluid retention is not a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, every medical condition that causes fluid retention — heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea and Cushing's syndrome — is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarcts, strokes, and venous thromboembolic disease. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that a number of medications that cause fluid retention are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. The list includes cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), nonselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormone replacement therapy with estrogens and progestins, oral contraceptives, insulins and sulfonylureas.

The consensus from multiple guidelines and systematic reviews is that gabapentinoids, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants have the best evidence to support their use in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain but comparative effectiveness studies to inform the best choice are lacking. Opioid analgesics should be avoided due to their serious adverse effects and potential for addiction. Long-term use of gabapentin and pregabalin is generally well tolerated and provides sustained efficacy. However, currently it remains unknown whether long-term use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarcts, strokes, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and venous thromboembolic events.

Nonhormonal therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — For postmenopausal women with mild or less bothersome hot flashes, we suggest a series of steps that do not involve medication, such as turning down the thermostat, dressing in layers, avoiding alcohol and spicy foods, and reducing obesity and stress. For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom MHT is contraindicated or who choose not to take MHT, we recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or gabapentin or pregabalin if there are no contraindications, and for those not responding to or tolerating these therapies, we suggest a trial of clonidine if there are no contraindications. For women seeking relief of VMS with over-the-counter (OTC) or complementary medicine therapies, we suggest counseling regarding the lack of consistent evidence for benefit for botanicals, black cohosh, omega-3-fatty acids, red clover, vitamin E, and mind/ body alternatives including anxiety control, acupuncture, paced breathing, and hypnosis.

### Differential effects of desvenlafaxine on hot flashes in women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen: a randomized controlled trial [^115fwQnj]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

We conducted a phase 3, four-week, multi-center, three-arm, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine for moderate-to-severe HFs among women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen regularly (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02819921, registered June 24, 2016). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either desvenlafaxine 100 mg (D-100), desvenlafaxine 50 mg (D-50), or placebo, all administered orally once daily for four weeks. Randomization was performed using a central interactive web-based system and a stratified block randomization method. Stratification factors included age (< 50 vs.50 years), depression (presence vs. absence), and participating institution.

Participants

Patients with breast cancer were eligible for enrollment if they were: (a) aged19 years, (b) diagnosed with atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast (stages I–IV), (c) regularly taking tamoxifen (6 times/week) after completing surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy, and (d) experiencing moderate-to-severe level of HFs occurring14 times/week (on average2 times/day) lasting for more than a month. Patients were excluded if they were: (a) pregnant/breastfeeding, (b) had a history of seizure disorder or hepatic/renal dysfunction, (c) taking any hormone therapy (e.g. agents containing estrogen/progesterone/androgens) or taking corticosteroids, or (d) using an antidepressant/gabapentin/pregabalin/clonidine to manage depression and/or HFs.

### Pregabalin [^116uZnAY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Vivo Studies

The drug interaction studies described in this section were conducted in healthy adults, and across various patient populations.

Gabapentin

The pharmacokinetic interactions of pregabalin and gabapentin were investigated in 12 healthy subjects following concomitant single-dose administration of 100-mg pregabalin and 300-mg gabapentin and in 18 healthy subjects following concomitant multiple-dose administration of 200-mg pregabalin every 8 hours and 400-mg gabapentin every 8 hours. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics following single-and multiple-dose administration were unaltered by pregabalin coadministration. The extent of pregabalin absorption was unaffected by gabapentin coadministration, although there was a small reduction in rate of absorption.

Oral Contraceptive

Pregabalin coadministration (200 mg three times a day) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (1 mg/35 μg, respectively) in healthy subjects.

Lorazepam

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of lorazepam single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of lorazepam (1 mg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Oxycodone

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of oxycodone single-dose pharmacokinetics. Single-dose administration of oxycodone (10 mg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Ethanol

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of ethanol single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of ethanol (0.7 g/kg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lamotrigine

Steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin, carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant pregabalin (200 mg three times a day) administration.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated with pregabalin and various concomitant medications suggest the following:

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114j6ozu]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain affects 2–24% of women worldwide and evidence for medical treatments is scarce. Gabapentin is effective in treating some chronic pain conditions. We aimed to measure the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in 39 UK hospital centres. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy, which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin (titrated to a maximum dose of 2700 mg daily) or matching placebo for 16 weeks. The online randomisation system minimised allocations by presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, current use of hormonal contraceptives, and hospital centre. The appearance, route, and administration of the assigned intervention were identical in both groups. Patients, clinicians, and research staff were unaware of the trial group assignments throughout the trial. Participants were unmasked once they had provided all outcome data at week 16–17, or sooner if a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the study drug occurred. The dual primary outcome measures were worst and average pain scores assessed separately on a numerical rating scale in weeks 13–16 after randomisation, in the intention-to-treat population. Self-reported adverse events were assessed according to intention-to-treat principles. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISCRTN77451762.

Findings

Participants were screened between Nov 30, 2015, and March 6, 2019, and 306 were randomly assigned (153 to gabapentin and 153 to placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in both worst and average numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at 13–16 weeks after randomisation. The mean worst NRS pain score was 7·1 (standard deviation [SD] 2·6) in the gabapentin group and 7·4 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was -1·4 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and -1·2 (SD 2·1) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference -0·20 [97·5% CI -0·81 to 0·42]; p = 0·47). The mean average NRS pain score was 4·3 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and 4·5 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was -1·1 (SD 2·0) in the gabapentin group and -0·9 (SD 1·8) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference -0·18 [97·5% CI -0·71 to 0·35]; p = 0·45). More women had a serious adverse event in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (10 [7%] of 153 in the gabapentin group compared with 3 [2%] of 153 in the placebo group; p = 0·04). Dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances were more common in the gabapentin group.

Interpretation

This study was adequately powered, but treatment with gabapentin did not result in significantly lower pain scores in women with chronic pelvic pain, and was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo. Given the increasing reports of abuse and evidence of potential harms associated with gabapentin use, it is important that clinicians consider alternative treatment options to off-label gabapentin for the management of chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112oRcoo]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Study design and participants

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (GaPP2) took place in 39 UK hospital centres. Ethical approval for the trial was obtained from the UK Coventry and Warwick Research Ethics Committee (REC 15/WM/0036) and clinical trial authorisation was obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. A trial steering committee provided independent oversight of the trial. Confidential interim analysis of all available data alongside anonymised reports of adverse events by participants were reviewed by a data monitoring committee on four occasions. No reason to recommend halting or modifying the trial was identified. The trial protocol has been published elsewhere.

The recruitment criteria for this study were defined before the International Classification of Diseases-11 classification for chronic secondary visceral pain was drawn up, and were based on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists definition for chronic pelvic pain and the 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain taxonomy. Moreover, we believe that they reflect the group of women commonly seen in gynaecological practice within the UK and that any heterogeneity is a strength, ensuring that our results are generalisable. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. We limited the study to women because of the growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that suggest sex differences in pain thresholds, sensitivity, and underlying neuroimmune modulation. Pelvic pain was defined as pain located within the true pelvis (between and below the anterior iliac crests). Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy (eg, macroscopic endometriosis lesions, complex ovarian cysts or ovarian cysts of > 5 cm, fibroids of > 3 cm, and dense adhesions), which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Women were excluded if they only had dysmenorrhoea; had a malignancy; were currently using or had previously used gabapentin or pregabalin; had surgery planned in next 6 months; had contraindications to taking gabapentin; had a previous reaction to gabapentin; were taking gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists and were unable or unwilling to stop; were breastfeeding, pregnant, or planned a pregnancy in next 6 months; or had pain suspected to be of gastrointestinal origin (according to positive Rome III Diagnostic Criteria); or had previously participated in the GaPP1 pilot study. All women provided written informed consent. After confirmation of clinical eligibility, women entered a pre-randomisation screening phase where they were required to return their worst and average pain scores on a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), weekly for 4 weeks via a centralised text messaging system. To be considered eligible for randomisation, women were required to have returned at least three of four pre-randomisation NRS scores on both the worst and average NRS scales to show adherence to data collection. At least two of the worst NRS pain scores needed to be a score of 4 or higher, for the pain to be considered sufficient for entry into the trial. No study drugs were taken during this pre-randomisation screening phase, but participants were able to remain on any analgesics they were taking. We did not specify a target recruitment per centre; all centres recruited as many women as they could during the recruitment period.

Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of prospective randomized trials designed to evaluate treatment efficacy of different agents on vasomotor HF in men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer

Besides VMS including hot flushes, several studies evaluated the effect of these symptoms on QoL using different scales. In our study, an exhaustive evaluation was based on 4 questionnaires. Like for the other agents, we observed a greater positive effect of Serelys Homme on fatigue (Fig. 5). QoL parameters like fatigue, as well as the intensity of all symptoms, decreased accordingly in our study. Conversely, the 2 earlier studies were unable to assess QoL or parameters other than the frequency of hot flushes at 1 month.

Hot flushes and other VMS are also important side effects of HT in breast cancer. Therapeutic management of VMS is largely extrapolated from patients with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of gabapentin and venlafaxine; these agents may be used for this off-label indication in men receiving HT. Low-dose estrogen and progestins can also be considered, but the benefits of this option need to be weighed against the thromboembolic risk associated with estrogen use. Additionally, acupuncture has been shown to be of potential benefit. Conservative strategies to abort hot flushes include sleeping with an open window or drinking cold beverages. Lastly, regular exercise can help decrease frequency and severity of hot flushes; given the benefit of exercise for other ADT side effects and overall health, this recommendation is strongly encouraged. Overall, a stepwise approach is suggested for hot-flush management, including exercise, conservative measures, use of venlafaxine or gabapentin, and lastly use of estrogen or progestins as needed while weighing the potential risks versus benefits of each treatment option.

### Gabapentin use during pregnancy and lactation with and without concurrent opioid exposure: considerations and future directions [^112scgsQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Gabapentin is a γ-aminobutyric acid analog formally indicated for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain that is gaining increased popularity. Gabapentin has been historically considered a safe medication, including during pregnancy and lactation, with low reported concerns for misuse and use disorders. However, new empirical efforts are revealing concerns regarding the safety of widespread gabapentin use, particularly in pregnancy and for individuals with a propensity toward substance misuse. The Food and Drug Administration's full prescribing information report on gabapentin provides concerning preclinical data and then states that gabapentin is potentially "developmentally toxic" and has an unknown risk of birth impacts. Concerns have also been raised surrounding in utero exposure to gabapentin due to the onset and presentation of atypical and/or difficult to control withdrawal signs and symptoms in neonates, including those dually exposed to opioids, as well as neonatal exposure to gabapentin via breastmilk. Moreover, nonprescribed gabapentin use has become an increasing problem, with opioid use disorder being the greatest risk factor for such misuse. This article summarizes the current literature regarding gabapentin use during pregnancy and related prenatal and neonatal exposure outcomes with special consideration for interactions between gabapentin and opioid use. Taken together, the current literature suggests that gabapentin use should be considered with caution during pregnancy and during the post-partum period. Well-controlled, prospective research studies are needed to determine the extent of the risks and benefits of prescribed and nonprescribed gabapentin exposure to pregnant people and their neonates.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111WKHTx]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that, in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology, gabapentin was no more effective than placebo in reducing pain. The trial was powered adequately to detect differences between trial groups, and the between-group point estimates and corresponding CIs excluded a minimally important clinical difference of one point on a 0–10 pain scale, so we can confidently conclude that gabapentin is not effective for chronic pelvic pain at a group level. The incidence of side-effects and serious adverse events was higher in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. We do not believe that the inclusion of a small proportion of women with neuropathic-like pain (65 [22%] of 301 participants) and potentially a number of actual neuropathies, explains the lack of efficacy of gabapentin over placebo overall in our study, given that there was no difference in mean PainDETECT scores between the two groups at baseline nor at the end of the study.

We used a dual primary outcome measure and considered both worst and average pain scores. These outcomes were considered separately and an improvement in one (or both) would conclude gabapentin was efficacious. Although we acknowledge that it is preferable to have a single primary outcome, a survey of our patient involvement group found that worst and average pain were equally important to women. We therefore collected the pain scores weekly over a 4-week period, asking participants to rate both worst and average pain for the preceding week, and defined a minimum number of responses to create a valid outcome. We used this approach because chronic pelvic pain can fluctuate during a woman's menstrual cycle, so eliciting a pain score at a single timepoint is unlikely to capture the effect of gabapentin nor reflect the woman's experience of pain. All outcome data in the trial were subjective or participant-reported outcomes (rather than laboratory measurements), but the study was blinded, reducing risk of incurring assessor bias.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^111enftg]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in menopausal patients and those on endocrine therapy are common; the most effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy, which is contraindicated in women on endocrine therapy or with a personal history of breast cancer. Nonhormone options that work include gabapentin (dose range 900–2400 mg/day; starting dose 100–300 mg at night), venlafaxine (dose range 37.5–150 mg/day; starting dose 37.5 mg/day), desvenlafaxine (dose range 100–150 mg/day; starting dose 25–50mg/day), paroxetine (dose range 10–25 mg/day; starting dose 10 mg/day) which is approved for managing VMS, but may interfere with tamoxifen metabolism through the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway, citalopram (dose range 10–20 mg/day; starting dose 10 mg/day), escitalopram (dose range 10–20 mg/day; starting dose 10 mg/day; starting dose 5 mg/day for elderly patients), oxybutynin (dose range 2.5–5 mg twice daily), and fezolinetant, a neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist recently approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe hot flashes (dose 45 mg/day); cognitive behavioral therapy and weight loss are also listed. Approaches not supported include avoidance of triggers such as alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, hot showers or rooms, and smoking because there is no evidence that these behavioral changes reduce VMS; over-the-counter supplements (soy-based formulas, black cohosh, wild yam, red clover, and pollen extract) since there is no high-quality data showing benefit, studies suggesting a benefit are small and safety data is lacking, none are recommended by the North American Menopause Society, and there is concern for drug interactions through the P450 CYP2D6 enzyme system for women taking tamoxifen; and traditional acupuncture, as studies have not shown a significant benefit though data is promising for electroacupuncture.

In Vivo Studies

The drug interaction studies described in this section were conducted in healthy adults, and across various patient populations.

Gabapentin

The pharmacokinetic interactions of pregabalin and gabapentin were investigated in 12 healthy subjects following concomitant single-dose administration of 100-mg pregabalin and 300-mg gabapentin and in 18 healthy subjects following concomitant multiple-dose administration of 200-mg pregabalin every 8 hours and 400-mg gabapentin every 8 hours. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics following single-and multiple-dose administration were unaltered by pregabalin coadministration. The extent of pregabalin absorption was unaffected by gabapentin coadministration, although there was a small reduction in rate of absorption.

Oral Contraceptive

Pregabalin coadministration (200 mg three times a day) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (1 mg/35 μg, respectively) in healthy subjects.

Lorazepam

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of lorazepam single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of lorazepam (1 mg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Oxycodone

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of oxycodone single-dose pharmacokinetics. Single-dose administration of oxycodone (10 mg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Ethanol

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of ethanol single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of ethanol (0.7 g/kg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lamotrigine

Steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin, carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant pregabalin (200 mg three times a day) administration.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113dr2QW]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Three prespecified subgroup analyses were done on the basis of presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress defined by the General Health Questionnaire(score 0–1 or 2–12), and current use of hormonal contraceptives (yes or no). These subgroup analyses were limited to the dual primary outcomes only. The treatment effect within these subgroups was examined by the measurement of treatment-by-subgroup interaction in the linear regression model.

Interim analyses of effectiveness and safety endpoints were done by the trial statistician (who remained unaware of treatment assignments) on behalf of the data and safety monitoring committee at approximately 12-month intervals during the recruitment period. Because the interim analyses were done according to the Haybittle–Peto principle, no adjustment was made in the final p values to measure significance. All analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4). This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISCRTN77451762.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving gabapentin and have been identified during postapproval use of HORIZANT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, bullous pemphigoid.

There are postmarketing reports of life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression in patients taking gabapentin with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

There are postmarketing reports of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of gabapentin. Reported adverse reactions include, but are not limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, and malaise [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Gabapentin for hot flashes in 420 women with breast cancer: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1175eDcD]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most women receiving systemic therapy for breast cancer experience hot flashes. We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial to assess the efficacy of gabapentin in controlling hot flashes in women with breast cancer.

Methods

420 women with breast cancer who were having two or more hot flashes per day were randomly assigned placebo, gabapentin 300 mg/day, or gabapentin 900 mg/day by mouth in three divided doses for 8 weeks. Each patient kept a 1-week, self-report diary on the frequency, severity, and duration of hot flashes before the start of the study and during weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat.

Findings

Evaluable data were available on 371 participants at 4 weeks (119 placebo, 123 gabapentin 300 mg, and 129 gabapentin 900 mg) and 347 at 8 weeks (113 placebo, 114 gabapentin 300 mg, and 120 gabapentin 900 mg). The percentage decreases in hot-flash severity score between baseline and weeks 4 and 8, respectively were: 21% (95% CI 12 to 30) and 15% (1 to 29) in the placebo group; 33% (23 to 43) and 31% (16 to 46) in the group assigned gabapentin 300 mg; and 49% (42 to 56) and 46% (34 to 58) in the group assigned gabapentin 900 mg. The differences between the groups were significant (p = 0.0001 at 4 weeks and p = 0.007 at 8 weeks by ANCOVA for overall treatment effect, adjusted for baseline values); only the higher dose of gabapentin was associated with significant decreases in hot-flash frequency and severity.

Interpretation

Gabapentin is effective in the control of hot flashes at a dose of 900 mg/day, but not at a dose of 300 mg/day. This drug should be considered for treatment of hot flashes in women with breast cancer.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113gjTF1]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either gabapentin or matched placebo through a secure online randomisation system, with the use of minimisation to balance trial group assignments according to presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea (pain score of ≥ 4 on a 0–10 NRS), psychological distress (General Health Questionnairescore ≥ 2), current use of hormonal contraceptives, and hospital centre. The appearance, route, and administration of the assigned intervention were identical in both groups. Patients, clinicians, and research staff were unaware of the trial group assignments throughout the trial. Participants were unmasked once they had provided all outcome data at week 16–17, or sooner if a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the study drug occurred.

Procedures

Participants took the assigned drugs orally, every day from the time of randomisation to 16 weeks after randomisation. The study drugs were supplied by Sharp Clinical Services UK, who procured the gabapentin and manufactured the placebo capsule, over-encapsulated the gabapentin, and dispensed all capsules into numbered containers. The dosing regimen included a 4-week titration phase where each participant started on one capsule (300 mg) daily, and increased the dose by one capsule every 3 days until they perceived that they were gaining adequate pain relief, or reported side-effects that precluded them from further increases, up to a maximum dose of nine capsules. If necessary, participants were advised to titrate down to the last tolerated dose with minimal side-effects. They were also asked to maintain their highest tolerated dose until the end of week 16. Study drugs were dispensed at time of randomisation, at weeks 4–5, and (dependent on the maximum tolerated dose reached) at weeks 8–10. Other analgesic medications, including opioids and antidepressants (but excluding those contraindicated alongside gabapentin) were allowed and their use was recorded.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116fKqy4]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough — sex differences and hypersensitivity: Population prevalence studies indicate that chronic cough is more prevalent among nonsmoking adult women than men, while among ex-smokers there is a similar prevalence of cough in men and women. In children, boys experience more cough than girls during the first decade of life, but this sex effect reverses after 14 years of age, with adolescent girls reporting more cough than adolescent boys. Cough as a side-effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy is more common in women than men. Cough hypersensitivity is more prevalent in adult women and is demonstrated by increased cough response to inhaled capsaicin in adult women with chronic cough and also in healthy adult women. Clinical features that characterize cough hypersensitivity and are more prevalent in adult women with chronic cough include allotussia and laryngeal paresthesia, and the Arnold nerve reflex is also increased in adult women with chronic cough. Sex may influence response to treatment for cough: women with laryngopharyngeal reflux-associated cough who respond to proton pump inhibitors have delayed time to maximal treatment effect, whereas sex is not observed to modify response to neuromodulator therapy (amitriptyline, gabapentin) used to treat chronic cough. The reasons for these sex effects are not known, and several proposed cough mechanisms are known to be modified by female sex hormones; similar sex differences in health-related quality of life have not been seen during acute cough.

### Oral gabapentin for scalp pruritus in patients with lichen planopilaris: a case series [^112YKFoy]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of LPP has been linked to neurogenic inflammation given the decreased epidermal nerve fiber density and altered expression of SP and CGRP in the LPP-affected scalp, which may lead to small-fiber neuropathy and associated scalp symptoms. Gabapentin secondarily reduces the release of SP and CGRP from primary afferent neurons by primarily increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid release. Additionally, by binding to the voltage-gated calcium channel, gabapentin inhibits presynaptic calcium influx and glutamate release, thereby suppressing pruritic stimulation at trigeminal and cervical nerves. The antineuroinflammatory properties of gabapentin may diminish scalp pruritus and perifollicular inflammation alongside concurrent therapies, leading to a reduction in LPPAI. Topical or oral gabapentin (10% cream 3 times daily or 200–300 mg daily) was reported to alleviate scalp pruritus in patients with scalp dysesthesia in a small-scale retrospective study. A clinical trial is underway to examine the efficacy of topical 6% gabapentin (NCT03346668) for symptomatic PCA. Interestingly, oral gabapentin 300 mg 3 times daily has also demonstrated efficacy in treating hot flashes, a condition frequently seen in patients with LPP — which predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Furthermore, gabapentin has a broad therapeutic index, desirable safety profiles, high bioavailability, and minimal drug-drug interactions, which may be favorable for LPP patients who are often older and on multiple medications due to the challenging management.

Our findings indicate the therapeutic potential of oral gabapentin for scalp pruritus in LPP, which is an essential component of disease activity measured by LPPAI. Limitations of this study include retrospective and noncontrolled design and adjunctive use of gabapentin in most patients. Larger prospective controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### Pharmacological and non-hormonal treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors: CEPO review and recommendations [^1147AwyE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Breast cancer patients frequently report hot flashes. Given that conventional hormone replacement therapy is generally contraindicated for them, other therapeutic modalities must be considered. The purpose of this review was to develop evidence-based recommendations on non-hormonal pharmacological interventions, including natural health products, for managing hot flashes in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer.

Methods

A review of the scientific literature published between January 2000 and December 2011 was performed. A total of 26 randomized trials were identified.

Results

Studies showed that serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antihypertensives and anticonvulsants significantly reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes in breast cancer patients.

Conclusions

Considering the evidence available to date, the CEPO recommends the following: (1) for breast cancer patients being treated with tamoxifen: (a) the use of venlafaxine, citalopram, clonidine, gabapentin and pregabalin be considered effective in treating hot flashes and (b) the use of paroxetine and fluoxetine be avoided, given that they may reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen; (2) for breast cancer patients not being treated with tamoxifen: (a) the use of venlafaxine, paroxetine, citalopram, clonidine, gabapentin and pregabalin be considered effective in treating hot flashes and (b) fluoxetine not be used to treat hot flashes, given that there is insufficient evidence for its therapeutic efficacy and (3) for breast cancer survivors, sertraline, phytoestrogens, black cohosh and St. John's wort not be used to treat hot flashes.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117UScFX]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Results

Participants were screened between Nov 30, 2015, and March 6, 2019. Of the 1348 women who were approached for participation, 414 were initially considered eligible based on clinical criteria (figure 1). Of these 414 women, 306 were randomly assigned (153 to gabapentin and 153 to placebo). 80% of participants had available data for the dual primary outcome measures (246 [80%] worst scores returned; 244 [80%] average scores returned). The groups were well balanced for all characteristics measured at baseline (table 1).

Figure 1
Trial profile

The final worst pain score was taken as the worst response from the worst pain scores returned, and the average pain score as the mean of the average pain scores returned. Adherence to treatment was defined as taking more than 50% of the study drug, self-reported at weeks 16–17. Participants were withdrawn from any further follow-up if they withdrew consent. NRS = numerical rating scale.

Table 1
Demographic and baseline characteristics of participants

There were no significant between-group differences in both worst and average NRS pain scores at 13–16 weeks after randomisation. The mean worst NRS pain score was 7·1 (SD 2·6) in the gabapentin group and 7·4 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1·4 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and −1·2 (SD 2·1) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·20 [97·5% CI −0·81 to 0·42]; p = 0·47). The mean average NRS pain score was 4·3 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and 4·5 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1·1 (SD 2·0) in the gabapentin group and −0·9 (SD 1·8) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·18 [97·5% CI −0·71 to 0·35]; p = 0·45; table 2; figure 2).

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^1123NiKx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Drug-induced rhinitis — mechanisms and causative agents — can be classified as local inflammatory, neurogenic, and idiopathic; an acute inflammatory response may follow ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid or other NSAIDs, and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers produce rhinorrhea and nasal congestion through a neurogenic mechanism. Responsible pharmacological agents include centrally acting sympatholytic drugs (eg, clonidine, reserpine, methyldopa), peripherally acting sympatholytic drugs (eg, guanethidine, phentolamine), ganglion-blocking drugs (eg, trimethaphan), and vasodilators including phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil). Many other drugs can produce nasal symptoms, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, gabapentin, and psychotropic medications (eg, risperidone, chlorpromazine). The effect of exogenous estrogens and oral contraceptives on nasal physiology is uncertain, with reports of reduced allergen-provoked nasal congestion during ovulation but increased sneezing at the end of the menstrual cycle, and overuse of topical decongestants can result in rhinitis medicamentosa.

### Cognitive behavioural treatment for women who have menopausal symptoms after breast cancer treatment (MENOS 1): a randomised controlled trial [^111ujQys]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK and, as a result of improved early detection and treatment, more women are now living longer with or surviving the disease. Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) affect 65–85% of women treated for breast cancer, often occurring while women are still adjusting to the effects of cancer treatments. HFNS are more severe in this population than they are in healthy women and have a negative effect on quality of life, mood, and sleep. Chemotherapy or adjuvant endocrine treatments can compromise or lead to failure of ovarian function, resulting in rapid reduction of oestrogen concentrations, which induces or exacerbates HFNS. HFNS can in turn reduce adherence to endocrine therapy if left untreated.

Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment for HFNS, but is generally contraindicated for patients with breast cancer because it can increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence, and HFNS can return in women who discontinue hormone replacement therapy. A Cochrane review of non-hormonal medical treatments concluded that clonidine (an antihypertensive drug), gabapentin (an anticonvulsant that works through an unknown mechanism), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) showed a mild to moderate effect on the frequency of HFNS in women with a history of breast cancer (reductions of between 15% and 58%; average 37%). Three trials done since the review was undertaken recorded similar reductions. Various side-effects of medical treatments were reported — eg, dry mouth, sleep problems, and nausea — and short follow-up limited conclusions about long-term outcomes. Some SSRIs (paroxetine and fluoxetine), but not all, might reduce the effectiveness of endocrine treatments. Evidence of improvements to quality of life is mixed; six of 12 studies of non-hormonal drugs reported no effect. Moreover, many breast cancer survivors prefer to use non-medical treatments. For non-pharmacological therapies — eg, vitamins, magnetic devices, or acupuncture — the Cochrane review concluded that outcomes were either inconsistent or not statistically significant. Consequently, a need exists for safe, acceptable, and effective non-hormonal treatments that are free from side-effects to help these women to manage HFNS.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^116wHXrq]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-HTs are also used to treat VMS; however, many non-HTs prescribed off-label, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentinoids, clonidine, and oxybutynin. SSRIs and SNRIs, typically used to treat depression, have been shown to improve mild to moderate VMS but are associated with several side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, nervousness, constipation, somnolence, sweating, and sexual dysfunction. Notably, paroxetine, an SSRI, at a recommended dose of 7.5 mg, once daily at bedtime, is one of the few non-HTs currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat VMS. Gabapentinoids have shown favorable results in clinical trials. Gabapentin has demonstrated reductions in the frequency and severity of VMS but has been associated with dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and disorientation. Pregabalin, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of neuropathic pain and seizures, has been shown to decrease VMS frequency but is not recommended because of limited studies and adverse events (AEs), such as dizziness, cognitive impairment, and weight gain, among other factors. Pregabalin is also a Schedule V controlled substance with a potential for abuse. Suicidal ideation or behaviors are listed in the black box warnings of all antiepileptic agents, including gabapentin, thus limiting their possible benefits in treating VMS. Clonidine has been shown to be less beneficial than other non-HTs but is used infrequently because of such AEs as constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, hypotension, lightheadedness, and sedation; because there are other more effective therapies with fewer AEs, clonidine is not recommended for the treatment of VMS. Oxybutynin has been shown to improve moderate to severe VMS but may cause dry mouth, urinary difficulties, and potential cognitive decline with long-term use. Fezolinetant is an oral, nonhormonal, neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist treatment option for moderate to severe VMS and is approved in the US, Europe, and Australia at a dose of 45 mg once daily. - Several OTC treatments, such as black cohosh, dong quai, herbal estrogen, and soy, have been studied but have not shown significantly better efficacy than placebo in clinical trials and, therefore, are not recommended for women experiencing VMS.

### Hypothalamic-pituitary and growth disorders in survivors of childhood cancer: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117SGiTx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Childhood cancer survivors — drug interactions with sex hormone therapy — Medical providers should be aware of known drug interactions between antiepileptic medications and estrogen replacement, as enzyme-inducing agents such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate may decrease the efficacy of sex hormones by interfering with their metabolism or by increasing the secretion of sex hormone–binding globulin. Other nonenzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs such as lamotrigine, valproate, and levetiracetam have been shown to cause changes in plasma sex hormone concentrations but the mechanisms are unknown, and estrogen replacement may increase seizure risk in patients treated for epilepsy because of increased neuron excitability and/or interference with drug metabolism (as with lamotrigine).

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116h2qds]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

The planned sample size of 240 women was estimated to provide 90% power to detect a minimally important clinical difference in NRS scores of one point on a 0–10 scale, assuming a SD of 2·5. There is a body of literature, to support one point on a NRS or 1 cm on a visual analogue scale representing minimal or little change, and 2·0–2·7 points being much or some change. To account for any increase in the risk of type 1 error that could be associated with having dual outcome measures, a Bonferroni correction was applied (with a two-sided α-level of 0·025). We planned to include 300 women in the trial to account for up to 20% loss to follow-up.

The dual primary outcome measures are presented as means and SDs, alongside adjusted mean differences (with corresponding 97·5% CIs) produced from a linear regression model. Mean differences were adjusted for baseline score and minimisation variables. Mean change from baseline is also presented by group. The primary analysis is equivalent to a change from baseline analysis when also adjusting for baseline score. 97·5% CIs have been used and p values have been reported from two-sided tests at the 2·5% significance level, to account for the Bonferroni correction applied to the dual primary outcome measures. NRS scores were further analysed using a repeated-measures model in which all assessment times were included. Binary secondary outcomes are presented as risk ratios produced from a log-binomial regression model. All continuous secondary outcome measures are presented as mean differences produced from a linear regression model. Appointments with health-care professionals for chronic pelvic pain and use of analgesics, in addition to appointments required by the trial, are reported descriptively only. All secondary outcomes are reported as point estimates with 99% CIs (without p values). All analyses, including assessment of safety and adverse events, were done by intention to treat and adjusted for the presence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress defined by the General Health Questionnaire, current use of hormonal contraceptive, recruiting hospital, and baseline score. Sensitivity analyses for the dual primary outcomes include a per-protocol analysis, an assessment of missing primary outcome data by means of a multiple-imputation approach, and an analysis to assess the effect of time between screening and randomisation.

### Effect of gabapentin on sexual function in vulvodynia: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1122Gmsj]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual dysfunction is common in women with vulvodynia.

Objective

The purpose of this study was (1) to evaluate whether extended-release gabapentin is more effective than placebo in improving sexual function in women with provoked vulvodynia and whether there is a relationship between treatment outcome and pelvic pain muscle severity that is evaluated by palpation with standardized applied pressure and (2) to evaluate whether sexual function in women with provoked vulvodynia would approach that of control subjects who report no vulvar pain either before or after treatment.

Study Design

As a secondary outcome in a multicenter double-blind, randomized crossover trial, sexual function that was measured by the Female Sexual Function Index was evaluated with gabapentin (1200–3000 mg/d) compared with placebo. Pain-free control subjects, matched by age and race, also completed Female Sexual Function Index for comparison.

Results

From August 2012 to January 2016, 230 women were screened at 3 academic institutions, and 89 women were assigned randomly to treatment. Gabapentin was more effective than placebo in improving overall sexual function (adjusted mean difference, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.4–2.2; p = 0.008), which included desire (mean difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.0–3.3; p = 0.04), arousal (mean difference, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1–0.5; p = 0.004), and satisfaction (mean difference, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.5; p = 0.02); however, sexual function remained significantly lower than in 56 matched vulvodynia pain-free control subjects. There was a moderate treatment effect among participants with baseline pelvic muscle pain severity scores above the median on the full Female Sexual Function Index scale (mean difference, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.3–2.8; p = 0.02) and arousal (mean difference, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1–0.6; p = 0.01) and pain domains (mean difference, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.02–0.9; p = 0.04).

Conclusion

Gabapentin improved sexual function in this group of women with provoked vulvodynia, although overall sexual function remained lower than women without the disorder. The most statistically significant increase was in the arousal domain of the Female Sexual Function Index that suggested a central mechanism of response. Women with median algometer pain scores > 5 improved sexual function overall, but the improvement was more frequent than the pain domain. We hypothesize that gabapentin may be effective as a pharmacologic treatment for those women with provoked vulvodynia and increased pelvic muscle pain on examination.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111fPfdj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drug–hormone interactions — evidence summary indicates that some AEDs enhance hepatic CYP450 isoenzyme activity (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate), accelerating metabolism of hormonal preparations and decreasing serum hormone concentrations; dexamethasone is metabolized primarily by hepatic CYP3A4 and patients may need to increase dexamethasone doses, while AEDs only modestly decrease concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone and are less likely to be clinically significant with hydrocortisone (HC), though oxcarbazepine increases cortisol elimination in normal subjects and symptoms of underdosing should be watched; in conclusion, clinicians should always exercise caution when treating AI patients with any type of GC if patients are also taking AEDs; AEDs accelerate T4 and sex hormone clearance requiring compensatory increases in replacement doses, can displace thyroid hormones resulting in observed normal or decreased free hormone levels, and because phenytoin may impair fT4 measurements an equilibrium dialysis fT4 assay is preferred; other AEDs increase sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) reducing bioavailability of E2 and T, combined estrogen and progesterone may decrease lamotrigine levels, and endogenous and exogenous sex steroids may affect seizure activity and epilepsy in women; addition of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, perampanel, or felbamate to DDAVP therapy can cause hyponatremia by increasing DDAVP renal responsiveness.

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain: a qualitative and quantitative systematic review, with focus on procedure [^112eMNAa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

The development of chronic post surgical pain has attracted increased attention and with central sensitization as a prerequisite, gabapentin with its ability to attenuate secondary hyperalgesia in pain models, is an interesting "anti-hyperalgesic". Only one of the included trials investigated pain beyond the immediate postoperative period, and our review cannot make a conclusion on this subject. In two excluded studies by Fassoulaki et al, gabapentin was investigated together with local anaesthetics as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen. In both abdominal hysterectomy and breast surgery, a reduction in postoperative morphine usage, as well as pain for more than one month postoperatively was reported.

In the qualitative analysis of the trials we found no obvious dose-response relationship for the use of perioperative gabapentin. One trial investigated the effect of different preoperative gabapentin doses (300–600–900–1200 mg) and found no additional analgesic effect raising the gabapentin dose above 600 mg. It is the only study in this review addressing this subject and so, the material does not allow for any conclusions on this topic.

In a recent pilot trial by Leung and colleagues, preoperative gabapentin significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium. This subject is sparsely addressed in the trials covered here. Two studies reported on lack of concentration, two studies reported on visual disturbances, and one study on hallucinations. All were non-significant on the subject.

### Analyzing pain patterns in stroke survivors in outpatient clinics: a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study [^116uryUf]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the cohort of 442 stroke survivors, nearly 60% reported pain, and among them, 56% disclosed more than one type of pain. Though women comprised more of the group that reported pain in the descriptive analysis, when adjusting for other variables, the regression analysis suggested that there was no significant difference in pain reporting between men and women. The regression analysis also demonstrated that those with OSA and a history of recreational drug use were more than three times more likely to report pain. As echoed in current evidence, the most frequently reported pain types were musculoskeletal (36%), neuropathic (22%), and headache (17%). Despite a high prevalence of patients reporting pain, only 20% disclosed analgesics in listing of prescribed medications. Interestingly, 22% were prescribed opioids, and 27% of this subgroup disclosed both gabapentin and opioid use.

Chronic pain evidence has established the basis of gender pain experience differences between men and women: biological, estrogen and progesterone increasing the propensity for pain and testosterone offering protection, and neural with differences in the sensorimotor areas and spinal inhibition pathways; psychological with cognitive and behavioral factors such as catastrophizing and depression having stronger relationships with pain in women; and treatment response, with differences noted in analgesic efficacy and side effects. The descriptive statistics in our study demonstrated that the number of women in the group reporting pain was higher than men; however, the regression model suggested no statistically significant difference between men and women reporting pain. As this was a retrospective study, there may be variables of interest that were not collected or charted/reported correctly that may have influenced the direction of this relationship. Further rigorous investigation into the gender differences in pain in stroke survivors is critically needed.

### Comparative analysis of molecular signatures suggests the use of gabapentin for the management of endometriosis-associated pain [^116zcS1U]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Morphological and genetic observations on mutant mouse uteri and on pathological specimens have prompted the suggestion that low DLX5 and DLX6 expressions could be associated with the progression of endometriosis. We have therefore proposed that Dlx5/6 -null mouse uteri could be considered as a model of the disease permitting to get new insight on this pathology.

Here, we have compared the gene expression signature of Dlx5/6 -null mouse uteri with those obtained in four independent studies on endometriosis. Dlx5/6 -null uteri and endometriosis implants share a set of 30 commonly deregulated genes supporting the hypothesis that downregulation of Dlx5/6 could be an early event in endometriosis progression. The 30 identified genes constitute a more "focused" genetic signature of the disease that has permitted potential therapeutic targets to be handpicked. We focused, in particular, on genes upregulated in endometriosis as they could be potential targets for therapeutic strategies.

Current endometriosis therapies present limited efficacy, high rates of symptom recurrence, and significant side effects. For example, the use of GnRH agonists is associated with side effects such as menopausal symptoms and reduced bone mineral density, which restrict their use and demand add-back therapy. In addition, pain management is one of the major clinical challenges for the treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis implants, although ectopic, are highly innervated. Peritoneal endometriosis lesions present a high density of sensory, cholinergic, and adrenergic nerve fibers that might be involved in the origin of pain. It has been proposed that a bidirectional relation exists between nerve fibers and endometriotic lesions with a two-way interaction between the implants and the central nervous system.–The interplay between the peripheral and the central nervous system might be at the origin of individual differences in pain perception that can, in some patients, evolve independently from the disease. When pathological conditions cause damage to the nervous system, sensory activation thresholds are lowered with exaggerated pain perception even upon mild or absent painful stimulation.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^11614x5m]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain is estimated to affect 2–24% of women worldwide, and is associated with substantially reduced quality of life and a 45% reduction in work productivity. It can be associated with underlying pathology such as endometriosis, but in up to 55% of women, no obvious cause is identified at laparoscopy. Management of chronic pelvic pain within gynaecological practice is difficult as no established treatments are available, but careful exploration of symptoms and history can point to non-gynaecological causes of chronic pelvic pain, for which some effective treatments exist.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

At the time of the design of the pilot study for this trial (GaPP1), there had been an increase in prescription of gabapentin in general within the UK. The rate of patients newly treated with gabapentinoids in primary care tripled from 2007 to 2017, and by 2017 half of the prescriptions of gabapentinoids were for an off-label indication. At the time, we also observed that there was considerable use of gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain (largely because of its perceived effectiveness in other chronic pain conditions). First, we surveyed a random group of general practitioners, with the support of the Scottish Primary Care Research Network. Of the general practitioners who responded to our survey, 74% said that they would consider gabapentin as a treatment option for chronic pelvic pain in women. Second, we surveyed a random group of gynaecologists, with the support of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Of those who responded to our survey, 50% said that they currently prescribe gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain, and 92% said that they would consider gabapentin as a treatment option for this condition. Since then, awareness and use of gabapentinoids has continued to increase in gynaecology, with the publication of reviews in this area and reference within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for endometriosis to the NICE guideline on neuropathic pain for treatment of chronic pelvic pain with neuromodulators. However, data from randomised clinical trials of the use of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain are scarce. A 2017 Cochrane review identified one trial that compared the efficacy of gabapentin and amitriptyline for chronic pelvic pain in women with a range of pelvic pathologies, but this study was open-label, there was no placebo group, the population had a mixed aetiology of pain symptoms, and the numbers analysed were small, with only 56 participants. An update to the Cochrane review search strategy in MEDLINE, Embase, PsychLit, and CAB abstracts to April 15, 2020, found only our own pilot trial (GaPP1) and one other placebo-controlled trial from Egypt, neither of which were powered to detect significant differences, and both had substantial attrition. An increased risk of suicidal behaviour, as a potential side-effect of gabapentin, and possible misuse of the drug have been of concern with the rise in the prescribing of gabapentin.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112RnCUp]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

We also acknowledge that it would have been interesting to look at the effect of review by a pain specialist or specialist pain medicine prescription on outcomes, but we did not document whether patients had been seen by a pain specialist at the outset of the trial. However, it is worth noting that within the UK, pain management approaches for chronic pelvic pain are not usually considered until after all gynaecological and other relevant specialist (eg, urology, gastroenterology) assessments and appropriate treatments are complete, or not providing symptom improvement. Therefore, it is unlikely that the women enrolled in this trial would have been seen by a pain specialist with regards to their pelvic pain.

Although more women in the placebo group were able to correctly guess their allocation at the end of the treatment period (78 [74%] of 106 correctly guessed placebo and 64 [58%] of 111 correctly guessed gabapentin), their use of rescue medication was similar. We cannot conclude that women who perceived they were taking placebo compensated by increasing their analgesic use and thus negated any effect of gabapentin.

The higher rates of side-effects observed with gabapentin compared with placebo (eg, dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances) in the trial are consistent with other published studies. A 2018 meta-analysis of all trials for postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathyshowed that, compared with placebo, gabapentin was associated with more drowsiness (gabapentin 14% vs placebo 5%; p < 0·001) and dizziness (gabapentin 19% vs placebo 7%; p < 0·001). Nevertheless, the rates of side-effects in our trial are lower than in these other studies, despite only measuring these in women. This would suggest that women are not more susceptible to developing side-effects from gabapentin than men.

Similar to many clinical trials for treatments for pain, we observed a potential placebo effect. 29 The trial was not designed to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms behind this effect, but information offered in relation to treatment, patients' expectations, previous encounters with gabapentin, and the therapeutic milieu can all generate this response. 30 Nonetheless, the placebo effect observed is very relevant, because of the side-effect profile of gabapentin and its potential addictive properties. 31

In conclusion, our results show that gabapentin did not relieve pain in women with chronic pelvic pain, and that gabapentin was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo.

Results

DLX5 distribution in normal endometrium and in endometriosis

First, we analyzed the distribution of DLX5 in normal endometrium from various stages of the menstrual cycle by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1A–B′). DLX5 protein is prevalently present in endometrial glandular and luminal epithelial cells. The intracellular distribution of DLX5 varies at different phases of the cycle: during the proliferative phase, DLX5 is detected both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Figure 1A and A′), while in the secretory phase, DLX5 is predominantly present in the cytoplasm (Figure 1B and B′) where it displays a polarized distribution mostly toward the luminal and basal aspects of the cells.

Most endometriotic lesions (Figure 1C–D′) present very few glands with a very large lumen covered by an atypical noncolumnar epithelium, which does not present a uniform phenotype even between different epithelial regions from the same patient (eg, the two facing epithelia in Figure 1D′). In certain regions, epithelial cells are large and noncohesive (Figure 1C′ and D′), while in other territories, they display a flattened phenotype with very little cytoplasm (Figure 1D′ and E′); cells are almost invariably ciliated. The intensity of anti-DLX5 staining is generally low or at the limit of detection (Figure 1C–D′), but occasionally (Figure 1E and E′), a clear signal can be detected in the cytoplasm and in perinuclear regions, while nuclei are mostly negative; frequently, epithelia are constituted by a mixture of DLX5-positive and DLX5-negative (arrows in Figure 1E′) cells.

### Lamotrigine extended-release (lamotrigine) [^114RwuRk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjustments to the Maintenance Dose of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:

(1) Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold over the recommended target maintenance dose to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level.

(2) Starting Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women taking a stable dose of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Table 1) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets should be necessary.

Primary outcomes

Longitudinal plot of primary outcome measurements in each trial group

Error bars indicate the SE. NRS = numerical rating scale

Point estimates and CIs from the prespecified sensitivity analyses and further analyses from the repeated-measures model were consistent with the primary analysis (appendix pp 2–3). There was no evidence of varying effect in the three prespecified subgroup analyses (appendix p 4).

No significant differences were noted in the proportion of women who had a reduction in NRS scores from baseline or any other patient-reported secondary outcomes (table 3). Women in the gabapentin group reported they were taking fewer painkillers, but these differences were not significant (appendix p 5).

Table 3
Secondary outcomes

A higher proportion of women had a serious adverse event in the gabapentin group (10 [7%] of 153) than in the placebo group (3 [2%] of 153; p = 0·04; table 4). One participant who was on gabapentin died of a complication of pneumonia which was exacerbated by other comorbidities, but this was not considered related to study participation. Known side-effects (as reported in the summary of product characteristics) of dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances were more common in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (table 4), but did not appear to prompt greater use of health-care resources (appendix p 7).

Table 4
Summary of reported side-effects and adverse events

Adherence to the study drug was similar between both the gabapentin and placebo groups (101 [90%] in the gabapentin group compared with 101 [93%] in the placebo group). A detailed breakdown of the extent of self-reported adherence to the study drug is shown in the appendix (p 8). The overall median dose taken daily per week was calculated for each group and is presented in the appendix (p 9). The doses used during the escalation phase were equal between the groups, thereafter the participants in the gabapentin group generally took one capsule (300 mg) more than those in the placebo group throughout the treatment period. At week 4, the median maximum tolerated number of tablets was equivalent to 2100 mg in both groups, although this reached 2700 mg (maximum permitted dose) in future weeks for some women.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of GABARONE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hepatobiliary Disorders: jaundice

Investigations: elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests

Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyponatremia

Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorder: rhabdomyolysis

Nervous System Disorders: movement disorder

Psychiatric Disorders: agitation

Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: breast enlargement, changes in libido, ejaculation disorders and anorgasmia

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], bullous pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

There are postmarketing reports of life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression in patients taking GABARONE with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Adverse reactions following the abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin have also been reported. The most frequently reported reactions were anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, and sweating.

Limitations

Firstly, the participants for this study were recruited through clinics and advertisements and no attempt was made to age or sex match the groups resulting in groups with characteristic ages and sex for each medical condition. No attempt was made to control for stage of menstrual cycle, 80, 81 oral contraceptive, testosterone levels, 82, 83, 84 or hormone replacement therapy use, 85, 86 for the duration of chronic pain symptoms or for periods of pain exacerbation or remission due to practical considerations. Although this increases the generalizability of our results as it more accurately reflects the patient population, we also acknowledge that there are known differences in fMRI pain processing between genders, 87, 88 age 89, 90, 91 groups, and hormonal mechanisms, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 which may have influences our results. However, we did control for factors, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which may alter blood flow dynamics and cause confounding and we also excluded patients on medications which are thought to the effect of blood flow dynamics such as antiepileptic, antipsychotic, and anxiolytic medications, such as gabapentin. 28, 92, 93 Even with these measures, the age difference between the groups maybe important as age‐related changes in brain volume in areas involved in pain processing 31, 89 and DNIC responses 31 have been identified. Similar changes to brain volume and pain processing have also been associated with pain duration, which may also have affected our results. 94, 95, 96 Visceral and cutaneous hypersensitivity is known only to affect a subset of patients with IBS. 97 In our study, we did not investigate or select our patients based on this phenomenon. This again may have influenced our results as we may not have had sufficient power to detect altered cutaneous sensitivity between our groups.

Anti-epileptic drugs

Anti-epileptic drugs (AED) are widely used in clinical practice, and their indications go beyond epilepsy treatment. Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of fractures. Several factors are involved such as reduced BMD, impaired bone quality (due to osteoporosis and/or osteomalacia), increased risk of falls, and the occurrence of traumatic fractures associated with seizures or loss of consciousness. The impact of the trauma during a seizure is important; when seizure-related fractures are excluded, the risk of fractures in epilepsy is only increased by 30%. Epilepsy usually requires long-term treatment with AED. AED use is associated with a decrease in BMD and an increased risk of fractures.

AEDs can be classified according to their ability to induce cytochrome P450 (CYP450). The inductors of CYP450 enzymes are phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and primidone. They accelerate vitamin D metabolism and therefore decrease plasma levels of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. This effect might lead to a secondary increase in PTH. Most studies with carbamazepine have reported normal levels of serum calcium. In contrast, phenytoin and phenobarbital have been associated with hypocalcemia and in vitro studies suggest an inhibition of cellular response to PTH by both anticonvulsants. Oxcarbazepine has a limited effect in inducing CYP450. Conversely, other AEDs do not induce CYP450 enzymes, such as valproate, lamotrigine, clonazepam, gabapentin, and topiramate. Despite no enzymatic induction, valproate has been associated with an increase in bone turnover, but the mechanism is unclear. Lamotrigine has not been associated with changes in BMD or BTMs. Benzodiazepines have been associated with an increased risk of fractures, but there are no data on BTMs. Gabapentin has been associated with a decrease in BMD but changes in BTMs have not been reported. Topiramate has been associated with mild hypocalcemia, lower bicarbonate concentration and an increase in bone turnover. Table 12 summarizes the effect of AED on BTMs.

### Serum levels of allopregnanolone, progesterone and testosterone in menstrually-related and postmenopausal migraine: a cross-sectional study [^116kfYob]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Women suffering from migraine presented low serum levels of allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that modulates GABAergic inhibition. In this context, the increased cortical excitability found in migraine may not be sufficiently offset by the allopregnanolone-mediated enhancement of the GABAergic transmission. Consequently, the reduced GABAergic inhibition could inadequately protect women with migraine against inflammatory and algogenic stimuli. In particular, it could contribute to menstrually-related migraine and persistence of migraine even after menopause. Moreover, serum levels of allopregnanolone, in our study carried out in the clinic, were inversely related to the years and frequency of migraine, also indicating an anti-migraine and not only analgesic action of this neurosteroid.

Our findings, obtained in a pilot study, if confirmed in larger case series, could provide the background for novel therapies aimed at raising the GABAergic transmission by drugs increasing the biosynthetic pathway of inhibitory neurosteroids or by the use of synthetic allopregnanolone analogues for the treatment of both menstrually-related and postmenopausal migraine.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111jphoy]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — carbamazepine, gabapentin, and valproic acid: Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder, and if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, but before using as an adjunct, the clinician should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential, and there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

### High-dose gabapentin equal to estrogen for hot flashes… [^1142QL3v]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is high-dose gabapentin as effective as usual-dose estrogen for the treatment of postmenopausal hot flashes. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. Synopsis: The authors recruited menopausal women 35 to 60 years of age who each had at least 50 moderate to severe hot flashes weekly for at least two months. Any treatments for hot flashes, including hormones, were discontinued for at least one month before enrollment in the study. Sixty women were randomized to gabapentin 2, 400 mg daily, conjugated equine estrogen 0. 625 mg daily, or placebo. The gabapentin was titrated over 12 days to a total of two 400-mg capsules three times daily. Women recorded their hot flashes in a diary and indicated the severity of each one on a visual analog scale.

The number of hot flashes was multiplied by the severity of each over the course of a week to obtain a composite hot flash score. The composite scores at 12 weeks were compared with baseline scores. The gabapentin group had a mean reduction of 71 percent, the estrogen group had a mean reduction of 72 percent, and the placebo group's score dropped 54 percent. There was no statistical difference between the gabapentin and estrogen groups. Five women dropped out during the study, including one in the gabapentin group because of side effects. Bottom Line: In this small study, high-dose gabapentin was as effective as the usual dose of conjugated equine estrogens for the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Larger studies are needed to confirm this result.

### Pilot study comparing hypnotherapy and gabapentin for hot flashes… [^114JzTnC]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Pilot Study Comparing Hypnotherapy and Gabapentin for Hot Flashes. ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. Premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy are at risk for experiencing premature menopause because of their treatment. The resulting symptoms, most notably hot flashes, can cause significant detriment to a patient's quality of life. Treatment for menopausal symptoms with the gold standard of hormone replacement therapy is not done routinely as it is unclear whether it can increase risk of tumor recurrence. Our study hypothesis is that hypnotherapy will be more effective than gabapentin in the control of hot flashes in this population. Roughly half of women diagnosed with pre-menopausal breast cancer will have hormone receptor-positive tumors, which will make them candidates for anti-estrogen therapies. Both endocrine therapy and ovarian ablation have also been shown to improve outcomes in this population.

Hot flashes are a frequent side effect in women receiving anti-estrogen therapy for breast cancer, and have been shown to have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. For example, it has been reported that hot flashes in breast cancer survivors are more severe and result in a more significant impact on quality of life measures when compared with healthy women. Gabapentin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analogue commonly used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain. There is some evidence to demonstrate its efficacy in hot flashes to be equivalent to estrogen and superior to antidepressants in postmenopausal women. In a pilot study of 22 women with breast cancer on tamoxifen, the use of gabapentin for four weeks reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 44. 2%, and decreased the hot flash severity scores by
52. 6%.

These results were confirmed in a larger study of 420 breast cancer survivors who were randomized to receive gabapentin 300mg/d, gabapentin 900mg/d, or placebo.
