## Question

gout vs pseudgout management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison of gout versus pseudogout management across diagnosis, acute flares, and chronic care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to establish the diagnostic distinction with crystal analysis as the foundation. Then, I should compare acute flare management across both conditions and note any meaningful differences, including biologic therapy. Next, I will contrast chronic or preventive strategies, especially the treat-to-target paradigm in gout versus the lack of crystal-lowering therapy in pseudogout. After that, I should consider special populations such as patients with chronic kidney disease and inpatient settings. Finally, I need to review the role of imaging in diagnosis and monitoring, synthesize the key divergences, and lay out a pragmatic decision framework with careful self-verification throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because management diverges only after crystals are correctly identified, and I should not jump ahead without that anchor; monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are negatively birefringent and needle-shaped in gout, whereas calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals are rhomboid and positively birefringent in pseudogout, and EULAR emphasizes synovial fluid analysis for crystals in all patients with suspected gout, which by extension is essential to distinguish CPPD as well, with the caveat that coexistent MSU and CPPD can occur and mislead management if not recognized [^113MrCC1] [^115sfjFm] [^113sCKrm] [^114XRhJ1].

> Wait, let me verify the safety context around aspiration and infection because I need to ensure we do not miss septic arthritis; synovial fluid analysis should include crystal identification and standard infection workup, and although synovial WBC counts below 50,000 cells/μL in the presence of MSU crystals are generally not suspicious for sepsis, this threshold does not rule out infection in immunocompromised hosts, so serial cultures and clinical vigilance remain prudent [^113sCKrm].

> Next, I should review acute flare management across both conditions, and I need to check that the similarities hold while acknowledging guideline-based nuance; NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids are first-line options for acute gout and are also used for pseudogout, with high-quality evidence supporting prompt anti-inflammatory therapy and preference for low-dose colchicine given comparable efficacy and fewer adverse events, and for refractory or contraindicated cases, IL-1 inhibitors can be considered with EULAR recommending their use in gout flares for patients who cannot take NSAIDs, colchicine, or steroids, while anakinra shows high response rates in hospitalized patients with gout and somewhat lower, but still meaningful, responses in pseudogout [^111ZX6nR] [^112iwfhS] [^112ZXcoP] [^1139UKZq] [^112FzH6P] [^112FzH6P] [^113gR76y].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific dosing signals that guide acute gout therapy because precise regimens matter; EULAR recommends colchicine within 12 hours of flare onset with a 1 mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg one hour later, or NSAIDs with gastroprotection as appropriate, or a short course of oral or intra-articular corticosteroids, and ACP recommends low-dose colchicine when colchicine is chosen, all of which align with the principle that early, adequately dosed anti-inflammatory therapy improves outcomes [^1139UKZq] [^111ZX6nR] [^116D1smR].

> Now, I will contrast chronic and preventive strategies because this is where the pathways truly diverge; gout requires disease-modifying urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with a treat-to-target approach aiming for serum urate below 6 mg/dL for all patients and below 5 mg/dL for severe disease with tophi or frequent flares, with xanthine oxidase inhibitors as first-line agents and escalation, switching, or combination strategies if targets are not met, whereas pseudogout lacks a crystal-lowering therapy or serum target and is managed symptomatically with attention to potential metabolic contributors, and I should note explicitly that this corpus does not provide pseudogout-specific chronic management guidelines, which limits definitive protocolization for CPPD prevention in these references [^1172bSbo] [^116Rkf8r] [^1161UGP6] [^114Ny1jR] [^112yeJDc] [^112Enj59].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought EULAR 2017 might include a chronic CPPD roadmap similar to gout's treat-to-target, but I should double-check the provided sources; on review, the documents focus on gout ULT indications, targets, and escalation, including pegloticase only for severe tophaceous gout refractory to maximal therapy, and there is no analogous CPPD crystal-lowering or monitoring target in this corpus, so I will correct my assumption and confine pseudogout chronic management here to symptomatic strategies and addressing comorbid contributors without a serum biochemical endpoint [^117MAsf7] [^116pbGMm] [^114eRei8].

> I need to ensure special population considerations are addressed, especially CKD where therapy choices and dosing change; the ACR recommends xanthine oxidase inhibitors over probenecid for gout with CKD stage 3 or worse, colchicine and NSAIDs require dose adjustment or avoidance in severe renal impairment, and in complex inpatient scenarios or when comorbidities limit standard options, anakinra appears effective and well tolerated for both gout and pseudogout according to retrospective data, albeit with somewhat higher response rates in gout, which I should interpret cautiously given study design [^111rpjV8] [^114WSd67] [^112FzH6P].

> Next, I should review the role of imaging because it influences diagnosis and monitoring, but I must verify the circumstances under which imaging can substitute for aspiration; EULAR 2024 recommends using ultrasound or dual-energy CT (DECT) to assess MSU deposition to predict future flares and to monitor crystal burden, recognizes the double contour sign as a highly specific indicator on ultrasound, and even allows that when characteristic MSU imaging features are present, synovial fluid analysis may not be necessary to confirm gout, whereas the provided documents do not offer parallel advanced imaging recommendations specific to pseudogout, which limits CPPD imaging-based management guidance in this set [^1135oGx4] [^11563DPg] [^117WvgfB] [^115sXLbA] [^113VckzR].

> Let me synthesize the key management distinctions so we do not lose the forest for the trees; both gout and pseudogout rely on anti-inflammatory therapy for acute flares, but gout has more robust, specific dosing guidance and a clearer escalation to IL-1 inhibitors in refractory cases, while the fundamental divergence is chronic care where gout mandates lifelong ULT with treat-to-target serum urate thresholds and structured escalation including XO inhibitors, uricosurics, and biologic uricase in select refractory cases, whereas pseudogout lacks a crystal-lowering therapy and defined biochemical targets in these references, emphasizing symptomatic control and comorbidity management instead [^1139UKZq] [^112ZXcoP] [^1172bSbo] [^114Ny1jR] [^117MAsf7].

> I will now lay out a decision framework, but hold on, I should verify that each branch aligns with the cited evidence; if synovial fluid shows MSU crystals, follow a gout-specific algorithm with acute anti-inflammatory therapy, initiate ULT when indicated, use anti-inflammatory prophylaxis during ULT initiation, and titrate to target serum urate with monitoring and escalation as needed, whereas if CPPD crystals are present, treat the acute flare with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids and consider IL-1 blockade when standard options are contraindicated or ineffective, recognizing that in this corpus there is no CPPD-specific chronic crystal-lowering endpoint, and if crystals are unclear, consider ultrasound or DECT for gout, which can at times obviate aspiration when findings are characteristic, while re-evaluating for pseudogout or alternative diagnoses when imaging is negative [^112iwfhS] [^112D3qBA] [^111dWSet] [^114EdBSE] [^1139UKZq] [^112ZXcoP] [^1135oGx4] [^117WvgfB].

---

Gout and pseudogout require distinct long-term strategies: **gout needs urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent flares and joint damage** [^1172bSbo] [^115ytto4], while **pseudogout does not require ULT** and focuses on flare control and comorbidity management. Both use NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids for acute flares, but **colchicine is less effective in pseudogout**. Gout care includes treat-to-target urate goals [^114Ny1jR], prophylaxis when starting ULT [^111dWSet], and lifestyle changes [^116oGup9]; pseudogout management emphasizes comorbidity control and patient education.

---

## Acute flare management

### Gout

- **First-line therapies**: NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids; start within 24 hours of flare onset [^111ZX6nR] [^1139UKZq].
- **Colchicine dosing**: 1 mg loading dose, then 0.5 mg one hour later on day 1; lower doses in renal impairment [^1139UKZq] [^111zAZ1i].
- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Consider for frequent flares with contraindications to standard therapy [^112ZXcoP] [^113gR76y].

---

### Pseudogout

For acute pseudogout flares, **NSAIDs or corticosteroids are first-line**, as colchicine is less effective than in gout. Colchicine can be used for prophylaxis in recurrent flares, but its **efficacy is limited**.

---

## Long-term management

### Gout

- **Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)**: Indicated for recurrent flares, tophi, chronic arthropathy, or renal stones [^1172bSbo] [^114eRei8].
- **First-line ULT**: Allopurinol or febuxostat; titrate to serum urate < 6 mg/dL, or < 5 mg/dL in severe disease [^114Ny1jR] [^112yeJDc] [^115ytto4].
- **Prophylaxis**: Low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs during ULT initiation to prevent flares [^114EdBSE] [^112D3qBA].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, reduced alcohol, low-purine diet, and comorbidity management [^114wQZpP] [^116oGup9].

---

### Pseudogout

- **No ULT**: ULT is not indicated, as pseudogout is not driven by hyperuricemia.
- **Comorbidity management**: Address metabolic or endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis).
- **Patient education**: Emphasize recognition and prompt treatment of flares [^1164mKu3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

| **Parameter** | **Gout** | **Pseudogout** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum urate | Regular monitoring; target < 6 mg/dL [^1161UGP6] [^114Ny1jR] | Not applicable |
| Imaging | Ultrasound or DECT to monitor crystal burden [^1135oGx4] | Limited role |
| Comorbidities | Regular assessment and management [^112JoYeD] | Focus on metabolic/endocrine disorders |

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

For gout, emphasize **ULT adherence and lifestyle changes** [^114wQZpP] [^116oGup9]; for pseudogout, emphasize **flare recognition and comorbidity management**.

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **Gout** | **Pseudogout** |
|-|-|-|
| Crystal type | Monosodium urate [^1119KM5h] | Calcium pyrophosphate [^113sCKrm] |
| Chronic therapy | ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat) [^115ytto4] | No ULT |
| Acute therapy | NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids [^111ZX6nR] | NSAIDs, corticosteroids |
| Prophylaxis | Colchicine or NSAIDs during ULT initiation [^111dWSet] | Limited role |
| Monitoring | Serum urate, imaging [^1161UGP6] [^1135oGx4] | Comorbidity management |

---

Gout management centers on **ULT** with treat-to-target urate goals and prophylaxis, whereas pseudogout focuses on acute flare control and comorbidity management **without ULT** [^114Ny1jR] [^111dWSet].

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^116e2Wc6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in patients with chronically elevated uric acid levels. The term gout comes from the Latin "gutta" (drop), which is thought to relate to the concept of an imbalance of humors flowing into a joint. This condition affects approximately 4% of the adult population in the United States and has a variety of associated risk factors, including certain medications, dietary factors, and medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, obesity, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and lead exposure.

Acute manifestations of gout include a painful, swollen joint that can either be mistaken for septic arthritis or concurrently infected, whereas chronic tophaceous deposits can cause periarticular bony erosions and damage to surrounding nerves and tendons. Orthopaedic surgeons are likely to encounter both acute and chronic gout over the course of their careers. This article will review the pathophysiology and medical treatment of gout, along with the surgical treatment of gout in the upper and lower extremity and spine.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. Part II: Management. Report of a task force of the EULAR Standing Committee for International Clinical Studies Including Therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The objective was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout. The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence-based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorized according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Twelve key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. These propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (such as weight loss if obese, reduced alcohol consumption, and a low animal purine diet), and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasized. Recommended drugs for acute attacks included oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long-term ULT (ES = 1.39).

### We can make gout management more successful now [^112N9Jrm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Numerous publications document deficits in the management and clinical outcomes of gout despite a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

The recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

- **Recent findings**: For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. All guidelines recommend using a low dose of colchicine. Intra-articular, oral, or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective.

- **Management of hyperuricemia**: Indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring a lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favor, with most guidelines favoring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is disagreement about the timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to a target serum urate (sUA) level of less than 6 mg/dl, and less than 5 mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Most guidelines agree on the recommendations for managing gout, and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^111uCu5B]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In general, diagnosis of gout is achieved by clinical findings and laboratory analysis. There are no specific radiographic findings present in an acute gout flare, whereas chronically affected joints may show periarticular erosions with sclerotic margins. MRI will also show bony erosions (if present), bone marrow and/or soft-tissue edema, synovial pannus, and gouty tophi in chronic cases. Tophi may appear hypointense or isointense on T1, with variable signals on T2, and enhance homogeneously with contrast.

Ultrasonography of gouty arthropathy will show effusions, synovitis, and even MSU crystals themselves. The ultrasonographic double-contour sign refers to irregular hyperechoic enhancement of the articular surface representing MSU crystal deposition that has been described in patients with chronic gout and subcutaneous nodules on physical examination. More recently, dual-energy CT (DECT), an imaging method that differentiates materials "based on their relative absorption of X-rays at different photon energy levels", has been used to identify patterns of MSU crystal deposition via color coding and can be useful in atypical presentations of gout or monitoring chronic gout over time.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^115CEZZ1]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Gout progresses through several classic disease stages and corresponding clinical manifestations. In some cases, advanced disease stages and complications can appear prematurely, without earlier disease stages or clinical manifestations being apparent, such as tophaceous gout without prior gout flares, although this pattern is uncommon. MSU, monosodium urate. Adapted from ref. Springer Nature Limited.

Care for people with gout and CKD presents important challenges. For instance, the clinical presentation of gout in this high-risk, comorbid population is variable, with a higher frequency of atypical presentations than in those without CKD. However, quality evidence to guide the management of gout in people with CKD is lacking, owing at least in part to the exclusion of people with CKD from trials of gout therapies, failure to report results stratified by renal function, and inconsistencies in the outcome measures used and reported. The resultant knowledge gaps have contributed to concerns regarding gout treatment efficacy and safety, some of which are legitimate and others questionable.

Use of ULT in the context of advanced CKD varies greatly among rheumatologists, nephrologists, and generalists, and professional bodies have issued conflicting recommendations regarding the treatment of gout in people with concomitant CKD. These inconsistencies frequently result in confusion and, consequently, suboptimal gout management with failure to achieve recommended target urate levels. Moreover, pharmacological options for treating gout flares and…

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114m1nrX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

The expert panel consisted of 20 members, including 19 physicians with a clinical and/or research interest in gout (17 clinical rheumatologists and 2 primary care physicians) and an epidemiologist/biostatistician. The panel was diverse, with 9 members from the US, 8 from Europe, 2 from New Zealand, and 1 from Mexico. A total of 133 paper cases were submitted by the expert panel, along with 79 clinical rheumatologists and general internists.

Based on the review of Phase 1 data and a ranking exercise with 30 cases representing low to high probability of gout, initial key factors important for classifying gout were identified. These included the presence of MSU crystals, pattern of joint involvement, intensity of symptomatic episodes, time to maximal pain and to resolution, episodic nature of symptoms, presence of clinical tophus, level of serum urate, imaging features, response to treatment, family history, and risk factors or associated comorbidities. The last three factors were not considered further, as they are not features of gout itself, despite their association with the condition. Inclusion of risk factors or comorbidities in the definition of gout would preclude future studies evaluating their association with gout.

Entry, sufficient, and exclusion criteria

Before defining domains and domain categories (the classification criteria), we established entry, sufficient, and exclusion criteria. The entry criteria aimed to identify the relevant patient population to whom the classification criteria would be applied. The sufficient criteria were intended to define characteristics necessary for classification.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to the management of acute flares, the 2017 BSR guidelines recommend initiating an NSAID at the maximum dose or colchicine in doses of 500 mcg 2–4 times daily as first-line therapy. The drug choice should depend on patient preference, renal function, and comorbidities, if not contraindicated. A gastroprotective agent should be co-prescribed in patients on NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of gout [^114KMSzy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is an ancient disease that has caused pain and suffering over many centuries. The tragedy is that today we have excellent medication for the prevention of chronic gout, yet many people continue to be plagued by gout attacks and develop chronic arthritis. The incidence of gout is increasing worldwide, which is related to aging and lifestyle changes. Gout is more prevalent in people with metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of diuretics, and intake of beer and sugared drinks.

This video and associated PowerPoint presentations should help anyone who manages patients with gout to understand how to elicit a good history, examine them, and generate a differential diagnosis. The emphasis is to understand the causes of gout and take a proactive role (see online supplementary video and file). The good news is that gout can improve with lifestyle changes, and medication is relatively inexpensive.

### Recent pharmacological advances in the management of gout [^116FjgP5]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and reports show that despite the availability of therapies, management is still suboptimal. The new EULAR 2016 recommendations for the treatment of gout highlight the significant development in gout therapies, and the number of drugs being trialled continues to increase. A clinical review of the evidence underlying the EULAR recommendations can reveal possible gaps in the literature and avenues for future research into gout therapies.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114XQYwy]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). High credibility.

The existing criteria for the classification of gout have suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity and were developed at a time when advanced imaging was not available. This effort was undertaken to develop new classification criteria for gout.

- **Methods**: An international group of investigators, supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, conducted a systematic review of the literature on advanced imaging of gout. They also conducted a diagnostic study using monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophus as the gold standard. Additionally, they carried out a ranking exercise involving paper patient cases and a multicriterion decision analysis exercise. These data formed the basis for developing the classification criteria, which were tested in an independent data set.

- **Results**: The entry criterion for the new classification criteria requires at least one episode of peripheral joint or bursal swelling, pain, or tenderness. The presence of MSU crystals in a symptomatic joint/bursa (i.e. synovial fluid) or in a tophus suffices for classification as having gout and does not require further scoring. The domains of the new classification criteria include clinical (e.g. pattern of joint/bursa involvement, characteristics, and time course of symptomatic episodes), laboratory (e.g. serum urate, MSU‐negative synovial fluid aspirate), and imaging (e.g. double‐contour sign on ultrasound or urate on dual‐energy computed tomography, radiographic gout‐related erosion).

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The epidemiology, diagnosis, and optimal management of gout present significant challenges.

The second challenge is the correct diagnosis of gout. Gout often initially manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis and progresses to chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares in later years. Arthritis may also be accompanied by tophi and renal stones. The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven diagnosis of gout are low. Given the involvement of the great toe and other lower extremity joints in conditions such as osteoarthritis and pseudogout, a presumptive diagnosis of gout based solely on big toe pain and borderline high or high serum urate levels can be problematic (refer to Figure 8).

Incorporating documentation of additional clinical features such as acute synovitis, radiographic signs of overhanging margins, and punched-out erosions typical of gout, while also considering features of differential diagnoses like osteoarthritis, pseudogout, and rheumatoid arthritis will often aid in an accurate diagnosis of gout. The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria for classifying acute gouty arthritis are often used for clinical diagnosis. However, these criteria prove inadequate for diagnosis in about 21% of office cases. Hence, aspirating the joint, bursa, or tophus and confirming the diagnosis is critical, as the presence of urate crystals in synovial fluid definitively confirms gout. This confirmation is crucial since the treatment for gout is often a lifelong journey.

Laboratory Analysis

The benchmark for the diagnosis of gout is the appearance of negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals in synovial fluid or tophaceous material under polarized light microscopy. This is in contrast to CPPD crystals, which will appear rhomboid-shaped and positively birefringent. In addition to crystal analysis, synovial fluid samples should always be sent for cell count with differential, Gram stain, and culture. Synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) counts under 50,000 cells/μL (or mm³) in the presence of MSU crystals are generally not suspicious for septic arthritis. Special attention must be paid even in cases of synovial WBC below this level if patients are immunocompromised and unable to mount the immune response of a high synovial fluid WBC count. Additionally, ruptured tophi with overlying skin ulceration should increase suspicion for possible coinfection. Synovial fluid cultures should be followed over time even in patients with low suspicion of infection, and Gram stains have a high positive predictive value but cannot exclude septic arthritis if negative.

In addition to aspiration, other laboratory tests can help confirm a diagnosis of suspected gout. C-reactive protein (CRP) is usually increased during a gout flare and can be quite high, although a high CRP alone is nonspecific. In other words, a high CRP alone does not necessarily mean that septic arthritis is present, whereas a CRP under 100 mg/dL in the setting of a lower synovial fluid WBC count and the presence of MSU crystals is generally consistent with gout.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^115qVvr2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality, and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

- **Recent findings**: Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate. However, they can still have some contribution to population-attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for managing hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare, and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well-tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Although there have been significant advances in understanding the risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is a substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases from their inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes such as results of laboratory and radiographic tests (serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis, and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making, including additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management; short-term clinical outcomes, like pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the ACP grading system, based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

- **Recommendation**: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### A point-of-care Raman spectroscopy-based device for the diagnosis of gout and pseudogout: Comparison with the clinical standard microscopy [^111Yq8km]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the usefulness of a novel medical device based on Raman spectroscopy for the rapid point-of-care diagnosis of gout and pseudogout, a shoebox-sized point-of-care Raman spectroscopy (POCRS) device was developed. This device includes a disposable syringe microfiltration kit to collect arthropathic crystals from synovial fluid and a customized automated Raman spectroscopy system to chemically identify crystal species.

Diagnosis according to the findings of POCRS was compared with the clinical standard diagnosis based on compensated polarized light microscopy (CPLM) of synovial fluid aspirates collected from symptomatic patients (n = 174). Kappa coefficients were used to measure the agreement between POCRS and CPLM findings.

Overall, POCRS and CPLM results were consistent in 89.7% of samples (156 of 174). For the diagnosis of gout, the kappa coefficient for POCRS and CPLM was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.75–0.94). For the diagnosis of pseudogout, the kappa coefficient for POCRS and CPLM was 0.61 (95% CI 0.42–0.81).

Kappa coefficients indicated that there was excellent agreement between POCRS and CPLM for the diagnosis of gout, with good agreement for the diagnosis of pseudogout. The POCRS device holds the potential to standardize and expedite the time to clinical diagnosis of gout and pseudogout, especially in settings where certified operators trained for CPLM analysis are not available.

### Therapeutic advances in gout [^116xcbwS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight recent developments in the management of gout. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gout from EULAR, quality of care indicators, and outcome measures for clinical trials have been published. The standards of gout diagnosis and management are very low. Allopurinol remains the mainstay for serum uric acid-lowering therapy. In an important percentage of patients receiving allopurinol, serum uric acid levels are insufficient to promote crystal dissolution. Febuxostat, a new serum uric acid-lowering drug, has shown good results. Information on uricase continues to appear. For the treatment of gouty inflammation, etoricoxib (a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor) has been shown to be as effective as indomethacin. Finally, the association of gout with the metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities, and the newly described association of gout with myocardial infarction, bring lifestyle and dietary modifications to the forefront in the management of gout.

Proper gout management requires changes to the physician's attitude towards the disease; essentially: (1) an unequivocal diagnosis based on urate crystal identification, (2) a clearly settled aim of the treatment: crystal elimination from the joints and elsewhere, and (3) proper use of the available therapeutic alternatives. Promoting a proper lifestyle appears to be especially important.

### Casebook consults: Improving outcomes in gout (multimedia activity) [^112j9Uc5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic, potentially debilitating condition characterized by an inflammatory process in the joints or periarticular tissues that results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment can lead to the development of tophi and chronic arthropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of gout can be made on the basis of the clinical presentation as well as risk factors such as metabolic syndrome.

Key conditions to rule out in the differential diagnosis are septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), fracture, and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute flares of gout should be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids. With a diagnosis of gout, if urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is required, prophylaxis should be considered with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID, followed by the addition of ULT. The goal of ULT is to reach a serum uric acid (SUA) level ≤ 6.0 mg/dL.

Measurements of SUA should be obtained after resolution of an acute attack, then periodically to facilitate titration of the ULT dose to achieve the target SUA level. Studies have confirmed significant reductions in gout attacks among patients who have attained SUA levels ≤ 6.0 mg/dL with ULT. Patient education concerning the disease and its treatment is essential to ensure close adherence to recommended therapies.

Patients should also understand that ULT is intended as long-term, and for most patients, lifelong therapy to maximize the prospects for control of the disease. Clinicians should feel confident in making a presumptive diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment.

Regarding medical management for gout, specifically in relation to anti-inflammatory therapy, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day, reduced in cases of renal impairment) as first-line prophylactic treatment. It is important to recognize the potential for neurotoxicity and/or muscular toxicity with prophylactic colchicine in patients with renal impairment or those on statin therapy. Co-prescribing colchicine with strong P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.

### Computational lexical analysis of the language commonly used to describe gout [^114z4Las]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Using these methods, we analyzed our reference corpus with an emphasis on three elements of health care language: disease language (e.g. symptoms, disease names), treatment language (e.g. mechanism of action), and success language (e.g. goals, treatment targets).

- **Disease language**: Terms suspected to have the greatest relevance to practicing clinicians were identified, including gout, gouty arthritis, hyperuricemia, intercritical gout, gouty arthropathy, and podagra. Various analyses were conducted on these terms, with a particular focus on the term gout. Statistically derived collocation analysis of the term gout is presented in Table 2. The collocates are words that occur within a 10‐word window of gout with much greater than chance frequency. For example, given the overall frequency of gout and flares in the corpus, one would expect them to co‐occur 61.606 times (on average) in a corpus of this size if they were randomly distributed. In fact, they co‐occur 1,239 times in this corpus, showing a strong association between the two words. Strong collocates of gout include flares, acute, flare, and attacks. These terms frequently co‐occur with gout but are, in actuality, clinically very distinct from it. Based on this analysis, the word that mostly reflects strongly the meaning of gout is flares, and while this is an accurate term for the physical manifestation of gout, it does not accurately convey the underlying causes of it. In effect, gout is used as an umbrella term that refers to the underlying hyperuricemia, the flares and attacks, and the acute and chronic stages.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1119KM5h]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). High credibility.

Gout, characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) in synovial fluid and other tissues, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. It has a prevalence of 3.9% in the US, 0.9% in France, 1.4–2.5% in the UK, 1.4% in Germany, and 3.2% (European ancestry) to 6.1% (Maori ancestry) in New Zealand. Over the last decade, several new therapies for gout have been approved by regulatory agencies or are currently being tested.

The conduct of trials leading to drug approval, and of observational studies providing insights into risk factors, genetic associations, and the general epidemiology of gout, is critically dependent on the appropriate identification of individuals with gout for inclusion. Classification criteria serve the purpose of enabling standardized assembly of a relatively homogeneous group of individuals with the disease of interest for enrollment into such studies.

There are several existing sets of classification criteria or diagnostic rules for gout, with the most widely used being the 1977 American Rheumatism Association (now the American College of Rheumatology [ACR]) preliminary criteria for the classification of the acute arthritis of primary gout. These preliminary criteria were intended for identifying the acute arthritis of gout and not necessarily for intercritical gout. The spectrum of comparator diseases was limited, and physician diagnosis was the gold standard. In a recent study in which the gold standard was MSU crystal status in synovial fluid or nodule aspiration.

Regarding medical management of gout, specifically for acute flares, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering joint aspiration and administering an intra-articular corticosteroid for patients with acute monoarticular gout. A short course of oral corticosteroids or a single injection of an intramuscular corticosteroid should be considered as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine, and when intra-articular injection is not feasible. Additionally, systemic therapy should be considered for patients with oligo- or polyarticular attacks of gout.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^116UWjgu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with gout flares in the wrist usually present with pain, erythema, and edema. Wrist aspiration is important to differentiate from pseudogout, cellulitis, hematoma, arthritic flare, or septic arthritis. Chronic gout in the wrist may lead to peritendinous tophi, lytic lesions in the carpal bones, and crystal deposition causing intercarpal ligament pathology, including scapholunate dissociation. Arthroscopic intervention in patients with gout and scapholunate ligament issues has shown diffuse radiocarpal and midcarpal synovitis, crystalline deposits, cartilage wear, and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligament disruption.

Surgical intervention of gout in the wrist is reserved for cases with persistent symptoms after medical management. Wrist arthroscopy can be used for synovectomy and evaluation of intercarpal ligamentous integrity and articular surfaces. Ligamentous reconstruction can proceed if the articular surfaces are preserved. If arthritis is present, standard management with salvage procedures such as proximal row carpectomy, intercarpal fusion, or wrist arthrodesis may be indicated. Although reports of concomitant gout and septic arthritis of the wrist are rare, arthroscopic treatment could be considered as an alternative to open synovectomy. A study of 40 septic wrists found that arthroscopic irrigation and débridement had a similarly effective rate of infection treatment with decreased length of stay compared to open treatment. It is imperative that uric acid control continue beyond surgical intervention.

Peritendinous gouty tophi can present in the flexor… (text ends here, please complete as per your original text).

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade, including those from the British Rheumatism Society, the European League Against Rheumatism, the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative, the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism, and the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the existing guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow. The initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate are infrequent. Greater education in proper management and increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management, as well as areas for further research.

- **Summary**: Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers struggle with the appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Management of gout: A systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

- **Purpose**: To review evidence about the treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

- **Data sources**: Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

- **Study selection**: Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

- **Data synthesis**: High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only three of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after one year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy.

### New classification criteria for gout: a framework for progress [^114vWb5j]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

The definitive classification or diagnosis of gout normally relies on the identification of MSU crystals in SF or from tophi. Where microscopic examination of SF is not available or is impractical, the best approach may differ depending on the context. For many types of research, clinical classification criteria are necessary. The increasing prevalence of gout, advances in therapeutics, and the development of international research collaborations to understand the impact, mechanisms, and optimal treatment of this condition emphasize the need for accurate and uniform classification criteria for gout.

Five clinical classification criteria for gout currently exist. However, none of the currently available criteria have been adequately validated. An international project is currently underway to develop new validated gout classification criteria. These criteria will be an essential step forward to advance the research agenda in the modern era of gout management.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^114VAGCC]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2022). High credibility.

Gout is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in patients with chronically elevated blood levels of uric acid. It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in the United States and is often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. Initial presentation is usually an acutely warm, swollen joint, most commonly the first metatarsophalangeal joint, but a variety of locations may be affected. The main treatment for gout is medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels. However, surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. Based on the literature at the time of writing, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities affecting outcomes in these patients should be considered.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^112iYRcF]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

An acute gout flare presents as a painful, swollen joint. Patients may complain of severe throbbing pain at night, waking them from sleep, and pain with ambulation if the foot and ankle are affected. They may note having had similar symptoms during previous gout flares if the condition is longstanding. There may be a recent trigger, such as dehydration, alcohol/purine ingestion, illness, or a surgical procedure.

On examination, patients may have fever, pain with active and passive range of motion of the affected joint, tenderness to palpation, warmth, and erythema. Chronic tophaceous gout appears as subcutaneous nodules that are normally painless but become painful during a flare. The skin overlying the nodules may erode, revealing chalky tophaceous material. Ulceration over a gouty tophus is a risk factor for superinfection. Gout flares can occur in any joint but most commonly occur in the foot and ankle, specifically the first metatarsophalangeal joint.

If a patient with a painful, swollen joint has a history of gout and similar symptoms from previous flares, a gout flare is likely. In the case of no known previous gout history, atypical symptoms, or other risk factors for infection such as immunocompromise or overlying skin ulceration, gout diagnosis must be confirmed with aspiration to rule out septic arthritis, superinfected gout, or a different crystalline arthropathy such as pseudogout/calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^116TDyzM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

As with most diseases, there is a gradient of probability of truly having the disease based on signs and symptoms. The threshold chosen for this classification criteria set yielded the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. While for certain purposes a higher sensitivity (lower score) may be preferable, such as a general population survey to determine the public health burden of gout for resource planning, a higher specificity (higher score) may be desirable for others, such as genetic association studies in which accurate phenotyping is critical. Furthermore, classification criteria are not intended to characterize the severity of the disease, but only its presence. Additionally, classification criteria should be applied only to the intended population — those who meet the entry criteria. Performance characteristics of any classification criteria set will necessarily be altered if the criteria are applied to those other than the intended population.

A limitation of our effort is that there is still a relative paucity of data and clinical experience to fully test advanced imaging data empirically. As more studies are published, there may be additional imaging signs and/or modalities found to have sufficient specificity for gout that could be incorporated into future criteria. We also realized that some investigators may not have access to imaging and therefore aimed to develop criteria that would still perform well in the absence of imaging data. In the discrete-choice experiments, the lack of imaging data was weighted the same as for studies performed with negative imaging results.

Regarding the medical management of gout, particularly concerning treatment targets, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend setting a lower serum urate target of less than 5 mg/dL (300 mcmol/L). This is intended to facilitate the faster dissolution of crystals in patients with severe gout, characterized by tophi, chronic arthropathy, and frequent attacks, until total crystal dissolution and resolution of gout are achieved.

### 2018 updated European League Against Rheumatism evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of gout [^11563DPg]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gout, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend considering an ultrasound to establish a diagnosis in patients with suspected gout flare or chronic gouty arthritis. This imaging can detect tophi that are not evident on clinical examination or reveal a double contour sign at cartilage surfaces, which is a highly specific indicator of urate deposits in joints.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114aygdd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Based on the key features identified initially, Phase 1 data, and available published literature, and with a defined population to whom the criteria would apply, the expert panel further developed the pertinent domains and their respective categories in an iterative process. The expert panel aimed to define relevant clinical and imaging parameters to be as specific as possible for gout.

- **Domains and categories**: The domains included clinical parameters (numbers 1–4), laboratory parameters (numbers 5 and 6), and imaging parameters (numbers 7 and 8). The specific domains and their respective definitions are summarized in Table 1. The domains were designed to be scored based on the totality of the subjects' symptomatic disease experience. All of the categories within domains are hierarchical and mutually exclusive, such that if both a higher and a lower category have been fulfilled at different points in time, the higher one should be scored; the highest categories are listed last within each domain.

		Table 1: Definitions and considerations for each domain

Symptomatic episodes were defined as those in which there was swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa. For the pattern of joint involvement, it was agreed that first metatarsophalangeal joint, ankle, or midfoot involvement as part of a polyarticular presentation, though possible in gout, was not specific enough for gout since that pattern could be seen commonly in other disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. The time course of symptomatic episodes was to be considered irrespective of anti-inflammatory treatment.

### 2018 updated European League against rheumatism evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of gout [^116XCZDk]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2020). High credibility.

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2020 guidelines recommend establishing a clinical diagnosis of gout, particularly when synovial fluid analysis is not feasible. This diagnosis is based on several highly suggestive, though not specific, features:

- **Male gender**: Gout is more commonly diagnosed in males.

- **Monoarticular involvement**: In particular, a foot joint, especially the first metatarsophalangeal or ankle joint, is affected.

- **Previous similar acute arthritis episodes**: The recurrence of acute arthritis episodes can be indicative.

- **Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling**: Symptoms often peak within less than 24 hours.

- **Erythema**: Redness of the skin over the affected joint can occur.

- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated levels of uric acid in the blood are often present.

- **Associated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)**: Patients may have concomitant cardiovascular conditions.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^1174vhHc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gout is an increasingly common condition in the United States and is often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. The benchmark for diagnosis is joint aspiration revealing uric acid crystals. Gout flares must be differentiated from septic arthritis and may be concurrently infected. The main treatment for acute and chronic gout is medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels. However, surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. Additionally, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities should be considered. It is important for surgeons to collaborate with rheumatologists for perioperative management.

### Determinants of self-management behavior in gout: A scoping review [^11583uUt]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

This study identified determinants for self-management behavior in gout and provides targets for researchers and policymakers to select and develop evidence- and theory-based interventions targeting patients with gout and their context. Implementing these interventions is expected to increase self-management behavior and thereby improve clinical outcomes. This study reveals the complexity and quantity of determinants that could be targeted to improve and support self-management. Although a complex intervention targeting the specific barriers for self-management of individuals may be most effective, a general intervention could target the COM-B domains by using the education, persuasion, and enablement intervention functions according to the BCW. More information on determinants of self-management behavior other than adherence to receiving ULT, such as lifestyle modifications, care-seeking behavior, and self-monitoring of disease status in gout, are needed to get a complete picture of determinants associated with self-management behavior. To conclude, we identified various modifiable determinants of self-management behavior in patients with gout, which can function as targets for interventions aiming to improve gout care through increased self-management.

### Education and non-pharmacological approaches for gout [^1164mKu3]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of this review are: to highlight the gaps in patient and physician knowledge of gout and how this might impede optimal disease management; to provide recommended core knowledge points that should be conveyed to people with gout; and to review non-pharmacological interventions that can be used in gout management. MeSH terms were used to identify eligible studies examining patients' and health-care professionals' knowledge about gout and its management. A narrative review of non-pharmacological management of gout is provided.

Many health-care professionals have significant gaps in their knowledge about gout that have the potential to impede optimal management. Likewise, people with gout and the general population lack knowledge about causes, consequences, and treatment of this condition. Full explanation about gout, including the potential benefits of urate-lowering treatment (ULT), motivates people with gout to want to start such treatment, and there is evidence, albeit limited, that educational interventions can improve uptake and adherence to ULT.

Additionally, several non-pharmacological approaches, such as rest and topical ice application for acute attacks, avoidance of risk factors that can trigger acute attacks, and dietary interventions that may reduce gout attack frequency (e.g. cherry or cherry juice extract, skimmed milk powder, or omega-3 fatty acid intake) or lower serum uric acid (e.g. vitamin C), can be used as adjuncts to ULT. There is a pressing need to educate health-care professionals, people with gout, and society at large to remove barriers to effective gout management.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels.

Confusion frequently arises because certain medications, such as colchicine, may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Evolution of gout: "malignant" change over time [^112UdR1J]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Gout is a common entity; yet it is such a great mimicker in its imaging features that it can confuse clinicians and radiologists alike, sometimes leading to unnecessary investigations and treatment. We present a case of a 52-year-old male renal transplant patient who presented with a slow-growing mass in his left shin. The initial radiograph demonstrated a non-aggressive looking calcified lesion. A fine needle aspiration demonstrated this lesion to be gout deposition.

The lesion was unchanged in the following eight years until the patient reported a sudden growth in size. Imaging showed features of an aggressive lesion with disruption of the previous calcification as well as enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical excision biopsy was performed in view of the worrisome features on imaging, and the histology showed tophaceous gout. Following the description of our case, we reviewed the clinical and imaging features of gout and discussed its differential diagnoses.

### Gout and coexisting pseudogout in the knee joint [^114XRhJ1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

We report the unusual case of a 63-year-old man with gout and coexisting pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease, affecting the same joint. This report describes the clinical features of the patient and the characteristics of the crystals extracted from his affected joint, examined using compensated polarized microscopy.

- **Methods**: Synovial fluid and specimens from the lateral meniscus of the patient's knee joint, taken during arthroscopy, were analyzed using compensated polarized microscopy to evaluate the presence and type of crystals.

- **Results**: Compensated polarized microscopy revealed both monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals extracted from the knee joint.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that the coexistence of gout and pseudogout should be considered in the diagnosis of crystal-induced arthritis. Careful crystal evaluation using compensated polarized microscopy may reveal similar cases with MSU and CPPD crystals in the same joint.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

- **Methods**: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients following a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^111uZ5vL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Accurate classification of gout without crystal documentation for recruitment into studies is also needed, since the majority of cases of gout are managed in primary or acute care settings, where synovial fluid aspiration and polarizing microscopy are not commonly performed. Additionally, the existing published criteria were developed at a time when advanced imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography or dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), had not been studied; their utility for gout classification in the context of other clinical and laboratory parameters is not known.

To address these issues, an international collaborative working group to develop new classification criteria for gout was convened with the support of the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). The final results are reported here.

Approach to identifying domains and categories.

In Phase 2, an international panel of expert rheumatologists and primary care physicians used a multicriterion decision analytic consensus methodology, informed by data generated in Phase 1, to determine the factors that best discriminated gout from other rheumatic diseases that could conceivably be considered in the differential diagnosis. Such an approach would lead to expert-derived, data-informed weighting of discriminating factors. The specific methods are described below.

Rheumatologists and general internists with an interest in gout submitted paper patient cases of patients for whom gout was in the differential diagnosis, using standardized data collection forms. A subset of 30 paper patient cases was selected to represent a broad spectrum of the probability of gout. Prior to the in-person expert panel meeting, panel members were given the data from Phase 1 to review, and they were asked to rank-order the 30 paper patient cases from lowest to highest probability of having gout.

At the in-person expert panel meeting, held over two days (June 9–10, 2014, in Paris, France, in advance of the EULAR Congress), three concepts were agreed upon a priori. First, the task was to develop criteria that would enable standardized assembly of a well-defined, relatively homogeneous group of subjects representative of persons with gout, for entry into observational studies or clinical trials. Such criteria are not intended to capture all possible patients, but rather to capture the great majority of patients with shared key features of gout.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113jcmxe]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development. The Gout, Hyperuricemia, and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from MSU crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease, with episodic highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can have a substantial impact on an affected individual and the individual's family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurrences of gout flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis, and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occur frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high rate of complications. Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life, and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricaemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dosage. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been questioned.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1111X7CV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). High credibility.

The new ACR/EULAR gout classification criteria represent an international collaborative effort that incorporates the latest published evidence on imaging modalities, a data-driven approach with MSU identification as a gold standard to reference key features, and a decision analytic approach to inform the weighting of the scoring system. This classification criteria set will enable a standardized approach to identifying a relatively homogeneous group of individuals who have the clinical entity of gout for enrollment into studies. The criteria permit characterization of an individual as having gout regardless of whether they are currently experiencing an acute symptomatic episode and regardless of any comorbidities. The new classification criteria have superior performance characteristics, with high sensitivity and improved specificity compared with previously published criteria. Arguably, specificity (leading to high positive predictive value) is of critical importance in most clinical studies since investigators need to have confidence that individuals who are enrolled in a study truly have the condition of interest.

Gout is unlike other rheumatic diseases in that a gold standard assessment is available, namely MSU crystal positivity. While this gold standard has high specificity, its feasibility and sensitivity may be inadequate due to difficulty with aspiration of joints (particularly small ones) and/or examination of the sample under polarizing microscopy. Thus, although MSU crystal results are extremely helpful when positive, they are not always feasible.
