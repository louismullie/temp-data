## Question

A 35-year-old woman presents to the respiratory clinic for follow-up of her asthma. She reports daily symptoms and frequent night-time awakenings despite using a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting beta-agonist (ICS-LABA) combination inhaler as prescribed. Her inhaler technique has been checked and is correct, and she is adherent to her medication. She does not have significant comorbidities such as obesity or chronic rhinosinusitis, and there are no environmental triggers identified. Her asthma control questionnaire score remains high, indicating poor control. Another patient in the clinic, a 28-year-old man, has well-controlled asthma on a low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA).

Based on the provided guideline definitions, how would you classify the severity of asthma in each patient, and what key factors must be considered to distinguish severe asthma from difficult-to-treat asthma?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to classify asthma severity in two patients and to distinguish severe asthma from difficult-to-treat asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern, treatment-based definition of asthma severity. Then, I should verify the criteria that separate severe asthma from difficult-to-treat asthma. Next, I will apply these criteria to the 35-year-old woman and then to the 28-year-old man. Finally, I will synthesize the key differentiators and outline next steps for evaluation and referral, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the contemporary framework for asthma severity, because I need to ensure I'm not using outdated symptom-frequency definitions. Modern severity is assessed retrospectively after at least 2–3 months of treatment, based on the intensity of therapy required to achieve control, not on symptoms alone, and severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, which is the GINA-endorsed approach used widely in guidelines and summaries [^11172PKk] [^115maK4T] [^111XN5KB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the distinction between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma. Difficult-to-treat asthma is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA or requires such therapy to maintain control, often due to modifiable factors like poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, comorbidities, or environmental exposures, whereas severe asthma is a subset in which control remains poor despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, or the disease worsens when high-dose therapy is reduced, and this distinction is consistently emphasized in GINA and allied guidance [^116MLLGt] [^113y545t] [^112dZZQK].

> Now, I will examine the 35-year-old woman's case. She has daily symptoms and frequent nocturnal awakenings with a high ACQ indicating poor control despite high-dose ICS-LABA, correct technique, and confirmed adherence, and without significant comorbidities or identifiable environmental triggers, which fits severe asthma rather than difficult-to-treat asthma because the lack of control persists after optimization of therapy and correction of modifiable factors, and the prevalence of true severe asthma is roughly 3–10% of asthma, aligning with this phenotype [^111Nd8o9] [^113y545t] [^115S3rJq].

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not missing a modifiable contributor. I initially wondered about chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity, but the case explicitly states these are absent, and inhaler technique and adherence have been confirmed, so the residual uncontrolled disease despite high-dose ICS-LABA supports severe asthma rather than difficult-to-treat asthma, and this is precisely the scenario in which phenotype assessment and consideration of add-on therapies, including biologics, are recommended by GINA and specialist pathways [^111Nd8o9] [^116eivKt].

> Next, I should review the 28-year-old man's case. He is well controlled on low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA, which by definition corresponds to mild asthma in the current treatment-based schema, where mild asthma is asthma that is well controlled with low-intensity treatment such as low-dose ICS or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol, and importantly, even patients with infrequent symptoms can have severe exacerbations if not on ICS-containing therapy, so his current control on low-dose ICS places him in the mild category retrospectively [^115QeGzm] [^114DDMqv].

> I should double-check the key differentiators that separate severe from difficult-to-treat asthma so I don't overcall severity. The critical factors are: confirmation of the asthma diagnosis and that the regimen is appropriate; verification of adherence and inhaler technique; identification and management of comorbidities and environmental exposures; and then, if uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and correction of these factors, the diagnosis is severe asthma, whereas if control improves once modifiable issues are addressed, that points to difficult-to-treat rather than severe disease, and this structured approach is repeatedly emphasized in GINA and primary care summaries [^111Nd8o9] [^113GLYtR] [^112dZZQK].

> Let me synthesize the classifications clearly. The 35-year-old woman has severe asthma because she remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA with good adherence and technique and no significant comorbidities or exposures, whereas the 28-year-old man has mild asthma because he is well controlled on low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA, reflecting low treatment intensity required for control [^111Nd8o9] [^115QeGzm].

> Next, I should review practical next steps for the woman with severe asthma. I need to ensure the diagnosis is confirmed objectively with spirometry and, if needed, bronchodilator responsiveness or other objective testing, assess the inflammatory phenotype with blood eosinophils and FeNO to guide biologic selection, screen for less obvious comorbidities or mimics, and refer to a specialist or severe asthma clinic for consideration of add-on therapies such as LAMA, LTRA, macrolides in adults, or biologics, while avoiding routine maintenance oral corticosteroids except as a last resort due to harms, and I should also remember that FeNO should not be used alone to guide treatment in severe asthma, per ERS/ATS guidance [^116eivKt] [^116MLLGt] [^112CS7sT].

> But wait, what if the man's control later deteriorates despite the same low-dose regimen; could that change his severity? Yes, severity is a retrospective label that can evolve with changes in treatment needs, so if he later requires higher-intensity therapy to maintain control, his severity classification would be updated accordingly, reinforcing that severity is dynamic and treatment-dependent rather than static [^115maK4T] [^111XN5KB].

The 35-year-old woman has **severe asthma** because she remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA, correct technique, and good adherence, with no modifiable factors identified [^111Nd8o9] [^113y545t]. The 28-year-old man has **mild asthma** because he is well controlled on low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA [^115QeGzm]. The key distinction is that severe asthma persists despite optimized therapy and management of contributory factors, whereas difficult-to-treat asthma is uncontrolled due to modifiable issues such as poor adherence, incorrect technique, or comorbidities [^111Nd8o9] [^113GLYtR].

## Classification of asthma severity

Asthma severity is defined retrospectively by the **level of treatment required to achieve control** after a trial of at least 2–3 months of therapy [^115maK4T] [^113nqHHY]. GINA classifies severity as mild, moderate, or severe based on the minimum treatment step needed to maintain control [^115maK4T] [^1175jKPw].

| **Severity category** | **Treatment required for control** |
|-|-|
| Mild | Low-intensity therapy (e.g. low-dose ICS or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol) [^115QeGzm] [^111D9HCv] |
| Moderate | Low- or medium-dose ICS-LABA [^1175jKPw] |
| Severe | High-dose ICS-LABA (with or without add-on therapy) or uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA [^111Nd8o9] [^113nqHHY] |

## Patient 1: 35-year-old woman

### Clinical presentation

- Daily symptoms and frequent nocturnal awakenings
- Poor control despite high-dose ICS-LABA
- Correct inhaler technique and good adherence
- No significant comorbidities or environmental triggers
- High ACQ score indicating poor control

---

### Classification

By GINA, this pattern meets criteria for **severe asthma**: asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose therapy is reduced [^111Nd8o9] [^113y545t].

---

### Rationale

- Uncontrolled symptoms despite high-dose ICS-LABA
- Confirmed correct inhaler technique and adherence
- No modifiable factors identified
- Persistent poor control indicates refractory disease

---

## Patient 2: 28-year-old man

### Clinical presentation

Well-controlled asthma on low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA, with minimal symptoms and no exacerbations.

---

### Classification

This pattern meets criteria for **mild asthma**: asthma that is well controlled on low-intensity treatment [^115QeGzm] [^111D9HCv].

---

### Rationale

- Good control on low-dose ICS
- Minimal symptoms and no exacerbations
- Low treatment intensity required for control

## Distinction between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma

Severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose therapy is reduced [^111Nd8o9] [^113y545t]. Difficult-to-treat asthma is uncontrolled due to **modifiable factors** such as poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, or comorbidities [^111Nd8o9] [^113GLYtR].

| **Feature** | **Severe asthma** | **Difficult-to-treat asthma** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors | Uncontrolled due to modifiable factors (adherence, technique, comorbidities) |
| Modifiable factors | Absent or corrected | Present and not corrected |
| Management | Specialist referral, phenotyping, biologics | Address modifiable factors, optimize therapy |

---

## Conclusion

- The 35-year-old woman has **severe asthma** because she remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and no modifiable factors.
- The 28-year-old man has **mild asthma** because he is well controlled on low-dose ICS.
- The key distinction is that severe asthma persists despite optimized therapy and management of contributory factors, whereas difficult-to-treat asthma is uncontrolled due to modifiable issues [^111Nd8o9] [^113GLYtR].

### What is severe asthma? [^117J79aC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is common, and some individuals are severely affected by it. Learned institutions have sought to provide a definition of 'severe asthma' to facilitate research and clinical care. This is a challenging undertaking given the difficulty in defining asthma and the lack of supportive evidence for a distinct severe asthma phenotype. In this review, we discuss the rationale for a definition of severe asthma and the relative merits of the sequential attempts that have been made to produce such a definition. The difficulty in disentangling control and severity is highlighted, as is the heterogeneity of phenotype in severe asthma, and potential for misclassification. We conclude that the search for a singular definition of severe asthma is problematic, though likely to continue. We suggest the alternative strategy of using classifiers with a specific aim related to symptoms, pathophysiology or service provision.

### 2020 asthma guideline update from the national asthma education and prevention program… [^111JX34y]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program of the NIH has updated its guideline recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of asthma patients. Michelle M. Cloutier, MD, from UConn Health, Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir, MD, of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and JAMA Associate Editor George O'Connor, MD, MS, from Boston Medical Center join JAMA's Q&A series to• Use of intermittent inhaled corticosteroids
- Use of add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists
- Use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement as a diagnostic biomarker• Monitoring response to therapy• Indoor allergen mitigation strategies• Safety and efficacy of subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy• Use of bronchial thermoplasty. Recorded December 8, 2020.

To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: intermittent inhaled corticosteroids; add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; indoor allergen mitigation; immunotherapy; and bronchial thermoplasty. From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 therapy. In step 2, either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended.

Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 and step 4 for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma.

### Predicted peak expiratory flow: differences across formulae in the literature [^116ZFSg8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The study objectives were to examine the differences between Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) formulae in the literature and to assess the potential impact of those differences on the interpretation of clinical guidelines for asthma management. We calculated 100% PEF values for hypothetical patients at the 50(th) percentile for height and weight and classified the percent predicted PEF into severity groups according to national asthma guidelines. Choosing different formulae could give an 18 year old man a 100% predicted PEF as low as 501 L/min and as high as 730 L/min (delta = 229 L/min); and a 35 year old woman a classification of severe (46%) using one, but moderate (57%) using another. Predicted PEF varied widely across formulae and choice of formula may alter guideline-based care. We propose recently published population-based equations as the reference standard for future asthma guidelines.

### Effectiveness of ICS / LABA compared with SABA as relief… [^1157oC9D]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is an inhaled corticosteroid /long-acting beta 2 agonist combination effective as a relief medication in patients with mild to severe asthma when compared with a short-acting beta 2 agonist. Evidence-Based Answer In mild asthma, as-needed ICS/LABA combinations should be used instead of as-needed SABAs without a maintenance inhaler because ICS/LABAs decrease the risk of severe exacerbations, increase the likelihood of having well-controlled asthma, and prolong the time to a first severe exacerbation. In moderate to severe asthma, ICS/LABA single maintenance and reliever therapy can decrease the risk of severe asthma exacerbations. SMART had similar outcomes to other treatment regimens for forced expiratory volume in one second, symptom control, and safety. Evidence Summary A 2019 RCT lasting 52 weeks involved 668 patients 18 to 75 years of age with mild asthma who were from New Zealand and Europe. The trial compared the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations per patient in three treatment groups: ICS/LABA; albuterol alone; and budesonide plus as-needed albuterol. 1 Two of the three arms focused on the reliever medication. An exacerbation was defined as worsening asthma that resulted in one or more of the following: an urgent medical care consultation, prescription of systemic glucocorticoids for any duration, or an episode of high beta 2 agonist use. At 52 weeks, the annualized exacerbation rate in the budesonide/formoterol group was lower than in the as-needed albuterol group.

### Subtypes of asthma based on asthma control and severity: a latent class analysis [^111GeBtz]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Synthesis with previous knowledge

As the choice of the variables applied in our study is in many ways different compared to previous studies that have applied similar type of analysis methods, a comparison between the results is difficult. However, we did identify some subtypes that are similar to those found in other populations. For example, our subtype Uncontrolled, Severe asthma among women is comparable to groups called "severe" or "difficult-to treat" asthma in some previous studies. However, we did not find such subtype among men, as in no class was the asthma-related medication or health-care use as extensive as among women belonging to this class. In addition, our subtype of Controlled, mild asthma is comparable to the one called "inactive/mild untreated adult onset asthma" in previous studies. According to our literature review, no previous study has examined asthma subtypes among men and women separately in stratified analyses. According to our findings this is an essential feature in the analyses, since especially the assessment of asthma severity seems to differ substantially between the genders in clinical practice.

We included potential determinants of class membership, i.e. asthma subtype, in our analyses, such as COPD, allergic diseases, age, and obesity. In our study, all of these predicted membership of subtypes with poor control and increased severity. However, the posterior probability of the best-fitting class did not improve after adding these covariates, which indicates that the optimal set of covariates may differ between men and women.

### Workup of severe asthma [^115anK2b]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

A 56-year-old man has difficult-to-control asthma and a history of four exacerbations in the prior 12 months despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and additional controller therapies. Is he suitable for more advanced therapeutic options? To address this query, we herein review the clinical assessment of a patient with suspected severe asthma and discuss factors contributing to poor asthma control and how biomarkers assist in disease investigation and stratification. The key components of our multidisciplinary approach are to confirm an asthma diagnosis and adherence to treatment, to assess any contributing comorbidities or confounding factors, and to stratify what type of asthma the patient has. The combination of spirometry and repeated measures of key biomarkers of type 2 airway inflammation-the blood eosinophil count and fractional exhaled nitric oxide-identifies whether poor disease control is driven by uncontrolled, ICS-resistant type 2 airway inflammation or ongoing airflow obstruction. A failure to elicit evidence of either suggests an alternative driver for the patient's symptoms, including chronic airway infection and non-asthma causes. Each phenotype represents a treatable trait that requires a specific targeted approach. Critically, steroids can cause harm, and their use should be guided by objective evidence of inflammation rather than symptoms alone. To conclude, after assessment of treatment adherence and exclusion of relevant comorbidities, the patient was found to have severe asthma with ICS-resistant type 2 airway inflammation. We will consider additional treatment options at our next appointment in part 2/2 of this How I Do It series.

### Subtypes of asthma based on asthma control and severity: a latent class analysis [^111Y9v5M]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma subtyping is a complex new field of study. Usually both etiological and outcome factors of asthma have been used simultaneously for subtyping thus making the interpretation of the results difficult. Identification of subtypes of asthma based on questionnaire data only will be useful for both treatment of asthma and for research. Our objective was to identify asthma subtypes that capture both asthma control and severity based on easily accessible variables.

Methods

We applied latent class analysis for the 1995 adult asthmatics, 692 men and 1303 women, of the Northern Finnish Asthma Study (NoFAS). The classifying variables included use of asthma medication within the last 12 months, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, and asthma-related healthcare use within the last 12 months. Covariates adjusted for included COPD, allergic rhinitis/allergic eczema, BMI, age and sex. All information was based on self-administered questionnaires.

Results

We identified four subtypes for women: Controlled, mild asthma (41% of participants); Partly controlled, moderate asthma (24%); Uncontrolled asthma, unknown severity (26%), and Uncontrolled, severe asthma (9%). For men we identified three subtypes: Controlled, mild asthma (31%); Poorly controlled asthma, unknown severity (53%); and Partly controlled, severe asthma (17%). For almost 96% of the subjects this subtyping was accurate. The covariates fitted in the model were based on clinical judgment and were good predictors of class membership.

Conclusions

Our results show that it is possible to form meaningful and accurate asthma subtypes based on questionnaire data, and that separate classification should be applied for men and women.

### Subtypes of asthma based on asthma control and severity: a latent class analysis [^111VaPm5]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Among men, identifying separate predictors for Partly controlled, severe asthma and Uncontrolled asthma with unknown severity was difficult, as almost all factors predicted belonging to these subtypes with similar odds ratios (Table 4). The only exception to this trend was that those who reported having allergic diseases showed a higher odds ratio for belonging to the Partly controlled, severe asthma subtype (1.67, 0.94–2.96) compared to the Uncontrolled asthma with unknown severity subtype (0.93, 0.54–1.62). COPD was a significant predictor for both Poorly controlled asthma with unknown severity and Partly controlled, severe asthma subtypes with the corresponding odds ratios of 9.01 (4.35–18.66) and 9.57 (4.62–19.83).

When adjusting for all covariates, the best posterior probabilities calculated among men and women were elevated compared to the non-adjusted model (Table 3). In this analysis, 53 women (4.31%) and 10 men (1.55%) had their best posterior probability below 0.50. On the other hand, the mean best posterior probability for each asthma subtype improved or remained stable, indicating that for those assigned to that class, the accuracy was better, although there were more people wavering between subtypes (Table 3). This is most likely due to the fact, that the optimal set of covariates is different between men and women.

### Asthma control or severity: that is the question [^1112ugx6]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

In the first National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the level of symptoms and airflow limitation and its variability allowed asthma to be subdivided by severity into four subcategories (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent). It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful.

### Subtypes of asthma based on asthma control and severity: a latent class analysis [^115eyRVR]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

To unravel the complex links and differences between asthma control and severity, we studied a total of 1995 adult asthmatics from the Northern Finnish Asthma Study by applying latent class analysis (LCA). The purpose of this study was to identify subtypes of asthma based on questionnaire-data only, among subjects already diagnosed to have asthma based on the diagnostic criteria applied in Finland. In order to enable further analyses on etiological factors of the subtypes formed, we included only variables of asthma manifestations in the classification. This enables further risk-factor analyses by maintaining the traditional idea of causality. The subtypes identified in this study can be applied in studies investigating potential role of environmental and behavioral factors in determining the etiology and/or prognosis (of different subtypes) of asthma. We addressed the following questions: 1) Is it possible to identify asthma subtypes which characterize the aspects of both asthma control and asthma severity by applying questionnaire-based information only; 2) When we assign a person to a particular subtype, how certain can we be that he/she truly belongs to that subtype; and 3) Do the subtypes formed separately for men and women lead to a more accurate classification? We also assessed 4) whether the following characteristics: age, having COPD and/or allergic diseases, and BMI, predict belonging to a certain asthma subtype.

Discussion

This population-based cross-sectional study provides evidence that identifying clinically meaningful subtypes of asthma based on questionnaire data is possible. The classification above benefits clinical work, because it provides a simpler way of categorizing asthmatics without using complicated clinical measurements. We performed the subtype analyses among women and men separately and found that gender-specific analysis is essential when assessing asthma control and severity. We also show that by calculating the class membership probability, the results of latent class analyses become easier to interpret and apply, because each individual patient can now be placed to one of the subtypes. We found high posterior probabilities which show that most individuals fit well into their respective subtype. This method, although quite informative, has to our knowledge been applied in only one previous study on asthma subtypes.

The finding that, especially among men, there is a large group of asthmatics with insufficient use of medication and healthcare services is worrying, and it calls for better patient-education programs. It is noticeable that among women higher age predicts the risk of uncontrolled asthma, but that it is also linked to poorer use of medical services. Thus, older age seems to create a difficulty when assessing the severity of asthma among women. Obese people were more likely to belong to the subtypes of asthma with severe disease and poor asthma control among both women and men. Among men, predictors separating subtypes of severe manifestations and those of unknown severity could not be identified. However, concomitant COPD was linked with severe manifestations of asthma, irrespective of the asthma subtype. For clinical work it is important to recognize the subtypes at risk of poorer asthma management since it might be possible to regain better control of their disease and thus prevent future complications of poorly managed disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11782icB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity terminology — variability across settings — explains that in the community and in primary care, 'severe' or 'mild' labels are commonly based on symptom or exacerbation frequency irrespective of treatment, whereas epidemiological studies and clinical trials often classify severity by prescribed treatment GINA or BTS Step regardless of asthma control. Most clinical trials of biologic therapy enroll patients uncontrolled despite taking medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA without routinely addressing contributory factors before enrolment. Some guidelines retain an older symptom-based classification distinguishing 'intermittent' and 'mild persistent' asthma with an untested assumption that patients with symptoms ≤ 2 days/week were not at risk and should be treated with SABA alone; however, patients with so-called 'intermittent' asthma can have severe or fatal exacerbations and their risk is substantially reduced by ICS-containing treatment compared with SABA alone. For low-resource countries, the World Health Organization definition of severe asthma includes 'untreated severe asthma', corresponding to uncontrolled asthma in patients not taking any ICS-containing treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111sFA1U]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for asthma, more specifically with respect to severity definitions, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to define severe asthma as asthma remaining uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or requiring high-dose ICS-LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. Distinguish severe asthma (disease that is relatively refractory to corticosteroid treatment) from asthma that is difficult to treat due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, or problems with adherence or comorbidities, such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity since correction of these comorbidities or risk factors ("treatable traits") can significantly improve asthma control.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

### Asthma diagnosis and treatment: filling in the information gaps [^116WWbHF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of asthma are based on guideline recommendations, which have provided a framework for the efforts. Asthma, however, is emerging as a heterogeneous disease, and these features need to be considered in both the diagnosis and management of this disease in individual patients. These diverse or phenotypic features add complexity to the diagnosis of asthma, as well as attempts to achieve control with treatment. Although the diagnosis of asthma is often based on clinical information, it is important to pursue objective criteria as well, including an evaluation for reversibility of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, an area with new diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, there exist a number of treatment gaps (ie, exacerbations, step-down care, use of antibiotics, and severe disease) in which new direction is needed to improve care. A major morbidity in asthmatic patients occurs with exacerbations and in patients with severe disease. Novel approaches to treatment for these conditions will be an important advance to reduce the morbidity associated with asthma.

### Severity, control, and responsiveness in asthma [^117HV3Vm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Guidelines for asthma management have proposed that initial treatment should be based on assessment of asthma severity. The treatments proposed for different degrees of asthma severity are essentially estimates of the intensity of treatment needed to achieve asthma control. Responsiveness to treatment is heterogeneous, however, even among asthmatic patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing asthma control and adjusting treatment accordingly. Application of a guidelines-based approach to asthma management thus requires general agreement on what is meant by severity, control, and responsiveness and requires further an awareness of asthma as causing symptoms and functional impairment in the present and also as causing risk of adverse events in the future.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115aSSTw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There are multiple knowledge gaps and unmet research needs in mild asthma. An important first step is to develop a robust definition that reflects its epidemiology, heterogeneity, and associated risks. Next, we must develop dedicated research constructs, independent of other severity groups, to explore its pathophysiology and management. Wherever applicable, findings must be evaluated by age group. We must also acknowledge the needs of at-risk individuals and special populations within this group. Our statement represents an important first step but is not exhaustive. We strongly advocate for greater funding and prioritization of research on mild asthma and encourage engagement with all stakeholders, including patients and caregivers.

### Severity assessment in asthma: an evolving concept [^1131wNhT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the clinical management of asthma base specific treatment recommendations on the assessment of disease severity. Thus, the accuracy of such assessments is essential for proper clinical management. The consistency of asthma severity assessment in patients with difficult-to-treat disease is unknown.

Objective

The objectives of this analysis were to compare the asthma severity assessment according to 3 methodologies in patients from The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens study.

Methods

Asthma severity on the basis of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines was compared with physician assessment and benchmarked against asthma-related health care use. Guideline-based asthma severity symptom components were derived from patient-reported questionnaires. Lung function levels were determined by prebronchodilator FEV(1) measurements; asthma-related medication and recent health care use were reported by patients.

Results

There was a clear lack of agreement among the asthma severity assessment modalities. Asthma severity was associated with asthma-related health care use, and patients considered to have severe asthma according to both sets of guidelines and physicians' assessment had the highest health care and medication use.

Conclusion

Classification of asthma severity on the basis of current asthma symptoms and lung function may be useful but not completely reflective of a patient's true asthma condition. Clinical assessment of asthma severity should consider a patient's medication use and consumption of health care resources for asthma exacerbations. Additional studies that apply criteria for asthma severity longitudinally are needed to support recommendations for optimal assessment of asthma severity.

### Most difficult asthma originates primarily in adult life [^113LDjg3]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies indicate that most asthma starts in childhood. However, the characteristics of adults with difficult asthma differ from the general asthma population. Difficult asthma as defined by poor control despite high dose inhaled steroids and long acting beta 2 agonists disproportionately affects women, more often has onset in adult life and is less frequently associated with atopy, and therefore appears to be a distinct phenotype. If an alternative definition of difficult asthma that is life threatening asthma is used then many of the behavioural traits may have their origin in childhood. Patients with severe and difficult asthma form a specific subgroup of asthmatic patients with high medical need and research specifically into this group of patients is now needed.

### Subtypes of asthma based on asthma control and severity: a latent class analysis [^113nirrh]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Validity of results

The previous studies that have applied similar type of analysis methods, have included factors for classification that were a mixture of etiological factors, outcomes of asthma, characteristics of individuals, and presence of atopic manifestations. In this study, we included in the subtype analyses only factors that are related to the manifestations or treatment of asthma. Thus, our approach provides a new alternative method for identifying subtypes of asthma that is more easily applicable for clinical work, especially in primary care settings with limited resources. The strengths of our study include the fact that asthma diagnosis was based on registry data received from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The criteria that they require for warranting the reimbursement right for asthma medication are clearly defined in Finland and follow the criteria recommended by the national asthma program report. Thus, the diagnosis of asthma was accurate and consistent between different asthma patients in this study. The questionnaires were distributed by The Social Insurance Institution of Finland. This was because, under the current law, the investigators are not allowed to contact directly asthmatics identified through this registry. This explains why the response rate (40%) was satisfactory, but lower than in our other epidemiologic studies. We have many subjects (26% in women and 53% in men) whose asthma severity is defined as "unknown". This is mainly a question of labelling. We could have called this subtype moderate severity, but since the ATS/ERS guidelines require assessment of asthma severity under "adequate treatment", we cannot fully assess the severity of their asthma, as this group does not seem to use all the treatments that are available. Introduction of some degree of information bias due to over-reporting of symptoms is possible in this study. However, a bias would be introduced only if such over-reporting would be related to the determinants of the subtype that the individual belongs to.

We did not verify the subtypes with full scale lung function testing and were not able to verify the results in another population due to the uniqueness of this data collection, these questions remain for future studies. This is also the situation often faced in clinical work, especially in primary care, as well as in large epidemiologic studies. We also did not have the possibility to test the population for biomarkers and form endotypes out of this population, which would be the next step towards investigating whether these subtypes might influence asthma treatment in the future. It is however highly likely, that behind the observed subtypes there are underlying mechanisms, for example inflammation that at least partly would explain the differences in asthma control and severity.

### Managing severe asthma in adults: lessons from the ERS / ATS guidelines [^116JyMt1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the latest guidelines on severe asthma.

Recent Findings

An updated definition of severe asthma is provided together with the evaluation steps necessary to reach a diagnosis of severe asthma. The importance of phenotyping is emphasized, and recommendations are provided for therapies specifically directed for severe asthma.

Summary

Severe asthma is widely recognized as a major unmet need. It is defined as asthma that requires treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller and/or systemic corticosteroid to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled' or that remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy. Severe asthma is a heterogeneous condition that consists of phenotypes such as eosinophilic asthma. More phenotypes need to be defined. Evaluation of the patient referred to as having severe or difficult-to-control asthma must take into account adherence to treatment, comorbidities and associated factors including side effects from therapies. These need to be addressed. Recommendations on the use of sputum eosinophil count and exhaled nitric oxide to guide therapy are presented. Treatment with anti-IgE antibody, methotrexate, macrolide antibiotics, antifungal agents and bronchial thermoplasty is reviewed and recommendations made. Research efforts into phenotyping of severe asthma will provide both biomarker-driven approaches and newer effective therapies to severe asthma management.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111XN5KB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma Severity

By consensus, asthma severity is assessed retrospectively, after at least 2–3 months of treatment, from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. GINA does not distinguish between so-called "intermittent" and "mild persistent" asthma because this historical distinction was arbitrary, with no evidence of a difference in the treatment response. Severe asthma is asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA or that requires such treatment to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. It is important to distinguish between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma (i.e. asthma that may be uncontrolled because of other factors, such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and comorbidities such as obesity and environmental exposures).

Rationale

This definition of asthma severity works well at the severe end of the spectrum but is less useful for describing mild asthma (see TRFR). For example, patients with infrequent or no interval symptoms can still have severe exacerbations. This risk is reduced to a similar extent by either daily ICS treatment or by ICS–formoterol taken only for symptom relief, and the baseline symptom frequency does not predict the need for daily ICS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11172PKk]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessing asthma severity — The current concept is that asthma severity should be assessed retrospectively from how difficult the patient's asthma is to treat, reflected by the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations after at least several months of treatment; by this definition, severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, and must be distinguished from difficult-to-treat asthma due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, adherence problems, or comorbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity.

### Categorizing asthma severity and monitoring control of chronic asthma [^115HyLrR]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma is a distressing disease, affecting up to 8% of the US population and causing considerable morbidity. Effective management of asthma requires accurate categorization of asthma severity and effective methods for monitoring the activity of the disease with treatment. Currently, symptoms, lung function, and requirements for corticosteroid treatment are the most accepted factors used for asthma severity categorization. Measures of airway hyperresponsiveness, particularly the use of methacholine, may provide additional information regarding the duration of asthma. Assessing airway inflammation using either sputum eosinophilia or exhaled nitric oxide levels has added little to clinical methods for determining asthma severity, but may be useful in monitoring the activity of the disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115maK4T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2–3 months of asthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively refractory to high intensity treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy, and it is important to distinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique and/or poor adherence. However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as 'easy to treat' is less useful, and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone actually increases the risk of exacerbations. 'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment, and GINA suggests that the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided in clinical practice if possible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS-containing treatment.

Compared with the understanding of many core pulmonary diseases, the understanding of asthma and severe asthma has improved exponentially over the last 20–30 years, including understanding concerning the application of precision-medicine approaches. Despite these advances, much remains to be biologically and immunologically clarified. Current "breakthrough" therapies are expensive and often inaccessible, and many patients remain poorly understood and treated. Yet conceptual understanding of "the severe asthmas" is now vastly different from what it was a mere 25 years ago, with accompanying dramatic improvement in the lives of many.

Classification of asthma severity and control — GINA framework: Asthma severity is commonly classified as mild, moderate, or severe, and the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) classification shifted from symptom burden on initial evaluation to the therapy required for adequate control of symptoms, with the assumption that the prescribed treatment is appropriate for the patient's needs. Asthma is classified as an Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition (ACSC), and it is stated that it is paramount these patients are treated adequately in the primary care setting to prevent asthma exacerbations and costly hospitalizations; this guideline did not determine if applying a particular classification system for asthma severity led to improved outcomes, although the classification system is widely used by clinicians, researchers, and other guideline developers and provides a common reference for communication, and Table C-1 provides information to assist in assignment of the severity level.

Prevalence

Despite improved definitions, the current prevalence of severe asthma remains poorly understood. The best estimates range from 4% to 10% of the asthma population. Much of this uncertainly is due to a disconnect between clinical diagnosis and physiologic confirmation and the necessity of determining whether patients are treated and adhering to treatment appropriately. Severe asthma, although more common in the very young, as compared with older children, appears to become less common in adolescence and early adulthood, only to appear or reappear in midadult life. Although it is predominantly a male disease in childhood, severe asthma, like adult asthma overall, largely affects females, perhaps because of resolution in boys and increased adult incidence in women. In three different cohorts, 45–50% of patients with severe asthma reported adult-onset (> 12 yr old) disease, the majority of whom were females. In contrast, resolution of severe asthma (not asthma itself) was observed in 60% of children in SARP (Severe Asthma Research Program), 3–4 years after enrollment (median age 11 yr old). Little is understood regarding this temporary or perhaps permanent resolution. However, anecdotally, many patients report childhood disease, resolution, and subsequent second worsening in adulthood for unclear reasons.

### Severe asthma: an overview [^112UD7tR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Severe asthma represents less than 10% of all asthma, but these patients are responsible for a disproportionate share of the health care costs and morbidity associated with the disease. A significant challenge in the diagnosis and management of severe asthma is the ability to identify accurately the patients most at risk for adverse outcomes, such as medication side effects, emergency department visits, hospitalization, near-fatal events, or disability from persistent symptoms or chronic lung function abnormalities. To improve the treatment of these patients, we must improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for severe disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to develop a common definition of severe asthma to allow adequate characterization of the disease clinically and provide the opportunity to compare results from many studies. Several severe asthma phenotypes have been described in the literature on the basis of the age of patients, age of disease onset, corticosteroid resistance, chronic airflow obstruction, and evidence for eosinophilic airway inflammation on biopsy. These phenotypes have led to an emerging interest in the use of noninvasive methods to monitor airway inflammation in severe asthma. Treatment algorithms based on markers of airway inflammation may decrease measures of health care utilization in severe asthma.

Which patients should be referred to asthma specialists?

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma should be systematically assessed to find out if they have a severe asthma or other reasons explaining their poor response to treatment, such as poor adherence or inappropriate treatment. For patients who do not respond to standard step care management and have poor asthma control despite good adherence and inhalation technique, including management of environmental exposures and co-morbidities, referral to a specialist is clearly essential.

### Severe asthma – A population study perspective [^115X4cZr]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe asthma is a considerable challenge for patients, health-care professionals and society. Few studies have estimated the prevalence of severe asthma according to modern definitions of which none based on a population study.

Objective

To describe characteristics and estimate the prevalence of severe asthma in a large adult population-based asthma cohort followed for 10–28 years.

Methods

N = 1006 subjects with asthma participated in a follow-up during 2012–14, when 830 (mean age 59 years, 56% women) still had current asthma. Severe asthma was defined according to three internationally well-known criteria: the ATS workshop definition from 2000 used in the US Severe Asthma Research Programme (SARP), the 2014 ATS/ERS Task force definition and the GINA 2017. All subjects with severe asthma according to any of these criteria were undergoing respiratory specialist care and were also contacted by telephone to verify treatment adherence.

Results

The prevalence of severe asthma according to the three definitions was 3.6% (US SARP), 4.8% (ERS/ATS Taskforce), and 6.1% (GINA) among subjects with current asthma. Although all were using high ICS doses and other maintenance treatment, > 90% did not have controlled asthma according to the asthma control test. Severe asthma was related to age > 50 years, nasal polyposis, impaired lung function, sensitization to aspergillus, and tended to be more common in women. Further, neutrophils in blood significantly discriminated severe asthma from other asthma.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

Severe asthma differed significantly from other asthma in terms of demographic, clinical and inflammatory characteristics, results suggesting possibilities for improved treatment regimens of severe asthma. The prevalence of severe asthma in this asthma cohort was 4%-6%, corresponding to approximately 0.5% of the general population.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114cVcTM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Patients with mild asthma are believed to represent the majority of patients with asthma. Disease-associated risks such as exacerbations, lung function decline, and death have been understudied in this patient population. There have been no prior efforts from major societies to describe research needs in mild asthma. Methods: A multidisciplinary, diverse group of 24 international experts reviewed the literature, identified knowledge gaps, and provided research recommendations relating to mild asthma definition, pathophysiology, and management across all age groups. Research needs were also investigated from a patient perspective, generated in conjunction with patients with asthma, caregivers, and stakeholders. Of note, this project is not a systematic review of the evidence and is not a clinical practice guideline. Results: There are multiple unmet needs in research on mild asthma driven by large knowledge gaps in all areas. Specifically, there is an immediate need for a robust mild asthma definition and an improved understanding of its pathophysiology and management strategies across all age groups. Future research must factor in patient perspectives. Conclusions: Despite significant advances in severe asthma, there remain innumerable research areas requiring urgent attention in mild asthma. An important first step is to determine a better definition that will accurately reflect the heterogeneity and risks noted in this group. This research statement highlights the topics of research that are of the highest priority. Furthermore, it firmly advocates the need for engagement with patient groups and for more support for research in this field.

### Subtypes of asthma based on asthma control and severity: a latent class analysis [^114VW5bt]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 presents the characteristics of the study population, including both the variables that were used in latent class forming the subtypes as well as the variables adjusted for as covariates. Among the total of 1995 participants, two thirds were women (65.3%). The age distribution was similar between men and women. As shown in Table 1, daily use of controller asthma medication was common (78.1%). It is noticeable that, except for the use of inhaled corticosteroids, men and women differed significantly with respect to the use of asthma medications and of health care facilities, even though the mean St. George's score was similar among the genders (Table 1). COPD diagnosis was more common among men, whereas allergic diseases where more common among women (Table 1).

Latent classes

We tested all the analyses by applying 2 to 6 classes, and compared the fit-indices between the different models to choose the best fitting classification (see Additional file 1: Table S1). When two or more models had similar fit-indices, we selected the amount of classes based on clinical interpretability of the results. In order to elaborate all possible combinations of control and severity, we categorized both into four levels: Fully controlled, Controlled, Partly controlled, and Uncontrolled, and Mild, Moderate, Unknown severity, and Severe.

Five classes combining asthma control and severity, were formed for the whole study population: 1) Fully controlled, mild asthma, 2) Partly controlled, mild asthma, 3) Partly controlled, moderate asthma, 4) Uncontrolled, unknown severity, and 5) Uncontrolled, severe asthma. Further analyses indicated that applying these five subtypes actually masked the differences between men and women, and thus, we further performed sex-specific analyses. For the results of the five-class model and the odds ratios for the predictive factors in these analyses, please refer to the Additional file 1.

### Clinical issues in severe asthma: consensus and controversies on the road to precision medicine [^114AVEfu]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

As seen in this CME online activity (available at http://courses.elseviercme.com/708e), the various forms of asthma affect > 300 million people globally and > 25 million people in the United States. Asthma-related symptoms and exacerbations result in nearly 2 million ED visits annually, and many of these visits lead to inpatient hospital stays. There is an urgent need to improve the care of the estimated 5% to 15% of patients who have severe asthma. Importantly, studies have shown that severe asthma accounts for an outsized proportion of the disease-related morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Examining cohorts from several large patient networks that were created to better understand clinical presentations, biopsychosocial consequences, and long-term outcomes of severe asthma revealed substantial disease burden, significant gaps in longitudinal care, and a clear need for additional treatment options. This CME-accredited Clinical Issues program is intended for allergists/clinical immunologists, pulmonologists, and other health-care providers involved in the management of patients with severe asthma. During the activity, a panel of expert faculty will discuss and debate a series of topics related to the evaluation and long-term treatment of various severe asthma phenotypes. Activity topics include education regarding (1) The classification of severe asthma to differentially diagnose patients with disease that is uncontrolled despite relatively intensive therapy; (2) potential phenotypes and available biomarkers, including strengths, limitations, and how to translate results into the selection of therapies; and (3) the different mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of biologic therapies that target the pathophysiology of severe asthma. The goal is to provide clinician learners with the latest evidence and a fresh perspective on evolving management paradigms for severe asthma.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115HcQRx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Proposed research to define mild asthma — Survey findings and research gaps emphasize variable exacerbation criteria; for example, "some respondents (8 of 22) favored zero exacerbations in the previous year", whereas an alternative approach "could be to assess exacerbation frequency longitudinally and define mild asthma as mild asthma with no more than one exacerbation per year on average (e.g., exacerbation every 2–3 yr)". Current evidence mapping was limited, as "we were also unable to apply our definition in our current literature search, as it would have excluded a majority of studies currently referred to for the treatment of mild asthma". Suggested directions include to "conduct surveys of physician and patient perspectives on how they interpret the term mild asthma", to "conduct a large, prospective cohort study of patients with 'well-controlled' asthma (without defining mild asthma a priori) to better understand and define features of mild asthma", to "develop a consensus definition of mild asthma that will have utility for patients, clinicians, and researchers", and to support "research that evaluates the longitudinal trajectory of patients with mild asthma from historical data sets". Additionally, the statement notes "there may be value in moving away from a 'mild, moderate, or severe' classification and instead focusing on 'controlled versus not controlled' and 'low risk versus high risk' of exacerbation, loss of lung function, or future poor control".

### Difficult to treat and severe asthma: management strategies [^114p73oY]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease in the United States. Up to 17% of asthma cases are classified as difficult to treat, and 3.7% of these are considered severe. Uncontrolled asthma is characterized by poor symptom control or frequent exacerbations. In difficult-to-treat asthma, the asthma is uncontrolled despite adherence to inhaled corticosteroid therapy in combination with a second controller, an oral corticosteroid is needed to achieve control, or it is uncontrolled despite oral corticosteroid therapy. Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma in which the disease is uncontrolled despite adherence to optimal management or it worsens when high-intensity therapy is decreased. The diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed and modifiable factors and comorbidities addressed in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. An adequate trial of an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist should be implemented with nonbiologic add-on therapies, such as a long-acting muscarinic agent or leukotriene receptor antagonist. Evaluation of severe asthma involves assessment of asthma phenotype. Evidence of type 2 inflammation indicates that the patient may benefit from newer biologic agents. Breathing exercises may improve quality of life, asthma symptoms, lung function, and number of exacerbations. Vitamin D and soy supplementation are ineffective. Bronchial thermoplasty is a procedural option that may be considered if there is inadequate response to other therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^115nG8db]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition

Advances in the understanding of severe asthma accelerated ∼20 years ago when severe asthma was recognized as a distinct grouping of entities. Severe asthma was specifically defined, first in 2000 by an American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop, then by the World Health Organization (for a more global definition with relevance to poorly developed and developing countries), and most recently by the European Respiratory Society (ERS)–ATS guidelines. Underlying obstructions with reversibility or reactivity, current or previous, remain at the heart of identifying severe asthma, such that confirmation of an asthma diagnosis, by original ATS definitions, is mandatory. This need to link to current or historical reversible obstruction is sometimes lost when evaluating symptomatic patients, despite guideline-appropriate therapy, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. In addition, lack of reversibility to normal should not invoke a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; rather, it is a hallmark of severe asthmatic disease.

Once an asthma diagnosis is established, ERS–ATS–defined severe asthma (Box 1) is "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (CSs), plus a second controller, to remain controlled or which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy". Control is defined by symptoms, exacerbations, and degree of obstruction. Yet the current severe asthma definition remains an umbrella definition. It can encompass smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers and a broad range of underlying pathobiologies or molecular phenotypes. Dissecting them is critical to improving treatment.

It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2". For education, it states that "'apparently mild asthma' may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk".

### Super-responders to biologic treatment in type 2-high severe asthma: passing fad or a meaningful phenotype? [^114yQh9b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Defining super-response to biologic treatment is a major concern in severe asthma. Although many definitions have been proposed, there is still a gap between the clinical perception of the super-response and a standardized classification. The current definition of super-response mainly relies on several clinical features, while many aspects of severe asthma inflammation and lung function are still poorly considered. Furthermore, many criteria of severe asthma super-response overlap with those of the clinical remission, leaving room for possible misclassifications. In this context, identifying the correct trajectory linking these 2 aspects of type 2-high severe asthma could help clinicians to understand which factors can predict a greater response to biologic therapies. In this paper, we review various aspects of super-response assessment, proposing some new criteria for its definition as well as new perspectives on its relationship with severe asthma clinical remission.

### Diagnosis and definition of severe refractory asthma: an international consensus statement from the innovative medicine initiative (IMI) [^115p4tSq]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with severe refractory asthma pose a major healthcare problem. Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that, for the development of new targeted therapies, there is an urgent need for further characterisation and classification of these patients. The Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) consortium is a pan-European public-private collaboration funded by the European Commission Innovative Medicines Initiative of the European Union. U-BIOPRED aims to subphenotype patients with severe refractory asthma by using an innovative systems biology approach. This paper presents the U-BIOPRED international consensus on the definition and diagnosis of severe asthma, aligning the latest concepts in adults as well as in children. The consensus is based on existing recommendations up to 2010 and will be used for the selection of patients for the upcoming U-BIOPRED study. It includes the differentiation between 'problematic', 'difficult' and 'severe refractory' asthma, and provides a systematic algorithmic approach to the evaluation of patients presenting with chronic severe asthma symptoms for use in clinical research and specialised care.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113nqHHY]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Assessment of asthma severity — Table C-1 classifies severity after a treatment trial based on the minimum therapy needed for control. Asthma Severity (assess after trial of 2–3 months of treatment) is determined by retrospective assessment of the minimum level of treatment required to obtain control after a trial of at least 2–3 months of therapy. Mild is controlled on low-intensity treatment, for example prn low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol or low dose ICS plus prn rapid-onset long-acting beta agonist/short-acting beta agonist (LABA/SABA). Moderate is controlled with low or medium-dose ICS-LABA. Severe is controlled with high-dose ICS-LABA (with or without add-on therapies such as long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], biologic therapies, or chronic oral corticosteroids) or is uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS-LABA (with or without add-on therapies). Severity classification does not apply to the active duty population due to different occupational requirements, and severe asthma should be distinguished from asthma that is difficult to treat due to modifiable factors such as inappropriate therapy, poor adherence, poor inhaler technique, uncontrolled co-morbidities and persistent exposures to sensitizing agents.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116X6fog]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Definition of mild asthma — current knowledge and challenges emphasize that the lack of a standardized definition has been a major challenge for clinical research; the current ATS/European Respiratory Society task force definition, published in 2008 and 2009, defines severity by difficulty in controlling asthma with treatment and considers mild asthma as asthma that can be controlled with low-intensity treatment; both symptoms and exacerbations were included in control assessment, exacerbations can occur even in patients with mild asthma, and severity could be assessed only once patients had been taking controller treatment for several months. In alignment with this framework, GINA defines mild asthma as asthma that is well controlled on steps 1 and 2 of treatment (with both steps containing ICS), while the 2020 focused update of the NAEPP guidelines retains the NAEPP 2007 division of mild asthma before controller treatment is started (in treatment-naive patients or in patients receiving SABAs alone) into "intermittent" versus "persistent" based on symptoms and exacerbations with normal lung function; before controller treatment GINA (unlike NAEPP) does not distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma, and after controller treatment is started, NAEPP continues to distinguish between these categories.

### Pathophysiology of severe asthma [^117G1VsM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Although asthma affects nearly 8% of the adult population, most of these patients have mild-to-moderate disease that can be controlled with appropriate treatment. It is estimated, however, that 5% to 10% of patients with asthma have severe disease that is unresponsive to typical therapeutics, including corticosteroids. Because patients with severe asthma are disproportionately affected by their disease, in terms of both impaired lifestyle and health care costs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a workshop on the pathogenesis of severe asthma. The goals of this workshop were to begin to define the characteristics of severe asthma. In these discussions, it was clear that many characteristics need to be considered in defining this phenotype of asthma, including symptoms, intensity of therapy (including administration of systemic corticosteroids), and impairment of lung function. Also discussed were potential mechanisms of severe asthma including the role of allergic diseases, which may play less of a role in severe asthma than in mild-to-moderate disease, and infections. A major limitation to control of severe asthma is the recalcitrant response of these patients to usual therapy including systemic corticosteroids; the potential of other therapies was reviewed. From these discussions, recommendations were made for future research needs to gain insights into a difficult therapeutic and possibly novel mechanistic area of asthma.

American Thoracic Society research statement — current challenges in mild asthma research include a lack of a reliable definition (the current definition is based on arbitrary cut offs and is not reliable or valid), suboptimal understanding of heterogeneity (inadequate understanding of mild asthma phenotypes and endotypes and failure to better understand variability in treatment responses), a lack of perceived research needs (no prior initiative from major societies and issues pertaining to lack of funding opportunities), methodological challenges (challenges with consistent inclusion and exclusions criteria and lack of standardized mild asthma outcomes to research), and issues stemming from the patient perspective (patient needs are not consistently factored into current study designs and recruitment issues based on patient perception of "mild" disease).

### Uniform definition of asthma severity, control, and exacerbations: document presented for the World Health Organization consultation on severe asthma [^1141wGBX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma is a global health problem affecting around 300 million individuals of all ages, ethnic groups and countries. It is estimated that around 250,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of asthma. Concepts of asthma severity and control are important in evaluating patients and their response to treatment, as well as for public health, registries, and research (clinical trials, epidemiologic, genetic, and mechanistic studies), but the terminology applied is not standardized, and terms are often used interchangeably. A common international approach is favored to define severe asthma, uncontrolled asthma, and when the 2 coincide, although adaptation may be required in accordance with local conditions. A World Health Organization meeting was convened April 5–6, 2009, to propose a uniform definition of severe asthma. An article was written by a group of experts and reviewed by the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases review group. Severe asthma is defined by the level of current clinical control and risks as "Uncontrolled asthma which can result in risk of frequent severe exacerbations (or death) and/or adverse reactions to medications and/or chronic morbidity (including impaired lung function or reduced lung growth in children)". Severe asthma includes 3 groups, each carrying different public health messages and challenges: (1) untreated severe asthma, (2) difficult-to-treat severe asthma, and (3) treatment-resistant severe asthma. The last group includes asthma for which control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment and asthma for which control can be maintained only with the highest level of recommended treatment.

### Diagnostic challenges of adult asthma [^1154QPyg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchial asthma is a common disorder that affects about 300 million people worldwide. Its signs and symptoms however, can be present in other pulmonary and/or airway diseases and therefore a careful workup of patients with respiratory symptoms that might be due to asthma is required to a) keep a broad differential diagnosis, especially in cases that do not respond well to standard antiasthmatic therapy and b) attempt to subphenotype patients within the syndrome of asthma to diagnose e.g. precipitating factors, inflammatory subtypes and comorbidities.

Recent Findings

The syndrome of asthma contains a number of different phenotypes that offer the possibility of personalized medicine based on the respective asthma phenotype. There are attempts to combine asthma and COPD in newly postulated overlap syndromes which this review discourages to do but instead, based on new and old information concerning asthma phenotyping, suggests to rule in comorbidities and rule out a number of other diseases that can mimick asthma clinically.

Summary

Bronchial asthma, although one of the most common respiratory diseases, can be mimicked by a number of other pulmonary and airway diseases, and especially patients with so called severe or treatment refractory asthma should receive a detailed diagnostic workup with a rather broad differential diagnosis.

### Clinical issues in severe asthma: debates and discussions about personalizing patient management [^1144M7VS]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

An outsized proportion of asthma-related morbidity and mortality is borne by the 5% to 15% of affected patients who have severe forms of the disease. These patients experience poorly controlled symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite daily treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and other long-acting controller medications. Ongoing research has elucidated key pathophysiologic processes and other clinical parameters related to asthma severity and persistence. In many cases, the patient's medical history, clinical presentation, and results from biomarker testing can help classify severe asthma phenotypically. Increasingly, this approach can allow health-care providers to personalize maintenance regimens using targeted therapies for the identified endotypes; that is, asthma phenotypes linked to specific underlying disease mechanisms and proinflammatory signaling cascades. Several biologic medications are now available to treat certain cohorts with severe asthma, and a number of other targeted agents are in late-stage development. Pulmonologists and asthma specialists who manage patients with severe asthma need to stay current on the latest published trial data for newer targeted therapies, approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration, and actionable best-practice recommendations on evaluating and treating patients with severe asthma. During this web-based Clinical Issues program (available online at https://courses.elseviercme.com/asthma18/761e), a panel of expert faculty discuss a series of topics related to the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of severe asthma, including the following: characterizing severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes; identification of patients with severe asthma; and the role of biomarkers in asthma phenotyping. The faculty also highlight the identification and management of comorbid conditions commonly associated with asthma. An overview of new and emerging biologic therapies for severe asthma is provided, followed by a detailed discussion on personalizing treatment for patients with severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113y545t]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Definitions — uncontrolled, difficult-to-treat, and severe asthma: Uncontrolled asthma includes one or both of poor symptom control and frequent exacerbations, specifically frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year) requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), or serious exacerbations (≥ 1/year) requiring hospitalization. Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a second controller (usually a long-acting beta agonist [LABA]) or with maintenance OCS, or that requires high-dose treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations; in many cases it may reflect modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, smoking, comorbidities, or an incorrect diagnosis. Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with maximal optimized high-dose ICS-LABA treatment and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased, and asthma is not classified as severe if it markedly improves when contributory factors such as inhaler technique and adherence are addressed.

### Current treatment of severe asthma [^117HyHw7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is considered a heterogeneous disease in which a variety of clinical, physiological and inflammatory markers determine disease severity. Pivotal studies in the last 5 years have led to substantial progress in many areas, ranging from a more accurate definition of truly severe, refractory asthma, to classification of the disease into distinct clinical phenotypes, and introduction of new therapies. This review focuses on three common clinical phenotypes of severe asthma in adults (early onset severe allergic asthma, late onset non-atopic eosinophilic asthma, late onset non-eosinophilic asthma with obesity), and provides an overview of recent developments regarding treatment options that are best suited for each of these phenotypes.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111X2tdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations and research gaps

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:
A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.
The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.
Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.
The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes (eg, exacerbations and asthma symptoms) and the cutoffs for tests (eg, F). Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.
Updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated.
Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized. Although the populations of interest for the focused updates were defined for the systematic reviews, the characterizations of study participants did not reflect current understanding of relevant phenotypes and endotypes (eg, based on asthma severity, allergen-specific sensitization, or airway inflammatory type).
Standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies.
The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, which evaluate treatment effects in relatively homogeneous populations and conditions in which fidelity to study protocols is actively promoted. Applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs. Such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations.
Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma. The GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes. However, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. Research is needed to understand how preferred outcomes vary by race or ethnicity, asthma severity, age (eg, children or older adults), and socioeconomic status.
All measures and outcomes relevant to making judgments need to be included in the systematic reviews. For example, although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data. Moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

### Exploring definitions and predictors of severe asthma clinical remission after biologic treatment in adults [^1114LnqG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings have tested the sensitivity of asthma remission definitions in the largest severe asthma cohort in the world, shown how the proportion of patients categorized as in remission is affected by some domains more than others, and, by identifying a wide range of prebiologic factors associated with remission, brought us one step closer to accurate remission prediction in real life. Although remission is the ultimate goal of asthma management, it occurs in a relatively small proportion of patients treated with current biologics. This may suggest the need to consider switching biologic therapies if remission is not achieved, use of biologic combinations, and use of biologics earlier to give patients the best chance of achieving remission, but further research is needed. If remission is the target, guidelines should reflect that, and treatment approaches/strategies in selected patients most likely to achieve it may be recommended (pending confirmation).

### Assessment of asthma control and severity [^111HkXb3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a conceptual framework for defining severity and control in asthma, to describe recent advances in measuring asthma control, and to discuss the role of severity and control in asthma disease management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles published between 1998 and July 2003. Additional sources included key references cited in these articles, national and international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, and the author's personal bibliography.

Study Selection

All studies that reported on the development and validation of formal measures of asthma control, as well as the few editorials that focused on the distinction between asthma severity and control, were included. The author's professional judgment was used to select for illustrative purposes from among the many purported measures of asthma severity in the literature.

Results

Although several standardized measures of asthma control exist, no direct comparisons of the performance and properties of these control measures have been published. The available instruments appear more similar than dissimilar. All share the common trait of assessing multiple aspects of asthma control, which is believed to provide better discrimination than a single measure.

Conclusions

Asthma control is different from asthma severity and may be useful as a clinical vital sign for patients with asthma. Ultimately, no one measure may be better than any of the others or the optimal measure may depend on the intended use of the scale.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113jNTUe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on mild asthma — mild asthma is believed to represent the majority of patients with asthma, is variably defined with common usage referring to infrequent symptoms, and patients can face an underappreciated exacerbation burden with increased risk for impaired quality of life, accelerated lung function decline, and oral corticosteroid exposure; a panel evaluated existing literature and made recommendations for future research, and this document is meant to be a roadmap for future research and not a clinical guideline for patient care. The statement suggests research priorities in various mild asthma–related areas, including definition of mild asthma (conduct surveys of physician and patient perspectives and develop a consensus definition with utility for patients, clinicians, and researchers), phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms (investigate inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, describe phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including airway hyperresponsiveness, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, and assess whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly corticosteroid responsive phenotype), and disease progression and exacerbations (conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to identify the frequency of and risk factors for progression to more severe disease and monitor long-term outcomes of patients followed exclusively by primary care providers, while evaluating patient factors influencing the exacerbation reduction effects of mild asthma therapies).

Asthma attacks are a major global source of morbidity and cost. The incidence and impact of asthma attacks have not improved despite widespread adoption of effective universal treatment guidelines. Consequently, there is increasing interest in managing asthma based on specific assessments of both current symptoms and future risk. In this review, we consider 'risk' in asthma, and how it might be assessed from the patient's history and objective measurements. We also discuss the potential for encouraging shared decision-making and improving medical consensus through explicit communication of risk and highlight the potential opportunities and challenges in risk assessment to improve asthma management through individualised treatment strategies.

Introduction

Asthma affects approximately 339 million individuals worldwide and 24 million individuals in the United States. Although most asthma research efforts have focused on severe asthma, patients with mild asthma constitute the majority of people with asthma (50–75%) and have been relatively overlooked and understudied. The term mild asthma has various definitions (Table 1), but it is often used to refer to patients with infrequent or easily relieved symptoms. However, patients with mild asthma can experience an underappreciated exacerbation burden, which places them at increased risk for accelerated lung function decline and oral corticosteroid exposure with associated adverse events. Furthermore, 30–37% of acute asthma episodes, 16% of near-fatal asthma episodes, and 15–27% of fatal attacks occurred in patients reporting symptoms less than weekly or only with exertion in the preceding 3 months. Finally, many patients with mild asthma are managed solely with SABAs, which provide only symptom relief, without treating the underlying airway inflammation that is contributing to symptom burden and exacerbation risk. Therefore, mild asthma is not a benign disease for many patients, and the recent Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update advocates reconsideration of its definition to more fully encompass associated risks and allow better communication with patients. The current American Thoracic Society (ATS) classification of asthma severity is based on the degree of treatment needed to control asthma, which often excludes consideration of exacerbation frequency.

Table 1.
Common Definitions Used for Mild Asthma

Challenges surrounding research on mild asthma include the variability of existing definitions, heterogeneity of both clinical features and inflammatory markers, the focus on severe asthma research that overlooks the needs of most patients with asthma, and the absence of unified patient advocacy for research on mild asthma (Figure 1). Interest in mild asthma has intensified (see Table E1 in the online supplement) after the recent publication of large clinical trial results that led to significant changes in the GINA strategy. Given the complexity surrounding research on mild asthma, leaders in the field identified a need to acknowledge current knowledge gaps and make recommendations for future research.

### Use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists for asthma exacerbations… [^113vPLSA]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question What is the efficacy associated with using inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists together as both the controller and the quick relief therapy termed single maintenance and reliever therapy in patients with persistent asthma. Findings. Meaning SMART was associated with better clinical outcomes than conventional approaches in patients with persistent asthma. Importance Combined use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists as the controller and the quick relief therapy termed single maintenance and reliever therapy is a potential therapeutic regimen for the management of persistent asthma. Among patients with persistent asthma that remains suboptimally controlled with the use of inhaled corticosteroids, US guidelines suggest a stepwise approach to modifying therapy that includes increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids or adding adjunctive therapies.

1 Inhaled long-acting β-agonists are the preferred adjunctive therapy for patients aged 12 years or older and are considered 1 of several potential adjunctive therapies for patients aged 5 to 11 years. When inhaled corticosteroids and LABA are used as controller therapies, the doses are scheduled on a daily basis and the patient continues to use short-acting β-agonists for as-needed quick relief of symptoms. Given the fast onset of action with the LABA formoterol, 2 it has been hypothesized that the combined use of inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol as needed instead of SABAs would provide quick symptom relief and also deliver steroid sooner during the course of symptom deterioration, thereby effectively managing asthma symptoms and reducing exacerbation risk.

Persistent asthma severity was not usually defined further in the studies; however, all of the studies required patients to be taking inhaled corticosteroids prior to enrollment and many patients also were taking an LABA. Based on reported mean doses of inhaled corticosteroids prior to enrollment, most patients were taking medium to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and thus represent patients with asthma severity that is worse than mild persistent asthma. Several postmarketing trials mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration that were designed to evaluate the safety of LABA used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma, albeit traditional dosing not SMART, have not detected any concern regarding serious asthma-related events. 40–42 This has recently prompted the Food and Drug Administration to remove the black box warning regarding asthma-related deaths from all medications that contain both inhaled corticosteroids and LABA. 43.

Definition of Mild Asthma

Current Knowledge and Challenges

The lack of a standardized definition of mild asthma has been a major challenge for clinical research (Table 1 and Figure 1). In the current ATS definition, published in 2008 and 2009 by an ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force, asthma severity is defined by difficulty in controlling asthma with treatment; mild asthma is considered as asthma that can be controlled with low-intensity treatment. The task force included both symptoms and exacerbations in the assessment of control but recognized that exacerbations could be experienced even by patients with mild asthma. It emphasized that severity could be assessed only once patients had been taking controller treatment for several months, as uncontrolled asthma before starting treatment could turn out to be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the response to ICS.

GINA, following the ATS/ERS definition, defines mild asthma as asthma that is well controlled on steps 1 and 2 of treatment (with both steps containing ICS). However, the 2020 focused update of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines retains the NAEPP 2007 division of mild asthma before controller treatment is started (i.e. in treatment-naive patients or in patients receiving SABAs alone), into "intermittent" versus "persistent" on the basis of daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, interference with daily activity, and exacerbations in the setting of normal lung function. Before controller treatment is started, GINA (unlike NAEPP) does not distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma because, as noted above, severity can be assessed only after the patient is on controller treatment, because of a lack of evidence to support specific symptom frequency criteria, and because both groups experience similarly large reductions in exacerbations with ICS treatment. After controller treatment is started, NAEPP continues to distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma: intermittent if it can be controlled by SABA-only treatment and persistent if step 2 treatment or higher is required.

### Management of severe asthma before referral to the severe asthma specialist [^112d46dr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and can be challenging to assess and control, due to heterogeneity of disease, complexity of diagnosis, and impact of comorbidities. A structured approach to the assessment and management of severe asthma may be helpful to the practicing clinician. First, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of asthma. In patients who are either not responding to treatment, or who require high doses of medication to control symptoms, it is highly possible that disease mimickers or comorbidities are present and can inhibit therapeutic responsiveness. The assessment and management of common comorbidities of asthma may dramatically impact disease control and thus medication requirement. Determining medication adherence and optimizing drug dose and delivery may separate out truly severe asthmatics from those not using medications regularly or properly. Next, although true personalized medicine for severe asthma is not yet realized, for those individuals with severe asthma, phenotypic characteristics of each patient may guide which therapeutic options may be most effective for that patient. Finally, evaluation and management of severe asthma at a referral center can add additional phenotyping, therapeutic, and diagnostic strategies.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

Overview of current guidelines

The systematic establishment of a thorough evidence base is currently considered the most rigorous and accurate means to develop clinical practice guidelines. Developing evidence-based consensus guidelines is an enormous undertaking in a field such as asthma, involving a major literature search, consideration of thousands of papers, and time commitment by numerous individuals in the respiratory medical community. Several hierarchies of evidence and grading recommendations have been used by different working groups; those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network are presented in Table 1. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group has recently proposed a system for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was first launched in 1993 as a program to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. GINA has published evidence-based asthma guidelines since 2002; annual updates are available on the GINA website. These guidelines emphasize the fact that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways and that, while asthma exacerbations are episodic, airway inflammation is chronically present. Exposure to allergens is listed as a common risk factor. The fact that medication must be taken every day by most patients to control symptoms, to improve lung function, and to prevent attacks is noted. Criteria defining the control of asthma are presented in the guidelines (Table 2). Moreover, the guidelines provide criteria for determining asthma severity; and recommendations for pharmacological management of asthma are outlined according to a stepwise approach based on asthma severity.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^112B3ozs]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Master Case Overview

Please evaluate this patient with asthma and three severe asthma attacks in the prior year despite taking a combination of high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting β₂ -agonist, and long-acting antimuscarinic. In clinic, the Asthma Control Test Questionnaire score is 14, FEV₁ after bronchodilator administration is 65% predicted with 15%/352 mL reversibility, and FEV₁ to FVC ratio of 0.57. Other data, including values of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, are listed below.

Case Report Variation 1

This patient is a 35-year-old woman with childhood-onset asthma and the following biomarker profile: blood eosinophil count, 0.35 × 10⁹/L; F, 45 parts per billion (ppb); serum IgE, 350 kU/L; with positive skin test results for house dust mite.

Case Report 1 Discussion

Workup

In line with the first part of this severe asthma article series, many elements are given that confirm the clinical problem: uncontrolled type 2 high-inflammation asthma with evidence of allergic sensitization. We emphasize that atopy is a clinical definition based on allergic symptoms plus sensitization. The two missing workup elements are a confirmation of good adherence and a review of imaging. An assessment of inhaler technique and ICS adherence is critical to avoid unnecessary escalation of treatment to costly biologic therapies and can be assessed most easily by counting prescription refills. Adherence ideally is checked before meeting the patient, which allows for a prompt and frank conversation about nonadherence when identified. However, because a prescription does not necessarily equate to daily ICS use, if concern exists that poor control simply may reflect poor ICS adherence (as opposed to genuine severe asthma), a more robust objective evaluation such as ICS prescription refills, connection to an inhaler e-monitor, or an Fsuppression testis cost-effective. In general, Fof ≥ 40 ppb or a ≥ 20% increase in its value should prompt a review of adherence and inhaler technique. An up-to-date chest radiograph should suffice for imaging in view of her young age and the straightforward presentation of the disease. A high-resolution CT scan would be indicated if abnormalities appeared on the chest radiograph or atypical features were included in the history, such as a high exacerbation rate without elevated T2 biomarkers, a pulmonary function test pattern not fully consistent with obstruction, an absence of prednisolone-responsive symptoms, or a combination thereof.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma in adults and adolescents — difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium or high-dose treatment with the combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations; severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high-dose ICS-LABA therapy and treatment of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma. Severe asthma places a large physical, mental, emotional, social and economic burden on patients and is often associated with multimorbidity.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma

Refer people with severe asthma to a respiratory specialist, if possible

Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium- or high-dose ICS with a second controller (usually a LABA) or with maintenance oral corticosteroids, or that requires high-dose ICS to maintain good asthma control. For many such patients, their asthma can be well controlled by optimizing care, including identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors listed in Figs. 2 and 7 and Supplementary Fig. 1. Poor adherence and incorrect inhaler technique are particularly common contributors to poor asthma control.

Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma (Fig. 8). Severe asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high-dose ICS-LABA treatment with correct inhaler technique and management of contributory factors such as comorbidities and environment exposures, or that worsens when the dose of ICS-LABA is reduced.

Based on a study in the Netherlands, about 3–4% of people with asthma are estimated to have severe asthma, but many more patients have difficult-to-treat asthma, that could be improved by referral for specialist assessment and treatment. While a small proportion of people with asthma have severe disease, they contribute towards a disproportionately high level of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.

While most people with asthma can be managed in primary care, it can be challenging to identify those at risk of poor outcomes, and especially those with severe asthma. This difficulty is partly due to the nature of primary care, where large numbers of patients present with many different and often previously undiagnosed medical conditions, there can be severe time pressures, resources may be limited, and at follow-up a patient may see different healthcare professionals with varying levels of expertise or training about asthma. Furthermore, medical records may be poor or incomplete, making it difficult to form a perspective of long-term control and efficacy of treatments, and specifically correctly identifying those that may benefit from specialist referral.

### Severe asthma: an expanding and mounting clinical challenge [^11552Zna]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Although all patients with asthma have variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, some have disease that is severe in many aspects: persistent airflow obstruction, ongoing symptoms, increased frequency of exacerbations, and, most importantly, a diminished response to medications. A number of definitions have emerged to characterize the clinical features of severe asthma, but a central feature of this phenotype is the need for high doses of medications, especially corticosteroids, in attempts to achieve disease control. The prevalence of severe asthma is also undergoing reevaluation from the usual estimate of 10% to larger numbers on the basis of medication needs and the lack of disease control achieved. At present, the underlying mechanisms of severe asthma are not established but likely reflect a heterogeneous pattern, rather than a single unifying process. Guideline-directed treatment for severe asthma has limits with usual approaches centered on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β-agonists, and trials with omalizumab, the monoclonal antibody to IgE. With the development of approaches to recognize asthma phenotypes with distinct pathogenesis and hence unique therapeutic targets, it is hoped that a personalized strategy in treatment directed toward disease-specific features will improve outcomes for this high-risk, severely affected population of patients.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113da49b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma terminology and reporting — The page advises to explain that 'asthma control' tools such as ACQ and ACT assess only one domain of asthma control, and only over a short period of time, and to "Always emphasize the need for and benefit from ICS-containing treatment in patients with asthma, regardless of their symptom frequency or severity, and even if they have no obvious additional risk factors". For epidemiologic studies, it directs to "describe the prescribed (or dispensed) treatment, without imputing severity" and to "state the actual treatment class, rather than a treatment Step". For clinical trials, it instructs: "Describe the patient population by their level of asthma control and treatment, e.g., 'patients with uncontrolled asthma despite medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA' rather than 'moderate asthma'". It also notes that, pending ongoing discussions, "no change has been made to use of the term 'mild asthma' elsewhere in this GINA Strategy Report".

### Differentiation of adult severe asthma from difficult-to-treat asthma-outcomes of a systematic assessment protocol [^1168HwnZ]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend a differentiation of difficult-to-treat asthma from severe asthma. However, this might be complex and to which extent this distinction is achievable in clinical practice remains unknown.

Objective

To evaluate to which degree a systematic evaluation protocol enables a differentiation between severe versus difficult-to-treat asthma in patients in specialist care on high intensity asthma treatment, i.e. potentially severe asthma.

Methods

All adult asthma patients seen in four respiratory clinics over one year were screened prospectively for asthma severity. Patients with difficult-to-control asthma according to ERS/ATS criteria (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids/oral corticosteroids) underwent systematic assessment to differentiate severe asthma patients from those with other causes of poor asthma control: objective confirmation of the asthma diagnosis as well as assessment of treatment barriers and comorbidities.

Results

Overall, 1034 asthma patients were screened, of whom 175 (16.9%) had difficult-to-control asthma. 117 of these accepted inclusion, and completed systematic assessment. Asthma diagnosis was objectively confirmed in 88%. Sub-optimal adherence (42.5%), inhaler errors (31.5%) and unmanaged comorbidities (66.7%) were common. After primary assessment, 12% (14/117) fulfilled strict criteria for severe asthma. Moreover, 56% (66/117) were instantly classified as difficult-to-treat asthma due to poor adherence/inhaler technique. Finally, an ´overlap' group of 32% (37/117) were identified with patients being adherent and displaying correct inhaler technique, but had unmanaged comorbidities -potentially fitting into both the difficult-to-treat and severe group.

Conclusion

Only a minority of patients with difficult-to-control asthma were found to have severe asthma after primary systematic assessment. Nevertheless, strict categorisation of severe vs. difficult-to-treat asthma seems to pose a challenge.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^112fFtUo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluation and effective management of asthma, and in particular severe asthma, remains at the core of pulmonary practice. Over the last 20–30 years, there has been increasing appreciation that "severe asthma" encompasses multiple different subgroups or phenotypes, each with differing presentations. Using clinical phenotyping, in combination with rapidly advancing molecular tools and targeted monoclonal antibodies (human knockouts), the understanding of these phenotypes, and our ability to treat them, have greatly advanced. Type-2 (T2)-high and -low severe asthmas are now easily identified. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil counts can be routinely employed in clinical settings to identify these phenotypes and predict responses to specific therapies, meeting the initial goals of precision medicine. Integration of molecular signals, biomarkers, and clinical responses to targeted therapies has enabled identification of critical molecular pathways and, in certain phenotypes, advanced them to near-endotype status. Despite these advances, little guidance is available to determine which class of biologic is appropriate for a given patient, and current "breakthrough" therapies remain expensive and even inaccessible to many patients. Many of the most severe asthmas, with and without T2-biomarker elevations, remain poorly understood and treated. Nevertheless, conceptual understanding of "the severe asthmas" has evolved dramatically in a mere 25 years, leading to dramatic improvements in the lives of many.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114xoGng]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There are significant limitations to the utility of the ATS/ERS definition of mild asthma for both clinical practice and clinical trials, as highlighted in GINA 2022. This definition was intended as a retrospective label for clinical practice, but few patients in clinical practice have had their controller treatment stepped down to assess the minimum step at which their asthma remains controlled. It is not suitable for assessing clinical trial eligibility because of the time needed to establish the minimum effective treatment and the sporadic nature of exacerbations and because many clinical trials require asthma to be uncontrolled at entry. The exception is step-down studies; for example, 55% of the SYGMA (Symbicort Given as Needed in Mild Asthma) populations included patients considered by their physicians to have controlled asthma on ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA).

In addition, our review revealed that the patient populations included in previous studies of mild asthma have been heterogeneous and rarely consistent with the above definitions. Inclusion criteria for clinical trials have typically been based on symptom frequency (sometimes with an upper frequency limit), treatment degree, minimum values of FEV₁, or a combination of these factors. Many studies also require patients to have some impairment of FEV₁ and significant bronchodilator responsiveness at entry (to confirm the diagnosis of asthma), but these are also typical features of uncontrolled asthma.

A standardized definition of mild asthma for clinical research could decrease heterogeneity among studies, thereby making comparisons of study results more generalizable. However, the undertaking of defining it is fraught with challenges. Specific challenges include the following
1 An inherent difficulty is that asthma severity by its own definition/nature varies over time. This makes it impossible to select a cutoff point to define categorical severity groups during cross-sectional assessments.
2 In addition to variable disease activity, definitions underappreciate the heterogeneity in this population, such as not including patients with infrequent (rare but significant) events.
3 Moreover, there is a risk of failing to identify patients who may be at higher risk of poorer outcomes or disease progression and would thus require more aggressive management approaches.
4 It is essential that a standardized definition have utility for the fields in which it will be used (e.g. clinical practice, clinical trials).

Future research on mild asthma, suggested in this document, will provide the tools instrumental to circumventing these challenges, bridging knowledge gaps, and hence developing a widely accepted definition. In the interim, this ad hoc committee proposes the following working definition of mild asthma.

Adults and adolescents — referral and assessment for persistent symptoms: Patients of any age with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite correct inhaler technique and good adherence with Step 4 treatment should be referred to a specialist with expertise in investigation and management of severe asthma, if available (Evidence D), and the section heading specifies to refer for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on therapy. In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

How to distinguish between uncontrolled asthma and severe asthma — The page states, "Although good symptom control and minimal exacerbations can usually be achieved with ICS-containing treatment, some patients will not achieve one or both of these goals even with a long period of high-dose therapy", and notes that in many others, lack of control is due to "incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, over-use of SABA, comorbidities, persistent environmental exposures, or psychosocial factors". It emphasizes that "It is important to distinguish between severe asthma and uncontrolled asthma", outlines initial steps in primary care and further management including referral and add-on treatment, and lists problems to exclude before diagnosing severe asthma: "Poor inhaler technique (up to 80% of community patients)"; "Poor medication adherence"; "Incorrect diagnosis of asthma, with symptoms due to alternative conditions such as inducible laryngeal obstruction, cardiac failure or lack of fitness"; "Multimorbidity such as rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea"; and "Ongoing exposure to sensitizing or irritant agents in the home or work environment, including tobacco smoke".

### Severe asthma: comparison of different classifications of severity and control [^112TGdBe]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Criteria of asthma severity and control lack standardization.

Objective

to compare classifications of asthma severity and control, applied to patients from a severe asthma clinic.

Methods

Cross-sectional study of 473 patients followed up for ≥ 6 months, reclassified using three criteria: 1) the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010, 2) the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2000, and 3) the European Respiratory Society (ERS)/ATS 2014. In order to evaluate disease control, the 2012 and 2014 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) classifications were compared.

Results

According to the definition of WHO 2010, 429 had Difficult-to-treat severe asthma and only 12 presented Treatment-resistant severe asthma. 114 patients had Refractory asthma by ATS 2000 and 88 had Severe asthma by ERS/ATS 2014. Considering the definitions of WHO 2010, only 9 out of 12 with Treatment-resistant and 64 out of 429 with Difficult-to-treat severe asthma met the criteria of ATS 2000 and ERS/ATS 2014. As for GINA classification of control, 208 (44%) of the 473 subjects were classified as having asthma controlled by the 2014 criteria, whereas only 45 (10%) patients had controlled asthma by the GINA 2012 criteria. The Kappa statistic indicates the highest agreement of the severity classification occurred between the criteria of ATS 2000 and ERS/ATS 2014 (0.64).

Conclusion

Good agreement was found between Refractory asthma ATS 2000 and Severe asthma ERS/ATS 2014 classifications. However, poor agreement was observed between the severity rating proposed by the WHO and other classifications. The GINA control classifications of 2012 and 2014 also agreed poorly.
