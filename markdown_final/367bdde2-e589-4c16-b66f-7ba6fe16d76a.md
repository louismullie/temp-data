## Question

Which condition is characterized by low serum iron, low TIBC, normal transferrin saturation, and elevated ferritin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition is characterized by low serum iron, low TIBC, normal transferrin saturation, and elevated ferritin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which anemia patterns map to this iron-study profile. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic mechanism that would produce low iron and low TIBC with high ferritin and consider how TSAT behaves in inflammation. Next, I should rule out competing diagnoses like pure iron deficiency anemia or iron overload states. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and note how to corroborate it clinically and with adjunct tests, before concluding definitively.

> Let me first match the laboratory pattern. Low serum iron with simultaneously low TIBC and elevated ferritin points strongly toward inflammation-driven iron sequestration rather than absolute iron depletion, which is the canonical signature of anemia of inflammation, also called anemia of chronic disease [^117SGuKh] [^111wSktU] [^116xxuaK].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism to ensure internal consistency. In inflammatory states, cytokine-driven hepcidin rises, which reduces intestinal iron absorption and locks iron within macrophages, causing hypoferremia; concurrently, transferrin is a negative acute-phase reactant so TIBC falls, while ferritin rises as both an acute-phase reactant and a marker of iron trapped in the reticuloendothelial system; when both serum iron and transferrin decrease, the TSAT ratio can look normal or only modestly reduced, limiting its diagnostic utility in inflammation [^111wSktU] [^117NHivW] [^117SGuKh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TSAT. I initially treated "normal TSAT" as typical, but I should double-check: in many patients with anemia of inflammation, TSAT is actually low because the fall in serum iron often exceeds the fall in transferrin; however, in some inflammatory contexts, proportional declines can leave TSAT near-normal, which is why guidelines emphasize that TSAT alone is unreliable when inflammation is present; functional iron deficiency in CKD, for instance, is defined by TSAT < 20% with normal or high ferritin, and in IBD-related inflammation, ACD is supported when ferritin is > 100 µg/L with low TSAT, yet the described profile can still be seen early or variably in AI due to those proportional changes [^111CX2fR] [^1132BBN1] [^111o9XK7] [^111wSktU].

> Next, I should review competing patterns to avoid anchoring. Pure iron deficiency anemia typically shows low serum iron, high TIBC, low TSAT, and low ferritin, which does not match the low TIBC and high ferritin here; ECCO guidance highlights that without active inflammation, ferritin < 30 µg/L supports ID, whereas with active inflammation, ferritin < 100 µg/L may still indicate ID — both inconsistent with this clearly elevated ferritin scenario; other causes of microcytosis such as thalassemia traits and sideroblastic anemia have different iron-study constellations and do not classically give low TIBC with hyperferritinemia, further supporting anemia of inflammation as the best fit [^114934vw] [^115Cu3E3] [^112AkgfE].

> I need to ensure we confirm the inflammatory context and consider mixed etiologies. Clinically correlating with evidence of inflammation and checking CRP is essential, and if diagnostic uncertainty persists — especially about concomitant iron deficiency — consider sTfR or the sTfR/log ferritin index, or hepcidin, which can help distinguish AI from mixed AI+ID states; baseline anemia workup per KDIGO and ECCO should include CBC, ferritin, TSAT, and markers of inflammation, recognizing that both ferritin and TSAT are confounded by inflammation and should be interpreted in that context [^114Acp5z] [^116oqmLu] [^115tbARs] [^111wSktU].

> Putting it all together, I should confirm the diagnosis. The constellation of low serum iron, low TIBC, relatively preserved or normal TSAT in this context, and elevated ferritin, in the setting of inflammation, is most consistent with anemia of inflammation, also known as anemia of chronic disease, driven by hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration and reduced availability for erythropoiesis [^117SGuKh] [^111wSktU] [^117NHivW].

---

The condition with low serum iron, low TIBC, normal iron saturation, and elevated ferritin is **anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**, also called anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh]. This pattern reflects **hepcidin-driven iron sequestration** in macrophages [^114BsmYh], reduced transferrin, and ferritin elevation as an acute-phase reactant [^111wSktU] [^1124kgh5], producing functional iron deficiency with normal or mildly reduced transferrin saturation [^111CX2fR].

---

## Pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease

ACD arises from **chronic inflammation** (infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy, CKD) [^117SGuKh] and is primarily mediated by hepcidin, which:

- **Inhibits iron export**: Binds ferroportin, reducing iron release from macrophages and enterocytes, causing hypoferremia despite adequate stores [^1114Y6P7].
- **Reduces transferrin**: Inflammation lowers transferrin synthesis, decreasing TIBC [^117NHivW].
- **Elevates ferritin**: Ferritin rises as an acute-phase reactant, reflecting inflammation more than true iron stores [^111wSktU].
- **Suppresses erythropoiesis**: Cytokines blunt erythropoietin production and erythroid proliferation, worsening anemia [^117SGuKh].

---

## Laboratory findings in anemia of chronic disease

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Typical findings in ACD** |
|-|-|
| Serum iron | Low |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | Low |
| Transferrin saturation | Normal or mildly reduced |
| Ferritin | Elevated [^117SGuKh] |
| Hemoglobin | Low (normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia) |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Elevated [^114G1cVV] |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | Elevated |

---

## Clinical conditions associated with anemia of chronic disease

ACD is common in **chronic inflammatory states**, including [^117SGuKh]:

- **Chronic infections**: Tuberculosis, HIV, endocarditis [^117SGuKh].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Reduced erythropoietin and inflammation.
- **Malignancies**: Solid tumors and hematologic cancers [^1169x3Bz].
- **Chronic inflammatory diseases**: Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure [^115Cu3E3] [^113ucEtZ].

---

## Differentiation from other iron-related disorders

ACD must be distinguished from **other iron disorders** [^112AkgfE]. Iron deficiency anemia shows low serum iron, high TIBC, low ferritin, and low transferrin saturation [^1118A3Wp]. Iron overload disorders (e.g. hemochromatosis) present with high serum iron, high ferritin, high transferrin saturation, and normal or high TIBC. Functional iron deficiency presents with low serum iron and normal or high ferritin with low transferrin saturation, often in CKD or during ESA therapy [^111CX2fR].

---

## Clinical implications and management

ACD reflects underlying inflammation and is associated with worse outcomes in chronic disease [^112UTSei]. Management focuses on:

- **Treat the cause**: Control the underlying inflammatory or chronic disease [^117SGuKh].
- **Iron therapy**: IV iron may help when functional iron deficiency limits erythropoiesis [^116oxpC2].
- **ESAs**: Consider in CKD or cancer-related anemia after correcting iron deficiency [^115HsamL] [^1169x3Bz].
- **Monitor**: Track hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation to guide therapy and avoid iron overload [^116oqmLu].

---

The condition with low serum iron, low TIBC, normal iron saturation, and elevated ferritin is **anemia of chronic disease**, driven by hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration and inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Management centers on treating the underlying disease, correcting iron deficiency, and selective use of ESAs.

### Serum ferritin is derived primarily from macrophages through a nonclassical secretory pathway [^1124kgh5]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

The serum ferritin concentration is a clinical parameter measured widely for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Its levels increase with elevations of tissue iron stores and with inflammation, but studies on cellular sources of serum ferritin, as well as its subunit composition, degree of iron loading, and glycosylation, have given rise to conflicting results. To gain further understanding of serum ferritin, we have used traditional and modern methodologies to characterize mouse serum ferritin.

We find that both splenic macrophages and proximal tubule cells of the kidney are possible cellular sources for serum ferritin and that serum ferritin is secreted by cells rather than being the product of a cytosolic leak from damaged cells. Mouse serum ferritin is composed mostly of L-subunits, whereas it contains few H-subunits, and the iron content is low. L-subunits of serum ferritin are frequently truncated at the C-terminus, giving rise to a characteristic 17-kD band that has been previously observed in lysosomal ferritin. Taken together with the fact that mouse serum ferritin is not detectably glycosylated, we propose that mouse serum ferritin is secreted through the nonclassical lysosomal secretory pathway.

### The role of iron in chronic inflammatory diseases: From mechanisms to treatment options in anemia of inflammation [^114BsmYh]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI) is a highly prevalent comorbidity in patients affected by chronic inflammatory disorders such as chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. These conditions negatively affect disease outcomes and quality of life. The pathophysiology of AI is multifactorial, with inflammatory hypoferremia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis playing major roles within disease-specific factors. Here, we review the recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to iron dysregulation in AI, the impact of hypoferremia and anemia on the course of the underlying disease, and novel therapeutic strategies applied to treat AI.

Iron deficiency is considered present if ferritin is less than 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT is less than 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting.

Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status; therefore, a higher cutoff (less than 100 µg/L) is needed to define IDA in these settings. Also, in inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis.
- **Hepcidin and iron homeostasis**:
	- The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes.
	- In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase in response to inflammatory cytokines, resulting in decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis.
	- Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation, and consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency.
	- The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency. For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (less than 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to the initial evaluation, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests as part of the initial evaluation of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of age and CKD stage:

- **Complete blood count**: including CBC for a comprehensive hematological assessment.
- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: to assess bone marrow activity and erythropoiesis.
- **Serum ferritin level**: to evaluate iron stores and potential iron deficiency.
- **Serum transferrin saturation**: for analyzing the availability of iron for erythropoiesis.
- **Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels**: to detect any deficiencies that could contribute to anemia.

### Adjusting total body iron for inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^111jBHu7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Total body iron (TBI) calculated from ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) allows for the evaluation of the full range of iron status from deficiency to excess. However, both ferritin and sTfR are affected by inflammation and malaria, which may require statistical adjustment. Although TBI has been used to assess iron status in the United States, its use worldwide and in settings with inflammation has been limited.

- **Objective**: We examine whether inflammation-adjusted ferritin and sTfR concentrations affect TBI values and the prevalence of low TBI. The study focuses on:
	1. α-1-acid glycoprotein concentration > 1 g/L.
	2. The application of arithmetic correction factors.
	3. The use of regression correction.
- **Results**: Regardless of the method used to adjust ferritin and sTfR for inflammation, the adjusted mean TBI decreased in both preschool children (PSC) and women of reproductive age (WRA) compared with unadjusted values. Subsequently, inflammation-adjusted TBI increased the prevalence of low TBI by a median of 4–14 percentage points (pps) in PSC and 1–3 pps in WRA.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning the evaluation for functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend measuring serum ferritin levels in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. Values should be viewed at or above 1,200 mcg/L to evaluate the potential for iron overload.

### Anemia of inflammation [^116xxuaK]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammation arising from various etiologies, including infection, autoimmune disorders, chronic diseases, and aging, can promote anemia. The anemia of inflammation (AI) is most often normocytic and normochromic and is usually mild. Characteristic changes in systemic iron handling, erythrocyte production, and erythrocyte life span all contribute to AI. The preferred treatment is directed at the underlying disease. However, when the inflammatory insult is intractable or the cause has not been diagnosed, there are limited options for the treatment of AI. Because anemia is a comorbid condition associated with poor outcomes in various chronic disease states, understanding its pathogenesis and developing new tools for its treatment should remain a priority.

Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide has taken center stage in recent years as a potent modulator of iron availability. As the technology for quantitative hepcidin analysis improves, hepcidin's role in various disease states is also being revealed. Recent insights concerning the regulatory pathways that modify hepcidin expression have identified novel targets for drug development. As the field advances with such therapeutics, the analysis of the impact of normalized hemoglobin on disease outcomes will confirm whether anemia is a reversible independent contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory diseases.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: Current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective, and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide hepcidin plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed.

Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^114RqVtL]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

As described earlier, inflammatory signals and the restriction in iron availability impair erythropoiesis, contributing to the development of AI. In response to hypoxia, EPO secretion increases, which promotes tissue repair and the expansion of erythroblasts while attenuating inflammatory signaling.

Erythroblasts secrete ERFE, which disrupts bone morphogenetic protein signaling, reducing hepcidin secretion by hepatocytes and thereby allowing iron release to support erythropoiesis. However, chronic inflammatory signals can unbalance this homeostatic loop by suppressing EPO production and its downstream signaling. Thus, in chronic pathologies, this dysregulation causes inflammatory iron restriction to progress into absolute ID, making it common for AI to coexist with ID anemia (IDA). Under conditions of ID, the production of EPO in response to hypoxia is further diminished as the body attempts to conserve limited iron resources for essential functions beyond erythropoiesis. This suppression impairs the maturation of red blood cells, thereby complicating the restoration of hemoglobin levels when AI and IDA occur simultaneously.

ID and inflammation are considered the main contributors to anemia in RDEB, yet the role of specific mediators and the reasons behind the limited efficacy of therapies remain incompletely understood. In RDEB, continuous wounding leads to unrelenting inflammation that complicates anemia recovery. However, because of the constant risk of infection, anti-inflammatory drugs are not the first line of treatment for RDEB. This situation underscores the challenges in managing anemia associated with RDEB.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115ah5qv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Previously, the Ganzoni formula has been widely used to estimate iron requirements and dosage, although this has been criticized as inconvenient, inconsistent, and inaccurate. More recently, a novel scheme of total iron calculation has been proposed and provides a simple and efficient dosing regimen. Although this scheme has only been evaluated for the dosing of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose, physicians have broadly adopted it for use with other intravenous iron products. Adjustments may be made in patients with very severe anemia (< 7.0 g/dL). In these patients, experts suggest an additional dosage of 500–1000 mg according to evaluated tolerability.
- **Estimated total iron need in inflammatory bowel disease patients with iron-deficiency anemia**: After successful initial treatment of ID anemia, IBD patients are still at an increased risk of anemia recurrence and may benefit from prophylactic iron substitution. Initial infusions with ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) seem to adequately prevent recurrences. Recent data suggest an intravenous iron re-treatment as soon as serum ferritin drops below 100 µg/L or recurrence of anemia occurs. Notably, Ali et al. demonstrated that up to 8 weeks after intravenous iron-dextran therapy, ferritin levels may not sufficiently reflect the availability of iron in patients' bone marrow, suggesting that clinicians should avoid assessing the response too soon after therapy.
- **Therapy of ACD in IBD**: After diagnosing ACD and addressing any coincident ID, treatment of ACD should focus on optimization of IBD treatment.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^1122PKte]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Although anemia is the most common systemic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among the broad spectrum of extraintestinal disease complications encountered in IBD, including arthritis and osteopathy, it has generally received little consideration. However, not only in terms of frequency, but also with regard to its potential effect on hospitalization rates and on the quality of life and work, anemia is indeed a significant and costly complication of IBD. Anemia is multifactorial in nature, with the most prevalent etiological forms being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease. In a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, the determination of iron status using common biochemical parameters alone is inadequate. A more accurate assessment may be attained using new iron indices, including reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, or zinc protoporphyrin.

While oral iron supplementation has traditionally been a mainstay of IDA treatment, it has also been linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. However, many physicians are still reluctant to administer iron intravenously, despite the wide availability of a variety of new IV preparations with improved safety profiles, and despite the recommendations of international expert guidelines. This article discusses improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on new clinical insights into the regulation of iron homeostasis.

### Adjusting retinol-binding protein concentrations for inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^111CrL9b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The accurate estimation of the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is important in planning and implementing interventions. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is often used in population surveys to measure vitamin A status, but its interpretation is challenging in settings where inflammation is common because RBP concentrations decrease during the acute-phase response.
- **Objectives**: We aimed to assess the relation between RBP concentrations and inflammation and malaria in preschool children (PSC) (age range: 6–59 months) and women of reproductive age (WRA) (age range: 15–49 years) and to investigate adjustment algorithms to account for these effects.
- **Design**: Cross-sectional data from 8 surveys for PSC (n = 8803) and 4 surveys for WRA (n = 4191) from the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project were analyzed individually and combined with the use of a meta-analysis. Several approaches were explored to adjust RBP concentrations in PSC in inflammation and malaria settings as follows: 1) the exclusion of subjects with C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations > 5 mg/L or α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations > 1 g/L, 2) the application of arithmetic correction factors, and 3) the use of a regression correction approach. The impact of adjustment on the estimated prevalence of VAD (defined as < 0.7 μmol/L) was examined in PSC.
- **Results**: The relation between estimated VAD and CRP and AGP deciles followed a linear pattern in PSC. In women, the correlations between RBP and CRP and AGP were too weak to justify adjustments for inflammation and malaria.

### Proinflammatory state, hepcidin, and anemia in older persons [^111mY6LT]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with overt inflammatory diseases, up-regulated hepcidin impairs iron absorption and macrophage release, causing anemia. Whether the mild proinflammatory state of aging is associated with increased hepcidin is unknown. We characterized the relationships between urinary hepcidin, iron status, anemia, and inflammation in 582 patients aged 65 years or older, participating in the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, "Aging in the Chianti Area") study, a population-based study of aging in Tuscany, Italy. Compared with non-anemic individuals, urinary hepcidin (nanograms/milligram of urinary creatinine) was significantly lower in cases of iron deficiency and inflammatory anemia compared to those with no anemia or other anemia types. Urinary hepcidin showed a positive correlation with log(ferritin) and a negative correlation with the soluble transferrin receptor/log(ferritin) ratio, but it did not correlate with markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Lower iron status was significantly correlated with higher levels of IL-6 and CRP. Upon adjusting for confounders, IL-6 and CRP remained significantly associated with serum iron, with no evidence that such a relationship was accounted for by variability in urinary hepcidin. In conclusion, elevated proinflammatory markers were associated with anemia and low iron status, but not with higher urinary hepcidin. Future studies should identify whether hepcidin production becomes up-regulated only in situations of overt inflammation.

### Anaemia and inflammation: What are the implications for the nephrologist [^117UAXjz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by a high mortality rate, mainly caused by cardiovascular disease. In patients with ESRD, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased oxidative stress are common features and may contribute to the development of malnutrition, anaemia, resistance to recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin), and atherosclerosis. The onset of inflammation is multi-factorial and is a predictor of poor outcomes in ESRD. Although inflammation may reflect the underlying cardiovascular disease, the acute-phase response may also contribute to both oxidative stress and progressive vascular injury. The acute-phase response in these patients may be influenced by a number of factors, possibly including the dialysis procedure itself.

Inflammation and the acute-phase response interact with the haematopoietic system at several levels, resulting in reduced erythropoiesis, accelerated destruction of erythrocytes, and blunting of the reactive increase in erythropoietin in response to reduced haemoglobin levels. In patients with ESRD, epoetin resistance has been linked with inflammation, which is often associated with a state of functional iron deficiency. Patients with ESRD are thought to have a reduced capacity to control oxidative stress, and there is evidence suggesting that a relationship may exist between inflammation, oxidative stress, and the treatment of anaemia with epoetin. Controlled trials are needed before evidence-based recommendations for the management of inflammation-induced anaemia and resistance to epoetin can be developed.

### Assessment of iron status in settings of inflammation: challenges and potential approaches [^114B8zHG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The determination of iron status is challenging when concomitant infection and inflammation are present because of the confounding effects of the acute-phase response on the interpretation of most iron indicators. This review summarizes the effects of inflammation on indicators of iron status and assesses the impact of a regression analysis to adjust for inflammation on estimates of iron deficiency (ID) in low- and high-infection-burden settings.

We overviewed cross-sectional data from 16 surveys for preschool children (PSC) (n = 29,765) and from 10 surveys for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) (n = 25,731) from the Biomarkers Reflecting the Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project. Effects of C-reactive protein (CRP) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations on estimates of ID according to serum ferritin (SF) (used generically to include plasma ferritin), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron (TBI) were summarized in relation to infection burden (in the United States compared with other countries) and population group (PSC compared with WRA).

Effects of the concentrations of CRP and AGP on SF, sTfR, and TBI were generally linear, especially in PSC. Overall, regression correction changed the estimated prevalence of ID in PSC by a median of +25 percentage points (pps) when SF concentrations were used, by -15 pps when sTfR concentrations were used, and by +14 pps when TBI was used. The estimated prevalence of ID in WRA changed by a median of +8 pps when SF concentrations were used and by -10 pps when sTfR concentrations were used.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD, and IBD reveals no consensus on practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia. Only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition. Whether this is due to a lack of awareness or an intentional omission is difficult to establish.

Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). However, guidelines often lack agreement on test cut-off values for these parameters. Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation, and some guidelines recommend the assessment of chronic inflammation according to inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There is little consensus for many conditions on when these should be measured, whether it should be a standard practice for all patients, or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic.

Moreover, no standard CRP cut-off values are provided, although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold. This is not recognized in most guidelines.

- **Summary of iron deficiency diagnostic measures**: Independent of anemia, iron deficiency anemia has more guideline coverage than iron deficiency.

### Research, policy, and programmatic considerations from the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project [^114nEpYh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project sought to inform the interpretation of iron and vitamin A biomarkers (ferritin, serum transferrin receptor, and retinol binding protein) in settings of prevalent inflammation, as well as the prevention and control strategies to address anemia. Our purpose is to comment on the contributions of the BRINDA to advance global knowledge with regard to iron and vitamin A status assessment in women and preschool children and to analyze the findings in terms of their rigor and usefulness for global nutrition research and programs.

BRINDA investigators found that the acute-phase response is so prevalent that it must be assessed in surveys of iron and vitamin A status for valid interpretation of micronutrient biomarkers. Furthermore, they found that C-reactive protein and α-1-acid glycoprotein provide important and different information about these responses and that common survey variables cannot replace the information they provide. Developing a method for adjusting micronutrient biomarkers for the independent influence of inflammation is challenging and complex, and BRINDA has brought greater clarity to this challenge through the use of large and diverse data sets. When comparing approaches, the regression methods appear to perform best when sample sizes are sufficient and adequate statistical capacity is available. Further correction for malaria does not appear to materially alter regression-adjusted prevalence estimates. We suggest that researchers present both adjusted and unadjusted estimates of micronutrient biomarkers.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend diagnosing iron deficiency in the presence of serum ferritin < 30 mcg/L in patients without clinical, endoscopic, or biochemical evidence of active disease.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Blood (2019). High credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI), also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is regarded as the most frequent anemia in hospitalized and chronically ill patients. It is prevalent in patients with diseases that cause prolonged immune activation, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. More recently, the list has grown to include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, and obesity.

Inflammation-inducible cytokines and the master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, block intestinal iron absorption and cause iron retention in reticuloendothelial cells, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis. In addition, a shortened erythrocyte half-life, suppressed erythropoietin response to anemia, and inhibition of erythroid cell differentiation by inflammatory mediators further contribute to AI in a disease-specific pattern. Although the diagnosis of AI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is supported by characteristic alterations in iron homeostasis, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia, the diagnosis of AI in patients with coexisting iron deficiency is more difficult.

In addition to treatment of the disease underlying AI, the combination of iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can improve anemia in many patients. In the future, emerging therapeutics that antagonize hepcidin function and redistribute endogenous iron for erythropoiesis may offer additional options. However, based on experience with anemia treatment in chronic kidney disease, critical illness, and cancer, determining the appropriate indications for specific treatments remains a challenge.

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: Should we change our practice [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The near-universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes diagnosing iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis.

Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus, large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period presents an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

### Anemia from inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage and relationships with outcome [^117NHivW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Anemia from inflammation is characterized by inflammation's inhibition of dietary iron absorption while increasing iron sequestration in macrophages through hepcidin. This is thought to promote evolutionarily developed efforts to decrease circulating iron, which normally facilitates bacterial proliferation and etiology. This serum iron decrement is accompanied by decrements in transferrin, the primary circulating binding protein of iron. Meanwhile, serum ferritin, representing secreted iron from iron-filled macrophages and an inflammatory acute-phase reactant, conversely increases. Additionally, RBC half-life is shortened, and erythropoiesis response to anemia is also suppressed. This type of multimodal impairment of RBC survival and erythropoiesis is known to be a major driver of anemia development and maintenance in critical illness. Our study recapitulates these well-known iron biomarker characteristics seen with inflammation in a novel patient population with ICH. However, it is worth mentioning that while certain studies have suggested that anemia of inflammation can manifest acutely, the inflammatory impairment of erythropoiesis has been thought to be a more prolonged and chronic process. Thus, we cannot exclude that the kinetics of the hemoglobin decrements identified in our ICH cohorts over the initial days were in part due to other superimposed unmeasured processes seen in critical illness like hemolysis, phlebotomy, hemodilution, fluid resuscitation, or other sources of blood loss or clearance. Yet it is worth mentioning that we adjusted for ICH severity, systemic medi…

### Iron deficiency is highly prevalent among candidates for metabolic surgery and may affect perioperative outcomes [^117LtQNM]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The presence of chronic low-grade inflammation, commonly identified in patients with severe obesity, alters iron homeostasis and indicators of iron status, fostering the development of updated guidelines for the diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID). Recommended diagnostic thresholds for ID in obesity derived from expert opinion include a ferritin level of < 30 ng/mL and/or transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. Earlier studies of ID among candidates for metabolic surgery using low levels of ferritin or iron as diagnostic thresholds demonstrated a prevalence of 5%-20%.
- **Objectives**: Using the recommended diagnostic thresholds for ID, this study measures the prevalence of ID in a large cohort of surgical candidates and its relationship to surgical outcomes.
- **Setting**: Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania.
- **Methods**: The study cohort included 3,723 patients who underwent pre-operative nutritional assessment, which included markers of iron nutrition over the period 2004–2018.
- **Results**: The cohort included 2,988 women (80.3%) and 735 men (19.7%); body mass index: 49.4 ± 9 kg/m². The diagnosis of ID was based on ferritin level < 30 ng/mL (true ID) and/or TSAT < 20%, representing a combination of true ID and inflammation (serum ferritin ≥ 30 ng/mL and TSAT < 20%). A total of 399 patients (10.8%) were anemic. A serum ferritin level of < 30 ng/mL was found in 488 patients (13%; 481 women and 7 men). Of these, 122 patients (25.2%) were also anemic. An additional 1,204 had serum ferritin ≥ 30 ng/mL and TSAT < 20%. Overall, 1,692 patients (45.4%) in this cohort were affected.

### Anemia and anemia correction: surrogate markers or causes of morbidity in chronic kidney disease [^112UTSei]. Nature Clinical Practice Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially interpreted to suggest that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, this assumption of causality overlooks the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated, both being caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress, and comorbid conditions.

Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. Consequently, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations suggest that an overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, is the likely culprit.

This review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. The focus is on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.

### Adjusting ferritin concentrations for inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^112JYUiN]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

We showed a stronger relation between inflammatory and ferritin biomarkers in children than in women, which translated into a greater increase in the estimated prevalence of depleted iron stores in children when adjusted for inflammation. This result may be indicative of differences in the response of ferritin to an inflammatory event across the life cycle. Although this hypothesis needs to be further explored, there has been supporting evidence of age-specific differences when it comes to iron metabolism, malaria, and pharmacokinetics.

The principal limitations of this study are the selection of data sets on the basis of convenience (i.e. the availability of data from BRINDA partners), the cross-sectional nature of the data, and the absence of a gold-standard measure of iron status. With the use of the BRINDA database, we were unable to determine whether CRP and AGP incompletely capture the relation between ferritin and inflammation or, alternatively, whether the adjustment approaches overadjust ferritin concentrations on the basis of a third unknown confounder. A comparison of adjustment approaches against a gold standard (e.g. bone marrow iron) and the use of longitudinal data would further contribute to the evidence.

An exploration of the potential utility of other iron biomarkers that are less affected by inflammation and infections would be worthwhile. One such biomarker, soluble transferrin receptor, was also shown to be influenced by inflammation and infections both individually and as part of the body iron equation with the use of a similar adjustment approach.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114nUyag]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches, and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^113MPkLy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent research by Thomas et al. has confirmed the cytometry of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) and the percentage of hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) to have a high predictive value in the differential diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), even when inflammation and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) are present. A reduction in %HYPO, with a mean lifetime of 120 days, denotes a longer-term deficiency in iron supply. In contrast, reduced CHr, with a mean lifetime of 48 hours, is an indicator of iron deficiency, providing an accurate measurement of bioavailable iron over the previous 3–4 days.

In hemodialysis patients, CHr < 29 pg has been demonstrated to be a more accurate measure of functional iron deficiency than the combined use of ferritin and transferrin saturation (TfS). Furthermore, CHr measurement may predict the response to intravenous (IV) iron therapy within 2–4 days after onset. However, there are no data available from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114afHPN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In humans, multiple factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy, environment, and nutrition, influence hemoglobin (Hb) levels. In general, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a decline in blood Hb according to certain reference levels. These cutoff levels apply equally to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as the definitions do not vary according to comorbidities. Considering the high prevalence of anemia in chronic inflammatory diseases, the recently published European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) guideline on anemia recommends regular screening according to disease severity and activity.

More specifically, anemia assessment in outpatients with active inflammation, indicated by highly elevated inflammatory biomarkers or significant endoscopic proof of disease activity, should be performed at least every three months. In contrast, screening intervals for outpatients who show few signs of systemic inflammation or are in remission can be extended to every six to twelve months. Special attention should be paid to children and adolescents. Common diagnostic markers for anemia assessment may be applied to patients without clinical, endoscopic, or biochemical evidence of active disease. However, in patients with IBD who have active disease, are receiving ongoing therapy, or have undergone extensive small bowel resection, important parameters for the assessment of anemia, such as erythrocyte indices, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TfS), do not always provide sufficient accuracy. It should be remembered that ferritin is an acute-phase protein that is increased in the context of inflammation.

### Inflammation and anaemia in a broad spectrum of patients with heart failure [^113ucEtZ]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Anaemia in heart failure (HF) is associated with a poor prognosis. Although inflammation is assumed to be an important cause of anaemia, the association between anaemia and inflammatory markers in patients with HF has not been well established.

- **Methods**: Data from a multicentre randomised clinical trial, in which patients were eligible if they were > 18 years of age and admitted for HF (New York Heart Association II-IV), were used. In a subset of 326 patients, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR)-1 and erythropoietin (Epo) were measured at discharge, and the primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Follow-up was 18 months.

- **Results**: Anaemia (Hb < 13 g/dl in men and < 12 g/dl in women) was present in 40% (130/326) of the study population. Median levels of IL-6, hsCRP, and sTNFR-1 were significantly higher in anaemic patients than in non-anaemic patients. Logistic regression demonstrated that each increase in hsCRP values (OR 1.58 per SD log hsCRP; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.29; p = 0.016) and each increase in sTNFR-1 values (OR 1.62 per SD log sTNFR-1; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.11; p < 0.001) were independently associated with anaemia. Epo (HR 1.31 per log Epo; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.69; p = 0.041) and sTNFR-1 (HR 1.47 per log sTNFR-1; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.86; p = 0.001) levels were independently associated with outcome.

- **Conclusion**: Anaemia is present in 40% of patients hospitalised for HF and is independently associated with inflammation.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiation of Vafseo. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of Vafseo and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months, then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue Vafseo if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Vafseo sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. Vafseo can be taken with or without food and should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

### Assessment of vitamin D status and association with inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^11152dRN]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

The justification to adjust estimates of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency for inflammation requires a strong biologic basis; however, our understanding remains limited about the bidirectional relationship between vitamin D and inflammation. Many have postulated that vitamin D deficiency is the consequence of inflammation, possibly owing to the rapid renal conversion between prohormone 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which is up-regulated during infection or inflammation. Evidence supporting this hypothesis remains mixed, as several studies observed that the concentration of 25(OH)D dropped after inflammation, whereas other studies found that the concentration of 25(OH)D was relatively stable during and after the course of infection and inflammation. In contrast, others have argued that vitamin D deficiency can contribute to inflammation through promoting the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, activating adaptive immune response, and modulating cytosol calcium concentrations. Furthermore, excess 25(OH)D concentrations could also lead to proinflammatory effects and increase the risk of chronic diseases. The biological mechanisms linking vitamin D and inflammatory biomarkers need to be better understood before justifying the adjustment of vitamin D biomarkers for inflammation.

At least 99% of the 25(OH)D in serum is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) or albumin, both of which are negative acute phase reactants. Therefore, declines in serum VDBP and albumin concentrations may contribute to a decline in the total 25(OH)D within.

### Methodologic approach for the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project [^1123YYmL]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

The Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project is a multiagency and multicountry collaboration formed to improve micronutrient assessment and better characterize anemia. The aims of the project were to:

- **Identify factors associated with inflammation**: Assess the relations between inflammation, malaria infection, and biomarkers of iron and vitamin A status and compare adjustment approaches.

- **Assess risk factors for anemia**: Focus on preschool children (PSC) and women of reproductive age (WRA).

The BRINDA database inclusion criteria included surveys that:

- Were conducted after 2004.
- Had target groups of PSC, WRA, or both.
- Used a similar laboratory methodology for the measurement of ≥ 1 biomarker of iron (ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor) or vitamin A status (retinol-binding protein or retinol) and ≥ 1 biomarker of inflammation (α-1-acid glycoprotein or C-reactive protein).

Individual data sets were standardized and merged into a BRINDA database comprising 16 nationally and regionally representative surveys from 14 countries. Collectively, the database covered all six WHO geographic regions and contained approximately 30,000 PSC and 27,000 WRA. Data were analyzed individually and combined with the use of a meta-analysis. The methods used to standardize the BRINDA database and the analytic approaches addressing the project's research questions are presented in this article.

### Regulation of iron homeostasis in anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^1114Y6P7]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is characterized by macrophage iron retention induced by cytokines and the master regulator hepcidin. Hepcidin controls cellular iron efflux by binding to the iron export protein ferroportin. Many patients, however, present with both ACD and iron deficiency anemia (ACD/IDA), the latter resulting from chronic blood loss. We used a rat model of ACD resulting from chronic arthritis and mimicked ACD/IDA by additional phlebotomy to define differing iron-regulatory pathways. Iron retention during inflammation occurs in macrophages and the spleen, but not in the liver. In rats and humans with ACD, serum hepcidin concentrations are elevated, which is paralleled by reduced duodenal and macrophage expression of ferroportin. Individuals with ACD/IDA have significantly lower hepcidin levels than ACD subjects, and ACD/IDA persons, in contrast to ACD subjects, were able to absorb dietary iron from the gut and mobilize iron from macrophages. Circulating hepcidin levels affect iron traffic in ACD and ACD/IDA and are more responsive to the erythropoietic demands for iron than to inflammation. Hepcidin determination may aid in differentiating between ACD and ACD/IDA and in selecting appropriate therapy for these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115iRmFf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In identifying anemia in IBD patients, low serum ferritin levels (< 30 µg/L), high transferrin levels, and a decreased MCV index are routinely used to screen for iron deficiency (ID). However, in IBD patients, these parameters may not always yield reliable conclusions due to overlapping causes of anemia and multiple confounding factors. Specifically, active inflammation can result in falsely normal or elevated ferritin levels as part of an acute-phase reaction. Under chronic inflammatory conditions, other parameters of low iron stores are also less interpretable due to changes such as increased platelet counts or low transferrin levels. In these cases, it is important to consider that serum ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L do not adequately exclude ID.

The concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) may indicate the status of iron supply more precisely, as it is not influenced by chronic inflammation. Recently, the ratio of sTfR to the logarithm of serum ferritin (sTfR/log ferritin index) has been reported to provide more accuracy in differentiating ID anemia from anemia of chronic disease (ACD). For example, a prospective multicenter observational trial in a cohort of 145 non-IBD patients with anemia demonstrated the utility of the sTfR/log ferritin index. Skikne et al. demonstrated that subjects with ID anemia or ACD + ID anemia had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR/log ferritin index values than subjects with ACD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves produced cutoffs of 21 nmol/L for sTfR and 14 (using nmol/L) for the sTfR/log ferritin index. The sTfR/log ferritin index was superior to sTfR in distinguishing these conditions.

### Use of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the assessment of iron deficiency in children with inflammatory bowel disease [^116p455K]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and anemia affect up to 50% to 75% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diagnosing iron deficiency in IBD can be challenging due to the impact of inflammation on iron status biomarkers. Consequently, there is a need for improved methods to accurately determine iron status in IBD.
- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to investigate the association of inflammation with the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (CHr) and assess the utility of CHr in comparison to standard iron biomarkers.
- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children with IBD. Iron biomarkers, including CHr, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, and hemoglobin, were measured alongside systemic biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein and α1-acid glycoprotein. Spearman correlations were used to evaluate the relationship between inflammation and iron biomarkers. The criterion standard for iron deficiency was defined as inflammation-corrected ferritin 8.3 mg/L. Receiver operating characteristic curves were employed to estimate the prognostic values of all iron biomarkers to identify patients with iron deficiency.
- **Results**: We analyzed data from 62 children aged 5 to 18 years. Sixty-nine percent of subjects had Crohn's disease, and 31% had ulcerative colitis, with 42% being girls and 53% African American. The prevalence of anemia was 32%, while iron deficiency prevalence was 52% using ferritin 8.3 mg/L, 39% using red blood cell distribution width of > 14.5%, 26% using body iron stores of < 0 mg/kg body weight, and 25% using CHr of < 28 pg.

Anemia is the most frequent extra-intestinal finding in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to determine the prevalence and types of anemia in pediatric patients with IBD at diagnosis and at approximately a one-year follow-up.

This retrospective chart review included patients diagnosed with IBD from 2005 to 2012, ranging in age from 1 to 18 years. Patients with hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and iron indices measured at diagnosis and approximately one year later were included in the study. The prevalence of anemia at the beginning and end of the study was recorded. The type of anemia was determined using the soluble transferrin receptor index.

At diagnosis, 67.31% of patients were anemic. Overall, 28.85% of patients had either iron deficiency anemia (IDA) or a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), whereas 38.46% had ACD alone. At follow-up, 20.51% were anemic; 15.38% had either IDA or a combination of IDA and ACD, while 5.13% had ACD alone. The pattern of anemia and response to therapy differed among IBD phenotypes. Anemia was more frequent in inflammatory bowel disease, with a higher prevalence in Crohn's disease (CD). At one year, the prevalence of anemia decreased significantly but persisted. Anemia of chronic disease predominated in CD. Iron deficiency anemia continued to be present in CD and ulcerative colitis.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^116ospjn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Although anemia is the most common systemic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), among the broad spectrum of extraintestinal disease complications encountered in IBD, including arthritis and osteopathy, it has generally received little consideration. However, not only in terms of frequency but also with regard to its potential effect on hospitalization rates and on the quality of life and work, anemia is indeed a significant and costly complication of IBD.

Anemia is multifactorial in nature, with the most prevalent etiological forms being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease. In a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, the determination of iron status using common biochemical parameters alone is inadequate. A more accurate assessment may be attained using new iron indices including reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, or zinc protoporphyrin.

While oral iron supplementation has traditionally been a mainstay of IDA treatment, it has also been linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. However, many physicians are still reluctant to administer iron intravenously, despite the wide availability of a variety of new IV preparations with improved safety profiles, and despite the recommendations of international expert guidelines. This article discusses improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on new clinical insights into the regulation of iron homeostasis.

### Adjusting soluble transferrin receptor concentrations for inflammation: Biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^115wE4Pd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The estimated prevalence of iron-deficient erythropoiesis using AGP to adjust sTfR for inflammation varied widely. The prevalence of unadjusted sTfR concentration > 8.3 mg/L was higher in children than in women, with ranges in preschool children (PSC) from 4.1% to 76.7%, and in women of reproductive age (WRA) from 5.8% to 34.0%.

- **Elevated sTfR concentrations in preschool children**: Estimated prevalence [% (95% CI)] was determined using different adjustment factors based on elevated AGP, as part of the BRINDA project.
	- Surveys are ordered alphabetically, and bars with different lowercase letters within a given country indicate significant differences, P < 0.05 (adjusted using Bonferroni correction).
	- AGP-BCF: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.93), QE(df = 16) = 2012.3; P < 0.0001. Reference value for AGP: −0.52 ln(g/L), QE(df = 10) = 584.5546, P < 0.0001.
	- **BRC coefficient**: ln AGP = 0.28, QE(df = 16) = 2213.5, P < 0.0001.

AGP stands for α-1-acid-glycoprotein; BCF is the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia correction factor; BRC refers to the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia regression correction. The BRINDA acronym stands for Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia, and ICF and IRC are the internal correction factor and internal regression correction, respectively. PNG refers to Papua New Guinea, while sTfR is soluble transferrin receptor.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^116Gsnzf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) was pinpointed by Dagg and colleagues as early as 1966 as a potential indicator of iron deficiency (ID). In the terminal reaction in heme synthesis — catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme ferrochelatase — iron is chelated by protoporphyrin, while the metal-binding site on ferrochelatase may be claimed by iron or zinc. A reduction in iron supply for erythropoiesis to a suboptimal level results in the production of ZPP instead of heme, with zinc, instead of iron, being incorporated into protoporphyrin IX.

Thus, ZPP levels are a direct marker of iron status in the bone marrow during erythropoiesis. ZPP production is entirely unaffected by anemia of chronic disease (ACD) or other chronic inflammation and is therefore an effective indicator of ID even in the presence of inflammation. The onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis triggers continuously increasing ZPP concentrations. Concentrations of 80 μmol/mol heme are associated with manifest iron deficiency. In severe cases, values up to 1000 μmol/mol heme have been reported. Thus, ZPP determination not only detects iron-deficient erythropoiesis but can also quantify it. Theoretically, as zinc deficiency is also not uncommon in inflammatory disorders, ZPP values may be false-negative in zinc-deficient patients.

The choice of laboratory parameter depends on both the clinical question posed and the availability of the respective test. However, the first-line parameter for assessing iron metabolism in routine practice should be chosen based on these considerations.

### UK Kidney Association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114iX4WB]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend considering monitoring hemoglobin concentration every 2–4 weeks during the correction phase or following a dose adjustment, and every 1–3 months for stable patients in the maintenance phase of EPO-stimulating agent treatment. Decide on more frequent monitoring based on clinical circumstances.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leucocyte count. To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

In clinical practice, it must be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent treatment-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), lab tests can be microcytic or even show macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes vary in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia.

### Serum hepcidin in inflammatory bowel diseases: Biological and clinical significance [^115tbARs]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hepcidin, a peptide produced by hepatocytes, regulates body iron homeostasis. Inflammation increases serum hepcidin, and its determination can be useful in the differential diagnosis of anemias during inflammatory diseases.
- **Methods**: We measured serum hepcidin-25 and hepcidin-20 isoforms in 54 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and 54 reference subjects, which included 36 healthy controls and 18 anemic patients without inflammation or renal failure. Disease activity, blood counts, iron status, and erythropoiesis-related parameters were obtained for all study subjects.
- **Results**: In IBD, hepcidin-25, the peptide bioactive isoform, correlated positively with C-reactive protein and serum ferritin. An inverse correlation was observed with transferrin, the soluble transferrin receptor, and the soluble transferrin receptor to Log(ferritin) ratio. Similar correlations were found in reference subjects. Patients with anemia of inflammation had higher hepcidin-25 levels than those with iron deficiency anemia or a combination of iron deficiency anemia and inflammation (P = 0.0061). In patients with inflammation and serum ferritin concentration of 100 to 200 ng/mL, hepcidin-25 was low, suggesting that these patients had iron deficiency. A serum hepcidin-25 concentration below 2.0 nM differentiated 85% of patients with iron deficiency anemia (with or without inflammation) from patients with anemia of inflammation. In IBD, hepcidin-20 correlated with both hepcidin-25 and C-reactive protein.
- **Conclusions**: In IBD, iron stores, inflammation, and iron requirement for erythropoiesis influence hepcidin levels.

### Assessment of iron status in settings of inflammation: challenges and potential approaches [^115WpLWF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The determination of iron status is challenging when concomitant infection and inflammation are present because of confounding effects of the acute-phase response on the interpretation of most iron indicators. This review summarizes the effects of inflammation on indicators of iron status and assesses the impact of a regression analysis to adjust for inflammation on estimates of iron deficiency (ID) in low- and high-infection-burden settings.

We overviewed cross-sectional data from 16 surveys for preschool children (PSC) (n = 29,765) and from 10 surveys for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) (n = 25,731) from the Biomarkers Reflecting the Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project.

- **Effect of inflammation markers**: Effects of C-reactive protein (CRP) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations on estimates of ID according to serum ferritin (SF) (used generically to include plasma ferritin), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron (TBI) were summarized in relation to infection burden (in the United States compared with other countries) and population group (PSC compared with WRA). Effects of the concentrations of CRP and AGP on SF, sTfR, and TBI were generally linear, especially in PSC.
- **Impact of regression correction**: Overall, regression correction changed the estimated prevalence of ID in PSC by a median of +25 percentage points (pps) when SF concentrations were used, by −15 pps when sTfR concentrations were used, and by +14 pps when TBI was used. Meanwhile, the estimated prevalence of ID in WRA changed by a median of +8 pps when SF concentrations were used, and by −10 pps when sTfR concentrations were used.

### Parenteral iron therapy in cancer-associated anemia [^1169x3Bz]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in cancer patients. Its cause is multifactorial, so a brief workup is always necessary to rule out simple, reversible causes. Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation and chemotherapy-induced anemia are the most common causes. Symptomatic or clinically severe anemia may require treatment with blood transfusion or an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). If ESA therapy is chosen, developing evidence now suggests that, similar to chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis, the addition of intravenous iron can improve the response to ESA because of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, even in the iron-replete patient.

### Methodologic approach for the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project [^111fL43N]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The second major contribution of the BRINDA project is the characterization of potential factors associated with inflammation and risk factors for anemia to better understand the drivers of these widespread phenomena. Inflammation is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in disease and nutritional deficiencies, but little is known about the prevalence and demographic differences of inflammation in low- and middle-income countries, to our knowledge. In contrast, anemia has long been recognized as a problem, with recent global estimates in children (43%) and women (33%) revealing little to no reduction in anemia between 1995 and 2011. Poorly designed and implemented interventions have largely contributed to this lack of progress, and an additional failure has been a poor understanding of anemia risk factors. Recently, a cause-specific attribution to anemia has been modeled with the use of estimation techniques that required a high degree of extrapolation. Although this is an important step forward, it underscores the need to assess risk factors directly. The body of work in the supplement highlights the importance of using real data to assess risk factors for anemia and provides a conceptual framework for dealing with such analyses.

There are several strengths of the BRINDA project, including its multipartner and collaborative nature, comparability of laboratory methods, and the large sample size from diverse countries. There are also important caveats about the data available. Data were aggregated from household-based surveys. The surveys were collected from various sources and may have limitations.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112sp2gt]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Include mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet count in addition to the hemoglobin concentration.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: This is to assess bone marrow responsiveness if indicated.
- **Assessment of iron status**: This can include the percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (RBCs), but only if processing of the blood sample is possible within 6 hours; reticulocyte hemoglobin count or equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent; or a combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin if the previous tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait.
- **Serum ferritin**: Used to assess iron stores.
- **Serum C-reactive protein (CRP)**: This assesses possible inflammation.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^113ed3k8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances related to iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of iron deficiency anemia. It is crucial to determine whether it results from inadequate intake or absorption, or from the loss of iron, typically due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, treating active inflammation is advised to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion (Best Practice Advice).

### Soluble transferrin receptor-ferritin index in the evaluation of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease: A case-control study [^1111Howb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

- **Summary box**:

- **What is already known**: No reliable biochemical markers exist for the differentiation between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is evidence that soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is not influenced by chronic or acute inflammation. Literature data suggest that the soluble transferrin receptor-ferritin (sTfR-F) index has a high diagnostic power in the diagnosis of IDA.
- **What the new findings are**: A high sTfR-F index has a better discriminating power than high sTfR levels in the diagnosis of IDA. The sTfR-F index is a very efficient marker for the detection and diagnosis of IDA among patients with IBD. The sTfR-F index could be proposed as an addition to the established markers for the diagnosis of IDA in patients with IBD.
