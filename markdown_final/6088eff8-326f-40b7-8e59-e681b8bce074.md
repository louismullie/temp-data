## Question

How is BPH diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the initial evaluation with symptom quantification and bother. Then, I should verify the role and scope of physical examination, especially digital rectal examination. Next, I will review basic laboratory tests and their indications, followed by functional assessments like uroflowmetry, post-void residual, and bladder diary. After that, I need to consider when imaging is necessary and which modalities fit which decisions. Then, I will examine the role of urodynamics in selective cases. I must also integrate the differential diagnosis, ensuring prostate cancer and prostatitis are appropriately excluded. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm that aligns with EAU 2025 and AUA 2024 guidance, confirming nuances and caveats along the way [^114MiWjR] [^11324X6e] [^116zaVUu].

> Let me first confirm the clinical starting point: BPH is a histological process, but clinical BPH is defined by progressive lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with impact on quality of life; therefore, I should quantify symptoms using a validated instrument such as IPSS/AUA-SI and explicitly assess bother and quality of life from the outset and at follow-up [^114MiWjR]. I should double-check symptom domains so I don't miss storage, voiding, and post-micturition features; obstructive/voiding (hesitancy, weak stream, straining), irritative/storage (frequency, urgency, nocturia), and post-micturition (dribbling, incomplete emptying) should all be captured to avoid anchoring bias [^117AzJAp]. Wait, I need to verify the threshold that predicts subsequent care-seeking; an IPSS greater than 7 has been shown to predict general practitioner visits, which helps contextualize severity and the likelihood of medical consultation [^117KGYgz] [^113uqsup].

> Now, regarding the physical examination, I will include a focused exam with a digital rectal examination (DRE) to estimate size, assess contour/consistency, and screen for nodules suggesting malignancy or neurological issues that affect sphincter tone [^112NxLdm]. Initially, I was going to call DRE "mandatory" per current EAU, but wait, I should double-check the wording; EAU 2025 frames DRE within the recommended physical examination rather than designating it as a universal mandatory test, whereas older EAU guidance did label DRE as mandatory, so I should state it as a recommended part of the initial assessment while acknowledging historical language [^112NxLdm] [^116WaV8z]. I also need to remember that DRE is unreliable for precise volume estimation, so if exact sizing will change management, I'll need imaging for accuracy [^115Cvwsb].

> Next, I should review baseline labs and clarify when each is truly indicated to avoid over-testing. Urinalysis (dipstick or microscopy) is essential to exclude infection, hematuria, and glycosuria that might reframe the differential, so I won't skip it [^1133Q5tt]. PSA should be measured only if it will influence treatment choices or if detecting prostate cancer would alter management; I also need to counsel patients about the implications of a raised PSA to avoid misunderstandings and downstream harm, so let me ensure I document that discussion [^115A5reb] [^114iWikc] [^116vSFvD]. I should confirm renal status when clinically relevant; serum creatinine is commonly obtained in practice and is reasonable where obstructive uropathy or chronic kidney disease is suspected, which aligns with real-world patterns of care, though its routine use can be individualized [^11483UXo].

> I will now examine functional urinary assessments, since they refine the picture of obstruction and bladder behavior. Uroflowmetry at baseline helps characterize the flow rate and pattern, and I should repeat it before medical or invasive treatment decisions to track changes objectively; let me ensure I also document voided volume to interpret results properly [^11324X6e] [^111dNShi] [^111CDoum]. Post-void residual (PVR) measurement is part of the standard assessment and should be obtained before interventions, as a large residual can change the therapeutic path or urgency of referral; I should verify consistent measurement technique to avoid variability [^116zaVUu] [^116h18Qo]. For patients with storage-predominant symptoms, especially nocturia, a 3-day bladder diary is recommended; hold on, I should make sure it includes fluid intake and timing to distinguish nocturnal polyuria from reduced functional capacity [^111pZJjU] [^112ESfAh].

> Let me consider imaging next and be precise about when it is warranted. If surgical treatment is being considered, prostate imaging should be obtained to guide approach selection, anatomy, and volume; likewise, imaging can assist medical decision-making when drug selection depends on gland size or a median lobe, so I should plan accordingly [^112EVVum] [^1146zrZS]. Transrectal ultrasound is the most accurate routine tool for prostate volume estimation and is superior to DRE when precise sizing impacts management; AUA also provides pragmatic size categories that I should use for planning (small < 30 g, medium 30–80 g, large 80–150 g, very large > 150 g) [^115Cvwsb] [^115XF8zA]. I should not forget upper tract ultrasound in men with LUTS when clinically indicated to assess for hydronephrosis or other complications that might reclassify urgency, particularly in the context of high PVR or recurrent infections [^114yZS4S]. Before interventions, if available, I can also assess size and shape via transrectal or abdominal ultrasound, cystoscopy, or cross-sectional imaging to refine procedural planning, but I need to avoid unnecessary imaging if it won't change management [^11739kap].

> But wait, what about MRI and cancer evaluation? MRI is primarily a tool for prostate cancer risk assessment and local staging rather than routine BPH diagnosis; I should confirm that I'm not over-ordering it for uncomplicated LUTS, reserving it for cases where cancer suspicion is present or biopsy planning is needed [^1132KNzx]. I should also remember that PSMA-PET can yield false positives in BPH tissue, so using it to shortcut biopsy carries risk; this reinforces that cancer must be ruled in or out using appropriate pathways before attributing symptoms solely to BPH [^115PNafZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of urodynamics to avoid unnecessary invasive testing. Urodynamic studies are not routine, but I should use them when there is diagnostic uncertainty and an invasive treatment is being considered, or when the patient cannot void more than 150 mL; noninvasive surrogates should not replace pressure-flow studies for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction when the diagnosis remains unclear [^116HUV5e] [^1161gGwa]. The AUA likewise recommends pressure-flow studies before intervention if uncertainty persists, so I need to document what uncertainty remains and how urodynamics will change the plan [^115PEhXb].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis carefully so I don't anchor prematurely on BPH. Prostate cancer must be considered and, when appropriate, excluded with PSA, DRE, and possibly MRI before invasive BPH treatment; adjunctive biomarkers like PCA3 can add context in selected settings, but they do not replace standard risk stratification pathways, so I need to confirm how each result will inform action [^115PNafZ] [^116e6m3A]. Prostatitis often overlaps with BPH symptoms, but the presence of pelvic/perineal pain and tenderness supports prostatitis; given that co-occurrence is not rare, I should consider dual pathology and tailor therapy accordingly rather than choosing a single-label diagnosis too early [^11394Myz].

> I should now synthesize the findings into a coherent working diagnosis. Clinical BPH is supported by bothersome LUTS on a validated symptom score, an enlarged prostate on exam or imaging when available, functional evidence such as reduced Qmax and elevated PVR consistent with obstruction, and exclusion of other pathologies that could explain the presentation; I need to remember that many older men have histologic BPH without bothersome symptoms, so symptoms and impact drive the need to treat rather than histology alone [^111Tca3G] [^113uqsup] [^117AzJAp].

> Finally, to ensure nothing is missed, I will articulate the practical diagnostic pathway I'll follow and double-check for alignment with guidelines. I will begin with IPSS/AUA-SI including bother/QoL and a targeted history and physical with DRE, obtain urinalysis and PSA if it will influence management or cancer evaluation after counseling, and check renal function when indicated; I will add uroflowmetry and PVR early and repeat before interventions, use a 3-day bladder diary for storage-predominant symptoms, and proceed to prostate imaging when treatment planning (medical or surgical) requires precise size/shape information or when surgery is contemplated; I will reserve urodynamics for diagnostic uncertainty before invasive therapy or low voided volumes, and I will explicitly exclude cancer and consider prostatitis and other etiologies before labeling the syndrome as BPH-driven LUTS, maintaining clear documentation of decision points throughout [^114MiWjR] [^112NxLdm] [^1133Q5tt] [^115A5reb] [^114iWikc] [^11324X6e] [^116zaVUu] [^111pZJjU] [^112EVVum] [^1146zrZS] [^11739kap] [^115PEhXb] [^11394Myz] [^115PNafZ].

---

Diagnose BPH by confirming **LUTS with IPSS** [^114MiWjR] and **DRE for prostate size/consistency** [^112NxLdm]. Obtain **urinalysis** [^1133Q5tt] to exclude infection, measure **post-void residual** [^116zaVUu], and perform **uroflowmetry** [^11324X6e] [^111CDoum] to assess obstruction. Use **PSA** [^115A5reb] selectively when results will change management [^114iWikc], and consider imaging (ultrasound or MRI) [^1146zrZS] if planning intervention [^112EVVum] or if cancer is suspected. Differentiate BPH from prostate cancer [^1132KNzx], prostatitis [^111H3wT4], and urethral stricture with clinical assessment, PSA, and imaging as needed [^11739kap].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptom assessment

BPH typically presents with **LUTS**, including:

- **Obstructive symptoms**: Hesitancy [^117AzJAp], weak stream, straining, prolonged voiding, incomplete emptying, postvoid dribble, split stream [^116phYin].

- **Irritative symptoms**: Frequency [^117AzJAp], urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence [^116phYin], reduced voiding volumes.

- **Post-micturition symptoms**: Sensation of incomplete emptying [^117AzJAp], postvoid dribble.

The International Prostate Symptom Score (**IPSS**) is a validated EAU-recommended [^114MiWjR] tool for initial assessment and follow-up that quantifies symptom severity and quality-of-life impact [^112ahbSk].

---

## Physical examination

A digital rectal examination (**DRE**) is mandatory [^112NxLdm] to assess prostate size and consistency and to exclude malignancy [^116WaV8z]. Findings consistent with BPH include a smooth, enlarged, firm prostate.

---

## Laboratory tests

Obtain **urinalysis** [^1133Q5tt] to exclude urinary tract infection or hematuria. Measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) selectively [^115A5reb] when results will influence management or if cancer is suspected [^114iWikc]. Patients should be counseled [^116vSFvD] on PSA implications.

---

## Imaging studies

Transrectal or abdominal **ultrasound** [^1146zrZS] is recommended to assess prostate size and shape, especially before interventions [^11739kap]. Consider **MRI** [^11739kap] when prostate cancer is suspected [^1132KNzx] or to delineate prostate anatomy in detail.

---

## Urodynamic studies

- **Uroflowmetry**: Recommended to assess urinary flow rate and obstruction severity [^111dNShi] [^11324X6e].

- **Post-void residual (PVR)**: Measure to evaluate incomplete bladder emptying [^116h18Qo] [^116zaVUu].

- **Pressure-flow studies**: Consider when diagnostic uncertainty exists or before invasive treatment [^115PEhXb].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to differentiate BPH from other causes of **LUTS**:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|
| Prostate cancer | - Elevated PSA <br/> - Abnormal DRE <br/> - Suspicious MRI [^1132KNzx] | - PSA <br/> - MRI <br/> - Biopsy |
| Prostatitis | - Pain [^11394Myz] <br/> - Fever <br/> - Dysuria <br/> - Elevated PSA | - Clinical assessment <br/> - PSA <br/> - MRI [^1132KNzx] |
| Urethral stricture | - Weak stream <br/> - Straining <br/> - History of trauma or infection | - Uroflowmetry [^11164Vm2] <br/> - Cystoscopy [^11739kap] |

---

## Risk factors and progression

Risk factors for BPH [^1127wzht] include advancing age, family history, obesity [^114Ss9Y6], diabetes mellitus [^112oh3wZ], and cardiovascular disease. BPH is a progressive condition [^113F8Bod] that may lead to acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and renal insufficiency if untreated [^112ZMJ5o].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

- **Clinical assessment**: IPSS [^114MiWjR], DRE [^112NxLdm], urinalysis [^1133Q5tt], selective PSA.

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRI if indicated [^11739kap].

- **Urodynamics**: Uroflowmetry, PVR, pressure-flow studies if needed [^11324X6e].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude prostate cancer, prostatitis, urethral stricture [^1132KNzx].

---

Diagnosing BPH requires a **structured approach** integrating symptom assessment, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging, and urodynamic studies, while excluding other causes of LUTS [^11739kap].

### Differential diagnosis of uncommon prostate diseases: Combining mpMRI and clinical information [^1132KNzx]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Common prostatic diseases other than typical benign lesions, such as acinar adenocarcinoma, BPH, and prostatitis, are usually inert or chronic. They involve varying degrees of elevated serum PSA levels or disturbing symptoms, such as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which interfere with the quality of life as long-term issues for males, particularly elderly males. This is because BPH and prostate cancer are age-related conditions. PSAs are proteinases produced mainly in the epithelial cells of the prostate. When various factors cause the destruction of the epithelial cells or the blood-epithelial barrier, there is a substantial increase in PSA secretion from tumor cells, or an increase in the entry of PSAs into the blood, leading to elevated serum PSA levels.

PCa is one of the most common groups of malignancies occurring in the male population after lung cancer, with acinar adenocarcinoma being the most common malignancy observed. On MRI, csPCa presents with homogeneous and moderate hypointensity on T2WI, hyperintensity on high b-value DWI, a low ADC, and early enhancement. These characteristics manifest without capsules, and csPCa easily forms extraprostatic extensions (EPEs), resulting in a PI-RADS 4–5 classification.

BPH is the fifth most prevalent non-cancer-related disorder among 50-year-old or elderly men. By the age of 60, the prevalence of BPH is 50%, increasing to 80% by the age of 80. BPH tissue produces PSA and primarily arises in the TZ. BPH consists of glandular hyperplasia and stromal hyperplasia. Predominantly glandular BPH nodules exhibit moderate hyperintensity.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114ffU2t]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia are the most common urological problem among men, affecting about a third of men over age 50. Surgical intervention is the most effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, with around 100,000 procedures carried out annually in the United States. Of all surgical treatments, monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), in which the enlarged prostate tissue is resected piece by piece using a monopolar electrode, has been the preferred method since the 1970s. It can substantially improve the maximal flow rate (Qmax), urinary symptoms (based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)), and health-related quality of life, with long-term efficacy compared with drugs or other minimally invasive treatments. However, monopolar TURP is a risky procedure because of the likelihood of severe complications such as massive bleeding or transurethral resection syndrome. Therefore, minimally invasive surgical techniques need to be developed with outcomes similar to those of monopolar TURP, but with fewer side effects.

Since the 2000s, new energy systems for surgical interventions treating benign prostatic hyperplasia have quickly become popular, including systems that use bipolar energy and various laser systems such as the holmium laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, thulium laser, and diode laser. The trend in surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia has shifted from monopolar TURP to laser treatments and bipolar TURP over the past 10 years. Bipolar energy can be

### Patterns of care for newly diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia in the United States [^11483UXo]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

We examined diagnostic tests and treatment patterns in men with new onset benign prostatic hyperplasia using consolidated national electronic health record data.

- **Materials and methods**: The Humedica® electronic health record database consists of de-identified patient records from approximately 25 million patients in the United States. Using this database, men with a new benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis (benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder neck obstruction, urinary retention, and incomplete bladder emptying) between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2012, were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included conditions such as genitourinary cancers, radiation cystitis, neurogenic bladder, and urological pain diagnoses. Diagnostic tests and treatments were summarized and stratified by age (less than 65 vs. 65 years or greater) and serum prostate-specific antigen level.

- **Results**: A total of 38,252 men met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up was 1,020 days. Serum creatinine in 92% of patients, serum prostate-specific antigen in 76%, and urinalysis in 52% were the most common tests. Invasive testing was obtained in less than 20% of patients. Treatments included watchful waiting in 40% of patients, pharmacological therapy in 59.4%, and surgery in 2.2%. α-Blockers were prescribed in 50.7% of men. Men older than 65 years and with higher prostate-specific antigen levels were less likely to be treated with watchful waiting. Therapy with a 5-ARI (5-α reductase inhibitor) was prescribed in 23% to 29% of men across all prostate-specific antigen categories.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of c

### Symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia: Impact on partners' quality of life [^116txDhX]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), in addition to affecting patients' quality of life through lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and related acute events, may also impact their partners' quality of life. This study aimed to explore partner morbidity in cases of symptomatic BPH patients being evaluated for surgical treatment.

The study group consisted of 50 couples where the male partners suffered from symptomatic BPH and were referred for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. Male subjects completed the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) form, while the female partners independently completed another structured questionnaire with seven items: sleep disturbance, social disruption, performance of essential tasks, psychological impact, sex life, fear of cancer, and fear of surgery. Data were analyzed in relation to the severity of symptoms (IPSS), the patient's and partner's age, the couple's age difference, marriage duration, and mode and place of living.

The results indicated that partners' morbidity due to their husband's condition included sleep disturbance (28%), disruption of social life (30%), which was positively related to IPSS and negatively to the duration of symptoms, inability to manage essential tasks outside and inside their home (8%), psychological burden (66%), which was positively related to the wife's age, the couple's age difference, and the marriage duration, inadequate sex life (48%), fear of prostate cancer (62%), and fear of surgery (82%).

In conclusion, partners of patients with symptomatic BPH experience significant morbidity due to their partner's condition.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^112Wshgr]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

The disability weight is an important metric representing the severity of health loss associated with a specific health state, described in lay language. It ranges from 0, representing perfect health, to 1, representing death. For the purpose of this study, disability weights for generic health states were estimated using nine large population-based surveys and one open-access internet survey. These surveys asked participants to compare pairwise combinations of health states.

- **Disability weight and symptomatic states**: Two health states were assigned to benign prostatic hyperplasia: asymptomatic and symptomatic. The symptomatic health state has a disability weight of 0.067 (95% CI 0.043–0.097), while the asymptomatic state has a disability weight of zero, assuming no 95% CIs.

To determine the proportion of benign prostatic hyperplasia prevalence to assign to the symptomatic health state, data were gathered from four community-based surveys in Japan, the United States, Scotland, and France. These surveys recruited men aged 40–84 years and used the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), a validated questionnaire, to measure the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms among men. The cumulative distribution of the I-PSS scores in survey participants was modeled using MR-BRT to estimate the mean proportion of individuals with symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms. The symptomatic and asymptomatic proportions were then applied to the prevalence estimates from DisMod-MR to produce estimates of the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Obesity and benign prostatic hyperplasia: Clinical connections, emerging etiological paradigms and future directions [^114Ss9Y6]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a highly prevalent disease in older men, with substantial adverse effects on public health. Classic etiological paradigms for benign prostatic hyperplasia focus on nonmodifiable risk factors; however, obesity also potentially promotes benign prostatic hyperplasia.

We performed a structured, comprehensive literature review to identify studies on obesity, benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, and physical activity.

A preponderance of published evidence suggests strong positive associations of obesity with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. This evidence encompasses most established metrics of adiposity, including body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, and falls under three general categories: prostate volume, clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia, and lower urinary tract symptoms.

- **Prostate volume**: Prior studies consistently showed that increased adiposity is positively associated with radiographically determined prostate volume and enlargement, suggesting that obesity promotes prostate growth.

- **Clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia**: Most studies revealed that obesity increases the risk of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia by several measures, including the initiation of benign prostatic hyperplasia medical treatment, noncancer prostate surgery, physician-diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia, histological diagnosis, and urinary flow rate.

- **Lower urinary tract symptoms**: Prior studies demonstrated that obesity increases the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms, as measured by a validated questionnaire.

### Enhanced clinical decisions for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia using patient-reported outcomes: Protocol for a prospective observational study [^112qk7MA]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) significantly impact quality of life among older men. Despite the prevalent use of the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) for BPH, this measure overlooks key symptoms such as pain and incontinence, underscoring the need for more comprehensive patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools. This study aims to integrate enhanced PROs into routine clinical practice to better capture the spectrum of LUTS, thereby improving clinical outcomes and patient care.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study will recruit men with LUTS secondary to BPH aged ≥ 50 years from urology clinics. Participants will be stratified into medical and surgical management groups, with PRO assessments scheduled at regular intervals to monitor LUTS and other health outcomes. The study will employ the LURN Symptom Index (SI)-29 alongside the traditional AUA-SI and other non-urologic PROs to evaluate a broad range of symptoms. Data on comorbidities, symptom severity, and treatment efficacy will be collected through a combination of electronic health records and PROs. Analyses will focus on the predictive power of these tools in relation to symptom trajectories and treatment responses.
	- **Aims are to**: (1) integrate routine clinical tests with PRO assessment to enhance screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with BPH; (2) examine psychometric properties of the LURN SIs, including test-retest reliability and establishment of clinically meaningful differences; and (3) create care-coordination recommendations.

Prevalence data processing

The processing of these data sources has been described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, for claims data, we used unique enrollee identification numbers to link inpatient and outpatient claims to a single individual. An enrollee was then extracted as a prevalent case if they had at least one inpatient or two outpatient medical encounters with any of the defining ICD codes for benign prostatic hyperplasia in either the primary or secondary diagnostic position.

Processing of inpatient admissions data involved converting benign prostatic hyperplasia admission counts into cause fractions, which are the number of hospital admissions specifically for benign prostatic hyperplasia divided by the total number of admissions in the data year. Then, these cause fractions were multiplied by the hospital admission rate per capita and the total population size for each unique source, age, sex, and year combination to convert data to population-level inpatient admission rates. Details of the data and methods used to estimate hospital admission rates and population sizes have been previously described.

Population-level benign prostatic hyperplasia admission rates were then transformed to population prevalence data by applying a ratio of total benign prostatic hyperplasia cases to inpatient benign prostatic hyperplasia admissions modelled from claims data. We treated claims data and outpatient-adjusted inpatient admission data from Taiwan (province of China) and Poland as reference data, meeting our ICD-based case definition, and representing a general population.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^114MQ45Q]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

With the population rapidly aging in many parts of the world, the burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia is expected to rise. Understanding the burden of and recent trends in benign prostatic hyperplasia, the role of demographic and other factors in driving the change, and the strengths and limitations of existing datasets is necessary to fill data gaps and help health systems prepare for the challenges associated with this rising global burden.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia-related false-positive of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: The Achilles' heel of biopsy-free radical prostatectomy [^115PNafZ]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Radical prostatectomy is one of the primary treatments for localized clinically significant prostate cancer. Generally, its application is based on prior biopsy. PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)-PET (positron emission tomography) is considered promising in biopsy-free radical prostatectomy. The expression of PSMA in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue and the corresponding positive reaction are crucial concerns for a no-biopsy strategy. Currently, no study has explored the benign prostatic hyperplasia-related false-positive of PSMA-PET in the detection of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the influence of maximum standardized uptake value and Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System on biopsy-free radical prostatectomy is also poorly characterized.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on patients who received PSMA-PET because of clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and were confirmed to have benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. The receiver operating characteristic curve was generated for maximum standardized uptake value. Results of interest were the false-positive rate of PSMA-PET and the efficacy of maximum standardized uptake value or multiparametric MRI in excluding false-positives.

- **Results**: The benign prostatic hyperplasia-related false-positive rate of PSMA-PET in detecting prostate cancer was 30%. Maximum standardized uptake value could effectively exclude benign prostatic hyperplasia and Grade Group 1 patients with an area under the curve of 0.86; the optimal maximum standardized uptake value cutoff value with 100% specificity was significant in the study.

### The urologist view of BPH progression: results of an international survey [^113wJvEC]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the opinion amongst the international urological community on whether benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive disease.

A 15-item questionnaire was distributed to the mailing list of the publication European Urology Today, and it was also accessible through the website of the European Association of Urology (EAU). The survey included questions on whether BPH was a progressive disorder, the evidence supporting this, including identifiable clinical parameters, risk factors for progression, and prevention of progression.

A total of 472 completed questionnaires from 47 countries were evaluated. Overall, the surveyed urologists agreed that BPH is a progressive disease, and some patients are more prone to this progression than others. Increased post-void residual urine, reduced flow rate, increased urinary symptoms, and urodynamic evidence of obstruction were considered the most significant risk factors for progression. Half of the surveyed urologists considered that medical therapies could prevent the progression of BPH, while a significant proportion thought that surgery was an effective preventative measure.

Although BPH is a benign disease, it has a considerable impact on the patient's quality of life. Its progressive nature and the identification of risk factors for progression warrant further investigation. In the future, there is likely to be a shift in the paradigm from treatment of BPH complications to include the prevention of BPH progression.

### Enhanced clinical decisions for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia using patient-reported outcomes: Protocol for a prospective observational study [^112Tpica]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) significantly impact the quality of life among older men. Despite the prevalent use of the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) for BPH, this measure overlooks key symptoms such as pain and incontinence, underscoring the need for more comprehensive patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools. This study aims to integrate enhanced PROs into routine clinical practice to better capture the spectrum of LUTS, thereby improving clinical outcomes and patient care.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study will recruit men with LUTS secondary to BPH aged ≥ 50 years from urology clinics. Participants will be stratified into medical and surgical management groups, with PRO assessments scheduled at regular intervals to monitor LUTS and other health outcomes. The study will employ the LURN Symptom Index (SI)-29 alongside the traditional AUA-SI and other non-urologic PROs to evaluate a broad range of symptoms. Data on comorbidities, symptom severity, and treatment efficacy will be collected through a combination of electronic health records and PROs. Analyses will focus on the predictive power of these tools in relation to symptom trajectories and treatment responses. The aims are to: (1) integrate routine clinical tests with PRO assessment to enhance screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with BPH; (2) examine psychometric properties of the LURN SIs, including test-retest reliability and the establishment of clinically meaningful differences; and (3) create care-coordination recommendations.

### Managing patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115cwx6k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed safely and effectively by primary care providers. After a basic evaluation to exclude other diseases that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, quantifying the degree of symptoms and bother, and perhaps making an assessment of prostate size, the primary care provider can determine which men require immediate evaluation by a urologist and which men may choose among various treatment options, including watchful waiting and various single-agent or combination medication strategies. Recent information about risk factors for disease progression has also helped to inform patient decisions on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The purpose of this review is to provide primary care providers with an approach to the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care: What you need to know [^111Tca3G]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed recent literature and treatment guidelines regarding the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH.

Published literature and treatment concepts were examined with respect to the diagnosis and treatment options for BPO.

BPH is a histological diagnosis that can contribute to medical problems, including enlargement of the prostate and BPO. These conditions should be treated only if the symptoms are troublesome, there is considerable risk of progression, or cancer is suspected. Very effective medical and surgical options are available to treat BPO and improve the patient's quality of life.

BPO is highly treatable but should be managed in close collaboration with the patient. Pharmacological agents and minimally invasive procedures are generally preferred to more invasive surgery when appropriate. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms usually can be treated by a primary care physician, while more complicated cases should be referred to a urologist for evaluation and management.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117AzJAp]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a common diagnosis among the ageing male population with increasing prevalence. Many risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, can elevate the risk of development and progression of BPH and LUTS. Symptoms can be:

- **Obstructive**: Resulting in urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining, or prolonged voiding.
- **Irritative**: Leading to increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and reduced voiding volumes.
- **Post-micturition**: For example, postvoid dribble or incomplete emptying.

BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^112ZMJ5o]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia, with respect to indications for surgery, the AUA 2024 guidelines recommend performing surgery in patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Renal insufficiency secondary to BPH**: Surgery is indicated for patients experiencing decreased kidney function due to BPH.

- **Refractory urinary retention secondary to BPH**: When urinary retention does not respond to other treatments, surgery is advised.

- **Recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs)**: Surgery may be necessary for patients with persistent infections related to BPH.

- **Bladder stones or gross hematuria due to BPH**: The presence of stones or visible blood in the urine that is related to BPH symptoms warrants surgical intervention.

- **Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary or attributed to BPH refractory to or unwilling to use other therapies**: Patients whose symptoms do not improve with non-surgical treatments, or those unwilling to pursue such therapies, are candidates for surgery.

### Simple case definition of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia, based on international prostate symptom score, predicts general practitioner consultation rates [^117KGYgz]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To determine which case-definition of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has the best predictive value for general practitioner visits for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of BPH. The incidence and prevalence rates of general practitioner visits for LUTS were also determined.

- **Methods**: A longitudinal, population-based study from 1995 to 2003 was conducted among 1,688 men aged 50 to 78 years old. Data were collected on physical urologic parameters, quality of life, and symptom severity as determined from the International Prostate Symptom Score. Information on health-care-seeking behavior of all participants was collected from the general practitioner (GP) record using a computerized search engine and an additional manual check of the electronically selected files.

- **Results**: The incidence and prevalence rate of the men at risk was 19.6% and 14.0%, respectively, and these rates increased with age. For sensitivity and the positive predictive value, the case-definition of clinical BPH as an International Prostate Symptom Score greater than 7 had the best predictive value for GP visits for LUTS within 2 years after baseline.

- **Conclusions**: Because only marginal improvement (greater specificity but lower sensitivity) in the prediction of GP visits for LUTS was possible by adding information on prostate volume and flow, for the prediction of future GP visits for LUTS suggestive of BPH, we suggest that the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire be used and that estimation of the prostate volume and flow is not required.

### Modern evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in 2014 [^11164Vm2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate and present the evidence for the use of different investigation modalities in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in 2014.

- **Recent findings**: Cystometry remains the gold standard in differentiating obstructed from nonobstructed men with LUTS. Prostatic ultrasound measures, such as intravesical prostatic protrusion, may be useful in counseling men before a trial without a catheter or commencing α-antagonists. Using a higher cut-off, bladder thickness/weight measurement has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity and may allow men with obstruction to be excluded from requiring cystometry. These and other techniques, such as near-infrared spectroscopy, penile cuff compression, and computational flow modeling, have shown good correlation with cystometry but still require more data, technical refinement, and standardization before they can be considered appropriate for routine clinical practice.

- **Summary**: The last few years have seen an increase in data regarding less invasive methods of cystometry. Although these methods do not provide the same information as cystometry, they may have a role in answering specific questions and counseling men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/LUTS. The key to incorporating these techniques into the assessment of men will lie with standardization and use for specific indications.

### Benign prostate hyperplasia: A review of the year's progress from bench to clinic [^111Muqx8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Therapeutic tools for classic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have focused on the dynamic component of obstruction and/or elimination of the static component via surgical or pharmaceutical therapies. Unfortunately, an exact cause for this disease process has not been identified, but additional insight has been achieved. This article presents an update of the BPH literature with a special focus on basic science or translational studies concerned with the cause of clinically significant BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Recent studies have been exploring connections between BPH with clinically significant LUTS, the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, alterations in cell signaling, and genetics, which in turn have provided additional information concerning the pathogenesis, medical therapies, and surgical therapies.

BPH is a chronic, progressive disease with important care implications and financial risks to the healthcare system. Continued improvements in length of life will demand that we unlock the cause of LUTS secondary to BPH with the goal of prevention as the ideal therapy. Studies reported in the last year contributed to our understanding of the disease process and provide insight for additional studies.

### Differential diagnosis of uncommon prostate diseases: Combining mpMRI and clinical information [^111H3wT4]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of abnormalities in the prostate is broad, encompassing both common conditions — such as acinar adenocarcinoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, hemorrhage, cysts, calcifications, atrophy, and fibrosis — and less common conditions, including tumors other than acinar adenocarcinoma, granulomatous prostatitis with tuberculosis, abscesses, other conditions, and idiopathic disorders like amyloidosis and exophytic benign prostatic hyperplasia. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate gland and imaging guidelines, such as the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1), have dramatically enhanced the ability to distinguish common abnormalities, particularly the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).

An overlap can exist in the clinical history and imaging features associated with various common and uncommon prostate abnormalities, and biopsy, though often required, is invasive. Prostate abnormalities can be divided into two categories:

- **Category 1**: Diseases for which PI-RADS scores are suitable for use.
- **Category 2**: Diseases for which PI-RADS scores are unsuitable for use.

Radiologists must possess an intimate knowledge of other diseases, especially uncommon conditions. Past relevant history, symptoms, age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, MRI manifestations, and the applicability of the PI-RADS assessment should all be considered when diagnosing prostate abnormalities.

### Recent developments in guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114hWYUz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines within the healthcare system aim to rationalize the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of a particular disease. These guidelines can be applicable on an international scale or may be country-specific. Specialists, who determine clinical evidence for individual practices, prepare these guidelines, and the strength of these recommendations depends on available evidence. The assessment of patients includes a minimal number of non-invasive tests, with additional (more invasive) tests recommended only in cases of abnormalities.

Treatment decisions should be evidence-based. However, despite guidelines, the choice of treatment is often highly dependent on the personal preference of the urologist. Patients' awareness of different treatment options and their involvement in choosing a treatment is also increasing. Economical aspects are becoming more important in making healthcare decisions. Currently, data on the durability of treatments are limited and deserve special attention to provide the most cost-effective care for different patient groups.

### Race and socioeconomic status are independently associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113ujhkt]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate enlargement is common as men age. However, differences in the diagnosis or treatment of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia between black and white men remain poorly understood. We investigated racial differences in and surgical intervention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in a large and predominantly low-income population.

Participants included 21,949 men, of whom 79.8% were black and 20.2% were white, recruited from 60 community health centers in the southeastern United States between 2002 and 2007. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, surgical intervention for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and economic and demographic indexes, such as education, household income, health insurance, and marital status, were determined by an interview in person. Logistic regression was used to summarize the association between race and benign prostatic hyperplasia while controlling for health care access and socioeconomic status.

Black men were approximately half as likely to report a benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis compared to white men (4.1% vs. 9.9%, age-adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40, 0.51), a difference that persisted with only small abatement after controlling for age, income, insurance coverage, comorbidity, education, and other factors (adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.43, 0.56). Of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, surgical intervention for that condition (133 patients) was more prevalent in black vs. white men (12.9% vs. 9.1%, adjusted OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.10, 2.48).

After controlling for economic factors associated with benign…

### Obesity and benign prostatic hyperplasia: Clinical connections, emerging etiological paradigms, and future directions [^115mfP28]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a highly prevalent disease in older men with substantial adverse effects on public health. Classic etiological paradigms for benign prostatic hyperplasia focus on nonmodifiable risk factors; however, obesity also potentially promotes benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a structured, comprehensive literature review to identify studies of obesity, benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, and physical activity.

- **Results**: A preponderance of published evidence suggests strong positive associations of obesity with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. This evidence encompasses most established metrics of adiposity, including body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, and falls under three general categories: prostate volume, clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia, and lower urinary tract symptoms.
	1. Prior studies consistently showed that increased adiposity is positively associated with radiographically determined prostate volume and enlargement, suggesting that obesity promotes prostate growth.

	2. Most studies revealed that obesity increases the risk of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia by several measures, including the initiation of benign prostatic hyperplasia medical treatment, noncancer prostate surgery, physician-diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia, histological diagnosis, and urinary flow rate.

	3. Prior studies demonstrated that obesity increases the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms, as measured by a validated questionnaire.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^113vVm66]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia has been identified as a major urological health problem in older men in many countries. The prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia from descriptive epidemiology studies ranges from 12% to 42%, and one study estimated the lifetime risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia to be 29%. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Lee and colleagues in 2017 identified 30 population-based, hospital-based, and community-based epidemiological studies in different countries and yielded a 26% point prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in older men for the years 1990–2016. Another meta-analysis done in China indicated that the pooled overall prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia among men aged 40 years or older was 36.6% during 1989–2014.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the largest and most comprehensive scientific effort to produce estimates of health loss due to 369 diseases and injuries. GBD overcomes some of the limitations of the epidemiological studies described above by utilizing a large number of administrative datasets from around the world, processing them in a comparable fashion, and using regional patterns and predictive covariates to provide the most precise annual estimates of disease burden possible for a large number of countries and territories, including those without primary data, over a long time series. The burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia has been estimated and included in comprehensive reports since GBD 2010, and Launer and colleagues previously reported the global estimates.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^1167oQhH]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

We present a comprehensive assessment of the temporal and geographical patterns of the benign prostatic hyperplasia burden from GBD 2019. Our findings are consistent with previous reports, showing that the absolute disease burden is rising in many parts of the world. The global number of prevalent cases almost doubled in the past 20 years. Despite the increase in the absolute benign prostatic hyperplasia burden, the global age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates remained largely unchanged during the study period. This suggests that population growth and aging have a greater impact on driving the increased prevalence of, and DALYs associated with, benign prostatic hyperplasia at the global level than other risk factors do.

Our study shows that the peak absolute benign prostatic hyperplasia burden occurred in men aged 65–69 years, and the age-specific prevalence was highest in men aged 75–79 years. This trend contrasts with the age trend found in autopsy studies, where the histological prevalence continues to rise with advancing age. However, it was similar to the age trend found in community-based studies, where the diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia was made based on lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement in clinical practice. Geographically, the age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates were lowest in countries in North Africa and the Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa, and highest in countries in Eastern Europe. This geographical variation could be attributable to the varying stages at which regions are in terms of population aging and healthcare access.

### Prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease [^113gUSZM]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed the evidence that benign prostatic hyperplasia is a progressive condition. Men at risk for benign prostatic hyperplasia disease can be identified, treated, and protected to a meaningful extent, regardless of symptom status.

- **Materials and methods**: The MEDLINE database was searched in four areas of interest relating to benign prostatic hyperplasia, including: 1) progression of clinical manifestations with age, especially in regard to baseline symptom status; 2) the incidence of complications due to disease progression; 3) the use of predictive factors that may help identify men at risk for disease progression; and 4) the prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease with medical therapy.

- **Results**: Tissue changes in the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) are inevitable consequences of aging. However, benign prostatic hyperplasia disease, defined as a life-altering urinary condition requiring medical intervention, is predictable and preventable. Benign prostatic hyperplasia disease progression is associated with increasing prostate volume, decreasing urinary flow, and symptomatic deterioration, often leading to major lifestyle interference and serious complications, such as acute urinary retention and the need for surgery. The risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease progression is directly related to prostate volume and its surrogate marker, serum prostate specific antigen, after prostate cancer is excluded. Other factors, such as baseline symptoms and the flow rate, were found to be less relevant compared to prostate specific antigen.

### A comprehensive approach toward novel serum biomarkers for benign prostatic hyperplasia: the MPSA Consortium [^113uqsup]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia is primarily diagnosed based on a diverse array of progressive lower urinary tract symptoms. It is likely distinct from histological benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is detected by the presence of nonmalignant proliferation of prostate cells but may or may not be associated with symptoms. Pharmacological management of lower urinary tract symptoms has emerged as an effective initial treatment for clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia due to the introduction of new drug therapies shown to be effective in recent large clinical trials. Despite advances in symptom management and research into disease pathology, diagnostic strategies for predicting benign prostatic hyperplasia progression and response to drug modalities are lacking. Questions remain regarding the molecular differences underlying clinical (symptomatic) versus histological (nonsymptomatic) benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Materials and methods**: As part of the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) clinical trial, which demonstrated the effectiveness of combination drug therapy in slowing benign prostatic hyperplasia progression, an archive of biological specimens linked to clinical data was collected for future profiling of disease pathology and changes associated with response to drug therapy. The MTOPS Prostatic Samples Analysis (MPSA) Consortium was established to identify and validate molecular markers that may better define benign prostatic hyperplasia-related pathologies, identify risk of progression of lower urinary tract symptoms, and predict response to treatment.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^111wY98Q]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Data used for estimating the symptomatic proportion of benign prostatic hyperplasia prevalence and for estimating disability weights were more limited than prevalence data. Disability weights associated with health state descriptions used in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study are derived from a series of face-to-face, telephone, and internet surveys conducted over several years in nine countries, and reported in a series of publications. If these nine countries are poorly representative of the values surrounding health in other countries, this could misrepresent the disability globally.

Estimation of the proportion of doctor-diagnosed symptomatic versus asymptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia cases rests on an even smaller database. We made use of four community-based surveys of International Prostate Symptom Scores (I-PSS) to calculate the pooled proportion of symptomatic cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This approach makes two important assumptions: that the distribution of I-PSS scores in community-based samples is similar to the distribution of I-PSS scores among cases ascertained from administrative data, and that the distribution of I-PSS scores from these four surveys conducted in Japan, the United States, Scotland, and France is reflective of the global distribution.

Furthermore, we acknowledge a pair of analytical limitations. Because of the GBD principle of assigning every death in our estimation framework to a single underlying cause of death, we elected to assign deaths related to benign prostatic hyperplasia to other diseases in the cascade of events that lead to death. Consequently, mortality related to benign prostatic hyperplasia was attributed accordingly.

### Global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia from 1990 to 2021 and projection to 2035 [^11297ThZ]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Our study found that the highest incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) occurs in the age range of 60 to 79, while the age over 80 is the stage with the highest prevalence of BPH projected for 2035. This finding underscores a crucial period, specifically the age range of 60 to 79, when BPH is most likely to develop due to various biological and hormonal changes that men experience as they age. By 2035, the demographic shift towards an older population could lead to a significant increase in the number of BPH cases among individuals aged 80 and older, creating a heavy disease burden.

It is important to note that the progression of BPH is often gradual and may not present with significant symptoms initially. However, as men age, the enlargement of the prostate gland can compress the urethra, leading to a variety of urinary symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, difficulty in starting urination, and a weak urine stream. These symptoms can significantly impact a man's quality of life and may necessitate medical intervention.

Therefore, targeted screening and early diagnosis programs could be implemented for men in their 50s and 60s, when the incidence of BPH is rapidly rising, to identify and manage the condition before it progresses to more severe stages. Moreover, research into the underlying mechanisms of BPH progression and the identification of modifiable risk factors could help in developing novel therapeutic approaches and reducing the burden of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and managing other comorbidities like diabetes, are also important considerations.

### EAU guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^116WaV8z]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to establish guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of BPH.

- **Methods**: A search of published work was conducted using Medline. In combination with expert opinions, recommendations were made on the usefulness of tests for assessment and follow-up, categorizing them as mandatory, recommended, or optional. Additionally, indications and outcomes for various therapeutic options were reviewed.

- **Results**: A digital rectal examination is mandatory for the diagnosis of BPH. Recommended tests include the International Prostate Symptom Score, creatinine measurement (or renal ultrasound), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume, while all other tests are optional. The treatment aims to improve the patients' quality of life, depending on the severity of BPH symptoms. A watchful waiting policy is recommended for patients with mild symptoms, medical treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms, and surgery for patients who have either failed medication or conservative management, or present with moderate to severe symptoms and/or complications of BPH requiring surgery. Among non-surgical treatments, transurethral microwave thermotherapy is considered the most attractive option. These treatments should be reserved for patients preferring to avoid surgery or for those who no longer respond favorably to medication. Finally, the study provides recommendations for follow-up tests and a recommended schedule for follow-up after BPH treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Recommendations for the assessment, therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with BPH are provided.

### The overlapping lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis [^11394Myz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to investigate the relationship, diagnosis, and treatment of the overlapping lower urinary tract symptoms experienced by men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis.

Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that men can suffer from both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Approximately 5–20% of men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia also suffer from prostatitis-like symptoms, while over one-third of men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia have had a diagnosis of prostatitis in the past. Differentiation between these two symptom-based medical conditions can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms, but pain clearly identifies patients with chronic prostatitis. Treatment for men with co-occurring benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis may include alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, and phytotherapies such as saw palmetto and bee pollen extract, with evidence showing the clear benefits of alpha-blocker therapy.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic prostatitis are common causes of lower urinary tract symptoms and frequently co-occur in older men. The best treatment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis is alpha-blockers.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^114og8wu]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: Given that the global population is both growing and aging, addressing the burden of age-associated diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, has become a global health priority. Although a systematic review was not conducted before producing and reporting these estimates, we identified many studies examining the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in different communities. However, varied case definitions, research methodologies, access to care, diagnostic modalities, and coding practices posed challenges in assessing and comparing the disease burden across different populations and over time. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) assembles data from diverse sources worldwide and applies standardized data processing and modeling techniques to facilitate like-versus-like comparisons across time and space. Previous GBD publications on multiple diseases, and a previous study by Launer and colleagues based on GBD 2017 estimates, reported a rising burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia worldwide.

- **Added value of this study**: The present study overcomes some of the limitations of epidemiological studies conducted in one or a few locations by using the GBD modeling methods to leverage international administrative data. It systematically estimates the prevalence of, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with, benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories between 2000 and 2019. We extended and improved upon the results of GBD 2017.

### The link between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer [^114uZZif]. Nature Reviews Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer are among the most common diseases of the prostate gland and represent significant burdens for patients and healthcare systems in many countries. The two diseases share traits such as hormone-dependent growth and response to antiandrogen therapy. Furthermore, risk factors such as prostate inflammation and metabolic disruption play key roles in the development of both diseases.

Despite these commonalities, BPH and prostate cancer exhibit important differences in terms of histology and localization. Large-scale epidemiological studies have shown that men with BPH have an increased risk of prostate cancer and prostate-cancer-related mortality. However, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal link, shared risk factors or pathophysiological mechanisms, or detection bias upon statistical analysis. Establishing BPH as a causal factor for prostate cancer development could improve the accuracy of prognostication and expedite intervention, potentially reducing the number of men who die from prostate cancer.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^115swdrZ]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common urological disease affecting older men worldwide; however, comprehensive data regarding its global, regional, and national burden, as well as its trends over time, are scarce. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we estimated the global trends and prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia, along with the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributed to this condition in 21 regions and 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019.

This study utilized GBD 2019 analytical and modeling strategies. Primary prevalence data were derived from claims in three countries and hospital inpatient encounters across 45 locations. A Bayesian meta-regression modeling tool, DisMod-MR version 2.1, was employed to estimate the age-specific, location-specific, and year-specific prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Age-standardized prevalence was calculated by the direct method using the GBD reference population.

Years lived with disability (YLDs) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia were estimated by multiplying the disability weight by the symptomatic proportion of the prevalence. Since we did not estimate the years of life lost due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) equaled YLDs. The final estimates were compared across Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles. The 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were estimated as the 25th and 975th of 1,000 ordered draws from a bootstrap.

### Diabetes and benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms — what do we know [^112oh3wZ]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia and the associated lower urinary tract symptoms are highly prevalent in older men, representing a substantial challenge to public health. While the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia increases with age, little is understood about its etiology and natural history. Recent evidence suggests relationships between diabetes and benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms. This paper presents an overview of clinical and epidemiological research on these conditions, hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms linking them, and recommendations for future research directions.

A structured, comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify studies examining the relationships between benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, and diabetes in older men.

A significant portion of the existing literature supports an association between diabetes and benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms. However, the failure to differentiate between lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia has contributed to some of the confusing evidence found in studies with more specific benign prostatic hyperplasia measurements. This confusion may result from factors such as largely cross-sectional analyses, the use of select or varied study populations, limited sample sizes, and inadequate control of potential confounders.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^117T1vfK]. The Lancet. Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Our study suggests a close and nuanced link between the benign prostatic hyperplasia burden and national sociodemographic status, and the potential for intervention to make an impact. As noted, the absolute benign prostatic hyperplasia burden has increased globally between 2000 and 2019, but age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates were more stable. This pattern of rising absolute burden with stability or only small changes in age-standardized rates was seen in most regions and many countries, reflecting the major role of widespread population growth and aging in the substantial increase in benign prostatic hyperplasia cases.

A rising absolute burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia was seen across all SDI quintiles, and the middle SDI quintile in particular carried the greatest absolute DALY burden by 2019. Notably, however, countries in the lowest three SDI quintiles (low, low-middle, and middle) had the largest percentage change in absolute DALYs between 2000 and 2019, and also had age-standardized DALY rates that overall trended upwards over the study period. Countries in the highest two SDI quintiles (high-middle and high) had somewhat smaller relative increases in absolute DALY counts and had age-standardized rates that overall trended downwards.

Although population growth and aging are the two most important factors contributing to the rising burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia worldwide, divergent trends in age-standardized rates suggest some influence from other risk factors for benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes.

### Landmarks in BPH — from aetiology to medical and surgical management [^113uWcTV]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians treat the symptoms associated with BPH on a daily basis. Although BPH is nearly universal with age, not all men develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Over the past 100 years, several notable advances in the field of urology have not only improved our understanding of the aetiology and natural history of this common disease but have also facilitated the development of therapeutics to effectively manage BPH-related symptoms. The high quality of modern-day diagnosis, as well as medical and surgical treatment for BPH, is a testimony to centuries of observation and decades of scientific research.

### Clinical evaluation of prostate cancer gene 3 score in diagnosis among Chinese men with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116e6m3A]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Due to the low specificity of current diagnostic methods for detecting prostate cancer, the identification of new biomarkers is highly desirable. The study was conducted to determine the clinical utility of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) assay to predict biopsy-detected cancers in Chinese men.

- **Methods**: The study included men who had a biopsy at The Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from January 2013 to December 2013. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were used to test PCA3 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA. The diagnostic accuracy of the PCA3 score for predicting a positive biopsy outcome was studied using sensitivity and specificity, and it was compared with PSA.

- **Results**: The probability of a positive biopsy increased with increasing PCA3 scores. The mean PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with prostate cancer (198.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 74.79–321.27) compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (84.31, 95% CI 6.47–162.15) with P < 0.01. The PCA3 score (cutoff 35) had a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 62.5%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed higher areas under the ROC curve for the PCA3 score compared to PSA, but without statistical significance.

- **Conclusions**: Increased PCA3 in biopsy tissue correlated with prostate cancer, and the PCA3 assay may improve diagnostic efficacy with the PCA3 score being independent of PSA level. The diagnostic significance of urinary PCA3 testing should be explored in future studies to further establish its utility.

### The progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: Examining the evidence and determining the risk [^113F8Bod]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is often associated with enlargement of the prostate gland, lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased urinary flow, and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, if the symptoms associated with BPH are left untreated, serious complications, such as acute urinary retention, may ensue. Evidence is emerging from long-term clinical studies to suggest that BPH is a progressive disease, with some patients progressing much more rapidly than others.

- **Objective**: This article aims to explore the natural history of BPH progression from a molecular, pathological, and clinical perspective, with emphasis on the key clinical evidence to support the progressive nature of this disease. How our increased understanding of the disease and of the risk factors for BPH progression might be applied to improve management practices are also discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Strategies to identify patients most at risk and guidelines directed towards long-term management, in addition to short-term treatment, may be useful in helping to prevent BPH progression.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Clinical manifestations and evaluation [^115cJoQd]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common condition related to aging and causing symptoms called lower urinary tract symptoms. Due to its high prevalence, it is important for clinicians involved in the management of patients with BPH to be aware of the strict recommendations for BPH evaluation. In this article, we describe the different steps and procedures doctors should follow to evaluate these patients. Symptoms and signs of BPH are reviewed, as well as the clinical evaluation steps and examinations available.

The basic evaluation of patients with BPH should include, according to the recommendations of the most relevant international guidelines, the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms using appropriate symptom scores. Additionally, a digital rectal examination, voiding charts, prostate-specific antigen and creatinine measurement, urinalysis, and imaging of the urinary tract should be performed.

### Evaluation of symptoms and quality of life in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112ahbSk]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common histologic condition among older men, marked by its morbidity through lower urinary tract symptoms and complications such as acute urinary retention, obstructive uropathy, and urinary tract infections. The mechanisms linking the histologic process and lower urinary tract symptoms remain uncertain; however, prostatic enlargement and bladder outlet obstruction are involved. Measurements of prostate size and the severity of bladder outlet obstruction correlate poorly with the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms.

The severity of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH can be measured reliably from the patient's perspective using several validated questionnaires, including the International Prostate Symptom Score, the Danish Prostate Symptom Score, and the International Continence Society (ICS) male questionnaire. In the clinical setting, these questionnaires can be used to assess the severity of symptoms in men with lower urinary tract symptoms that may be attributable to BPH, based on their age and clinical characteristics. They are also used to monitor changes in symptoms over time and with treatment. None of these questionnaires can accurately determine whether a symptomatic patient has underlying bladder outlet obstruction.

Additional questionnaires are available to measure the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on men's lives, as well as associated phenomena such as continence and sexual function, which may be affected by BPH and its treatments. Men suffering from a severe burden of lower urinary tract symptoms often experience significant impacts on their quality of life.

### Digital rectal examination, serum prostatic specific antigen or transrectal ultrasonography: the best tool to guide the treatment of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115Cvwsb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to consider benign prostatic hyperplasia as a progressive disease. Identifying men with progressive disease could significantly impact the decision to choose different therapeutic options. Numerous pieces of evidence demonstrate the impact of prostate volume on disease progression. It has been accepted that digital rectal examination, serum prostatic specific antigen, and transrectal prostate ultrasound are available tools for prostate volume estimation. This review examines the updated information on these tools for their guidance in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Recent findings**: Digital rectal examination is unreliable in assessing prostate volume; however, it remains important to rule out prostate cancer or neurological problems. Prostatic specific antigens should be recommended as part of patient evaluation due to their impact on predicting disease progression. Transrectal prostate ultrasound may be the best tool for estimating the exact prostate size.

- **Summary**: Numerous pieces of evidence have clearly demonstrated the impact of prostate volume on disease progression. Digital rectal examination appears effective at identifying a very large prostate. Prostatic specific antigen is the best tool for predicting disease progression and guiding therapeutic options. For surgical guidance, transrectal prostate ultrasound is the most useful tool available for exact prostate volume estimation.

### Integrative multiplatform molecular profiling of benign prostatic hyperplasia identifies distinct subtypes [^1127wzht]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign prostatic hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: BPH is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland that affects aging men.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BPH is complex and not fully understood. However, androgenic hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a significant role in the growth and maintenance of the prostate gland. Dihydrotestosterone is synthesized from testosterone by the action of 5-alpha reductase enzymes, and both normal and pathological growth of the prostate is dependent on dihydrotestosterone synthesis.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of BPH/LUTS in men is estimated at 15,000 per 1,000 person-years. The reported prevalence of BPH ranges from 8–14% in men aged 40–49 years to 21–43% in men aged 60–69 years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BPH include advancing age, familial predisposition, obesity, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and CVD.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, BPH is primarily diagnosed based on a diverse array of progressive LUTS. These symptoms include increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, weak urinary stream, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BPH is variable. It is a progressive condition but is not necessarily life-threatening.
