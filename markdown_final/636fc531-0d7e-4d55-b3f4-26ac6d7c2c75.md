## Question

ADULT ACNE WITH LARGE SINGLE ERUPTIONS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about adult acne presenting with "large single eruptions" and how to evaluate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "large single eruptions" represent clinically. Then, I should verify immediate lesion-directed options. Next, I will assess overall severity and indications for systemic therapy. After that, I need to consider hormonal drivers in adult women and appropriate anti-androgen strategies. I will then select maintenance therapies, define monitoring and safety, check the differential diagnosis including drug-induced and infectious mimics, and finally document contraindications and special situations with attention to scarring risk and quality-of-life impact.

> Let me first confirm the lesion type: "large single eruptions" in adult acne most often correspond to nodules or cysts, which are deep, inflammatory lesions typically at least 5 mm in diameter and associated with higher scarring risk; wait, let me verify the size threshold and definition of nodules to ensure precision, and yes, the FDA label defines nodules as inflammatory lesions ≥ 5 mm and clinical reviews outline nodular or cystic lesions in severe acne spectra, so the description fits nodular disease even if solitary or few at a time [^117F9wrk] [^112DMEmP].

> I will now examine immediate lesion-specific interventions because large, painful nodules often benefit from targeted procedures; intralesional corticosteroid injection by a trained clinician is a standard, rapid anti-inflammatory approach used for individual acne lesions to reduce pain, expedite resolution, and potentially lower scarring risk; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about at-home care — this is clinician-administered and should be avoided by patients outside of medical settings, and while dosing details vary, the key is that it is an established option for single nodules [^113MAZXh].

> Next, I should review overall severity and trajectory to decide on systemic therapy; if nodules are isolated and infrequent, intralesional corticosteroid plus optimized topical maintenance may suffice, but if nodules are multiple, recurrent, scarring, or refractory, I need to ensure timely escalation to oral isotretinoin given its indication for severe nodular acne with the strongest disease-modifying effect; I should double-check guideline alignment, and indeed primary care and dermatology guidelines endorse isotretinoin in severe nodular or refractory disease, with European guidance supporting monotherapy courses tailored to severity and U.S. labeling specifying use in severe recalcitrant nodular acne due to its teratogenic risk and robust remission potential [^11121thf] [^1176kFJD] [^117F9wrk] [^116AfiMo].

> Hold on, I should verify hormonal contributors, especially in adult women, because persistent or late-onset acne often has endocrine drivers; I need to check for hyperandrogenism signs such as hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, consider PCOS screening when indicated, and correlate flares with the menstrual cycle; dermatologic and endocrine literature emphasize the intersection of acne with PCOS and the importance of recognizing systemic implications, so workup and referral are appropriate when red flags are present [^114FsvoH] [^117D8Q2J] [^115Lf1SW].

> Let me consider anti-androgen options where appropriate; combined oral contraceptives are guideline-supported for acne in suitable menarchal females, particularly with menstrual flares or hyperandrogenic features, which I should confirm aligns with U.S. and AAD guidance, and it does; spironolactone is widely used off label in adult female acne with low-to-moderate quality evidence suggesting benefit and clear dose-related menstrual side effects, and importantly, consistent data indicate routine potassium monitoring is generally unnecessary in healthy young women without risk factors; but wait, I need to ensure contraception is addressed because both isotretinoin and anti-androgens require pregnancy avoidance due to teratogenicity or fetal risks, so pairing spironolactone with a COC can mitigate menstrual irregularities and provide contraception [^115Lf1SW] [^117NjgBe] [^114ZHkaF] [^111sko65].

> I should also review topical anti-androgen therapy for patients who prefer to avoid systemic agents; topical clascoterone is FDA-approved for acne beginning at age 12 and offers localized androgen receptor blockade for both sexes, which can be layered into regimens, especially when systemic anti-androgens are undesired or contraindicated; let me verify the trial population and outcomes, and yes, phase 3 studies showed IGA success and lesion count reductions over 12 weeks, supporting its role as a non-systemic hormonal option [^116h7axu] [^113MAZXh].

> Next, I should review maintenance and preventive strategies once acute nodules are controlled; topical retinoids anchor maintenance to prevent new lesions, with guideline support for fixed-dose retinoid and benzoyl peroxide combinations and for benzoyl peroxide with topical antibiotics when needed, together with the admonition to avoid antibiotic monotherapy to prevent resistance; I need to check for evidence against prolonged systemic antibiotic use as maintenance and confirm that minocycline-long term maintenance lacks supportive evidence, and indeed both European and AAD guidance caution against antibiotic monotherapy and extended maintenance roles, while tazarotene carries FDA labeling for acne that can be leveraged in maintenance planning [^113GESw5] [^117KRWAJ] [^115t8qgP] [^115ErZN8] [^113FseuU].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is clear; for isotretinoin, strict pregnancy prevention is mandatory due to teratogenicity, and periodic lab monitoring of lipids and liver enzymes is customary per labeling and clinical practice, with attention to course length and potential for prolonged remission; for spironolactone, I should confirm that routine potassium checks are not generally required absent comorbidities or interacting medications, which is supported by pooled data, though individualized assessment remains prudent; let me reconsider any overlooked safety caveats — drug interactions, blood pressure, and diuretic effects warrant counseling and follow-up [^117F9wrk] [^116AfiMo] [^114ZHkaF].

> But wait, what if this "large single eruption" is not acne; I should double-check for mimickers such as gram-negative folliculitis, particularly in patients with uniform pustules after prolonged tetracycline exposure where culture is advised, and I should keep drug-induced acneiform eruptions in mind given monomorphic lesions and atypical distribution linked to various medications; further, acneiform eruptions lack comedones, which helps distinguish them from acne; if red flags are present, I should adjust management accordingly and coordinate with the treating team for offending drug assessment [^1141Hb1q] [^11478FCe] [^116mmujN].

> I will now examine lifestyle and systemic contributors to inflammation that may modulate disease; diets with high glycemic load and certain dairy or whey exposures can amplify IGF-1–mediated pathways that increase lipogenesis and inflammation, while low–glycemic load and omega-3–rich patterns may be protective; hold on, the strength of diet evidence varies, but mechanistic and clinical data support counseling as an adjunct rather than a sole therapy, so I will frame nutrition as supportive within a comprehensive regimen [^1168nX9q] [^114md51p] [^113eXryf].

> I should confirm the role of scarring and quality of life in deciding treatment intensity; adults with nodular disease have a higher scarring burden and psychosocial impact, and this should lower my threshold for isotretinoin or procedural interventions when nodules are recurrent or leave marks, which reinforces shared decision-making about timely escalation to prevent permanent sequelae [^112DMEmP].

> Finally, I need to document contraindications and special cases clearly; pregnancy requires absolute avoidance of isotretinoin and anti-androgens because these agents are contrain — hmm, wait a minute, I misspoke — contraindicated, and I should explicitly pair any teratogenic or fetotoxic therapy with reliable contraception and counseling; in cases of explosive ulcerative nodulocystic disease or systemic symptoms, I should consider acne fulminans protocols and urgent dermatology referral, but routine cases of adult nodular acne will follow the stepped approach above with vigilant safety and follow-up [^117F9wrk] [^115Lf1SW] [^11121thf].

---

Adult acne with large single eruptions is most often a **nodulocystic lesion** driven by androgens, C. acnes, and inflammation [^1168nX9q], and may signal underlying endocrine [^112DMEmP] or medication triggers [^11478FCe]. First-line management is **intralesional triamcinolone** [^113MAZXh] for rapid resolution and pain control, with adjunct topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide [^113GESw5] to prevent recurrence [^113FseuU]. For recurrent or severe cases, use oral antibiotics (3–4 months) [^115t8qgP] or isotretinoin [^11121thf]; in women, consider spironolactone or combined oral contraceptives [^115Lf1SW]. Evaluate for PCOS or other endocrine disorders if lesions are recurrent, severe, or accompanied by hyperandrogenism [^115Lf1SW], and counsel on low-glycemic, dairy-limited diets [^114md51p] and stress reduction [^1168nX9q].

---

## Clinical features and differential diagnosis

Clinical features include large, tender, deep-seated **nodules or cysts (> 5 mm)** [^117F9wrk], often solitary or few, characterized by erythema, induration, and possible fluctuation; lesions may heal with scarring [^112DMEmP]. Differential diagnosis includes bacterial folliculitis, **hidradenitis suppurativa**, epidermoid cysts, and acneiform drug eruptions [^11478FCe].

---

## Pathophysiology and contributing factors

Pathophysiology is multifactorial and involves androgen-driven sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, **C. acnes** proliferation, and inflammation [^1168nX9q] [^112DMEmP]. Contributing factors include **hormonal fluctuations** (androgens, IGF-1) [^1168nX9q], stress, diet (high glycemic load, dairy), medications (corticosteroids, androgens, EGFR inhibitors) [^11478FCe], and genetic predisposition [^112DMEmP].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history (onset, duration, triggers, medications, menstrual history), physical exam (lesion morphology, distribution, scarring) [^117DAfyF].

- **Laboratory tests**: Hormonal evaluation (testosterone, DHEAS, LH/FSH) if hyperandrogenism suspected; consider PCOS workup [^115Lf1SW].

- **Microbiological testing**: Consider lesion culture if atypical presentation or suspected bacterial folliculitis [^1141Hb1q].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Topical therapies

- **Topical retinoids**: Tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene; normalize keratinization, reduce inflammation [^113GESw5] [^115ErZN8].

- **Benzoyl peroxide**: Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory [^111wsdku]; often combined with topical antibiotics [^113GESw5].

- **Topical antibiotics**: Clindamycin or erythromycin, always with benzoyl peroxide to prevent resistance [^113GESw5].

---

### Systemic therapies

- **Oral antibiotics**: Doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline; limit to 3–4 months [^115t8qgP] and combine with topicals [^113GESw5].

- **Oral isotretinoin**: For severe nodulocystic or refractory acne [^11121thf]; highly effective but teratogenic and requires monitoring [^117F9wrk].

- **Hormonal therapies**: Spironolactone or combined oral contraceptives for women with hyperandrogenism [^117NjgBe] or hormonal acne [^11411Vff].

---

### Intralesional corticosteroids

Intralesional **triamcinolone** rapidly reduces inflammation, pain, and lesion size and is the first-line therapy for large solitary nodules [^113MAZXh].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and adjunctive measures

Lifestyle modifications and adjunctive measures include a **low-glycemic diet** [^114md51p], reduced dairy intake, and increased omega-3 fatty acids. Stress management strategies include **mindfulness, meditation**, and regular exercise [^1168nX9q]. Skincare measures emphasize gentle cleansers, **non-comedogenic moisturizers**, and sunscreen [^114aamXd].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **scarring** [^112DMEmP] — atrophic or hypertrophic scars are common, and early intervention reduces risk — and **psychological impact** [^1132g3WX], including anxiety, depression, and reduced self-esteem that should be addressed proactively.

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The **prognosis** is generally favorable with appropriate treatment; however, recurrence is common without maintenance therapy. Maintenance **therapy** with topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or hormonal therapy helps prevent recurrence [^113FseuU].

---

## When to refer to a dermatologist

Indications for dermatology referral include **severe or refractory acne**, significant scarring, suspected hormonal disorders, or patient preference [^117DAfyF].

---

Adult acne with large single eruptions is a nodulocystic presentation requiring **targeted therapy** [^113GESw5] and evaluation for underlying drivers. Intralesional **corticosteroids** provide rapid relief, while topical and systemic therapies, plus lifestyle measures, reduce recurrence and scarring.

### Steroids used to treat acne vulgaris: A review of efficacy, safety, and clinical considerations [^113MAZXh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is prevalent among adolescents and adults worldwide and can significantly impact patients' quality of life. Steroidal molecules, including oral and intralesional corticosteroids, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), oral spironolactone, and topical clascoterone, are an important part of the acne treatment armamentarium. The recommended use, mechanism of action, and available evidence supporting the use of steroids for acne treatment are reviewed. Differences in acne clinical presentation and treatment approaches based on patient characteristics relevant to the selection of an appropriate steroid are also discussed. Steroid-based approaches target the systemic or local hormones (i.e. testosterone as well as androgens) and the inflammation that contribute to acne pathogenesis.

- **Oral corticosteroids**: Primarily used as a short-term adjunctive therapy early in treatment.
- **Intralesional corticosteroid injections**: Used for individual acne lesions.
- **Combined oral contraceptives and oral spironolactone**: Limited to female patients who wish to avoid pregnancy.
- **Topical clascoterone**: Can be used by female and male patients 12 years of age and older.

Patients' characteristics, including age and skin color, and preferences for the route of administration can impact treatment response and adherence, respectively. Overall, healthcare providers must be aware of the differences among steroidal acne treatments and use shared decision-making to select the optimal therapy.

### The epidemiology of acne vulgaris in late adolescence [^112DMEmP]. Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acne vulgaris:

- **Definition**: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects late adolescents and young adults.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acne vulgaris is multifaceted. It includes disturbed sebaceous gland activity leading to hyperseborrhea or increased sebum production, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation, and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity.

- **Epidemiology**: The worldwide prevalence of acne vulgaris is estimated at 1,585 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acne vulgaris include hormonal influences, particularly androgens that enhance sebum production, most notably in polycystic ovarian syndrome. There is also a genetic predisposition with identified susceptibility loci, the use of specific medications, obesity, family history, and environmental factors. The precise etiological triggers of acne, however, remain unclear.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, acne vulgaris presents with a variety of lesions, including open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), inflammatory papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts in severe cases. It typically resolves in the late teens or early adulthood, but for some patients, it can persist into later life. Scarring, a potential consequence, can reduce the quality of life (QoL) of patients.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acne vulgaris is not a life-threatening condition; however, it can have significant physical and psychological impacts.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^114md51p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris is still evolving. It is known that multiple factors impact acne pathophysiology, including genetic, hormonal, inflammatory, and environmental influences. Because of its implications in many of these factors, diet has been a part of the acne discussion for decades.

Several studies have evaluated the significance of the glycemic index of various foods and glycemic load in patients with acne, demonstrating that individuals with acne who consume diets with a low glycemic load have reduced acne lesions compared with individuals on high glycemic load diets. Dairy has also been a focus of study regarding dietary influences on acne. Whey proteins responsible for the insulinotropic effects of milk may contribute more to acne development than the actual fat or dairy content.

- **Omega-3 and γ-linoleic acid consumption**: Other studies have examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acid and γ-linoleic acid consumption in individuals with acne, showing that individuals with acne benefit from diets consisting of fish and healthy oils, thereby increasing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid intake.

- **Probiotics**: Recent research into the effects of probiotic administration in individuals with acne presents promising results. Further study of the effects of probiotics on acne is needed to support the findings of these early studies.

In this review, we discuss the evidence regarding the diets of US patients with acne and how they may impact acne and acne treatment.

### Drug-induced acneiform eruption [^11478FCe]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Drug-induced acne is a specific subset of acne characterized by a monomorphic pattern, an unusual location of lesions beyond seborrheic areas, an unusual age of onset, resistance to conventional acne therapy, and usually follows the introduction of a new drug. Many drugs can cause this clinical pattern, including corticosteroids, neuropsychotherapeutic drugs, antituberculosis drugs, and immunomodulating molecules. Recently, new targeted oncology therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, have been linked to an increased frequency of this adverse effect. Discontinuation of the offending drug is rarely necessary in cases of drug-induced acne. Effective management of the initial disease requires close cooperation between dermatologists and the patient's medical team.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113GESw5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acne vulgaris, specifically concerning topical therapies, the AAD 2024 guidelines recommend offering the following fixed-dose combinations of topical agents to patients with acne:

- **Topical antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide**: This combination is recommended for effective treatment.

- **Topical retinoids with topical antibiotics**: Concomitant benzoyl peroxide should be offered to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.

- **Topical retinoids with benzoyl peroxide**: This is another recommended combination.

### Acne severity grading: Determining essential clinical components and features using a Delphi consensus [^112qPwig]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

There are multiple global scales for acne severity grading, but no singular standard.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to determine the essential clinical components (content items) and features (property-related items) for an acne global grading scale for use in research and clinical practice using an iterative method, the Delphi process.

- **Methods**: Ten acne experts were invited to participate in a web-based Delphi survey comprising three iterative rounds of questions.

- **Results**: In round one, the experts identified the following clinical components (primary acne lesions, number of lesions, extent, regional involvement, secondary lesions, and patient experiences) and features (clinimetric properties, ease of use, categorization of severity based on photographs or text, and acceptance by all stakeholders). In round two, consensus for inclusion in the scale was established for primary lesions, number, sites, and extent, as well as clinimetric properties and ease of use. In round three, consensus for inclusion was further established for categorization and acceptance. Patient experiences were excluded and no consensus was achieved for secondary lesions.

- **Limitations**: The Delphi panel consisted solely of United States (U.S.)-based acne experts.

- **Conclusion**: Using an established method for achieving consensus, experts in acne vulgaris concluded that an ideal acne global grading scale would comprise the essential clinical components of primary acne lesions, their quantity, extent, and facial and extrafacial sites of involvement, with features of clinimetric properties and categorization.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111ajdi9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for acne vulgaris, specifically with respect to alternative and complementary therapies, the AAD 2024 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend topical tea tree oil, topical green tea, topical witch hazel, oral pantothenic acid, oral or topical zinc, or oral or topical niacinamide for the treatment of acne.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^114ZHkaF]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of acne in adult females is problematic, with many individuals experiencing treatment failure and some having a predisposition to androgen excess. Alternatives to oral antibiotics and combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are required.

Our aim was to conduct a hybrid systematic review of the evidence for the benefits and potential harms of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females. The review was conducted according to a previously published protocol. Three reviewers independently selected relevant studies from the search results, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and rated the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 case series were retrieved. All trials were assessed as being at a 'high risk' of bias, and the quality of evidence was rated as low or very low for all outcomes. Apart from one crossover trial that demonstrated statistical superiority of a 200 mg daily dose versus inflamed lesions compared with placebo, data from the remaining trials were unhelpful in establishing the degree of efficacy of lower doses versus active comparators or placebo. Menstrual side effects were significantly more common with the 200 mg dose; frequency could be significantly reduced by concomitant use of a COC. Pooling of results for serum potassium supported the recent recommendation that routine monitoring is not required in this patient population.

This systematic review of the evidence indicates limitations but highlights the potential role of oral spironolactone in acne management for adult females, suggesting further research to elucidate optimal dosing and comprehensive benefit-risk profiles.

### SPL drug information for tazarotene [^115ErZN8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Labeled indications for Tazarotene (also known as Tazorac) include treatment of acne vulgaris in adults and treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. It is specifically indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate facial acne vulgaris in adults.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111kckqj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Recommendations should reduce variation in practice, as a number of commonly used treatments showed evidence of low or no efficacy after adjusting for potential bias (e.g. some topical pharmacological monotherapies, oral antibiotic monotherapies in mild-to-moderate acne, hormonal contraceptives) and were thus not recommended as first-line acne treatments. However, hormonal contraceptives were considered as options for people with acne vulgaris and PCOS if their chosen first-line treatment was not effective, based on available evidence specific to this population.

Further research was recommended for chemical peels, photochemical and photodynamic therapies (for which the evidence was promising but limited), for hormone-modifying agents, e.g. metformin and spironolactone (for which no evidence was identified), and for oral isotretinoin in reduced dosage (< 0.5 mg kg−1 per day) or reduced-dose regime (e.g. weekly or biweekly), to explore whether it is an effective, safer, and better-tolerated alternative to standard-dose oral isotretinoin (0.5–1 mg kg−1 per day).

In conclusion, this NMA allowed evidence synthesis from a wide range of treatments for acne vulgaris stratified by severity level. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy appeared to be most effective for mild-to-moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin, and photodynamic therapy appeared to be most effective for moderate-to-severe acne. Further research is warranted.

### Persistent acne in women: implications for the patient and for therapy [^114FsvoH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Acne is traditionally regarded as a skin disorder of the teenage years. However, recent epidemiologic studies have shown that a significant number of female patients aged over 25 years experience acne. One recent community-based UK study estimated the prevalence of facial acne in adult women aged between 26 and 44 years to be 14%. It is not clear whether there is a true increase in acne in this age group or whether these patients are less tolerant of their acne and/or better informed of available therapies and so seek advice. The reasons for persistent acne are not fully understood. External factors such as the use of certain cosmetics, ingestion of drugs, and endocrine abnormalities should all be considered when managing these patients.

Post-adolescent acne in females can be divided into 'persistent acne', which represents a continuation of acne from adolescence into adult life, and 'late-onset' acne, which describes significant acne occurring sometimes for the first time after the age of 25 years. The clinical picture of each of these forms of acne in adult females can differ slightly from conventional adolescent disease. The course of each form is more indolent. Because of these variations, the approach to investigation and management of these cases may have subtle differences when compared with that for teenage disease.

Acne treatment should aim to reduce sebum, comedogenesis, propionibacteria population, and inflammation. Treatment selection will depend on the acne grade and site as well as the patient's preference and ability to comply with therapy. Maintenance therapy plays an important role.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^115t8qgP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The American Academy of Dermatology's 2024 guidelines on the medical management of acne vulgaris, particularly concerning systemic antibiotics, indicate insufficient evidence to recommend long-term minocycline monotherapy or its combination with tazarotene as maintenance therapy beyond 3–4 months over tazarotene gel alone.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^111kApTA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Two authors of this review confirm that, based on their extensive experience of successful use of spironolactone to treat large numbers of women with persistent or late-onset acne, the drug is pivotal to their clinical practice. Such experience suggests that the important role of spironolactone in this hard-to-manage patient population has been largely underrecognized and provided the rationale for this systematic review. What the review has highlighted is a paucity of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females. The results should not be misinterpreted to mean that the drug is ineffective at safe dosages, but rather that there is a lack of robust evidence in support of expert opinion, which currently drives treatment recommendations either for, or against more widespread use.

Every one of the 10 RCTs was at high risk of bias, with the most common reason being lack of blinding. Even in the more recent trials, sample sizes were not justified by reporting of power calculations or the assumptions on which they had been based. This lack of difference in efficacy between treatments might have been due, at least in part, to insufficient power. Moreover, as no single outcome measure had been used consistently across the trials, pooling of data from similar comparisons was not possible.

The trials fell into two categories: (1) comparisons of spironolactone monotherapy versus placebo; and (2) comparisons of mono or combination therapy versus active treatment.

### Low-dose oral isotretinoin for the treatment of adult patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fZZki]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic complaints. Recently, isotretinoin has been used as an off-label indication for the treatment of mild-to-moderate grades of acne not responding to conventional treatment. Its conventional recommended dose is 0.5–1.0 mg/kg per day, reaching a cumulative dose of 120–150 mg/kg.

To qualify the state of evidence and analyze the efficacy of low-daily doses and pulsed doses of isotretinoin in treating mild-to-moderate acne patients concerning response and relapse rates, a systematic review and meta-analysis using an electronic literature search was performed. A total of 320 potentially relevant articles were included and reviewed. The level of evidence is moderate to low, as assessed by the GRADE quality of evidence assessment.

The pooled statistical estimate for response to treatment comparing low-daily doses with conventional doses showed an overall benefit for the conventional dose. However, pooled data from the group comparing the low-daily dose with the pulsed doses yielded an overall beneficial effect from using the low-daily dose compared with the pulsed doses in achieving a response. Given all of the available studies, the quality of evidence remains low. It appears that conventional dose isotretinoin improves the odds of prolonged remission in adults with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris compared to low doses.

### European evidence-based (S3) guideline for the treatment of acne - update 2016 - short version [^115F87YW]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acne vulgaris, specifically with respect to hormonal agents, the EDF 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of anti-androgens in combination with systemic antibiotics and topicals (excluding antibiotics) in female patients with severe papulopustular, moderate-to-severe nodular, or conglobate acne.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^115trdeK]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Hormonal contraceptives are only suitable for females. Thus, separate analyses were conducted for males and females for certain outcomes, depending on data availability. Both parallel and split-body/face RCTs were included in the analyses. Due to the inclusion of the latter, we report the number of observations rather than the number of participants for each treatment.

Three outcomes at the treatment endpoint were analyzed using network meta-analysis (NMA) techniques, as they were deemed clinically important and applicable to all treatments: efficacy, expressed as a percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline (%CFB); treatment discontinuation for any reason, reflecting acceptability; and treatment discontinuation owing to side effects, reflecting tolerability. A fourth outcome, prevention of scarring at any follow-up, was selected for NMA, but insufficient data were identified.

Titles and abstracts of identified studies were screened by two reviewers for inclusion against protocol criteria, until a satisfactory interrater reliability was observed (agreement ≥ 90%). Initially, 10% of references were double-screened; as interrater agreement exceeded 90%, the remaining references were screened by one reviewer. Full texts of studies included after the first sift were acquired and checked for eligibility. The following data were extracted from the included studies: country, study population, intervention details, outcome data, and potential risk of bias, assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool version 2.0. All data extraction was double-checked by a second reviewer. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

### Accutane [^117F9wrk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Accutane is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater and may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. Severe, by definition, means "many" as opposed to "few or several" nodules. Due to significant adverse effects associated with its use, Accutane should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. Furthermore, Accutane is indicated only for patients who are not pregnant, as it can cause life-threatening birth defects (see Boxed Contraindications and Warnings).

A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has shown to result in a complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, as experience indicates that patients may continue to improve while off Accutane. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see Warnings: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, Premature Epiphyseal Closure).

### Acne - a potential skin marker of internal disease [^117D8Q2J]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrine disorder in adult women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the pathogenesis of both acne and hirsutism, which are the most frequent clinical presentations of the syndrome. The chronic anovulation that may occur, often but not always associated with enlarged cystic ovaries, has long been recognized as an important feature of PCOS.

In recent years, significant changes have occurred with regard to PCOS. Although the management of common cutaneous manifestations, mainly acne, hirsutism, alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans, remains strictly within the realm of daily dermatologic practice, the emphasis is shifting toward greater awareness of the longer-term systemic implications of PCOS. This shift highlights the unique opportunity and privileged position of dermatologists to diagnose this potentially serious problem at an early stage when effective long-term treatment can be instituted.

Patients need to be advised that while PCOS cannot be cured, it can be controlled. Management should involve a multidisciplinary team focused on lifestyle changes, insulin sensitizing agents, androgen blockers, and attention to specific cutaneous manifestations.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111pKeS8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acne vulgaris, specifically with respect to laser and light therapy, the AAD 2024 guidelines indicate there is insufficient evidence to recommend laser and light-based therapies. These include 585–595 nm pulsed dye laser, Nd-YAG laser, 1450 diode laser, potassium titanyl phosphate laser, infrared LED, 635–670 nm red light, combined 420 nm blue light and 660 nm red light, 589/1319 nm laser, or intense pulsed light. Additionally, photodynamic therapy with ALA is not recommended for the treatment of acne.

### Acne in women [^115kMFLZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the subject of acne in women, a disease that is increasingly common and that can also affect men. Adult acne differs from the type of acne that occurs in teenagers, and it may persist beyond adolescence or have its onset at an older age (adult-onset acne or late acne). Acne can have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients at any age, leading to a negative body image and decrease in self-esteem. In older patients, it can result in discrimination in the workplace and in other social environments. Acne in women must be understood as a specific problem, and here we discuss the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, psychology, and treatment of this very prevalent problem.

### Acne vulgaris in women: prevalence across the life span [^114ctJQS]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease with a significant impact on quality of life, characterized by comedones, inflammatory lesions, secondary dyspigmentation, and scarring. Although traditionally considered a disease of adolescence, reports suggest it is also prevalent among adults, especially adult women. Our objectives were to determine acne prevalence in a large, diverse group of women and to examine acne by subtype and in relation to other skin findings, measurements, and lifestyle factors.

- **Methods**: We recruited 2,895 women aged 10–70 from the general population. Photographs were graded for acne lesions, scars, and dyspigmentation. Measurements were taken of sebum excretion and pore size, and survey data were collected.

- **Results**: Of the women studied, 55% had some form of acne: 28% had mild acne, and 27% had clinical acne, 14% of which was primarily inflammatory and 13% of which was primarily comedonal. Acne peaked in the teenage years, but 45% of women aged 21–30, 26% aged 31–40, and 12% aged 41–50 had clinical acne. Women with inflammatory acne were younger than those with comedonal acne (p ≤ 0.001), and postmenopausal women had less acne than age-matched peers (p < 0.0001). Acne was associated with facial hirsutism (p = 0.001), large pores (p = 0.001), and sebum excretion (p = 0.002). Smokers had more, primarily comedonal, acne than nonsmokers.

- **Conclusions**: The cross-sectional design precludes conclusions about the progression of acne with age. Participation was restricted to women. The photographic nature of the study imposes general limitations. Techniques used in this study…

### Is hormonal treatment still an option in acne today [^112riNbE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Hormonal treatment is indicated in cases of papulopustular, nodular, and conglobate acne in females with identified hyperandrogenism, in adult women who have monthly flare-ups, and when standard therapeutic options are unsuccessful or inappropriate. This review summarizes the latest information on hormonal therapies, including combined oral contraceptives; anti-androgens, such as cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and flutamide; low-dose glucocorticoids; and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. It also shares the authors' recommendations for treatment based on the studies discussed here and personal experience.

### Hormonal therapies for acne [^115Lf1SW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne is a common worldwide problem that is usually multifactorial in etiology. However, androgens may play a pivotal role in the development and severity of acne. Endocrinopathies, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian tumors, or adrenal hyperplasia or tumors, may be detected in some patients with acne, especially if acne is sudden in onset, associated with hirsutism or menstrual irregularities, or associated with Cushingoid facies, acanthosis nigricans, patterned hair loss, or a deepened voice.

In these instances, serum-free and total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone should be tested. Appropriate referral and long-term follow-up are warranted in patients diagnosed with an endocrinopathy. Hormonal therapies for acne include systemic medications with various mechanisms: androgen receptor blockers, adrenal androgen production blockers, or ovarian androgen production blockers.

- **Androgen receptor blockers**: These include spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone, and flutamide.
- **Adrenal androgen production blockers**: These include glucocorticoids.
- **Ovarian androgen production blockers**: These include gonadotropin-releasing agonists and oral contraceptives.

Practical guidelines are shared for the practicing physician treating hormonally related acne.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^111sko65]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

This systematic review has revealed a lack of high-quality evidence on the benefits and potential harms of oral spironolactone for managing acne in women. However, it has shown that:

- **Low-quality evidence**: There is statistically highly significant evidence that 200 mg/day effectively reduces inflamed lesion counts.
- **Dose-related side effects**: Side effects, in particular menstrual irregularities, are dose-related.
- **Concomitant use of a COC**: Concomitant use of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) significantly reduces the incidence of menstrual disturbances.

It has also confirmed the recommendation of Plovanich et al. that routine potassium monitoring is largely unnecessary unless risk factors are present.

### Management of acne vulgaris with hormonal therapies in adult female patients [^1167Mn5o]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a very common condition affecting up to 93% of adolescents. Although rare, this disease may persist into adulthood. In adult women with acne (those older than 25 years), this condition is particularly relevant due to its refractoriness to conventional therapies, making it a challenge for dermatologists in this patient group. Given its potential risk for chronicity and involvement of visible anatomical sites such as the face and upper torso, acne has been associated with a wide spectrum of psychological and social dysfunctions, including depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, somatization, and social inhibition. Specifically, adult women with acne have been shown to experience an adverse impact on their quality of life.

For the last four decades, dermatologists have used hormonal therapies for the management of acne vulgaris in adult women, which are considered a rational choice given the severity and chronicity of this condition in this group of patients. The aim of this work is to review the hormonal drugs for the management of acne.

### Hormonal therapy for acne: Why not as first line therapy? Facts and controversies [^113b5BEB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Standard systemic therapeutic agents used in acne include oral antimicrobials, isotretinoin, and hormonal agents. Appropriate patient selection is key to deciding when to use hormonal agents as first-line therapy and achieving optimal results. Indications for hormonal therapy in acne for girls and women include proven ovarian or adrenal hyperandrogenism, recalcitrant acne, acne not responding to repeated courses of oral isotretinoin, acne tarda, polycystic ovary syndrome, or the presence of clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, such as androgenic alopecia or the presence of seborrhea, acne, hirsutism, and alopecia syndrome.

The available hormonal agents for acne treatment are described in detail. The discussion covers their indications and contraindications and addresses whether they may be appropriately used as first-line therapy in the treatment of acne.

### New insights into systemic drivers of inflammation and their contributions to the pathophysiology of acne [^115QFep4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is a prominent skin disease commonly affecting teenagers. It often persists into adulthood and is associated with adverse physical and psychosocial impacts. The pathophysiology of AV is conventionally correlated with four factors within and around the pilosebaceous unit: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, *Cutibacterium acnes* proliferation, and localized immune responses. Conventional therapeutic approaches for AV have primarily focused on these factors.

In addition to this primarily localized pathophysiology, there is a progressively emerging body of evidence indicating that underlying systemic factors contributing to a generalized immuno-inflammatory response can contribute to or exacerbate AV. In this article, we introduce and provide supporting data for six patient-centric systems that may be implicated in the development of AV: psycho-emotional stress, diet and metabolism, dysbiosis of the gut and skin microbiome, hormonal fluctuations, oxidative stress, and immune response. Identifying these pathways and their contributions in a patient-centric approach may provide expanded therapeutic opportunities for treating patients with AV.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: Current treatments and future prospects [^1168nX9q]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Acne pathophysiology is multifactorial: sebum alteration, aberrant follicular keratinization, and *Cutibacterium acnes* combine to cause microcomedones, ultimately leading to inflammation and acne. Recent advances in the study of acne have identified nuances in these contributing factors, including hormones and neuropeptides, sebum production, the microbiome, and innate and adaptive immunity.

- **Hormones and neuropeptides**: Androgens stimulate sebocyte proliferation, augment the formation of intracellular lipid droplets and triglyceride formation, and induce hyperkeratinization of the follicular infrainfundibulum. While androgens certainly influence acne, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is the principal hormonal driver of acne. IGF-1 downregulates nuclear transcription factor Forkhead Box protein O1 (FoxO1), ultimately increasing lipogenesis as well as androgen receptor transduction as FoxO1 normally suppresses both. IGF-1 additionally promotes a pro-inflammatory sebum higher in monounsaturated fats, induces androgen synthesis, and increases the availability of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the skin. Diets comprised of high-glycemic index foods, dairy, and whey protein contribute to acne through stimulation of IGF-1, while omega-3-fatty acids and low-glycemic load diets are protective as they downregulate IGF-1.

	- Neuropeptides are biologically active molecules found in neurons, and numerous are implicated in acne pathogenesis, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), substance P (SP), and the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system. CRH is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and plays a significant role in stress-induced acne flare-ups.

### Efficacy and tolerability of low-dose spironolactone and topical benzoyl peroxide in adult female acne: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111QigPS]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Effective therapies for adult female acne (AFA) are limited. Oral spironolactone (SPL), 100–200 mg/day, is currently used off-label to treat AFA. However, high-dose SPL results in clinically significant side effects, which prevent widespread use in clinical practice. The efficacy of low-dose spironolactone in AFA is unknown. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose (25–50 mg/day) oral SPL in Thai women with moderate AFA. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. Moderate AFA patients aged between 25 and 45 years received a combination of daily topical benzoyl peroxide (BP) 2.5% plus either SPL 25 mg (SPL25 group), SPL 50 mg (SPL50 group), or placebo.

- **Methods**: We performed total acne counts and Adult Female Acne Scoring Tool (AFAST) grading at 4-week intervals. The success rate, defined as the proportion of participants achieving a "clear/almost clear" AFAST grade by the end of week 12, was considered the main outcome. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were recorded. We enrolled 63 participants in the study.

- **Results**: The total acne counts decreased significantly in all three groups (P < 0.05) compared with baseline. Participants in the SPL50 group had a significantly higher success rate than those in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Serum potassium and creatinine levels showed no significant changes with treatment or between groups. A small number of participants in SPL25 and SPL50 reported mild and temporary TRAE, such as menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and dizziness.

- **Conclusion**: The combination of SPL 50 mg/day and topical BP proved to be effective.

### Winlevi [^116h7axu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Winlevi cream 1% applied twice daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two identically designed, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 [NCT02608450] and Trial 2 [NCT02608476]). These trials enrolled 1,440 subjects with facial acne vulgaris. Subjects aged 9 years or older with an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of moderate or severe facial acne vulgaris (score of 3 or 4), 30 to 75 inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) were included.

A total of 1,421 subjects aged 12 years and older were enrolled, with 641 (45%) between 12 to 17 years of age and 780 (55%) aged 18 years or older. Additionally, 62% of the subjects were female, and 91% were Caucasian. At baseline, subjects had a mean inflammatory lesion count of 42.4 and a mean non-inflammatory lesion count of 61.4. Approximately 83% of subjects had an IGA score of 3 ("moderate").

Efficacy was assessed at Week 12 by the proportion of subjects in each treatment group with at least a 2-point reduction in IGA compared to baseline and an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). The assessment also included absolute change and percent change from baseline in non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions. The IGA success rate and the mean absolute and percent reduction from baseline in acne lesion counts after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the study findings.

### Isotretinoin treatment of acne in a patient with Apert syndrome [^113SKcZa]. Pediatric Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-2) and is characterized by premature fusion of the cranial sutures and early epiphyseal closure. A characteristic feature in these patients is the development of widespread, severe, pustular acne around puberty. The FGFR-2 mutation associated with Apert syndrome has been described in localized nevoid acne lesions, attributed to somatic mosaicism. Isotretinoin has been reported as useful in controlling this acne. We report the successful treatment of acne with isotretinoin in a teenager with Apert syndrome and review the pathophysiology of acne in this syndrome.

### Improvement of adult female acne with a novel weekly oestradiol-loaded peel-off mask: a split-face placebo-controlled study [^113Fj5fk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Adult female acne (AFA) is characterized by a relapsing eruption of acne in women aged ≥ 25 years. It can be slower to respond to traditional adolescent acne treatments. Usually, androgens promote acne by stimulating sebum production, while oestrogens have the opposite effect by reducing sebum output when present in adequate quantities. Oestradiol is a female sex hormone that has its highest absolute serum levels and highest oestrogenic activity during the reproductive years. Peel-off facial masks have been suggested to intensify the effect of added active ingredients by forming an occlusive film after drying.

- **Objectives**: To study the safety and efficacy of weekly topical oestradiol 0.05% in the treatment of AFA.

- **Methods**: Twenty women with AFA were subjected to once-weekly application of an oestradiol 0.05% mask or placebo mask to either side of their face for 8 weeks. An acne lesion count was performed at baseline, at each visit, and 8 weeks post-treatment.

- **Results**: At the end of the treatment period, the treated side showed significant improvement in comedones, papules, and pustules. Although lesion counts increased 2 months post-treatment, they remained significantly less common on the oestradiol-treated side compared with the side of the face treated with placebo. No side-effects were reported. Limitations included the small number of patients studied and the short follow-up period. The oestradiol effect was not studied at the cellular or molecular levels.

- **Conclusions**: Topical oestradiol peel-off masks may be a promising convenient, safe, and effective treatment.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1141Hb1q]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acne vulgaris, specifically concerning microbiological testing, the AAD 2024 guidelines recommend considering obtaining lesion culture for the diagnosis of Gram-negative folliculitis in patients presenting with eruptive uniform pustules to nodules in periorificial areas. This recommendation is particularly relevant in the context of prolonged tetracycline treatment.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^116YWLAR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Only two RCTs conducted time courses with post-treatment follow-up. One found that improvement was maximal at month 3 (approximately 50% reduction vs. baseline), whereas the other showed that improvement continued until month 12, when the reduction was 89%. Both studies used 100 mg/day of spironolactone in combination with a COC. The former used triphasic levonorgestrel/EE, and the latter used cyproterone acetate/EE. In the follow-up phase, acne returned to baseline levels over 6 months in those treated with spironolactone plus levonorgestrel/EE. However, there was no relapse in those treated with cyproterone acetate/EE. The data for the spironolactone plus levonorgestrel/EE combination may be somewhat misleading as a non-validated scoring method, which combined acne with seborrhea and alopecia, was used. Neither study included a COC-only or spironolactone-only treatment arm, making it impossible to determine the contribution of spironolactone to the efficacy of the combination.

Two studies made apparently contradictory observations regarding the efficacy of spironolactone against comedonal (non-inflamed) lesions. One case series found that residual acne was more likely to be comedonal, whereas an RCT showed what appeared to be a large reduction in comedonal acne compared with baseline and the comparator. However, the lack of reporting of baseline data for the number of lesions in the RCT did not permit fair comparisons to be made. As only these two studies evaluated comedones, it is not possible to know whether spironolactone monotherapy is effective.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in an adult and adolescent female population [^113m3wck]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common dermatological condition typically associated with adolescents, affecting about 85% of young people. However, it is also prevalent and persistent into adulthood, particularly in females. The efficacy of tretinoin in acne is well documented with large pivotal studies. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed to provide an important alternative option to treat acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion were similar in adolescent (≥ 18 years) women with moderate-to-severe acne.

- **Methods**: A post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate or severe acne was conducted. Female subjects (aged 9 to 58 years, N = 909) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least a 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout.

- **Results**: At week 12, the mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts in female subjects was 56.9% and 51.7%, respectively, compared with 47.1% and 34.9% with vehicle (P < 0.001). Similar results were seen in adult and adolescent females regarding the reduction in inflammatory lesion counts with tretinoin 0.05% lotion.

### Pustular skin disorders: Diagnosis and treatment [^1122FT5t]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for pustular skin disorders is extensive. The distribution of the lesions and the age of the patient are characteristics that may provide strong clues to the etiology of cutaneous pustular eruptions. In adults, generalized pustular dermatoses include pustular psoriasis, Reiter's disease, and subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Medications can cause generalized pustular eruptions, such as in the case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis; or more localized reactions, such as acneiform drug eruptions, which usually involve the face, chest, and back.

Localized pustular eruptions are seen on the hands and feet in adults with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris and acrodermatitis continua (both of which may be variants of psoriasis); on the face in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea, and perioral dermatitis; and on the trunk and/or extremities in patients with folliculitis. A separate condition known as eosinophilic folliculitis occurs in individuals with advanced human immunodeficiency disease. Severely pruritic, sterile, eosinophilic pustules are found on the chest, proximal extremities, head, and neck. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E and eosinophilia are often concurrently found.

In neonates, it is especially important to make the correct diagnosis with respect to pustular skin disorders, since pustules can be a manifestation of sepsis or other serious infectious diseases. Generalized pustular eruptions in neonates include erythema toxicum neonatorum and transient neonatal pustular melanosis, both of which are non-infectious.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily dapsone gel, 7.5% for treatment of adolescents and adults with acne vulgaris: Second of two identically designed, large, multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials [^112XBjDS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dapsone gel, 5%, is administered twice daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and some patients may find adherence challenging. The study objective was to assess the efficacy and safety, compared with vehicle, of acne treatment with a recently FDA-approved, once-daily formulation of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with a 50% greater concentration of dapsone.

- **Methods**: This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter clinical trial enrolled patients aged 12 years and older with 20–50 facial inflammatory lesions, 30–100 facial noninflammatory lesions, and an acne grade of 3 (moderate) on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to topical dapsone gel, 7.5%, or vehicle once daily for 12 weeks. Investigators assessed GAAS success rate (proportion of patients with a GAAS of 0 or 1) and percent change from baseline in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total lesions.

- **Results**: The intent-to-treat population comprised 2238 patients (1118 in the dapsone gel, 7.5% group and 1120 in the vehicle group). The GAAS success rates were 29.8% for the dapsone gel, 7.5% group and 20.9% for the vehicle group (P < 0.001) at week 12. At week 12, mean inflammatory lesions decreased from baseline by 53.8% and 47.3%, noninflammatory lesions decreased by 45.9% and 40.4%, and total lesions decreased by 48.9% and 43.2% for the dapsone gel, 7.5% group and the vehicle group, respectively (all, P < 0.001). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar for dapsone gel, 7.5% (17.6%)…

### Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne [^113E4PhY]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions in children and adolescents. The presentation, differential diagnosis, and association of acne with systemic pathology differ by age of presentation. Acknowledged guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acne are lacking, and there are variations in management across the spectrum of primary and specialty care. The American Acne and Rosacea Society convened a panel of pediatric dermatologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists with expertise in acne to develop recommendations for the management of pediatric acne and evidence-based treatment algorithms.

- **Methods**: Ten major topic areas in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne were identified. A thorough literature search was performed, and articles were identified, reviewed, and assessed for evidence grading. Each topic area was assigned to two expert reviewers who developed and presented summaries and recommendations for critique and editing. Furthermore, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, including ratings for the strength of recommendation for a body of evidence, was used throughout for the consensus recommendations for the evaluation and management of pediatric acne. Practical evidence-based treatment algorithms also were developed.

- **Results**: Recommendations were put forth regarding the classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric acne, based on age and pubertal status. Treatment considerations include the use of over-the-counter products, topical benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, and topical antibiotics.

### Consensus on neonatal through preadolescent acne [^113TBS1i]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common dermatological disorder. Pediatric acne may be a manifestation of underlying pathology and can occur in the first weeks, months, or years of life. Acne in childhood can be categorized by age and pubertal status.

- **Objective**: An expert panel of pediatric dermatologists and dermatologists developed a consensus paper on neonatal through preadolescent acne, providing information on differential diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and maintenance of the condition.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review explored present clinical guidelines, treatment options, and therapeutic approaches addressing neonatal through preadolescent acne. The information from the literature searches was used together with the panel's expert opinion and experience to adopt consensus statements following established standards.

- **Results**: The panel members reached unanimous consensus on seven statements addressing the various age categories of pediatric acne: neonatal acne (birth to ≤ 8 weeks), infantile acne (8 weeks to ≤ 1 year), mid-childhood acne (1 year to < 7 years), preadolescent acne (≥ 7 to 12 years), and adolescent acne (≥ 12 to 19 years or after menarche for girls). Health care providers treating children need to pay more attention to pediatric acne and should monitor the risk of endocrine-associated abnormalities, especially in mid-childhood acne. When prescribing acne treatment, newer medications approved for use in children older than nine years of age may offer a suitable option.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^116WCbmE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals, and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

- **Search strategy**: Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms, and study-type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019 and reruns were performed in May 2020 [Appendix S1; see Supporting Information].

- **Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta-analysis**: A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical, and combined treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100) and is provided in full in Appendix S2 [see Supporting Information].

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne, or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe cases.

### Adolescent acne vulgaris: current and emerging treatments [^1132g3WX]. The Lancet. Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases worldwide, affecting all ethnicities and races, with peak prevalence between ages 15 and 20 years. The burden of this condition, along with its clinical and psychological sequelae, is substantial. The visual appearance of acne and its sequelae, including scarring and pigment changes, frequently result in psychological and social morbidity due to concerns about appearance. As understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved, approaches to achieving optimal outcomes with effective treatment regimens continue to emerge.

In the past few years, several novel therapeutics have been developed, including new agents aimed at reducing antimicrobial resistance and products with specific actions targeting retinoid as well as androgen receptors. This review considers the management approaches for adolescents with acne vulgaris, reviewing treatment options from the evidence base and international expert opinion. Approaches to selecting treatments, including novel and emerging treatment regimens, are discussed.

### Acne: Effect of hormones on pathogenesis and management [^114nucc2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

In the pathogenesis of acne, androgen hormones play a crucial role. In the treatment of acne, hormonal therapies provide valuable alternatives to standard modalities in selected women. Although numerous factors contribute to the development of acne, the requirement for androgens is absolute and is one that allows for effective treatments in women through inhibition of androgen expression.

The two prerequisites for androgen expression at the level of the pilosebaceous unit are the presence of androgen in the form of either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone and functioning androgen receptors. A third component may be the metabolism of androgen precursors to active androgens within pilosebaceous units. Hormonal treatment of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, androgenetic alopecia), such as that seen in polycystic ovary syndrome, centers on reduction of circulating androgen levels as well as androgen receptor blockade.

Combination oral contraceptives represent the primary treatment modality for reducing circulating androgens from ovarian and, to a lesser degree, adrenal sources. Newer formulations may also have clinically significant androgen receptor blocking and 5alpha-reductase inhibiting effects. These newer oral contraceptives have high safety profiles and are used widely internationally for this purpose. Androgen receptor blockers currently in use include spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and flutamide. Androgen receptor blockers are frequently combined with oral contraceptives to achieve optimal results in selected women.

In women with adrenal hyperplasia, low-dose corticosteroids are also considered in management strategies.

### Acne vulgaris: Diagnosis and treatment [^117NjgBe]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acne vulgaris, specifically concerning hormonal agents, the AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the offer of combined oral contraceptives for menarchal females who are unresponsive or intolerant to past therapies, who experience a temporal association of acne outbreaks with menses, or who exhibit signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as acne, hirsutism, and oligomenorrhea.

### Optimizing the trial design for a comparative effectiveness study of spironolactone versus oral antibiotics for women with acne: A Delphi consensus panel [^113VSipv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

For women with acne, the condition often persists into adulthood, with over 50% of women reporting acne between 20–29 years of age and over 35% between 30–39 years of age. While mild acne can usually be managed with topical medications, moderate to severe acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, spironolactone, and isotretinoin. Although oral antibiotics are the most common systemic medication prescribed for women with moderate to severe acne, spironolactone may represent a safe and effective therapeutic alternative that can decrease our reliance on oral antibiotics for the treatment of acne. However, while spironolactone use is increasing, oral antibiotics are still prescribed 3 to 5 times more often than spironolactone.

### Acneiform eruptions [^116mmujN]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Is it acne or is it not? When this question arises, we can presume that we have crossed the boundaries of "acneiform eruptions" of the face. Although acne may be considered a condition fairly easy to diagnose, it is not rare for the practicing dermatologist or the general physician to wonder when faced with an acneiform eruption before establishing a diagnosis.

In this review, we address facial acneiform eruptions in children and adults, including perioral dermatitis, granulomatous periorificial dermatitis, nevus comedonicus, acne cosmetica, rosacea, demodicosis, folliculitis, acneiform presentation of cutaneous lymphomas, and drug-induced acneiform eruptions, such as those caused by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and steroids, along with their diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.

The major distinguishing factor in acneiform eruptions is that, in contrast to acne, there are no comedones (whiteheads or blackheads).

### European evidence-based (S3) guideline for the treatment of acne - update 2016 - short version [^1176kFJD]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acne vulgaris, particularly concerning systemic retinoids, the EDF 2016 guidelines recommend offering oral isotretinoin monotherapy for at least six months, extending longer if there is an inadequate response. This is suggested for patients with severe papulopustular acne, moderate-to-severe nodular acne, or conglobate acne. The dosing is specified at 0.3–0.5 mg/kg for severe papulopustular or moderate nodular acne, and ≥ 0.5 mg/kg for conglobate acne.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^113eXryf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic conditions globally. Unlike our knowledge regarding the heritable nature of acne and the role of hormones in acne pathogenesis, there is uncertainty regarding the role of environmental factors, including diet, in acne.

The development of acne in some populations after the adoption of a Western diet suggests that this diet plays a role in acne. Certain populations historically did not have acne: the Canadian Inuit, South African Zulus, Japanese Okinawans, Aché of Paraguay, and Kitavan islanders of Papua New Guinea. The appearance of acne in these groups has been attributed to their acceptance of Western diets, including processed foods, dairy, and refined sugars. Acne is also absent in adolescents with Laron syndrome, a hereditary dwarfism disorder resulting from insensitivity to growth hormone. However, some develop acne if treated with insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Acne resolves when IGF-1 dosing is reduced or discontinued.

Here, we examine how diet may influence acne pathogenesis, persistence, and treatment. To perform the literature search for this review, PubMed and MEDLINE were queried with combinations of search terms including but not limited to the following: isotretinoin, diet and acne, glycemic index (GI) and acne, dairy and acne, and acne pathophysiology. A review of search results was performed for dates from 1977 to 2020, and relevant articles were selected. Given the limited number of studies available, clinical studies and review articles were included if they co…

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^117Wfc5r]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The protocol for this review was published in PROSPERO with the accession number 42016038496.

- **Search strategies**: Electronic searches were conducted between May 10 and 15, 2016, and included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and LILACS. The search strategy for MEDLINE and EMBASE is shown in Appendix 1 (electronic supplementary material). The following trials registers were also searched using the terms spironolactone AND acne or polycystic ovarian syndrome: meta Register of Controlled Trials; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the EU Clinical Trials Register.

The reference lists of all identified RCTs and key review articles were checked for citations to potentially relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied.

Outputs of searches were imported into Rayyan to facilitate sorting, and full-text copies of all potentially eligible studies were obtained. Two authors (AE and ZF) independently assessed the full-text papers and resolved any disagreements on the eligibility of included studies through discussion and consensus, or through a third party (EvZ).

- **Inclusion criteria**: We included RCTs in females of any ethnicity over 18 years of age with acne vulgaris of the face and/or trunk, or PCOS if acne status or severity was measured as an outcome. Case series were included if they provided supplementary evidence on the benefits or side effects.

### Acne: Topical treatment [^115nRpza]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease, affecting approximately 70–80% of adolescents and young adults. It is a multifactorial disease of the pilosebaceous unit. The influence of androgens at the onset of adolescence leads to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland and an increase in sebum production.

Additional increased proliferation and altered differentiation of the follicular epithelium eventually block the pilosebaceous duct, leading to the development of the microcomedo as the primary acne lesion. Concomitantly and subsequently, colonization with Propionibacterium acnes increases, followed by the induction of inflammatory reactions from bacteria, ductal corneocytes, and sebaceous proinflammatory agents.

### Acne through the ages: Case-based observations through childhood and adolescence [^116PHysh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common disorder affecting more than 17 million individuals in the United States. Knowledge of the disease is an important part of clinical practice, particularly for the pediatric practitioner. Contrary to common belief, acne is not a disease limited to adolescents and young adults but can occur at any stage of life. This article is a case-based review of acne during childhood and adolescence. Workup is based on age and physical findings, whereas therapy depends on the type of skin lesions along with patient characteristics and preferences.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^116XzeZJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The study selection process identified 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 18 case series where acne severity was an outcome, alongside three articles discussing the side effects of spironolactone without including clinical outcomes. Eleven studies were deemed out of scope, and five were unobtainable (see Electronic Supplementary Table 2).

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**:
	- All 10 RCTs were single-center studies conducted in Canada (1), the UK (2), India (3), Bangladesh (1), Thailand (1), Israel (1), and China (1). Baseline acne severity, ranging from mild to severe, was unreported in four trials. Seven trials reported acne-affected sites, always including the face. Of the four trials that involved males, two provided separate results for females. Funding was not discussed in six trials, while one was financed by a spironolactone manufacturer, two by non-industrial sponsors, and one reported no pharmaceutical support. The active and placebo treatments were supplied by a spironolactone manufacturer in two trials. Declarations of no conflicts of interest were made in two trials. For further details, see Table 1.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^112J9tFp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Side effects reported in RCTs and case series**: None of the studies provided a clear statement on how information regarding side effects was obtained, such as spontaneous reporting versus an open-ended question at each visit. In the RCTs, there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who dropped out due to side effects: 14/303 (4.6%) receiving spironolactone at any dose versus 10/343 (2.9%) receiving the comparators (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71–3.52; p = 0.26). Dropout rates due to side effects were not calculated for two trials. In the case series, 49/729 (6.7%) women dropped out due to spironolactone side effects (ITT population), which was not significantly different from the rate in the RCTs (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39–1.23; p = 0.20).

Due to inadequate reporting in 8 out of 10 RCTs, the proportion of women experiencing any side effects could not be determined. In the case series, at least 241 women experienced side effects, equivalent to 48.0% of the PP and 43.9% of the ITT population. Reported rates varied from 0 to 90.7%, with the highest rates associated with the 200 mg/day dose. The most common side effect in both the RCTs and case series was menstrual irregularities: 38/264 (14.4%) in the RCTs and 216/543 (39.8%) in the case series (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26–0.49; p < 0.00001). From the case series, these disturbances were dose-related, with 137/176 women receiving 200 mg/day experiencing menstrual disturbances compared with 66/349 on lower daily doses (RR 4.12, 95% CI 3.27–5.19; p < 0.00001).

### Challenges in adult acne and the role of skin care in managing the condition [^114aamXd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a complex, multifactorial, inflammatory skin condition. Although frequently presented at dermatology clinics, the literature on adult acne is scarce, particularly concerning skin barrier function and management. We aimed to provide insights into the role of skin barrier integrity in adult acne patients and the role of cleansers and moisturizers as adjunctive to treating and maintaining adult acne.

- **Methods**: A panel of eight dermatologists who treat adult patients with acne developed a consensus paper on the role of skin barrier function and skin care in adult acne management. The modified Delphi method comprised a face-to-face meeting and online follow-up to discuss the results of a scoping literature review. Drawing from their experience and opinions, they agreed on seven consensus statements.

- **Results**: Epidermal barrier dysfunction plays a vital role in acne pathogenesis and asymmetrically impacts adult female acne. Erythema, pruritus, peeling, and xerosis are common adverse effects of first-line acne treatment options and, if not appropriately counseled and managed, can exacerbate, leading to regimen nonadherence and poor patient experience and outcomes.

Improving patient knowledge of comprehensive acne treatments — including quality adjunctive cleansers and moisturizers — may maximize regimen efficacy and provide patients with personalized and successful acne treatment and maintenance tools.

### Post-adolescent acne in women: more common and more clinical considerations [^116b7PkU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that post-adolescent acne in women is on the rise. Acne in this subgroup of patients commonly follows a specific pattern that can often be treatment-resistant and/or prone to relapse, including after oral isotretinoin therapy. With a plethora of medications to choose from for acne treatment, many of which have been used in the past by patients without success, dermatology practitioners often find oral contraceptives and spironolactone to be beneficial in otherwise healthy adult females.

Hormonal anomalies such as polycystic ovarian syndrome or other underlying endocrine disorders should also be appropriately worked up by the clinician and managed accordingly. This article reviews some of the underlying pathophysiological factors, available treatment options, and screening guidelines to assist clinicians in the management of acne in adult females.

### Pediatric acne: Clinical presentations, evaluation, and management [^111UpEud]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris can be easy to diagnose yet difficult to evaluate and manage, especially when it presents in infancy and childhood. The differential diagnosis of acne varies by age and, in some cases, may warrant a work-up to rule out underlying systemic abnormalities. Likewise, treatment strategies can be influenced by the patient's age. In this article, we present an overview of the clinical presentations of acne by age, an approach to patient evaluation, and a general strategy for the management of this common and important disease.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne fulminans and its variants [^111JzB3J]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acne fulminans (AF) is a severe variant of inflammatory acne. It typically manifests as an explosive worsening and ulceration of skin lesions and can be associated with systemic symptoms. However, there is a paucity of evidence-based information and no clear guidelines concerning the classification and treatment of AF.

- **Objective**: To better define the spectrum of AF and its variants, devise optimal therapeutic approaches, and identify areas of future research.

- **Methods**: A panel of physicians with expertise in severe acne vulgaris was convened following a comprehensive literature review of severe acne variants. Priority topics were reviewed and presented by each panelist at a 5-hour conference. Following review of the audiotape and scribed notes from the conference, surveys were utilized to address points of controversy and to clarify consensus recommendations.

- **Results**: Appropriate clinical case presentations and consensus survey questions were utilized to create final recommendations based on both the literature and the expert consensus.

- **Limitations**: Limited evidence-based data and prospective studies in the literature concerning the treatment of AF is available.

- **Conclusion**: These guidelines better characterize AF and provide health care practitioners approaches to the classification, treatment, and prevention of AF and its variants.

### Effects of diet on acne and its response to treatment [^1138iLyN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Demographics of patients with acne**: Acne prevalence is estimated to be 9.4% worldwide. Prevalence is highest in adolescents and young adults and decreases with age beyond 30 years. After teenage years, acne remains more common in women than men, occurring in approximately one-half of women in their 20s, one-third in their 30s, and one-quarter in their 40s.

	- In the United States, acne is the most common condition presenting to dermatologists. Despite greater numbers of teenage boys than girls with acne, almost two-thirds of dermatology visits due to acne are attended by female individuals. Approximately two-thirds of visits are made by patients younger than 25 years of age, with the mean age of those seeking treatment being 24 years. Children as young as 6 years of age may be prescribed acne treatment. Acne medications are most often prescribed for those aged 12–14 years.

### Tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate and severe acne vulgaris in females: Effect of age on efficacy and tolerability [^112u2JKU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

While it is generally considered a disease of adolescence, acne affects an increasing number of adults, especially women. Although data exist on the use of retinoids in adult females, there is no universal agreement on the age of onset of adult female acne, or data on efficacy and tolerability dependent on age. A novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion formulation has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in acne patients with moderate or severe disease.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion in women with moderate or severe acne categorized into different age groups (13–19, 20–29, and 30+ years).

- **Methods**: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Women (aged 13–19 years, N = 357; 20–29 years, N = 352; 30+ years, N = 156) with moderate or severe acne were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and 'clear'/'almost clear') and Quality of Life (QoL) using the validated Acne-QoL questionnaire. Safety and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout; cutaneous tolerability was assessed at each study visit using a 4-point scale (where 0 = none and 3 = severe).

- **Results**: At baseline, 91.9% (N = 794) of women in the post hoc analysis had moderate (EGSS = 3) and 8.1% (N = 70) severe (EGSS = 4) acne.
