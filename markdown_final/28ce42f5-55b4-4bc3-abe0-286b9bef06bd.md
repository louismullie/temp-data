## Question

Is alkaline phosphatase elevated in cholecystitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alkaline phosphatase is elevated in cholecystitis and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions and what the major guidelines actually recommend obtaining and why. Then, I should verify how often ALP is elevated in uncomplicated cholecystitis versus when common bile duct stones are present. Next, I will examine the predictive value and thresholds for ALP in risk stratification, followed by the pathophysiology that explains these patterns. After that, I need to distinguish ALP patterns in primary cholestatic liver diseases to avoid misattribution. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-based interpretation and note pitfalls where a normal or mildly elevated ALP can mislead us, anchoring the approach in WSES and Tokyo guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and the role of ALP in the initial workup. Acute calculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation usually from cystic duct obstruction, whereas choledocholithiasis refers to stones in the common bile duct causing varying degrees of cholestasis; ALP is a cholestatic enzyme that rises with impaired bile flow or biliary epithelial injury, but its utility differs between these conditions [^117MpALN]. I should confirm that contemporary guidelines recommend measuring ALP with other LFTs in all suspected ACC to assess the risk of choledocholithiasis, not to diagnose ACC itself, which still relies on clinical findings plus imaging per Tokyo criteria, and on ultrasound to look for CBD dilation or stones as part of initial risk assessment [^114gKpDj] [^115RE54j] [^111Dzo9D].

> Wait, let me verify the cautionary notes from guidelines before jumping to conclusions about any single lab. The WSES 2020 panel explicitly warns against relying on elevated LFTs, including ALP or bilirubin, as the sole method to identify common bile duct stones in ACC, recommending further diagnostic testing when suspicion exists; this is echoed across multiple sections and reinforces that LFTs are adjuncts, not stand-alone diagnostics for CBD stones [^112RxuPA] [^notfound] [^117TB6w6]. I should also confirm that an enlarged CBD on ultrasound is only an indirect sign and still mandates second-level testing when present, aligning with an algorithm that moves to MRCP, EUS, or IOC depending on risk tier and local expertise [^111HNmJg] [^116yRz7a].

> Next, I should review how often ALP is elevated in uncomplicated ACC without ductal stones, because overcalling obstruction based solely on ALP is a common pitfall. The 2016 WSES guideline synthesis reports that 15% to 50% of ACC patients have elevated liver enzymes without choledocholithiasis, and specifically that approximately 30% can have abnormal ALP and or bilirubin despite no CBD stones, underscoring nonobstructive inflammatory cholestasis in ACC itself [^112Bus4P]. Let me consider corroborating observational data: in a cohort of 424 ACC patients selected for abnormal LFTs, a substantial proportion had no CBD stones despite enzyme elevations, with metabolic comorbidity such as fatty liver contributing to abnormal profiles, which reinforces the nonspecificity of mild ALP elevations in ACC [^114gGaRR].

> I will now examine ALP's predictive value when CBD stones complicate ACC. On logistic regression, ALP above the upper limit of normal independently predicted choledocholithiasis with an odds ratio around 4, though specificity remained modest and overall risk modeling benefited from imaging features such as a dilated CBD on ultrasound, which had a higher odds ratio than ALP alone [^114JdLHF]. Hold on, I should double-check head-to-head LFT performance: in an emergency series, GGT outperformed other LFTs for predicting CBD stones, with better operating characteristics than ALP, albeit still yielding only moderate specificity and limited positive predictive value, which again argues for composite risk assessment rather than single-test decisions [^111MrViD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated ALP's diagnostic power; the WSES group notes that across studies the PPV of any abnormal LFT in this setting hovers around 15%, and a Cochrane review highlights the uncertainty of LFT accuracy against surgical or endoscopic gold standards, so ALP alone cannot safely triage to ERCP without confirmatory imaging [^112RxuPA].

> Let me think about thresholds and magnitude, because degree often refines pretest risk. A meta-analytic summary cited by WSES suggests that at modest cutoffs, ALP can be sensitive albeit nonspecific, whereas at higher cutoffs, sensitivity drops and specificity rises substantially; for instance, ALP greater than twice the upper limit of normal carries high specificity but low sensitivity, which is clinically useful to raise suspicion for obstruction when markedly elevated but unsafe to rule out stones when normal or only mildly elevated [^111MrViD]. I should confirm that rising bilirubin, particularly to higher thresholds, behaves similarly with trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, supporting the use of tiered algorithms rather than binary rules [^111MrViD].

> Now, I need to ensure the pathophysiology aligns with these patterns. In obstructive cholestasis from CBD stones, cholangiocyte ALP induction and impaired bile flow drive higher and more sustained ALP elevations, whereas in severe gallbladder inflammation without ductal obstruction, transient pressure effects or local inflammatory mediators can cause milder, variable ALP elevations that resolve as the acute cholecystitis is treated [^117MpALN]. But wait, what if we are very early in the course of obstruction; I should review temporal dynamics: early choledocholithiasis can present with sharp transaminase surges while ALP lags or remains unchanged initially, which means a normal ALP soon after pain onset does not exclude CBD stones and underscores the value of repeat testing and imaging if suspicion persists [^116C5SjS].

> I should confirm how to distinguish these biliary patterns from primary cholestatic diseases where ALP is a hallmark and often substantially elevated. In PBC, ALP reduction is an established treatment target and values frequently exceed two times the upper limit of normal, while in PSC, ALP is commonly elevated but fluctuates within individuals over time, which is very different from the typically modest and reactive ALP changes seen in straightforward ACC without obstruction [^117MPwoL] [^113zTGZL]. Hold on, I should verify hepatic origin when ALP is isolated; GGT helps confirm a hepatobiliary source and avoids misattributing bone-derived ALP elevations, preventing diagnostic detours in patients with nonhepatic causes of elevated ALP [^115eFu7U] [^116jVVbP].

> Let me reconsider a possible misinterpretation I almost made: I initially thought a normal ALP might effectively rule out CBD stones, but that overstates its negative predictive value; WSES notes that while overall normal LFT panels can carry high NPV, this does not translate to using ALP alone to exclude stones, and early presentations can be falsely reassuring, so I should not anchor on a single normal ALP in a patient with concerning clinical or imaging features [^112Bus4P] [^112RxuPA] [^116C5SjS]. I need to ensure that if clinical risk remains intermediate, the patient proceeds to MRCP or EUS rather than to immediate ERCP or to unqualified discharge, consistent with risk-tiered strategies endorsed by surgical and endoscopic societies [^116yRz7a] [^114gKpDj].

> Synthesis and practical takeaways: ALP is not universally elevated in ACC, and mild or transient elevations can occur without CBD stones due to inflammatory cholestasis, so normal ALP does not exclude ACC or choledocholithiasis; conversely, marked ALP elevations, especially greater than twice the upper limit of normal, should heighten suspicion for ductal obstruction and prompt confirmatory imaging rather than reflex ERCP, interpreted alongside bilirubin, GGT, transaminases, ultrasound findings, and the clinical picture including jaundice and cholangitis features [^112Bus4P] [^111MrViD] [^114gKpDj] [^111MrViD]. I should double-check that this aligns with modern care pathways: WSES recommends obtaining ALP with other LFTs in all ACC presentations to stratify choledocholithiasis risk, cautions against using LFTs in isolation to diagnose stones, and directs intermediate-risk patients to MRCP or EUS while reserving ERCP for high-risk profiles or positive second-level tests, which ties the laboratory signal to an imaging-confirmed diagnosis before invasive therapy [^115RE54j] [^112RxuPA] [^116yRz7a].

Yes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is often elevated in cholecystitis, but the elevation is typically **mild to moderate** and not specific to cholecystitis alone. ALP rises due to biliary epithelial inflammation and cholestasis from cystic duct obstruction [^113bNUia], but higher levels suggest **choledocholithiasis or cholangitis** [^111v6obo] [^1177QuKY] rather than isolated cholecystitis. ALP should be interpreted with other liver tests and imaging [^117MpALN], as it is neither sensitive nor specific for cholecystitis [^1114f7Hp].

---

## Pathophysiology of ALP elevation in cholecystitis

ALP is produced by biliary epithelium and rises with cholestasis or biliary inflammation. In cholecystitis, cystic duct obstruction causes gallbladder inflammation and edema, leading to **biliary epithelial injury** and cholestasis, which increases ALP [^117MpALN].

---

## Frequency and magnitude of ALP elevation in cholecystitis

ALP elevation is common but usually **mild to moderate** (1–3× ULN) in cholecystitis. Marked elevations (> 3× ULN) are uncommon and suggest additional biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^111MrViD]. Regarding **frequency**, ALP is elevated in ~30% of acute calculous cholecystitis without choledocholithiasis [^112Bus4P]. The **magnitude** is typically mild to moderate, with marked elevations uncommon without CBD obstruction.

---

## Clinical significance of ALP elevation in cholecystitis

ALP elevation indicates biliary inflammation or cholestasis but is **nonspecific** and can occur in many hepatobiliary and non-hepatic conditions [^115eFu7U]. In cholecystitis, ALP elevation alone does not confirm the diagnosis and must be interpreted with other tests and imaging [^111pmgwj].

---

## Diagnostic utility of ALP in cholecystitis

ALP has limited diagnostic utility for cholecystitis because of its **low specificity** and sensitivity [^112RxuPA], and it is most useful when combined with other liver tests (ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin) and imaging (ultrasound, MRCP, ERCP) [^116A5Ru9] to assess for choledocholithiasis or cholangitis. The **sensitivity** is low — many patients have normal ALP — and **specificity** is also low, as elevated ALP occurs in many conditions [^112Bus4P].

---

## Differentiating cholecystitis from other hepatobiliary conditions

ALP elevation alone **cannot reliably distinguish** cholecystitis from other hepatobiliary conditions [^114jxnHw]. Additional tests and imaging are needed to differentiate cholecystitis from [^111Dzo9D]:

- **Choledocholithiasis**: CBD stones causing obstruction.
- **Cholangitis**: Biliary infection with obstruction.
- **Hepatitis**: Hepatocellular injury.
- **Pancreatitis**: Pancreatic inflammation.
- **Malignancy**: Biliary or hepatic tumors [^117MpALN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend obtaining ALP with other liver tests in suspected cholecystitis to assess for choledocholithiasis or cholangitis, but emphasize that **elevated ALP alone** is insufficient for diagnosis and that further imaging is required [^115RE54j] [^111HNmJg].

---

## Summary table: ALP elevation in cholecystitis

| **Parameter** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Frequency | ~30% without choledocholithiasis [^112Bus4P] |
| Magnitude | Mild to moderate (1–3× ULN) |
| Diagnostic utility | - Limited <br/> - Low sensitivity and specificity |
| Clinical significance | Indicates biliary inflammation/cholestasis |
| Guidelines | - Obtain ALP with other tests <br/> - Do not rely on ALP alone [^114gKpDj] [^1177QuKY] |

---

ALP is often elevated in cholecystitis due to biliary inflammation and cholestasis [^113bNUia], but the rise is usually mild to moderate and **nonspecific** [^117MpALN]. Marked elevations suggest additional obstruction or cholangitis [^111MrViD], and ALP should be interpreted with other tests and imaging to guide diagnosis and management [^112RxuPA].

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^117MPwoL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

It is becoming increasingly clear that our goal in treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is evolving to target greater reductions in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin than what was recommended in the past. It is our opinion that the goal after adding a second-line therapy for PBC is to achieve the lowest ALP level possible. We recommend that ALP response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) be assessed 6–12 months after UDCA initiation and that the second-line therapy be considered (see the following section, Up-to-date PBC algorithm). It is also important to apply proper medical judgment and consider other factors when adding a second-line therapy.

For instance, exposing an older patient with stage I disease and an ALP of 150 U/L to a second or third drug knowing that it will not alter their clinical course but will lower their ALP would not be the best approach. Given the recent restriction established on the use of obeticholic acid (OCA) in patients with advanced cirrhosis, it is also important to restage the liver disease and carefully evaluate for signs of portal hypertension before starting OCA. Finally, it seems likely that our treatment goals in PBC will evolve over time to achieve complete biochemical remission, characterized by normal or near-normal ALP and bilirubin levels.

### Role of liver function tests in predicting common bile duct stones in acute calculous cholecystitis [^111v6obo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The role of liver function tests (LFTs) in evaluating common bile duct (CBD) stones in patients with cholelithiasis has been studied widely. However, it is not clear whether these predictive models are useful in inflammatory gallstone disease.

- **Methods**: A review was undertaken of 385 consecutive patients admitted as an emergency for acute calculous gallbladder disease. The diagnosis of calculous cholecystitis was confirmed by ultrasonography or histological confirmation of acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. Patients with obvious jaundice, defined as a bilirubin level above 80 micromol/l, and gallstone pancreatitis were excluded.

- **Results**: Some 216 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 (13.0 percent) were found to have CBD stones. LFT results were not significantly different in patients with chronic, acute, or complicated acute cholecystitis. Using several cut-off levels, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) had the highest specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, comparable to a scoring system that combined all LFTs. Bilirubin was the least specific and predictive. A cut-off point for GGT at 90 units/l produced a sensitivity of 86 percent (24 of 28), specificity of 74.5 percent (140 of 188), and positive and negative predictive values of 33 percent (24 of 72) and 97.2 percent (140 of 144) respectively. This represented a one in three chance of CBD stones when the GGT level was above 90 units/l and a one in 30 chance when the level was less than 90 units/l.

- **Conclusion**: Selection criteria based on GGT can be helpful in the prediction of CBD stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^111g4yEa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phosphatase, we conducted a study at Brooke Army Medical Center.

NAFLD is a common referral to gastroenterologists and hepatologists. We have observed a subset of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD presenting with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase, rather than the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

A review of the liver biopsy database was performed, focusing on the key identifiers "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were divided into two groups: those with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), and those with typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated, with 135 biopsies included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients, while group 2 included 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, patients with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). Histopathological analysis showed that patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female compared to group 2 (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than patients in group 2 (P = 0.001). Five of the seven patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions suggest that older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated further.

### Choledocholithiasis in acute calculous cholecystitis: Guidelines and beyond [^114JdLHF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

On univariate analysis, we found that elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, dilated common bile duct (CBD) on ultrasound (US), CBD stone on US, and acute biliary pancreatitis were significant risk factors for choledocholithiasis in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) (P < 0.05). On logistic regression analysis using a forward conditional method, ALP elevated above the upper limit of normal (P = 0.003; odds ratio [OR] 4.26, 95%CI 1.66–10.96) and dilated CBD on US (P = 0.001; OR 9.97, 95%CI 4.65–21.36) were independent positive predictors for choledocholithiasis, while acute biliary pancreatitis was an independent negative predictor (P = 0.030; OR 0.36, 95%CI 0.14–0.91).

The predictive score was calculated by allotting +1 for each positive predictor and -1 for each negative predictor, giving a range from -1 to +2. Using ≥ 1 as a cutoff, sensitivity and specificity for predicting choledocholithiasis were 95.24% (95%CI 86.71–99.01) and 51.82% (95%CI 42.09–61.45), respectively. When the score was -1 or 0, 95% of patients did not have choledocholithiasis. When the score was 1, 28 out of 68 (41.17%) had choledocholithiasis, and when the score was 2, 32 out of 45 (71.11%) had choledocholithiasis.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^116RPvTv]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The CFF recommends that individuals with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) and advanced liver disease undergo a liver-specific physical examination and measurement of AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, conjugated (or direct) bilirubin, albumin, platelets, and international normalized ratio (INR) at least every 6 months to detect the progression of liver disease.

Elevations of AST and ALT are observed during hepatocellular inflammation, while GGT elevation occurs during cholestasis or biliary inflammation. GGT elevation has been associated with the presence of cystic fibrosis hepatobiliary involvement (CFHBI) or progression to advanced cystic fibrosis liver disease (aCFLD). Elevated conjugated bilirubin may occur in aCFLD with significant hepatocellular destruction. Albumin and INR are markers of liver synthetic function. Previous studies have not specifically evaluated the utility of monitoring albumin and INR to detect the progression of hepatobiliary disease in cystic fibrosis. However, in the presence of aCFLD, understanding liver synthetic function is essential for evaluating the progression of liver disease and the risk for comorbidities such as ascites or variceal bleeding. Low or decreasing platelets over time may indicate the development or progression of portal hypertension, regardless of the absolute value. aCFLD is generally a slowly progressive disease for which twice-yearly evaluation of inflammation, cholestasis, liver function, and progression of portal hypertension allows earlier recognition of changes in those PwCF who have already been identified to have aCFLD.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rxoB9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Overall, the ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have similar performances and limitations, with only minor differences in how they balance between sensitivity and specificity. Both perform better than the ASGE 2010 guidelines, but neither is clearly superior, as indicated by similar AUCs. In clinical practice, the main value of the guidelines lies in their ability to rule out choledocholithiasis (CBDS). For example, patients without any ASGE 2019 criteria (i.e. abnormal liver function, CBD > 6 mm, age > 55) have a very low rate of CBDS and can proceed to cholecystectomy without additional workup. However, the guidelines have only modest specificity when identifying patients at high risk for CBDS. Although the guidelines can help limit ERCP to a smaller group of patients if used as intended, the nontherapeutic ERCP rate is still arguably too high, resulting in an undesirable number of nontherapeutic ERCPs with associated risks of ERCP-related complications such as pancreatitis or perforation. A more refined strategy is therefore indicated.

With all guidelines, a substantial proportion of patients are expected to fall into the intermediate risk category. However, a debate remains on how these patients are best managed. Although much research effort has focused on comparing MRCP and EUS in this patient group, both ASGE and ESGE expert panels have deemed the evidence to be of low to moderate quality only, citing a lack of data on cost-effectiveness and other logistical considerations. To optimize the management of these patients, further research in these deficient areas is required.

### Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones [^116A5Ru9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound and liver function tests, including serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase, are used as screening tests for diagnosing common bile duct stones in individuals suspected of having these stones. Notably, there has been no systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests.

- **Objectives**: To determine and compare the accuracy of ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosing common bile duct stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to September 2012. Additionally, we reviewed the references of included studies to identify further studies. Systematic reviews were sourced from various databases such as the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, Medion, and ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility). We imposed no restrictions based on language, publication status, or the method of data collection — both prospective and retrospective data were considered.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies that provided the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for ultrasound, serum bilirubin, or serum alkaline phosphatase. Studies were accepted only if the presence of common bile duct stones was confirmed by extraction (via surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive test result, and their absence confirmed by surgical or endoscopic exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months for a negative test result.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^117XpUm1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300 U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalized with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver, but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction.

Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### Flecainide acetate [^115Ky4qS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been rare reports of isolated elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and serum transaminase levels. These elevations have been asymptomatic, and no cause-and-effect relationship with flecainide acetate has been established. In foreign postmarketing surveillance studies, there have been rare reports of hepatic dysfunction, including cholestasis and hepatic failure, and extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias. Although no cause-and-effect relationship has been established, it is advisable to discontinue flecainide acetate in patients who develop unexplained jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction or blood dyscrasias to eliminate flecainide acetate as the possible causative agent.

Incidence figures for other adverse effects in patients with ventricular arrhythmias are based on a multicenter efficacy study, utilizing starting doses of 200 mg/day with gradual upward titration to 400 mg/day. Patients were treated for an average of 4.7 months, with some receiving up to 22 months of therapy. In this trial, 5.4% of patients discontinued due to non-cardiac adverse effects.

The following additional adverse experiences, possibly related to flecainide acetate therapy and occurring in 1% to less than 3% of patients, have been reported in acute and chronic studies:

- **Body as a whole**: Malaise, fever
- **Cardiovascular**: Tachycardia, sinus pause or arrest
- **Gastrointestinal**: Vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, anorexia
- **Skin**: Rash
- **Visual**: Diplopia
- **Nervous system**: Hypoesthesia, paresthesia, paresis, ataxia, flushing, increased sweating

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In response to abnormal liver blood tests, outcomes and pathways should be carefully considered. As indicated in figure 1, the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes, it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to identify the cause. Liver enzymes can be raised due to intercurrent illness; however, repeated tests show that 84% remained abnormal after one month, and 75% remained abnormal even after two years. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests, it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests. Instead, the cause should be determined unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion for a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a pediatrician, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, presenting a wider differential diagnosis.

- **Response to abnormal liver blood tests**: Figure 1 details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure, and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine the choice of pathway.

### Inter- and intra-individual variation, and limited prognostic utility, of serum alkaline phosphatase in a trial of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113zTGZL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score are used as endpoints in trials of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We aimed to quantify inter- and intra-individual variation in levels of ALP and the ELF score over time and evaluated their association with fibrosis progression.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from 234 patients with large-duct PSC enrolled in a 2-year, phase 2b placebo-controlled trial of simtuzumab. Participants were assessed by laboratory tests every 4 weeks, and liver biopsies were collected at the time of screening, week 48, and week 96.

- **Results**: Serum levels of ALP and ELF scores did not differ significantly between simtuzumab and placebo groups, so the data were pooled. Median per-patient variations in ALP between clinic visits were approximately 12% over 12 weeks, 20% over 48 weeks, and 20% over 96 weeks. Reductions, unrelated to study intervention, of more than 40% in ALP were observed in 10.9% of patients with baseline activity greater than 2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 12.5% of patients with more than 3-fold the ULN at 1 year. At 2 years, reductions of more than 40% in ALP were observed in 15.8% of patients with baseline activity greater than 2-fold the ULN and 17.9% of patients with more than 3-fold the ULN. Among the 209 patients with Ishak fibrosis stage 0–4 at baseline, serum ALP activity did not associate with the development of cirrhosis or with a 2-point increase in fibrosis stage at 2 years.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^11138Kkq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholecystitis, specifically concerning cholecystectomy timing, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend performing immediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the first-line treatment in high-risk patients with acute calculous cholecystitis. This recommendation is based on the recognition that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is superior to percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage in this group of patients.

### Serum alkaline phosphatase elevation as a preoperative sarcopenic biomarker in digestive cancer: a retrospective cohort study [^1154p4mh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

Patients diagnosed with sarcopenia preoperatively are known to typically develop postsurgical complications and have an overall poor prognosis. Previous studies have hinted at a link between the development of sarcopenia and inflammation; however, the mechanism in preoperative cancer patients remains unclear. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels have been identified as markers of chronic inflammation. Therefore, we focused on patients with digestive cancer, who often experience chronic inflammation, to investigate the potential of ALP as a preoperative sarcopenia marker.

The data were retrospectively analyzed from electronic medical records. A total of 274 patients diagnosed with digestive cancer, scheduled for surgery, and screened for perioperative sarcopenia at the rehabilitation outpatient clinic of the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery at Yokohama City University Hospital were included. Patients were categorized into sarcopenia (SC group; 58 patients) and nonsarcopenia (NSC group; 216 patients) groups.

The serum ALP level was found to be significantly higher in the SC group (168.4 U/L vs. 100.4 U/L), even after adjusting for confounders such as age, hepatic cancer, liver dysfunction, and bone fracture. This indicates a correlation between ALP elevation and sarcopenia risk (p-value = 0.0018, odds ratio estimated at 1.0055; confidence interval: 1.0021–1.0090). Laboratory findings also revealed clinically meaningful differences in albumin, ALP, and hemoglobin levels, as well as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and malnutrition markers.

### Primary biliary cirrhosis presented as peripheral eosinophilia in asymptomatic women with or without elevated alkaline phosphatase [^114kxqdJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by the destruction of biliary epithelial cells, presumably by autoimmune mechanisms. Although lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PBC, the possible involvement of eosinophils has also been suggested. Recent studies have shown that eosinophilia possibly occurs in the peripheral blood of PBC patients.

We present four cases of asymptomatic middle-aged women with moderate-to-high eosinophilia observed during random investigation. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased in two of them. As a result of clinical and laboratory evaluations, the early stages of PBC were diagnosed in all the patients, as attested by the detection of high titres of anti-mitochondrial antibodies and the characteristic lesions on liver biopsies. Liver function tests and eosinophils returned within normal limits after two months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, suggesting that its potential immunomodulatory actions may extend to eosinophils.

Our report further supports the possibility that eosinophilia may occur in PBC, especially in its early stages. From the clinical point of view, we believe that PBC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of eosinophilia with an otherwise unknown origin. In particular, PBC should be suspected in a patient when other causes of eosinophilia have been excluded, irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms, or the presence or absence of elevated ALP. In such cases, further evaluation for anti-mitochondrial antibodies should be done.

### Association between reduced levels of alkaline phosphatase and survival times of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116kJMZ7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). High credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the impact of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels on the survival of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). While UDCA does not halt PSC progression, patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who experience a decrease in ALP when treated with UDCA exhibit longer survival. This study compared survival times between PSC patients treated with UDCA or a placebo, focusing on ALP level reduction as a factor.

Data were collected from the Scandinavian PSC UDCA trial. Between 1996 and 2001, patients were randomly assigned to receive either UDCA (17–23 mg/kg/day, n = 97) or placebo (n = 101) and were followed until 2010. End points included death, liver transplantation, or cholangiocarcinoma. Biochemical responders, identified by normal or ≥ 40% reduced ALP levels after one year, were compared with nonresponders using the Kaplan-Meier method.

By the study's conclusion, there was no significant difference in survival between the UDCA and placebo groups (P = 0.774, log-rank); 26 patients in the UDCA group and 29 in the placebo group reached an end point. Among the participants, there were 79 responders and 116 nonresponders overall. Notably, significantly more biochemical responders treated with UDCA survived for 10 years compared to nonresponders (P = 0.03, log-rank). These differences remained significant irrespective of the treatment group; generally, reductions in ALP levels correlated with prolonged survival.

### Hepatobiliary scintigraphy in acute cholecystitis [^112wGyai]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a mature imaging technique for the evaluation of patients with acute cholecystitis (AC). It is effective in both calculous and acalculous forms of AC. The test is used in contemporary medical practice as the arbiter when the findings from screening abdominal ultrasound do not fit the clinical picture. It is also performed in severely ill patients who have AC suspected on other testing, but whose frail condition and high operative risk demand the highest level of certainty. This review, therefore, examines all technique variations of hepatobiliary scintigraphy, offering an approach that may best fit a variety of clinical situations and philosophies on AC.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, specifically concerning laboratory tests, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the acquisition of blood cultures in adult and pediatric patients with suspected intra-abdominal infections who present with elevated temperature and hypotension, tachypnea, delirium, or when there is concern for antibiotic-resistant organisms that would inform the treatment regimen.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis is characterised by intestinal dysbiosis independent from IBD [^1163sk1h]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Enterococcus abundance correlates to alkaline phosphatase levels, but this is not confirmed by multivariate analysis. Interestingly, the alterations in the signature genera abundances were more pronounced in patients with cirrhosis and liver transplantation compared to patients with stable disease, although these lacked statistical significance, probably due to the reduced sample size after splitting the groups (see online supplementary figure S3A). The same findings were observed in patients with IBD, where differences at the genus level were more pronounced in patients with active disease or an ileoanal pouch than in patients in clinical remission (see online supplementary figure S3b). Again, these differences were not significant after correction for multiple testing.

Since disease severity groups provided hints of a possible association between severity and the amplitude of the microbiota signature, we next evaluated the correlation between the three PSC-associated genera and serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), two clinical markers of cholestasis. A persistent elevation of ALP often triggers the diagnosis of PSC. A significant positive Spearman correlation was found between the abundance of Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus and GGT (see online supplementary table S6). Notably, we found a positive correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.29, adjusted p value = 0.012199; figure 4) between Enterococcus abundance and ALP, although this correlation did not withstand multivariate analysis when deconfounding for sex, age, BMI, and smoking status.

### I can feel it in my bones — a case of deranged 'liver' function [^116jVVbP]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35–129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had attributed to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11–50), making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including X-ray, CT, and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^1114f7Hp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis of ACC**: As no feature has sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude the diagnosis of ACC, it is recommended not to rely on a single clinical or laboratory finding. For the diagnosis of ACC, a combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging investigations is suggested. However, the best combination is not known.

	- **Useful features for the diagnosis of ACC include**:
		- **History and clinical examination**: fever, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, vomiting or food intolerance; Murphy's sign.
		- **Laboratory tests**: elevated C-reactive protein, elevated white blood cell count.
		- **Imaging**: signs suggestive of gallbladder inflammation.

The recommendations of the 2016 WSES guidelines were primarily based on two studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis by Trowbridge et al. and a prospective diagnostic study by Eskelinen et al. This evidence, despite its limitations, remains relevant and the associated statement remains valid.

The paper by Trowbridge et al. included 17 studies, which reported a quantitative assessment of history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The results showed that Murphy's sign (positive likelihood ratio — LR 2.8; 95% CI 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–1.1) were notable, although the 95% confidence intervals included 1.0 in both cases. None of the clinical signs or laboratory tests demonstrated likelihood ratios higher than these.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS into three different classes: low risk (50% chance) of CBDS. This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should undergo surgery without further investigation. Patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or intraoperatively with laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), to select those who need stone removal. Finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct (CBD) exploration is a valuable option. Patients with a high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). See the management flowchart for ACC in Fig. 1.

- **Risk factors and classification**: Table 2 outlines the risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010).

- **What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?**

We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

The ASGE guidelines remain a valuable tool for the diagnosis and management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for choledocholithiasis, specifically concerning initial evaluation, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining liver function tests (LFTs), including ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, and ALP, and conducting an abdominal ultrasound to assess the risk of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis.

### Preoperative predictors of choledocholithiasis in patients presenting with acute calculous cholecystitis [^11687MEV]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Markedly increased liver chemistries in patients presenting with acute calculous cholecystitis (AC) often prompt an evaluation for concomitant choledocholithiasis (CDL). However, guidelines directing the workup for CDL fail to address this unique population. The aims of this study are to define the range of presenting laboratory values and imaging findings in AC, develop a model to predict the presence of concurrent CDL, and develop a management algorithm that can be easily applied on presentation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of patients presenting with AC to a large tertiary hospital over a 3.5-year period. CDL was defined as common bile duct (CBD) stone(s), sludge, or debris seen on any of the following studies: US, CT, magnetic resonance imaging/MRCP, EUS, ERCP, or intraoperative cholangiogram. A multivariable model to predict CDL was developed on 70% of the patients and validated on the remaining 30%.

- **Results**: A total of 366 patients were identified and 65 (17.8%) had concurrent CDL. Univariable analysis was used to predict CDL and demonstrated statistically significant odds ratios for transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase (AlkPhos) above normal, lipase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥ 1.8 mg/dL, and CBD diameter > 6 mm. In the validation cohort, an optimal model containing alanine transaminase (ALT) > 3 times the upper limit of normal, abnormal AlkPhos, and CBD diameter > 6 mm was found to have an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91.

### Torsion of the gallbladder: A rare but important differential to consider when treating acute cholecystitis non-operatively [^113NaDMm]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented with postprandial epigastric pain. She had normal vital signs, inflammatory markers, and liver function tests. Ultrasound and CT of the abdomen demonstrated features consistent with acute cholecystitis. Her medical comorbidities and extensive abdominal surgical history prompted the decision to treat non-operatively. Despite optimal medical management, worsening abdominal pain and increasing inflammatory markers developed.

She underwent an emergency laparoscopy, which revealed a necrotic gallbladder secondary to an anticlockwise complete gallbladder torsion; a rare condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality if managed non-operatively. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was achieved without complication, and the patient had an uneventful recovery.

Preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder is difficult. However, there are certain patient demographics and imaging characteristics that can help surgeons differentiate it from acute cholecystitis — a condition that can be safely managed non-operatively in selected patients. The differentiating features are elaborated on in this case report.

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously, the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or ingestion of other toxins.

- **Investigations**: History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

- **Diagnosis**: Choledocholithiasis.

- **Management**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

Biochemistry: Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels at presentation, while sometimes modestly raised and occasionally normal, are typically about 10 times higher than normal, and sometimes even higher. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes.

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are younger compared to Caucasian patients, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients exhibit more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, which is not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment: Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These patterns incorporate an understanding of both acute and chronic liver disease, determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury.

- **Asymptomatic disease**: Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, the severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis is similar, as is the death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival.

- **Chronic hepatitis**: This is the most common form of AIH, with an insidious onset.

### Haemorrhagic cholecystitis: An unusual cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1175c4jC]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Haemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and presents a diagnostic challenge. This case report describes an orthopaedic patient who developed deranged liver function tests and anemia following a hemiarthroplasty of the hip. The patient experienced upper abdominal pain and had black stools, clinically appearing as melaena. An initial ultrasound scan of the abdomen was inconclusive. Consequently, a CT scan was conducted, raising the potential diagnosis of haemorrhagic cholecystitis. An endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed no evidence of other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. After undergoing an emergency laparotomy and cholecystectomy, the patient recovered well. This report aims to increase awareness of the uncommon condition of haemorrhagic cholecystitis and to educate on the clinical and radiological signs that lead to this diagnosis.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^112Bus4P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

- **Elevation of liver biochemical enzymes**: Elevation of liver biochemical enzymes and/or bilirubin levels are not sufficient to identify acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) patients with choledocholithiasis, and further diagnostic tests are needed. Liver biochemical tests historically have great utility in determining the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS). However, the majority of published studies are not conducted on patients with ACC and often include asymptomatic cholelithiasis.

Normal liver biochemical tests have a negative predictive value of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result is only 15%. The positive predictive value of liver function studies is a poor tool for predicting CBDS, even in non-ACC cases, with results ranging from 25% to 50%. In ACC, liver biochemical tests may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and biliary tree.

15% to 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in liver enzymes without choledocholithiasis. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1,178 patients with ACC had increased liver tests, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), greater than twice normal levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had choledocholithiasis. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of ACC patients without choledocholithiasis had elevated ALT and AST, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels with leukocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis.

Padda et al. demonstrated that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without choledocholithiasis had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT. Among patients with

- **Performance of ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines**: In ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines, patients are stratified into high risk, intermediate risk, or low risk for CBDS based on various clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound criteria, as presented in Table 4. All three guidelines recommend ERCP or laparoscopic treatment for CBDS for patients stratified as high risk, MRCP or EUS for patients stratified as intermediate risk, and no additional workup prior to cholecystectomy for patients stratified as low risk. Given these similarities, we have applied identical strategies when performing the meta-analysis of these guidelines by treating these three-tiered stratification systems as predictive tools with two distinct thresholds, as detailed in the "Data Analysis" section above.

- **Table 4**: Summary of ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines.

Data for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are available from 21 studies with 12,047 patients, 17 studies with 9271 patients, and 8 studies with 5028 patients, respectively. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]).

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: Diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis (with videos) [^111Dzo9D]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis serve as an essential clinical tool for identifying and classifying this condition. Primarily, these criteria guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious inflammation of the gallbladder, and stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis include local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs of inflammation consist of Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs of inflammation encompass fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

A diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis is established if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation. Suspected acute cholecystitis is diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not. If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established.

These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding clinicians in accurately assessing and managing the condition.

### Use of liver function tests as first-line diagnostic tools for predicting common bile duct stones in acute cholecystitis patients [^116jp7H6]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Prior studies have examined the use of liver function tests (LFT) for predicting the presence of common bile duct (CBD) stones in chronic cholecystitis (CC) patients. It is currently unclear whether LFT are also useful for predicting CBD stones in patients with acute cholecystitis (AC).

- **Methods**: Of 1,059 patients who visited an emergency room with gallbladder-related symptoms between March 2004 and December 2009, 854 patients were analyzed and were divided into three groups: 556 AC patients without CBD stones (AC - CBD), 98 AC patients with CBD stones (AC + CBD), and 200 CC patients without CBD stones. We compared the LFT values at admission and the changes in LFT values over time following admission among the three groups.

- **Results**: The LFT values were significantly greater in the AC + CBD group than in the AC - CBD groups. Of all the LFT variables analyzed, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase was the most reliable variable for predicting the presence of CBD stones, with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 75.3% at the cut-off level of 224 IU/L. The elevated LFT values decreased significantly from the start of the follow-up assessment to before cholecystectomy in the AC - CBD group but were unchanged before stone removal in the AC + CBD group.

- **Conclusion**: The LFT values on initial admission and the changes in LFT values over time are reliable predictors of CBD stones in patients with AC.

### Cholecystitis [^113bNUia]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholecystitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder, usually caused by obstruction of the cystic duct.

- **Pathophysiology**: It is mostly caused by gallstones or by impacted biliary sludge, with or without secondary bacterial infection such as E. coli, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus faecalis.

- **Disease course**: The inflammatory process due to obstruction of the cystic duct results in acute cholecystitis, which causes clinical manifestations of persistent pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), and mild jaundice. Disease progression may lead to gangrenous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, cholecystoenteric fistulas, gallstone ileus, and acalculous cholecystitis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the United States, the overall mortality associated with untreated complications of acute cholecystitis is approximately 20%.

### Clinical evolution of gallstones following percutaneous cholecystostomy in patients with severe acute calculous cholecystitis: A single-center analysis of 102 cases [^111epmxT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

The study received local board approval. We conducted a single-center retrospective case-control evaluation of the outcomes of patients who had undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) for severe acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), comparing those who went on to have interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with those who had PC only. At our institution, a diagnosis of ACC was made in the presence of acute onset of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, localized tenderness with or without guarding on palpation, elevated serum white cell count, and evidence of gallstones within a thick-walled gallbladder on abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography scan.

In cases of altered liver function tests and/or evidence of a dilated biliary tree on imaging, subjects were also assessed using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Upon diagnosis, the severity of ACC was defined according to the Tokyo guidelines. Emergency LC was contraindicated in cases of Tokyo 3 disease, or any Tokyo grade associated with a duration of symptoms greater than 5 days, previous multiple upper abdominal surgeries, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score greater than 3, or body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m².

The decision to proceed with PC was made on a multidisciplinary level, at any time from the diagnosis of ACC in critically ill patients who required organ support in the intensive care unit, or in those who did not respond to maximal intravenous antibiotic therapy for 4 days or more. The clinical response was judged to be poor based on persistent tachycardia, hypotension, white cell count > 18×10⁹/L, and/or serum C-reactive protein > 250 mg/L.

### Drug-induced cholestatic liver diseases [^114oSQf2]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Cholestatic DILI is an important and frequently challenging differential diagnosis in patients presenting with elevated liver tests, with a predominant elevation in alkaline phosphatase. A number of competing etiologies need to be ruled out, such as hepatobiliary malignancy, choledocholithiasis, cholestatic forms of viral hepatitis, cholestasis of sepsis, primary and secondary cholangitis, and right-sided cardiac failure, to name a few.

Important advances have occurred in the understanding and knowledge of the clinical phenotypes, new etiological agents, risk factors, pathophysiology, and genetic determinants of drug-induced cholestasis since the last review on drug-induced cholestasis was published in Hepatology in 2011. Secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) due to drugs has been well documented for several different drugs. Checkpoint inhibitors are one of the types of drugs shown to lead to secondary sclerosing cholangitis. Several new herbal and dietary supplements have recently been shown to lead to cholestatic liver injury. A number of genetic risk factors for cholestasis due to drugs have been identified in the last decade, and the pathogenesis behind cholestatic injury is better defined.

In this review, the focus is on the diagnostic approach and description of new clinical phenotypes, such as secondary sclerosing cholangitis and vanishing bile duct syndrome. Furthermore, the review provides an overview of the risk factors, genetic determinants, and the pathophysiology of hepatobiliary transporters leading to cholestasis. Management, areas of uncertainty, and future directions are also discussed.

### Does this patient have acute cholecystitis [^111pmgwj]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Although few patients with acute abdominal pain will prove to have cholecystitis, ruling in or ruling out acute cholecystitis consumes substantial diagnostic resources. The objective was to determine if aspects of the history, physical examination, or basic laboratory testing could clearly identify patients who require diagnostic imaging tests to rule in or out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

- **Data sources**: An electronic search of the Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, and English-language articles from January 1966 through November 2000 were indexed in MEDLINE. Additionally, Index Medicus was hand-searched for 1950–1965, and references in identified articles and bibliographies of prominent textbooks of physical examination, surgery, and gastroenterology were scanned. To identify relevant articles appearing since the comprehensive search, we repeated the MEDLINE search in July 2002.

- **Study selection**: Included studies evaluated the role of the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests in adults with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Studies had to report data from a control group found not to have acute cholecystitis. Acceptable definitions of cholecystitis included surgery, pathologic examination, hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan or right upper quadrant ultrasound, or a clinical course consistent with acute cholecystitis and no evidence for an alternate diagnosis. Studies of acalculous cholecystitis were included. Seventeen of 195 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data from the 17 included studies.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L for males and 19 to 25 IU/L for females, and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation.

The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be conducted.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of gallstones [^1177QuKY]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholangitis, specifically concerning laboratory tests such as CBC and serum biochemistry, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients presenting with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and/or jaundice:

- **WBCs**: Complete blood count to assess white blood cell count.
- **CRP**: C-reactive protein level to evaluate inflammation.
- **Liver biochemical tests**: To determine the function and health of the liver.

### A novel machine learning model and a public online prediction platform for prediction of post-ERCP-cholecystitis (PEC) [^115tR859]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for PEC: PEC is an uncommon complication often mistaken for acute cholangitis due to its similar symptoms. It typically presents as acute cholecystitis within one or two weeks of an ERCP procedure. However, cases of acute exacerbation of delayed cholecystitis may occur three months after discharge from the hospital. According to the 2018 Tokyo Guidelines for acute cholecystitis, PEC may present with the following:

- **Local signs of inflammation**: Right upper abdominal mass/pain/tenderness and a positive Murphy's sign.
- **Systemic signs of inflammation**: Fever, elevated C reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts.
- **Imaging features**: Indicated by acute cholecystitis on abdominal ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

A definitive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis includes at least one symptom from the local signs and systemic signs, plus confirmation through imaging.

Data collection: More than 54 parameters were included and evaluated in the model. These include:

1. Patients' basic characteristics, such as age, sex, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and pancreatitis.
2. Preoperative and postoperative laboratory tests, which include measures such as WBC and neutrophil ratio (N%), and levels of serum amylase, total cholesterol, triglyceride, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT).
3. Imaging parameters include abdominal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI scans.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^1151SFiB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Associated common bile duct stones: which tools to use for suspicion and diagnosis at presentation**: Choledocholithiasis, i.e. the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS), is reported to occur in 10% to 20% of gallstone cases, with a lower incidence, ranging from 5% to 15%, in cases of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). Investigations for CBDS require time and may delay surgical treatment. Due to the relatively low incidence of CBDS during ACC, the main issue is selecting patients with a high likelihood of CBDS, who would benefit from further diagnostic tests and removal of CBDS. An uncommon condition that mimics CBDS is Mirizzi syndrome, which occurs in less than 1% of patients with gallstones. Preoperative investigations may help in the diagnosis, although the vast majority of cases are identified during surgery.

	- The only new study on this topic was a cross-sectional study on the role of liver function tests (LFTs). The authors evaluated the role of LFTs and the role of early follow-up in the diagnosis of CBDS in ACC. The most reliable LFT was gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 75.3%, using a cut-off level of 224 IU/L. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 50%, while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 91.4%. The results also showed a significant decrease in LFTs within the non-CBD groups at 4-day follow-up, which was not evident in the ACC + CBDS group — with the exception of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Moreover, in the CBDS group, all LFT values improved significantly after the removal of the CBDS at a mean follow-up time of 4.3 days.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^114jxnHw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is no single clinical or laboratory finding with sufficient diagnostic accuracy to establish or exclude acute cholecystitis (LoE 2, GoR B). However, a combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, and laboratory tests may strongly support the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) (LoE 4, GoR C).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of different clinical signs and bedside tests in diagnosing ACC included 17 studies. These studies reported the quantitative assessment of diagnostic values of clinical tests. Twelve variables related to history and clinical examination, five variables related to basic laboratory tests, and one variable that combined a clinical sign with a laboratory test were assessed in a cohort of patients with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Results demonstrated that, with the exception of Murphy's sign, none of the summary positive likelihood ratios (LR) of the clinical tests was higher than 1.6, and none of the summary negative LRs was less than 0.4. Murphy's sign had a positive LR of 2.8 (CI 95% 0.8 to 8.6) and a negative LR of 0.5 (CI 95% 0.2 to 1), but the 95% CI included the value 1.

Although the study was classified as high quality according to the Oxford classification, it presents some limitations. The study did not report the proportion of patients with abdominal pain and the proportion of patients with suspected acute cholecystitis. While LR is robust for assessing prevalence, the inclusion of patients with abdominal pain alongside those suspected of acute cholecystitis may introduce a source of heterogeneity in the analysis.

### Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones, which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, usually in the gallbladder. Cholelithiasis is one of the most common surgical problems worldwide and is particularly prevalent in most Western countries. Biliary colic is the term used for gallbladder pain experienced by a person with gallstones without overt infection around the gallbladder. It is the most common manifestation of cholelithiasis, observed in over one-third of people with gallstones over the course of 10 or more years. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to relieve biliary colic pain, but their role needs further elucidation. They may decrease the frequency of short-term complications, such as mild forms of acute cholecystitis, jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis, but they may also increase the occurrence of more severe and possibly life-threatening adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment, cardiovascular events, or milder events such as abdominal pain, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, or cutaneous manifestations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in people with biliary colic.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2016. We applied no language limitation.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials evaluating the use of NSAIDs in individuals with biliary colic.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^111tvvKQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of jaundice should be evaluated with caution because it reflects a wide spectrum of potentially benign and malignant conditions. These include, but are not limited to, CBD obstruction from external compression (cholangiocarcinoma, periampullary cancers, gallbladder cancer), choledocholithiasis, and liver failure (e.g. secondary to sepsis). Although ultrasonography continues to be the diagnostic gold standard for detecting choledocholithiasis (especially within the distal CBD), MR cholangiography (MRC) may also be useful to define the etiology. The dominant goals in the treatment of patients with choledocholithiasis are three-fold: treat sepsis, evacuate the CBD, and prevent future recurrences. Although the order of the latter two goals is debated on the basis of length of stay, safety, and economics, it is clear that ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy represent the two dominant therapies. Laparoscopic CBD exploration (transcystic or transductal) is also a viable option and has the added benefit of being performed as a single procedure.

Acalculous cholecystitis is an uncommon and serious presentation observed in 5% to 10% of patients with biliary emergencies. It is typically associated with critical illness, immunosuppressive conditions, uncommon pathogens (anaerobes), and/or sepsis. On a global basis, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continue to represent the most common immunosuppressive cases and are younger, presenting with elevations in their alkaline phosphatase.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and is also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate, and pancreas but not in bone; therefore, it can be useful in confirming that an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is of liver, and not bony, origin. GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption, or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### Malignant neuroendocrine tumour of the gallbladder with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen: Case report and literature review [^1125r4cY]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman presented to a tertiary care centre with signs and symptoms of acute cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and a diagnosis of a high-grade neuroendocrine tumour of the gallbladder with peritoneal and liver metastases. She had a liver abscess secondary to Salmonella and Enterococcus faecalis that was drained and treated with appropriate antibiotics. Interestingly, the serum chromogranin A levels were within normal limits, but the carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated, aiding in the evaluation of responses and progression.

She was treated with 10 cycles of palliative chemotherapy. Complications associated with malignancy began to recur, such as cholangitis, worsening pain, cachexia, and intestinal obstruction, leading to chemotherapy delays. Her disease progressed during these times, with a rapid deterioration of performance status. She died due to septic complications following a laparotomy for intestinal obstruction. Her progression-free survival was 8 months with subjective and objective improvements, and her overall survival was 13 months. We describe the course of her illness and provide a brief review of the literature.

### Predictors of abnormalities on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: Is there a role when the biliary tree is normal on previous imaging [^115EYNrn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Limitations to this study include the numerous indications for imaging requests, which were not standardized and were variable according to the clinical information provided by the clinician writing the request form, many of whom were junior doctors. For example, we were unable to differentiate between abdominal pain and pancreatitis. Additionally, fever was listed in several cases; it is possible, however, that this may have been a symptom for other patients but was not included on the request form. Furthermore, this study was performed retrospectively for a group of patients investigated with MRCP, and we do not have a control group to compare our cohort with.

- **Statistical findings**: We have demonstrated that it is efficacious to proceed to MRCP with abnormal findings on index imaging, clinical jaundice, or elevated serum ALP. However, other clinical indices, such as pain or abnormal liver chemistry (other than raised ALP), are not independently predictive of a positive finding on MRCP. Elevated ALP is a predictor of positive MRCP findings. In the context of normal CBD size on index imaging, having a confirmed indicator is vital.

This study has identified that there is a reasonable diagnostic yield for MRCP in the absence of a dilated biliary system on previous US/CT. We propose that there should be a specific rationale for performing MRCP when initial imaging is normal. This study recommends that MRCP should be strongly considered in the context of an elevated ALP and normal US/CT biliary system. In addition, we suggest a bilirubin threshold of > 40 µmol/L can be used as an indicator.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111MrViD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis reported the diagnostic accuracy of serum bilirubin and serum ALP at two cut-off values for each test. Serum bilirubin at a cut-off of 22.23 μmol/L had a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Bilirubin at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit had a sensitivity of 0.42 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.63) and a specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). For ALP at a cutoff of greater than 125 IU/L, sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99) and specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). For ALP at a cutoff of greater than twice the normal limit, sensitivity was 0.38 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.59) and specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99).

- **Imaging features predictive of CBDS**:
	- We suggest considering the visualization of a stone in the common bile duct at transabdominal US as a predictor of CBDS in patients with ACC. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak# An increased diameter of the common bile duct, an indirect sign of stone presence, is not sufficient to identify ACC patients with CBDS, and we therefore recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Abdominal US is the preferred imaging technique for the diagnosis of ACC. The common bile duct can be visualized and investigated at the same time. A meta-analysis by Gurusamy et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of US: sensitivity ranged from 0.32 to 1.00 with a summary sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90), while specificity ranged from 0.77 to 0.97 with a summary specificity of 0.91 (95% CI).

### Clinical characteristics of acute cholecystitis with elevated liver enzymes not associated with choledocholithiasis [^114gGaRR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated liver enzymes are observed occasionally in patients with acute cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis. The etiology and mechanism of this phenomenon are not well known. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics between acute cholecystitis with and without choledocholithiasis in patients with elevated liver enzymes.

- **Patients and methods**: The medical records of acute cholecystitis patients who underwent cholecystectomy between January 2001 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. We retrieved data of patients who showed abnormal liver enzymes and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or intraoperative cholangiography.

- **Results**: We analyzed clinical characteristics and comorbidities in 424 patients. Among 424 cholecystectomy patients with abnormal liver enzymes, 178 (42%) patients did not have choledocholithiasis and 246 (58%) patients had choledocholithiasis. The median AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were 47, 82.5 IU/dl, and 1.21 mg/dl, respectively, in patients without choledocholithiasis and 58, 96 IU/dl, and 1.53 mg/dl, respectively, in patients with choledocholithiasis. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fatty liver [odds ratio (OR): 0.218; P < 0.001], radiologic findings (OR: 0.414; P = 0.001), and the level of total bilirubin (OR: 1.410; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of choledocholithiasis.

- **Conclusion**: Elevated liver enzymes in patients with cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis are correlated with the presence of fatty liver.

### How often are liver function tests normal in acute biliary pancreatitis [^117VVopF]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The biochemical markers of a biliary etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) include an ALT elevation of more than three times the upper range of normal (ULN) and a serum total bilirubin greater than 3 mg%.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the frequency of normal liver function tests (LFTs), including bilirubin, ALP, ALT, and AST, in patients with biliary AP.

- **Design**: In this prospective study, data collected for other ongoing studies on AP in the Division of Gastroenterology over the last 20 years were analyzed.

- **Material and methods**: Serum total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in 269 patients with biliary AP out of 728 cases of AP of various etiologies were analyzed. The biliary etiology was confirmed based on gallstones documented by transabdominal ultrasound or at surgery.

- **Results**: We noted normal bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in 14.5%, 12.3%, 11.2%, and 26.4% of cases of acute biliary pancreatitis, respectively. When all four laboratory tests were considered collectively, the incidence of normal values was 10.4%. We also noted an ALT elevation of less than three times ULN in 16.7% of cases of biliary AP, and 43.5% of cases had a total bilirubin level of less than 3 mg%.

- **Conclusions**: Almost 15 to 20% of patients with biliary AP manifest with normal LFTs. Clinicians should not exclude a biliary etiology solely on the basis of normal LFTs.

### Duration of pain is correlated with elevation in liver function tests in patients with symptomatic choledocholithiasis [^116C5SjS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

We assessed the temporal relationship between abdominal pain and elevation in liver function tests (LFTs) in patients with acute symptomatic choledocholithiasis.

- **Methods**: Retrospective study of patients that presented within 12 hours of pain onset and were subsequently found to have choledocholithiasis.

- **Results**: We identified 40 patients with complete medical records. Levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT) correlated with duration of pain (Pearson correlation, r = 0.633 and 0.622 respectively, P < .001 for both); the correlation was not as strong for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (r = 0.326, P = 0.046) and was not significant for alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin. This temporal association was stronger in patients that had undergone cholecystectomy versus those with intact gallbladders (for ALT, r = 0.603 vs r = 0.311, respectively). Eighteen patients, evaluated within 6 hours of pain, had normal or minimal alterations in LFTs; transabdominal ultrasound was abnormal in 6 (sensitivity 33.3%). All had repeat LFTs within 24 hours (mean 10.3 ± 6.9 hours later) and large increases in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase levels (mean 10.5- and 6.8-fold respectively; P < .01 for both), intermediate increases in glutamyl transpeptidase levels (mean 4-fold, P < .05), and no changes in alkaline phosphatase levels. This significant increase in LFTs was the only indication of biliary pathology before endoscopy in 11 of 18 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Increasing duration of pain is associated with increasing LFTs (particularly transaminases) in patients with symptomatic choledocholithiasis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, specifically in relation to the evaluation for choledocholithiasis, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining further diagnostic tests in patients with an increased diameter of the common bile duct, an indirect sign of stone presence, to identify patients with choledocholithiasis.

One flaw of the study is that the index diagnosis depends to some extent on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of CBDS is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated LFTs; this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with ACC?

- **Recommendation**: We recommend against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC. In such cases, we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LTFs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a NPV of 97%, whereas the PPV of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in patients without ACC; the literature ranges from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction. A proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had evidence of CBDS.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^114f5qLA]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

Overlapping features of patients with AIH indicate that about 10% have pruritus, raised serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Additionally, 7–25% have coincidental biliary injury, some with destructive bile duct lesions, on liver biopsy, which is characteristic of PBC.

The presence of a single feature usually does not undermine an AIH diagnosis. Additionally, patients with PBC and marked interface hepatitis can exist without these being classified as true variant syndromes. However, the likelihood of an AIH-PBC variant syndrome designation increases with the presence of more features. These features can evolve over time. Patients with AIH who test positive for AMA are more likely to develop bile duct damage on follow-up biopsy than AMA-negative patients. Conversely, interface hepatitis, which is classically associated with but not specific to AIH, is present in up to 50% of PBC patients and might be severe in 10%. These patients are more likely to develop progressive fibrosis.

- **Diagnostic criteria and prevalence**: Given these features, diagnosing AIH-PBC variant syndrome is challenging and cannot reliably be made using the IAIHG scoring systems for AIH. Specific diagnostic criteria have been developed but remain arbitrary as there is no gold standard for validation. For example, the 'Paris' criteria include at least two of three 'typical' criteria for both PBC and AIH.

	- **For PBC**:
		- Serum ALP > 2× or γ-GGT > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) values
		- Positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)
		- Liver biopsy showing florid bile duct lesions

	- **For AIH**:
		- Serum
