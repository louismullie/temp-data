## Question

Are CT of the chest generally performed with or without contrast when trying to evaluate the lung parenchyma for general shortness of breath on exertion with restrictive lung pathology seen on PFT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chest CT to evaluate lung parenchyma in a patient with exertional dyspnea and a restrictive pattern on PFTs should be performed with or without IV contrast, and what CT protocol is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical target: diffuse parenchymal lung disease versus other causes of restriction. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care CT technique for parenchymal assessment. Next, I need to check how IV contrast affects interpretation of interstitial disease. After that, I will consider exceptions where contrast is indicated. Finally, I should specify the recommended HRCT acquisition parameters and any adjunct sequences that improve diagnostic yield.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and diagnostic target. Restrictive physiology (reduced TLC and FVC) with exertional dyspnea raises concern for interstitial lung disease among other possibilities, and since the stated goal is to evaluate lung parenchyma, I should focus on protocols optimized for diffuse interstitial abnormalities rather than vascular or mediastinal assessment [^111HBwXN].

> Next, I should review the standard imaging approach for suspected parenchymal lung disease. High-resolution CT (HRCT) is the established modality for evaluating diffuse interstitial lung diseases and is recommended by major societies for ILD workups, including IPF, LAM, and related entities, because thin sections with high spatial frequency reconstruction best depict ground-glass, reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing patterns without the need for IV contrast [^1144VC7o] [^1172U3ae] [^111HBwXN].

> Wait, let me verify the impact of IV contrast on parenchymal assessment before jumping to conclusions. At first, I thought contrast might help delineate vessels from reticular fibrosis to improve interpretation; hold on, that's not correct for routine diffuse parenchymal evaluation because IV contrast increases lung attenuation and can mask or alter the quantification of subtle interstitial or emphysematous changes, which argues strongly for non-contrast scans as the reference for lung structure assessment [^116kQRyq] [^111HBwXN].

> I need to ensure I capture legitimate exceptions where contrast is actually useful. If there is suspected pulmonary vascular disease (for example, suspected or established pulmonary hypertension) or a vascular contribution to unexplained exertional dyspnea in post-COVID follow-up, contrast-enhanced chest CT or CT pulmonary angiography is appropriate to evaluate the pulmonary arteries and right heart, but those are targeted vascular studies rather than baseline parenchymal HRCT for ILD characterization [^112KQdzP] [^1124VH8y].

> Let me now examine the specific HRCT technique that best serves parenchymal evaluation. A non-contrast volumetric thin-section acquisition (≤ 1–1.5 mm), reconstructed with a high spatial frequency kernel, obtained at full inspiration in the supine position, is standard; adding limited prone images helps distinguish dependent atelectasis from true basilar disease when equivocal on supine imaging, and end-expiratory imaging can detect air trapping and small airways disease when clinically relevant, all without IV contrast [^115pqeJZ] [^114tVjMt] [^114jrCbR].

> But wait, what if a combined examination is being considered to avoid two scans; could virtual non-contrast (VNC) from dual-energy CT substitute for a true non-contrast series? Let me reconsider this carefully: VNC correlates closely with true non-contrast for several quantitative metrics, yet for ILD/parenchymal assessment the conservative and widely endorsed approach remains a true non-contrast HRCT to avoid any residual confounding in attenuation-based interpretation or quantification, reserving contrast for separate vascular questions if needed [^112fkVDw] [^1144VC7o].

> I should double-check the clinical utility and downstream impact to be sure this recommendation aligns with outcomes. HRCT not only improves diagnostic confidence and narrows differentials in diffuse parenchymal lung disease but also frequently alters management plans, which reinforces the value of acquiring an optimized non-contrast HRCT as the first-line parenchymal study in this scenario [^114oRizd].

> Synthesis and answer: For a patient with exertional dyspnea, restrictive PFTs, and a request to evaluate lung parenchyma, obtain a non-contrast HRCT of the chest; avoid IV contrast for the parenchymal evaluation itself, and add a separate contrast-enhanced study only if there is a distinct vascular or mediastinal indication such as suspected pulmonary hypertension, unexplained post-COVID vascular involvement, or hemoptysis requiring CTA, rather than mixing protocols that could degrade parenchymal assessment [^1144VC7o] [^1124VH8y] [^112KQdzP] [^112inDZm].

> Practical protocol I recommend: non-contrast volumetric HRCT with ≤ 1–1.5 mm collimation, high spatial-frequency reconstruction, full inspiratory supine imaging, add prone views if dependent opacities are equivocal, and include an end-expiratory series when small airways disease or mosaic attenuation is suspected; use dose-optimization strategies consistent with modern HRCT technique, and reserve IV contrast for separately indicated vascular/mediastinal assessments rather than routine parenchymal characterization [^115pqeJZ] [^111HBwXN] [^114tVjMt] [^114jrCbR].

No, chest CT for evaluating lung parenchyma in patients with exertional dyspnea and restrictive PFTs is **generally performed without contrast**. Non-contrast high-resolution CT (HRCT) is the **standard** [^1144VC7o] because it best depicts interstitial and parenchymal abnormalities [^111HBwXN] while avoiding the confounding effects of contrast on lung density [^116kQRyq] and quantitative analysis. Contrast is reserved for a specific suspicion of vascular disease (e.g. pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension [^112KQdzP]) or malignancy because it can obscure or alter parenchymal findings and is unnecessary for typical ILD assessment.

---

## Indications for chest CT in restrictive lung disease

Chest CT is indicated in patients with restrictive lung disease to characterize **interstitial lung disease** [^1144VC7o] by identifying patterns such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and sarcoidosis [^111HBwXN]. It also assesses disease extent and severity — quantifying fibrosis, ground-glass opacities, reticulation, and honeycombing — and **guides management** by informing treatment decisions, prognosis, and the need for biopsy or further testing [^114oRizd].

---

## Role of contrast in chest CT

Intravenous contrast is primarily used to enhance vascular structures and identify **vascular abnormalities**, such as:

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for diagnosing PE.

- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Contrast-enhanced CT is recommended [^112KQdzP] for initial evaluation of suspected pulmonary hypertension.

- **Malignancy**: Contrast may be used to evaluate suspected tumors or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

However, **contrast is generally not required** to evaluate lung parenchyma in restrictive lung disease because it does not significantly improve visualization of interstitial abnormalities [^111HBwXN] and may obscure subtle parenchymal changes [^116kQRyq].

---

## High-resolution CT (HRCT) without contrast

HRCT without contrast is the **standard imaging modality** for evaluating restrictive lung disease and interstitial lung abnormalities [^1144VC7o]. HRCT provides detailed images of the lung parenchyma [^111HBwXN], enabling accurate identification and characterization of interstitial abnormalities [^112ygy8A], such as:

- **Ground-glass opacities**: Indicative of active inflammation or early fibrosis.

- **Reticulation**: Suggestive of fibrosis or chronic interstitial disease.

- **Honeycombing**: Characteristic of advanced fibrosis, particularly in UIP/IPF.

- **Traction bronchiectasis**: Indicative of fibrotic lung disease [^112ygy8A].

International guidelines recommend **HRCT without contrast** for the evaluation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other interstitial lung diseases [^1144VC7o] [^114M1Wj8].

---

## Limitations and risks of contrast-enhanced CT in restrictive lung disease

Contrast-enhanced CT has several **limitations and risks** when evaluating restrictive lung disease:

- **Obscuration of parenchymal abnormalities**: Contrast may obscure subtle interstitial abnormalities, making it difficult to accurately assess disease extent and severity.

- **Alteration of lung density measurements**: Contrast significantly alters lung density measurements [^116kQRyq], potentially confounding quantitative analysis of lung parenchyma [^112fkVDw].

- **Risk of contrast-induced nephropathy**: Patients with impaired renal function are at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.

- **Allergic reactions**: Contrast agents carry a risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **consistently advise against routine use of contrast-enhanced CT** for evaluating restrictive lung disease. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) **recommend HRCT without contrast as the standard imaging modality** for interstitial lung disease and restrictive lung pathology [^1144VC7o]. Contrast-enhanced CT is **recommended only when there is a specific clinical suspicion** of vascular abnormalities [^1124VH8y], such as pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension [^112KQdzP], or when malignancy is suspected.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended CT protocol** |
|-|-|
| General evaluation of restrictive lung disease | HRCT without contrast [^1144VC7o] |
| Suspected pulmonary embolism | Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) [^114bykgq] |
| Suspected pulmonary hypertension | Contrast-enhanced CT [^112KQdzP] |
| Suspected malignancy | Contrast-enhanced CT |

Chest CT for evaluating lung parenchyma in patients with exertional dyspnea and restrictive PFTs is **generally performed without contrast**. HRCT without contrast is the **standard** imaging modality for evaluating restrictive lung disease because it provides detailed images of the lung parenchyma without the confounding effects of contrast [^1144VC7o] [^112fkVDw]. Contrast-enhanced CT is indicated only when there is a specific clinical suspicion of vascular abnormalities [^112KQdzP] or malignancy.

### Contrast enhanced CT-scans are not comparable to non-enhanced scans in emphysema quantification [^116kQRyq]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic, interventional, and surgical treatments have pursued new avenues in the treatment of emphysema. For longitudinal therapy monitoring and as endpoints for clinical trials, quantification of the disease is necessary. Sensitive, easy-to-measure, and stable and reproducible parameters must be characterized. One parameter that might affect emphysema quantification is IV contrast enhancement, which may also be indicated. A retrospective analysis was conducted to determine whether a contrast-enhanced scan is suitable for emphysema quantification or if an additional scan is necessary. This analysis involved 12 adult patients undergoing both non-enhanced and enhanced thin section MSCT within a week (median 0 days, range 0–4 days).

The in-house YACTA software was used for the automatic quantification of lung and emphysema volume, emphysema index, mean lung density, and the 5th, 10th, and 15th percentiles. After IV contrast administration, the median CT-derived lung volume decreased slightly by 1.1%, while the median emphysema volume decreased significantly by 11%. This resulted in a decrease of the median emphysema index by 9%. The median lung density (15th percentile) increased after contrast application by 18 HU (9 HU). CT quantification yields emphysema values that are clearly affected by IV contrast application. The detected changes after contrast application reflect higher density in the lung parenchyma. Consequently, the amount of quantified emphysema is reduced, and lung density increased after contrast enhancement. In longitudinal analyses, non-enhanced scans should be the reference.

### High-resolution CT of diffuse interstitial lung disease: Key findings in common disorders [^111HBwXN]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

High-resolution CT (HRCT) is the radiological imaging technique that most closely reflects changes in lung structure. It represents the preferred radiological method for diagnosing patients with known or suspected diffuse interstitial lung disease. While a single HRCT finding is often nonspecific, the combination of various HRCT findings, along with their anatomical distribution, can suggest the most probable diagnosis. The purpose of this article is to summarize the classic HRCT features of the most common diffuse interstitial lung diseases.

Lists of differential diagnoses and distinguishing key features are provided to enhance diagnostic confidence. The presence of classic HRCT features often negates the need for biopsy. In patients with atypical findings, HRCT can be used to determine the most appropriate biopsy site.

### Quantitative CT analysis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and correlation with lung function study [^112nosWe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease. However, the field of quantitative CT scan analysis in conjunction with pulmonary function tests for IPF patients remains relatively understudied. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of features derived from high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for patients with IPF and correlated them with pulmonary function tests.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed the chest HRCT images and pulmonary function test results of 52 patients with IPF during the same period (1 week) and selected 52 healthy individuals, matched for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI), with normal chest HRCT as controls. HRCT scans were performed using a Philips 256-row Brilliance iCT scanner with standardized parameters. Lung function tests were performed using a Jaeger volumetric tracer for forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), and maximum ventilation volume (MVV) metrics. CT quantitative analysis, including tissue segmentation and threshold-based quantification of lung abnormalities, was performed using 3D-Slicer software to calculate the percentage of normal lung areas (NL%), percentage of ground-glass opacity areas (GGO%), percentage of fibrotic area (F%), and abnormal lesion area percentage (AA%). Semi-quantitative analyses were performed by two experienced radiologists to assess disease progression. The aortic-to-sternal distance (ASD) was measured on axial images as a standardized parameter.

### The "complex restrictive" pulmonary function pattern: Clinical and radiologic analysis of a common but previously undescribed restrictive pattern [^113C3Y1s]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Most patients with restriction have a pulmonary function test (PFT) pattern in which total lung capacity (TLC), FVC, and FEV1 are reduced to a similar degree. This pattern is called "simple restriction" (SR). In contrast, we commonly observe a pattern in which FVC percent predicted (pp) is disproportionately reduced relative to TLC pp. This pattern is termed "complex restriction" (CR), and we attempted to characterize its clinical, radiologic, and physiologic features.

- **Methods**: This study reviewed PFT results of patients tested between November 2009 and June 2013 who had restriction (TLC less than the lower limit of normal). SR was defined as TLC pp - FVC pp ≤ 10%, and CR was stratified into four classes based on TLC pp - FVC pp discrepancy: Class 1 CR, TLC pp - FVC pp > 10% and ≤ 15%; Class 2 CR, TLC pp - FVC pp > 15% and ≤ 20%; Class 3 CR, TLC pp - FVC pp > 20% and ≤ 25%; and Class 4 CR, TLC pp - FVC pp > 25%. The medical records of 150 randomly selected patients with SR and 50 patients from each CR class were reviewed.

- **Results**: Of 39,277 PFTs completed, we identified 4,532 patients (11.5%) with restriction: 2,407 (6.1%) with SR, 1,614 (4.1%) with CR, and 511 (1.3%) with a mixed pattern. Patients with CR were younger, more often women, and had a higher prevalence of neuromuscular disease, BMI > 40 kg/m² or < 18.5 kg/m², diaphragmatic dysfunction, bronchiectasis, CT mosaic attenuation, and pulmonary hypertension [P < .0001, < .0001, < .001, .004, .0008, .002, .008, .009, .053, and .01, respectively], and a lower prevalence of interstitial lung disease.

### Ultra-low-dose CT versus chest X-ray for patients suspected of pulmonary disease at the emergency department: a multicentre randomised clinical trial [^112wBLrH]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

In this trial, we showed that using ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of non-traumatic pulmonary disease at the emergency department (ED) resulted in functional health outcomes at 28 days that are at least similar to those obtained with management guided by chest X-ray (CXR), with minimal differences in ED length of stay, hospital admissions, hospital length of stay, and mortality rates. There was less additional imaging required but more incidental findings.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was more often diagnosed at ED discharge, with subsequent confirmation of diagnosis at day 28, in the ULDCT group. This reflects the higher accuracy of ULDCT for CAP; however, it hardly affected clinical management. These results align with a previous prospective study comparing clinical management and outcomes in adults hospitalized with CAP who had radiological evidence of pneumonia on chest CT but not on CXR, compared to patients with radiological evidence on CXR. Of the patients, 66 of 2251 (2.9%) with only evidence of pneumonia on chest CT had management and clinical outcomes comparable to those with evidence on CXR.

Similarly, congestive heart failure was more often diagnosed with CXR at day 28. The presumed reason for underdiagnosing congestive heart failure with ULDCT was the unfamiliarity of radiologists with detecting congestive heart failure on ULDCT in the ED setting.

The similarity in health outcomes with CXR and ULDCT, despite the well-documented lower diagnostic accuracy of CXR, is likely explained by CXR's ability to detect the most relevant diagnoses in ED patients. In cases where a presumed clinical diagnosis is not confirmed by CXR, the attending physician may explore alternative assessments or imaging modalities to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee presents recommendations for managing incidentally detected lung findings on thoracic CT. The Chest Subcommittee is composed of thoracic radiologists who endorsed and developed the provided guidance. These recommendations represent a combination of published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. The recommendations address commonly encountered incidental findings in the lungs and are not intended to be a comprehensive review of all pulmonary incidental findings. The goal is to improve the quality of care by providing guidance on management of incidentally detected thoracic findings.

### High-resolution computed tomography of the lungs: the borderlands of normality [^111sYLyh]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is now widely used in the assessment of airways and diffuse lung disease. Considerable literature on pathologic correlation has increased the understanding of the signs of disease seen on HRCT. However, neither the significance of subtle individual signs nor the spectrum of HRCT appearances in healthy lungs is well documented. HRCT signs that cause diagnostic uncertainty and the spectrum of findings that exist between definite normality and definite abnormality are discussed.

### Utility of chest CT following a chest X-ray in patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic thoracic emergencies [^1159HDgR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Chest radiography is the initial choice for thoracic imaging. However, the wide availability of computed tomography (CT) has led to a substantial increase in its use in the emergency department (ED). We evaluated the utility of chest CT following a chest X-ray in patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic thoracic emergencies and determined if the diagnosis and management decision changed after CT.

- **Methods**: The study enrolled 500 consecutive patients with both chest X-rays and CT who presented to the ED with non-traumatic complaints. Chest X-rays and CT images obtained within 12 hours before any definitive treatment were randomly evaluated in consensus by two radiologists blinded to the clinical information.

- **Results**: The chest X-ray and CT image findings were concordant in 49.2% of the 500 patients, and this concordance was negatively correlated with patient age. Leading diagnosis and management decisions based on the chest radiograph changed after CT in 35.4% of the study group, and this finding was also correlated with age. In 55% of 205 patients, pneumonic infiltrations were undiagnosed with radiography. Pulmonary edema was the most specific (93.3%) and sensitive (85.4%) radiography finding. Posteroanterior chest radiographs taken in the upright position had higher concordance with CT than anteroposterior (AP) radiographs taken in the supine position.

- **Conclusions**: Chest CT may be an appropriate imaging choice in patients presenting to the ED for non-traumatic reasons, particularly for elderly patients and when the radiograph is taken with the AP technique.

### Computed tomography of diffuse lung disease: Functional correlates [^1148ypHF]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

An appreciation of functional and morphological characteristics is fundamental to the understanding of diffuse lung disease. The detailed information available from high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and the facility to subjectively or objectively quantify disease have elucidated the sometimes complex pulmonary function profiles of several diffuse lung diseases. The many reasons why correlations between the extent of HRCT abnormalities and physiological measures of disease may be less strong than expected are considered in this review.

### Thoracic computed tomography in the progressive fibrotic phenotype [^114D9CfZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To discuss the rationale and methods for determining progressive lung fibrosis on thoracic computed tomography (CT), this article explores the limitations and challenges of these techniques.

Identifying patients with progressive lung fibrosis is crucial for determining optimal treatment strategies. Serial high-resolution computed tomography is one method for assessing disease progression. A number of studies are reviewed in this article that have explored various parameters, both visual and automated, which signify progressive fibrosis on CT.

To reliably use serial CT as a marker of disease progression in fibrotic lung disease, clinicians and radiologists need to be aware of the optimal methods for identifying changes in disease extent and understand their limitations.

### Chest CT signs in pulmonary disease: A pictorial review [^112ygy8A]. Chest (2017). High credibility.

CT scanning of the chest is one of the most important imaging modalities available to a pulmonologist. The advent of high-resolution CT scanning of the chest has led to its increasing use. Although chest radiographs are still useful as an initial test, their utility is limited in the diagnosis of lung diseases that depend on higher resolution images, such as interstitial lung diseases and pulmonary vascular diseases. Several metaphoric chest CT scan signs have been described, linking abnormal imaging patterns to lung diseases. Some of these are specific to a disease, whereas others help narrow the differential diagnosis. Recognizing these imaging patterns and CT scan signs is thus vitally important. In the present article, we describe a comprehensive list of the commonly encountered metaphoric chest CT scan signs and their clinical relevance.

### Imaging of unusual diffuse lung diseases [^113GoDYi]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Computed tomography scans are commonly used in imaging lung diseases. As more information accumulates, patterns of rare or new diseases on CT scans are being increasingly reported. Several pulmonary diseases have distinguishing features that are better delineated on high-resolution CT scans than plain chest radiographs. The radiographic features of unusual diffuse lung diseases published in the past two years are described.

- **Recent findings**: Severe acute respiratory syndrome generally manifests as focal or diffuse bilateral areas of consolidation on chest radiography, with reticulation and ground-glass attenuation commonly seen on CT scans. A normal high-resolution CT (HRCT) rules out the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, while a normal chest radiograph does not. Immunocompromised patients without AIDS who have CMV pneumonia generally demonstrate a combination of ground-glass attenuation, air-space consolidation, and small nodules on HRCT. Nodules less than 10 mm in size in immunocompromised patients are highly suggestive of viral infections. Bronchial wall thickening on HRCT associated with cavitating nodules is suggestive of Wegner granulomatosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Small cysts may be seen in a minority of patients with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis and centrilobular emphysema in chronic farmer's lung. The reversed halo sign has a high specificity for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The triad of ground-glass opacities, ill-defined centrilobular nodules, cysts, and focal areas of air trapping is highly suggestive of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

### Ultra-low-dose CT versus chest X-ray for patients suspected of pulmonary disease at the emergency department: A multicentre randomised clinical trial [^115vv61y]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

The link between imaging and health outcomes is an indirect one, and superior accuracy is not guaranteed to lead to improved health outcomes. We did not expect ULDCT to lead to better patient outcomes but anticipated that it would result in functional health after 28 days at least as good as obtained with CXR, hence the non-inferiority design. In addition, we hypothesized that improved detection of underlying conditions with ULDCT would lead to a more efficient healthcare process, reflected in fewer hospital admissions and a shorter hospital length of stay compared with CXR.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^114tcfuM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to present diagnostic challenges. Our 2020 edition of this review showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this update, we include new relevant studies and have removed studies with case-control designs and those not intended to be diagnostic test accuracy studies.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray, and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19.

- **Search methods**: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 30 September 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19 and that reported estimates of test accuracy or provided data from which we could compute estimates.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list. We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and we summarized pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented the uncertainty of accuracy estimates using 95% confidence.

The study highlights the importance of diagnostic imaging in the clinical management of COVID-19 and aims to provide clarity on the effectiveness of these diagnostic tools in identifying the disease.

### Morphological measurements in computed tomography correlate with airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146k2jr]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the correlation between CT measurements of emphysema or peripheral airways and airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched from 1976 to 2011. Two reviewers independently screened 1,763 citations to identify articles that correlated CT measurements to airflow obstruction parameters of the pulmonary function test in COPD patients, rated study quality, and extracted information. Three CT measurements were assessed: lung attenuation area percentage < -950 Hounsfield units, mean lung density, and airway wall area percentage. Two airflow obstruction parameters were accessed: forced expiratory volume in the first second as percentage from predicted (FEV(1) %pred) and FEV(1) divided by the forced vital capacity.

- **Results**: Seventy-nine articles (9,559 participants) were included in the systematic review, demonstrating different methodologies, measurements, and CT airflow obstruction correlations. There were 15 high-quality articles (2,095 participants) in the meta-analysis. The absolute pooled correlation coefficients ranged from 0.48 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.54) to 0.65 (0.58 to 0.71) for inspiratory CT, and 0.64 (0.53 to 0.72) to 0.73 (0.63 to 0.80) for expiratory CT.

- **Conclusions**: CT measurements of emphysema or peripheral airways are significantly related to airflow obstruction in COPD patients. CT provides a morphological method to investigate airway obstruction in COPD.

- **Key Points**
- Computed tomography is widely performed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

### Detection and early referral of patients with interstitial lung abnormalities: An expert survey initiative [^113o4XcH]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

In the initial survey, the expert panel recommended ordering a high-resolution chest CT scan (HRCT), if not already performed, when any of the following findings are present in the screening CT scan: nondependent subpleural reticulation on ≥ 5% of the CT scan; traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing; or centrilobular ground-glass nodules or patchy ground-glass opacity. The expert panel also agreed that full pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry, lung volumes, and measurement of diffusion capacity, should be performed in people identified with these imaging findings.

- **Diagnostic testing in asymptomatic patients**:
	- Survey results indicated that expert opinions (n = 44; Survey One) recommended HRCT imaging in patients who previously had CT scan-detected interstitial lung abnormalities. Recommended PFTs in these patients included spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity measurement, following HRCT imaging. If diffusion capacity measurements were within the normal range, but honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis was present, referral to a pulmonologist with expertise in interstitial lung disease (ILD) was advised.

For patients with confirmed interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) but no PFT abnormalities, over 90% of expert panel members recommended follow-up, specialist referral, or periodic repeat testing, although consensus was not reached on any single approach.

### The clinical impact of high resolution computed tomography in patients with respiratory disease [^114oRizd]. European Radiology (2011). High credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography is widely used to investigate patients with suspected diffuse lung disease. Numerous studies have assessed the diagnostic performance of this investigation, but the diagnostic and therapeutic impacts have received little attention.

- **Methods**: The diagnostic and therapeutic impacts of high-resolution computed tomography in routine clinical practice were evaluated prospectively. All 507 referrals for high-resolution computed tomography over 12 months in two centers were included. Requesting clinicians completed questionnaires before and after the investigation detailing clinical indications, working diagnoses, confidence level in each diagnosis, planned investigations, and treatments.

- **Results**: Three hundred and fifty-four studies on 347 patients had complete data and were available for analysis. Following high-resolution computed tomography, a new leading diagnosis (the diagnosis with the highest confidence level) emerged in 204 (58%) studies; in 166 (47%) studies, the new leading diagnosis was not in the original differential diagnosis. Mean confidence in the leading diagnosis increased from 6.7 to 8.5 out of 10 (p < 0.001). The invasiveness of planned investigations increased in 23 (7%) studies and decreased in 124 (35%) studies. The treatment plan was modified after 319 (90%) studies.

- **Conclusions**: Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography alters leading diagnosis, increases diagnostic confidence, and frequently changes investigation and management plans.

### Clinical differences in the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease stage 0 [^116AShAQ]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine the clinical differences between Stage 0 and normal subjects using low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function tests. Subjects who participated in a health check for lung cancer screening underwent both low-dose CT and pulmonary function tests. They were categorized into Stage 0, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to pulmonary function tests, and normal subjects. The severity of emphysema, determined via a visual score, was calculated on three low-dose CT slices. The study involved 1,359 men and 888 women, with the numbers and percentages of male and female smokers being 1,076 (79.2%) and 107 (12.0%), respectively.

A total of 722 individuals reported having one or more respiratory symptoms, such as cough (69.8%), sputum production (75.8%), or shortness of breath (0.83%). Of these, 71 individuals (9.8%) met the criteria for chronic respiratory symptoms. Among normal subjects, smoking caused observable differences in airflow limitation according to pulmonary function tests. The proportion of smokers and the visual score were notably higher in Stage 0 subjects than in normal subjects. Additionally, the maximum mid-expiratory flow (%MMF) and peak expiratory flow rate were significantly lower in Stage 0 subjects compared to normal subjects.

- **Smoking as a factor**: %MMF and the proportion of the visual score were significantly lower in smoking Stage 0 subjects than in non-smoking Stage 0 subjects. Smoking may indicate early signs of emphysematous changes between Stage 0 and normal subjects, as observed in pulmonary function tests and visual scores.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^114M1Wj8]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Sjögren's disease, particularly concerning chest CT, the PDSS-CEP 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining repeated HRCT in patients with SD who have respiratory symptoms. The intervals for these scans should be determined on a case-by-case basis, individualized according to the nature and severity of the underlying pulmonary abnormality, as well as the degree of symptoms and functional impairment.

### Quantitative chest computed tomography: Regional differences in dual-energy-derived virtual vs. true non-contrast scans [^112fkVDw]. Clinical Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Quantitative analysis of chest computed tomography (CT) usually requires non-contrast scans. Multi-energy CT-derived virtual non-contrast (VNC) images may obviate additional true non-contrast (TNC) scans. We aimed to quantitatively compare virtual and true non-contrast images, with a focus on regional differences in pulmonary tissue.

- **Materials and methods**: This bi-center retrospective, IRB-approved study included consecutive patients who received contrast-enhanced dual-energy and non-contrast chest CT scans within one year between April 2018 and December 2022. Scans were co-registered and semi-manually segmented into various volumes of interest: whole lung, center/periphery, ventral/dorsal half, and upper/middle/lower third. The mean lung density, high and low attenuation volumes, and the lower 15th percentile were computed from the VNC and TNC scans for each volume. Correlation and agreement were assessed using Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Subgroup analyses involved body mass index and markers of pulmonary emphysema.

- **Results**: Forty-eight patients were included (26 females, median age: 63 years, interquartile range: 58–69). Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients greater than 0.9 demonstrated high correlation and agreement for the mean lung density, low attenuation volume, and the lower 15th percentile across the whole lung. The agreement for high attenuation volume was slightly less pronounced (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.84 [95% confidence interval: 0.73, 0.91]). Regional differences were observed, for example, in these assessments.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: An official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^113NSbZX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The committee recommended baseline screening for ILD but did not reach a consensus on the frequency of follow-up if the initial screening result is negative. The risk of developing ILD is often highest in the early years after diagnosis, but this can vary depending on the underlying CTD. Considerations for repeat screening should include the individual's risk profile based on factors such as antibody status, age, and other characteristics of the CTD. The prevalence of ILAs/ILD in SLE without overlap with other CTDs is low, and baseline screening was not recommended. Additionally, the increased risk of radiation from CT screening should be considered, particularly for individuals who are younger. Pulmonary function tests alone are not sensitive enough to detect ILD, highlighting the need for CT screening. Although radiation exposure is a concern, modern techniques have significantly reduced the associated risks, and advancements like photon-counting CT may further decrease radiation exposure. The committee acknowledges that this suggestion may place additional strain on healthcare systems given the high prevalence of some of the included high-risk CTDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Question 3**: Should adults with a first-degree relative with pulmonary fibrosis who are not suspected of having ILD undergo chest CT screening to identify ILAs/ILD?

- **Suggestions**: We suggest chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ⩾50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with FPF. Remarks: FPF is defined by at least two genetically related first- or second-degree relatives having pulmonary fibrosis.

### A practical approach to high-resolution CT of diffuse lung disease [^114Ti8NG]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Diffuse lung disease presents a variety of high-resolution CT findings reflecting its complex pathology and provides a diagnostic challenge for radiologists. Frequent modifications in detailed pathological classification make it difficult to keep up with the latest understanding. In this review, we describe a practical approach to high-resolution CT diagnosis of diffuse lung disease, emphasizing:

- **Analysis of distribution**: Focusing on the distribution of abnormalities.
- **Interpretation of pattern**: Understanding patterns in relation to distribution.
- **Utilization of associated findings**: Incorporating associated imaging findings and clinical information.
- **Chronicity of findings**: Considering the chronicity of the findings.

This practical approach will help radiologists establish a framework to interpret high-resolution CT, leading to a pinpoint diagnosis or narrower differential diagnoses of diffuse lung diseases.

### Volumetric expiratory high-resolution CT of the lung [^114jrCbR]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

We developed a volumetric expiratory high-resolution CT (HRCT) protocol that provides combined inspiratory and expiratory volumetric imaging of the lung without increasing radiation exposure and conducted a preliminary feasibility assessment of this protocol to evaluate diffuse lung disease with small airway abnormalities. The volumetric expiratory HRCT increased the detectability of the conducting airway to the areas of air trapping (P < 0.0001) and added significant information about the extent and distribution of air trapping (P < 0.0001).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® routine chest imaging [^116w45QG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Routine chest imaging has been used to identify unknown or subclinical cardiothoracic abnormalities in the absence of symptoms. Various imaging modalities have been suggested for routine chest imaging. We review the evidence for, or against the use of routine chest imaging in different clinical scenarios. This document aims to determine guidelines for the use of routine chest imaging as the initial imaging for hospital admission, initial imaging prior to noncardiothoracic surgery, and surveillance imaging for chronic cardiopulmonary disease.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Thin-section chest CT findings of primary Sjögren's syndrome: Correlation with pulmonary function [^111AVMeZ]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe thin-section CT findings of lung involvement in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) and to correlate them with pulmonary function tests (PFT). The chest thin-section CT examinations of 35 patients with a proven diagnosis of PSS and respiratory symptoms were retrospectively assessed by two observers. Initially, this assessment was done independently with interobserver evaluation, followed by a consensus review. The extent of the most frequent CT findings was scored. Correlation was made with PFT in 31 of these patients.

Three main CT patterns were identified with good interobserver agreement (kappa coefficient 0.71):

- **Large and/or small airways disease**: 19 of 35 patients (54%).
- **Interstitial lung fibrosis (ILF)**: 7 of 35 patients (20%).
- **Suggestive of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP)**: 5 of 35 patients (14%).

The CT scans were normal in 2 patients (6%) and showed only dilatation of pulmonary vessels due to pulmonary arterial hypertension in two others (6%).

- **Airway disease patients**: These patients had predominantly obstructive profiles (mean FEV(1)/FVC ratio 69.7 ± 12.7%, mean MEF(25) 50.1 ± 22.9%).
- **ILF and LIP patients**: These patients had predominantly restrictive profiles and/or a decreased diffusing lung capacity (mean TLC 87.0 ± 26.0 and 64.6 ± 18.6%, mean DL(CO) 57.4 ± 21.2 and 52.0 ± 8.0%).

Significant correlation (p < 0.01) was found between the scores of ground-glass attenuation and TLC (r = -0.84) and DL(CO) (r = -0.70) and between the score of air trapping and FEV1 (r = -1.0). In patients with PSS and respiratory symptoms, thin-section CT may provide characterization of lung involvement.

### X-ray dark-field chest imaging for detection and quantification of emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a diagnostic accuracy study [^112oeSLB]. The Lancet Digital Health (2021). Low credibility.

Conventional and dark-field chest x-rays of a patient with localized emphysema were captured using our demonstrator system. In the dark-field image, the affected regions appear dark, indicating reduced small-angle scattering due to fewer air-tissue interfaces. By contrast, the attenuation image is limited in visualizing the circumscribed emphysematous changes. Pulmonary function testing yields moderate obstruction, which remains post-bronchodilation. Each lung function parameter is normalized with respect to the expected value for a patient without pulmonary disorders of the same age, sex, and height. CT densitometry yields an emphysema index of 11.5%, implying that this fraction of the lung volume has density values below –950 HU. The corresponding voxels in the CT slices, shown in red with lung parenchymal window settings applied, indicate consistent information regarding parenchymal condition between dark-field and CT images.

### Thin-section CT imaging that correlates with pulmonary function tests in obstructive airway disease [^112ijhAq]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify independent CT findings that correlated with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with obstructive airway diseases.

- **Materials and methods**: Sixty-eight patients with obstructive airway disease and 29 normal subjects (mean age, 52 years; 36 men and 61 women) underwent inspiratory and expiratory thin-section CT and PFTs. A patient with obvious emphysema was excluded. Two radiologists independently reviewed the images and semi-quantitatively evaluated lung attenuation (mosaic perfusion, air trapping) and airway abnormalities (extent and severity of bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis or centrilobular nodules, mucus plugging). Univariate, multivariate, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed with CT findings and PFTs.

- **Results**: Forty-two patients showed obstructive PFTs, and 26 symptomatic patients showed near-normal PFTs. On univariate analysis, air trapping and bronchial wall thickening showed the highest correlation with obstructive PFTs, such as FEV1.0/FVC, MMEF, and FEF75 (r ranged from -0.712 to -0.782; p < 0.001), while mosaic perfusion and mucus plugging showed moderate correlation, and bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, and nodules showed the least, but significant, correlation. Multiple logistic analyses revealed air trapping and bronchial wall thickening as the only significant independent determinants of obstructive PFTs. ROC analysis revealed the cut-off value of air trapping for obstructive PFTs to be one-third of whole lung (area under curve, 0.847).

- **Conclusions**: The study confirms that air trapping and bronchial wall thickening are significant independent determinants of obstructive PFTs in patients with obstructive airway disease.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^1137wtDJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

We included 94 studies encompassing various imaging modalities: 64 CT, 12 X-ray, 11 ultrasounds, three using both CT and X-ray, two combining CT and ultrasound, and two utilizing both X-ray and ultrasound. These studies involved a total of 37,631 participants suspected of having COVID-19, of which 19,768 (53%) received a final diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms or epidemiological risk factors, such as close contact with a confirmed case.

The median sample size was 234, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 101.25 to 478.75. A total of sixty-five studies were conducted in Europe across various countries: Italy (19), the Netherlands (9), France (9), Belgium (5), Turkey (6), Germany (7), UK (4), Switzerland (2), Czech Republic (1), Ireland (1), Spain (1), and Denmark (1). Nineteen studies were undertaken in Asia, specifically in China (9), Korea (1), India (4), Iran (2), Japan (1), Pakistan (1), and the United Arab Emirates (1). The remaining studies were conducted in North America (USA 6, Canada 1) and South America (Brazil 3).

- **Index test readings**: Performed by radiologists in 49 studies (52%), radiology residents in two studies (2%), both radiologists and residents in three studies (4%), and radiographers and radiologists in one study (1%). Thirty-nine studies (37%) did not clearly report the level of training of the readers.

- **Technical parameters regarding chest CT protocol**: Not clearly reported in 31 out of 69 studies (44%). Non-contrast CT was used in 25 studies (36%), high-resolution chest CT was utilized in eight studies (11%), low-dose CT, with or without contrast, was employed in 11 studies (15%), and CT with IV contrast was used in five studies (7%).

### The relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Ntbpc]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation, and its severity is graded according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. The airflow limitation in COPD patients is caused by parenchymal destruction (i.e. emphysema) and small airways disease with airway inflammation and airway remodeling, which leads to expiratory airway obstruction and air trapping.

Emphysema has been quantified in vivo by computed tomography (CT) for decades; however, in vivo detection of small airways disease has been difficult since these small airways (diameter < 2 mm) cannot be visualized directly with CT techniques. Nakano et al. suggested that measurements of large airway wall thickening can be used as an indirect sign of small airways disease. However, quantification of airway wall dimensions remains technically challenging. Alternatively, air trapping on end-expiratory CT may be easier to quantify and is possibly a more direct measurement of small airways dysfunction. The main challenge in this approach is to separate air trapping due to small airways disease from air that remains in emphysematous spaces after expiration.

Separate quantification of air trapping and emphysema is relevant for two reasons. First, COPD is a disease with broad heterogeneity, and COPD phenotyping may be possible when quantitative CT is combined with clinical and physiological characteristics. Second, quantitative CT of COPD components might gain a role in the (early) diagnosis of the disease.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tracheobronchial disease [^112inDZm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bronchiectasis, specifically in terms of diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a chest X-ray (CXR) in patients with suspected bronchiectasis to assess for associated conditions and to exclude diseases causing similar symptoms. A chest CT is advised to evaluate the extent, severity, and distribution of bronchiectasis, as well as to assess associated parenchymal disease. Consider obtaining a CT angiography (CTA) to assess important vascular findings, such as dilated bronchial arteries and other systemic collateral vessels that can be potential sources of bleeding. Additionally, consider obtaining a chest MRI to assess the presence and extent of bronchiectasis, recognizing that it is inferior to CT in the evaluation of the lung parenchyma and is not widely used for this indication.

### The relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111dNJ1w]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography (CT) measurements of air trapping and emphysema in a population of former heavy smokers with and without airflow limitation.

- **Methods**: In 248 subjects (50 normal smokers; 50 mild obstruction; 50 moderate obstruction; 50 severe obstruction; 48 very severe obstruction), CT emphysema and CT air trapping were quantified on paired inspiratory and end-expiratory CT examinations using several available quantification methods. CT measurements were related to lung function (FEV1, FEV1/FVC, RV/TLC, Kco) by univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.

- **Results**: Quantitative CT measurements of emphysema and air trapping were strongly correlated to airflow limitation (univariate r-squared up to 0.72, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the combination of CT emphysema and CT air trapping explained 68–83% of the variability in airflow limitation in subjects covering the total range of airflow limitation (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The combination of quantitative CT air trapping and emphysema measurements is strongly associated with lung function impairment in former heavy smokers with a wide range of airflow limitation.

- **Key points**:
	- CT helps to automatically assess lung disease in heavy smokers
	- CT quantitatively measures emphysema and small airways disease in heavy smokers
	- CT air trapping and CT emphysema are associated with lung function impairment

### CT techniques for imaging the lung: Recommendations for multislice and single slice computed tomography [^115pqeJZ]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The introduction of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) has provided the thoracic radiologist with a powerful tool to image the lungs. Enthusiasm for new protocols should be tempered with concerns over the potential increase in radiation dose. Before older protocols are abandoned, there should be good evidence that newer protocols are objectively superior. Ultimately, the best protocol is one that provides the most relevant clinical information at the lowest dose possible.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^114bykgq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Accepted recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) continue to emphasize pre-test probability to guide the choice of testing, and the positive predictive value of CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) remains dependent on the pre-test probability of PE. We used documentation of pre-test probability in patients' medical records as a surrogate for assignment of pre-test probability by any means, subjective or objective. It is possible that assessment of pre-test probability was performed by physicians prior to CTPA but not specifically recorded. However, if this were the case, such assessment of pre-test probability occurred in a rather small minority of patients for the following two reasons:

- **D-dimer measurement**: D-dimer was only measured in 20% of all patients with a low or intermediate pre-test probability of PE.
- **Anticoagulation treatment**: Only 1 in 5 patients in the high pre-test probability category received anticoagulation while awaiting confirmation of PE with a CTPA.

Our study was designed to investigate the rates and indications for the use of CTPA in clinical practice and therefore only includes patients undergoing CTPA. It is possible that patients presented with low risk for PE, were appropriately screened, and did not undergo CTPA. We believe that such a number is small as our data reveal that younger patients with fewer risk factors for PE were undergoing CTPA.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^115hXup1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing CTPA in contrast to 2000 and 2005 were significantly younger and less acutely ill in 2008, as evidenced by their higher oxygen saturation and lower respiratory rate. Moreover, patients in 2008 were much less likely to have any risk factors for thrombosis or a prior history of venous thromboembolism. There was an increase in the use of CTPA in patients with chest pain and for "other" indications. The increase in the number of scans ordered was accompanied by a significant drop in the diagnosis of PE from 22.6% in 2000 to 13% in 2010. We also noted a change in the size and location of pulmonary emboli detected over time; in 2008, a greater proportion of PE was found distal to the lobar arteries in the segmental or subsegmental branches.

Since younger patients and women may be more at risk from the potential carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation, we also examined age and gender in our sample. The number of CTPA performed on women under the age of 40 years increased significantly over the study period. While 11.8% of all CTPAs performed were on women less than 40 years of age, the presence of a PE in this cohort was lower than in all CTPAs reviewed (9.1% versus 17.7%).

- **Demographics, signs and symptoms, risk factors and prior medical history by year** for 850 patients undergoing CT angiography.

- **CTPA positivity rate and location of pulmonary emboli**: Central PE was defined as PE in the pulmonary trunk, right or left main pulmonary arteries, or lobar arteries while PE in segmental branches.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: An official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^114tVjMt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In developing this document, the committee identified several important underlying concepts:

- **Spectrum of changes**: Although normal lung, ILAs, and ILD likely represent a spectrum of changes, the development of specific criteria for ILAs and ILD would facilitate clinical recommendations for each category.

- **Definition balance**: The definitions of ILA and ILD should attempt to balance the sensitivity and specificity for disease progression and the need for treatment, recognizing that not all "disease" requires treatment.

- **CT scan sensitivity**: Although ILA is often identified on routine chest CT scans, thin-section (< 1.5 mm) CT is more sensitive than thicker sections. High-resolution CT (HRCT) with prone imaging can facilitate characterization and may be necessary if findings on supine imaging are equivocal.

- **Quantitative CT (QCT)**: QCT, which applies computer techniques for objective detection and measurement of specific radiologic features, holds promise for advancing ILA assessment but is still under investigation and not yet used routinely in clinical practice.

- **Provisional recommendations**: We have made provisional recommendations when evidence was weak, with the intent that these recommendations will stimulate additional evidence generation.

- **Patient-centered approach**: In conversations with patients (and consistent with published data), we prioritized early identification of disease and information sharing with patients over the potential burden of detecting findings of low or uncertain clinical significance, recognizing that all recommendations need to be personalized based on individual patient wishes and values.

### Value of computed tomography of the chest in subjects with ARDS: A retrospective observational study [^1131iHFG]. Respiratory care (2016). Low credibility.

The value of computed tomography (CT) of the chest in the management of patients with ARDS is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of thoracic CT scans in subjects with ARDS using the Berlin definition.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, observational study in a university hospital ARDS center on all subjects with ARDS in whom a CT scan of the chest was performed immediately before or during an ICU stay between January 1, 2007, and June 30, 2013.

- **Results**: During the study period, a total of 1,781 thoracic CT scans were performed, of which 204 cases met inclusion criteria. The most common pathologic findings of the lung parenchyma were consolidations (94.1% of cases) and ground glass opacities (85.3%). Furthermore, CT scans showed pleural effusions (80.4%), mediastinal lymphadenopathy (66.7%), signs of right ventricular strain and pulmonary hypertension (53.9%), pericardial effusion (37.3%), emphysema of the chest wall (12.3%), pneumothorax (11.8%), emphysema of the mediastinum (7.4%), and pulmonary embolism (2.5%). Results of CT scans led to changes in management in 26.5% of cases. Mortality was significantly increased in subjects with involvement of lung parenchyma of > 80% (P = 0.004). Intrahospital transport was associated with critical incidents in 8.3% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: Systematic evaluation of thoracic CT scans yielded information useful for making a diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and recognizing concomitant disorders requiring therapeutic interventions. Results obtained from CT scans led to changes in management.

### The relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115BDxrJ]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

To study COPD in a lung cancer screening trial, pulmonary function tests (PFT) and an expiratory CT data acquisition were previously added to the screening protocol in our center. We automatically assessed emphysema and air trapping in CT examinations obtained in this lung cancer screening population. Since limited subjects with severe airflow limitation were present in the screening trial, clinical subjects were added to study the total range of COPD.

This retrospective study was approved by our institutional ethics board; written informed consent was obtained from the screening trial participants, and waived for the clinical subjects.

- **Subjects**: Within the lung cancer screening trial participants, random samples of 50 subjects were drawn for each GOLD stage, resulting in 50 GOLD 1, 50 GOLD 2, and 24 GOLD 3 subjects. The clinical subjects underwent outpatient inspiratory and expiratory CT and PFT examination for COPD evaluation and/or lung transplantation screening. Cases with GOLD 3 or GOLD 4 were selected. No CTs contained major breathing artifacts, and scans with signs of acute pneumonia were excluded. The GOLD 3 study population was extended to 50 subjects with a random sample of clinical subjects. The GOLD 4 group consisted of all available clinical subjects (N = 48).

Additionally, a group of normal smokers from the screening trial participants was selected. A 'normal smoker' is defined as having two normal lung function tests with at least a two-year interval, plus a slow rate of lung function decline.

### Increased expiratory computed tomography density reveals possible abnormalities in radiologically preserved lung parenchyma in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1147dGno]. Investigative Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, lethal chronic lung disease with unclear pathogenesis. The radiological hallmark is the pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia accentuated in peripheral and basal areas with otherwise preserved lung structure. One hypothesis is that alveolar collapse and consequent induration lead to fibrotic transformation of lung tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate normal-appearing tissue during expiration for signs of collapsibility and differences from other diseases or controls.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively assessed a total of 43 patients (15 with IPF, 13 with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and 15 controls) using nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) during inspiration and expiration, performed for routine clinical workup. Densitometry of visually unaffected lung tissue was conducted in all lung lobes with a region of interest of 15 mm in diameter on soft tissue kernel reconstruction (slice thickness, 1 mm) during inspiration and expiration.

- **Results**: One-factor analysis of variance analysis yielded a significant difference in attenuation changes between inspiration and expiration of unaffected lung parenchyma among all subject groups in all lung lobes. For IPF patients, the highest differences in densities were observed in the lower lobes, which is the predominantly affected site of usual interstitial pneumonia. In the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group, the density remained rather equal in the entire lung.

High CT attenuation changes between inspiration and expiration in IPF patients suggest differences in lung parenchyma that could aid in understanding IPF progression and potentially in distinguishing it from other lung conditions.

### Mimics in chest disease: Interstitial opacities [^117EG96q]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Since the advent of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the 1990s, the understanding of interstitial lung disease has dramatically changed. As CT descriptions of the various diffuse lung diseases are continuously refined, certain CT characteristics are considered pathognomonic, while others become less specific. HRCT finds its role in an integrated approach to diagnosis where it provides sufficient information to produce a differential diagnosis and, in many cases, allows a non-invasive definitive diagnosis.

There are various patterns of interstitial lung disease on HRCT, each representing different interstitial lung diseases with completely different histological appearances and clinical manifestations. The main distinct interstitial HRCT patterns are five: septal, reticular, nodular, cystic, ground-glass, and decreased lung attenuation pattern. Although each HRCT pattern encompasses many different interstitial lung entities, the contrary may also occur; namely, one entity may present with many different patterns and have many different "faces". To make things even more complicated, there may be an overlap of HRCT patterns in one entity. In everyday clinical practice, one should try to combine the different HRCT patterns or identify the predominant pattern to make the correct diagnosis. Integration of HRCT findings with clinical findings and knowledge of acute or chronic symptoms is crucial to reach the correct diagnosis.

### The relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1168mkzy]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography (CT) measurements of air trapping and emphysema in a population of former heavy smokers with and without airflow limitation, a study was conducted.

In this study, 248 subjects were assessed, including 50 normal smokers, 50 with mild obstruction, 50 with moderate obstruction, 50 with severe obstruction, and 48 with very severe obstruction. CT emphysema and CT air trapping were quantified on paired inspiratory and end-expiratory CT examinations using various available quantification methods. CT measurements were analyzed in relation to lung function (FEV1, FEV1/FVC, RV/TLC, Kco) using univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.

Quantitative CT measurements of emphysema and air trapping were found to be strongly correlated with airflow limitation, with univariate r-squared values reaching up to 0.72 (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the combination of CT emphysema and CT air trapping explained 68–83% of the variability in airflow limitation across the full range of airflow limitation in the subjects (p < 0.001).

The study concludes that the combination of quantitative CT air trapping and emphysema measurements is strongly associated with lung function impairment in former heavy smokers with a wide range of airflow limitation.

### Potential interstitial lung abnormalities on chest X-rays prior to symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112X5r8e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The fact that a significant proportion of patients in whom either a chest X-ray or a CT scan had been done for some other reason, prior to the start of symptoms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is of interest. Interstitial lung abnormalities are found on CT scans of 2–9% of older adults. When followed up, interstitial lung abnormalities are oftentimes progressive, associating with respiratory symptoms and increased mortality. However, as far as we are aware, it is not known what proportion of patients with IPF had potential interstitial lung abnormalities on previous imaging. The proportion of 58% that we found on chest X-rays is very high. Furthermore, these chest X-rays were done a median of 44.5 months prior to the start of symptoms, indicating that subclinical disease can be present for a long time in many patients.

This would suggest that screening certain populations at high risk for IPF might be worthwhile, as there would be ample time for intervention and halting disease progression. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is presently unknown whether treatment with antifibrotic medication can prevent the progression of interstitial lung abnormalities. Furthermore, it is not known whether the abnormalities seen on the chest X-rays represent the same clinical entity as interstitial lung abnormalities seen on chest CT scans. The latter are often subtle changes that are not visible on chest X-rays and might represent a much earlier stage of fibrosis.

We were not able to explore precisely how the radiology reports that mentioned potential interstitial lung abnormalities.

### Quantitative computerized two-point correlation analysis of lung CT scans correlates with pulmonary function in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^113hmc1T]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Chest CT scans are commonly used to clinically assess disease severity in patients presenting with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Despite their ability to reliably detect subtle changes in lung disease, the utility of chest CT scans for guiding therapy is limited because image interpretation by radiologists is qualitative and highly variable. We sought to create a computerized CT image analysis tool that would provide quantitative and clinically relevant information.

- **Methods**: We established that a two-point correlation analysis approach reduced the background signal attendant to normal lung structures, such as blood vessels, airways, and lymphatics while highlighting diseased tissue. This approach was applied to multiple lung fields to generate an overall lung texture score (LTS) representing the quantity of diseased lung parenchyma. Using deidentified lung CT scan and pulmonary function test (PFT) data from The Ohio State University Medical Center's Information Warehouse, we analyzed 71 consecutive CT scans from patients with sarcoidosis for whom simultaneous matching PFTs were available to determine whether the LTS correlated with standard PFT results.

- **Results**: We found a high correlation between LTS and FVC, total lung capacity, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (P < .0001 for all comparisons). Moreover, LTS was equivalent to PFTs for the detection of active lung disease. The image analysis protocol was conducted quickly (< 1 min per study) on a standard laptop computer connected to a publicly available National Institutes of Health resource.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: An official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^1125NABc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

- **Evidence-based suggestions for follow-up assessment**: We suggest that patients with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) undergo a follow-up chest CT scan 2–3 years after the baseline chest CT scan. Earlier follow-up (12 months) may be appropriate in some clinical contexts. The frequency of subsequent follow-up chest CT scans depends on multiple factors, including evidence for progression of the ILAs on the initial follow-up chest CT scan. This suggestion was approved by 34 of 36 votes (94%).

- **Evidence base**: Fifteen studies performed serial chest CT scans in patients with ILAs and associated radiologic progression with outcomes. The frequency of repeat chest CT scanning ranged from 2 to 12 years, although most studies repeated imaging every 2–5 years. All studies measured the prevalence of radiologic progression; after eliminating outliers, the prevalence was 46% (95% CI, 38–55%). Two studies identified a positive association between radiologic progression and mortality (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3–2.8; and HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.21–2.34, respectively), whereas a third study found no association.

- **Rationale**: For patients with ILAs, the primary purpose of follow-up imaging is to identify progression to interstitial lung disease (ILD) because further diagnostic workup may be warranted to inform management and therapeutic decisions and to mitigate lung function decline. The evidence suggests that, for every 1,000 patients with ILAs, 460 will experience progression.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^116bYEue]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Our March 2021 edition of this review showed thoracic imaging computed tomography (CT) to be sensitive and moderately specific in diagnosing COVID‐19 pneumonia. This new edition is an update of the review.

- **Objectives**: Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging in people with suspected COVID‐19; assess the rate of positive imaging in people who had an initial reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) negative result and a positive RT‐PCR result on follow‐up; and evaluate the accuracy of thoracic imaging for screening COVID‐19 in asymptomatic individuals. The secondary objective was to assess threshold effects of index test positivity on accuracy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID‐19 publications through to 17 February 2021. We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included diagnostic accuracy studies of all designs, except for case‐control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID‐19. Studies had to assess chest CT, chest X‐ray, or ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID‐19, use a reference standard that included RT‐PCR, and report estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which we could compute estimates. We excluded studies that used imaging as part of the reference standard and studies that excluded participants with normal index test results.

### Computed tomographic thoracic morphologic indices in normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Comparison with spiral CT densitometry and pulmonary function tests [^114pZjPb]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To determine which computed tomographic (CT) dimensions can predict obstructive lung disease on routine chest CT scans, morphological and densitometric CT findings were compared with pulmonary function tests (PFT) in both normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Consecutive patients (n = 646; 260 females and 386 males; mean age 54.9 years, ranging from 20 to 90 years) who received chest CT scans with densitometry during a 3-month period were retrospectively analyzed in a single center. PFT was conducted in 235 patients (152 males, 83 females) simultaneously with CT scanning. The patients were grouped by age (61 years). CT parameters, including tracheal, azygoesophageal, thoracic vertical, anterior-posterior (AP), transverse diameters, transverse cardiac diameter, diameters of main, right, and left pulmonary arteries, and CT densitometric values such as lung volume and density (-900 to -1000 Hounsfield Units, HU), low attenuation value cluster (default threshold: -950 HU), were compared with PFT values. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationship between the CT indices and PFT.

Ninety of the 235 patients with PFT were smokers (76 males, 14 females). Obstructive PFT was detected in 65 patients (27.7%: 46 males, 19 females). Male smokers with obstructive PFT exhibited significantly larger thoracic anterior-posterior (mean: normal, 172.3 cm versus COPD, 185.9 cm, p = 0.0001) and smaller transverse diameters (mean: normal, 247.0 cm vs. COPD, 235.8 cm).

### High-resolution CT scanning: potential outcome measure [^115UHNTt]. Current opinion in pulmonary medicine (2004). Low credibility.

High-resolution CT (HRCT) imaging of the chest can provide both structural and functional lung analysis useful to evaluate initial and progressive cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Chest HRCT scoring systems have been used to evaluate the extent and severity of CF-specific airway and lung parenchymal disease. This review summarizes recent developments in HRCT and volumetric chest CT imaging, CF chest CT scoring systems, and reviews how HRCT/volumetric CT can provide useful outcome measures for future CF clinical research.

- **Recent findings**: Early manifestations of CF lung disease determined by chest CT/HRCT imaging in CF infants and children with mild disease include regional air trapping and bronchial wall thickness. The distribution of findings in more progressed CF lung disease is heterogeneous, with a significant amount of non-homogeneity in progressive lung pathology. Recent CF studies have used new clinical CT parameters such as quantitative air trapping, quantitative airway measurements, and a composite CT/pulmonary function test (PFT) score. These appear to be promising new outcome measures that are more sensitive than global pulmonary function measurements or total chest CT scores in discriminating early or mild CF lung disease and treatment effects during clinical interventions.

Chest HRCT and volumetric CT imaging can detect regional CF lung changes before changes in global pulmonary function measurements. Chest HRCT scoring has been used in descriptive studies defining CF lung disease severity.

### Quantitative CT analysis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and correlation with lung function study [^114Ydobc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an unexplained, irreversible, chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by a progressive decline in lung function, for which there is a lack of effective treatment and a low survival rate. The prevalence of IPF is increasing in elderly patients, with a median survival of 3–5 years. High-resolution CT (HRCT) is the most accurate test for the noninvasive diagnosis of IPF, which manifests as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on HRCT images or surgical lung biopsy.

Lung function can reflect the disease progression of patients with IPF, assess the severity of the disease, and predict the disease prognosis. However, pulmonary function tests require the active cooperation of patients. The results are significantly affected when patients do not cooperate for personal reasons. For patients with serious conditions, completing the pulmonary function test may even be impossible. Therefore, qualified pulmonary function tests are not applicable to elderly patients who cannot cooperate and those with acute exacerbation or an advanced stage of IPF.

With the advent of new computer technologies, quantitative CT techniques are developing into viable tools. Quantitative chest CT technology, which allows chest CT images to be reconstructed and calculated by appropriate software, is gradually gaining wide acceptance due to its objectivity and ability to reflect histological features. It has great potential in the assessment of interstitial lung diseases such as IPF.

### Systematic review of evidence for relationships between physiological and CT indices of small airways and clinical outcomes in COPD [^117BQW5y]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Small airways disease (SAD) is considered pivotal in the pathology of COPD. There are numerous publications describing physiological and computed tomography (CT) imaging markers to detect SAD. However, there is no agreed gold standard and limited understanding of the clinical associations of these measures to disease outcomes.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review using Embase, Medline, and PubMed to explore the relationship between physiological and CT SAD measures in COPD (GOLD Stages 1–4). Furthermore, evidence linking these physiological measures with defined clinical outcomes such as health status, functional assessment, and exacerbation frequency was summarised.

- **Results**: The search yielded 1160 abstracts, of which 19 met the search criteria. Six studies examined physiological and CT measures, while 13 publications identified physiological measures and clinical outcomes. Strong correlations were seen between CT and physiological measures of SAD. Varying associations between physiological measures and defined clinical outcomes were noted.

- **Conclusions**: Physiological and CT measures of SAD correlate and infer similar information. Physiological measures of SAD may offer valuable insight into the clinical expression of the disease. A consensus on the standardisation and recommendation of tests to measure SAD is needed to better understand any clinical benefits of targeted drug therapy to the small airways.

### Post-discharge chest CT findings and pulmonary function tests in severe COVID-19 patients [^117DxzUX]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) findings in severe COVID-19 patients after discharge and to correlate CT pulmonary involvement with PFT results.

- **Methods**: COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between February 25 and May 2, 2020, were retrospectively included according to the following criteria: (a) COVID-19 defined as severe based on the WHO interim guidance (i.e. clinical signs of pneumonia plus respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, and/or SpO2 < 90% on room air); (b) chest radiograph in the acute setting; (c) post-discharge unenhanced chest CT; and (d) post-discharge comprehensive PFT. Imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated in consensus by two readers, and the volume of abnormal lung was measured on CT using 3D Slicer software. Differences between demographics, comorbidities, acute radiographic findings, PFT, and post-discharge clinical and laboratory data of patients with normal and abnormal CT findings were assessed by Mann-Whitney or Fisher tests, and the compromised lung volume-PFT association by Pearson correlation after removing possible outliers.

- **Results**: At a median of 105 days from symptom onset, 74 of 91 (81%) patients had CT abnormalities. The most common CT pattern was a combination of ground-glass opacity and reticular pattern (46 of 74, 62%), along with architectural distortion (68 of 74, 92%) and bronchial dilatation (66 of 74, 89%). Compromised lung volume had a median value of 15% [11–23], was higher in dyspneic patients, and negatively correlated with the percentage of predicted.
