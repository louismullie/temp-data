## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best reflects Howard Becker's sociological view of cannabis use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Becker's core theoretical framework and whether it treats drug use as learned behavior. Then, I should verify which answer choice aligns with the concept of a "deviant career" and social learning. Next, I will examine the distractors that sound plausible but conflict with Becker's perspective, such as the gateway hypothesis or moralistic framing. Finally, I will confirm the best match and briefly justify why the alternatives are incorrect based on Becker's symbolic interactionist approach.

> Let me first confirm Becker's theoretical stance. Becker's classic work, particularly in Outsiders, analyzes marijuana use as a social process whereby novices learn to perceive effects, manage stigma, and integrate use into their identity through interaction with more experienced users; this is the essence of a "deviant career" shaped by social learning and labeling, not by pharmacological determinism or moral condemnation [^notfound].

> Now, I should review the options and identify the closest match. Option G states that cannabis use is learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career, which directly mirrors Becker's argument that use is acquired via social interaction, shared meanings, and progressive involvement in a deviant subculture, rather than being innate or purely pharmacologically driven [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the common distractors. The gateway hypothesis (Option C) is a different causal claim about progression to harder drugs and is not Becker's focus; Becker emphasizes learning and socialization, not a pharmacological or sequential escalation model, so C is inconsistent with his perspective. Similarly, Options A and H reflect moralistic or regulatory framings that Becker, as a sociologist of deviance, would treat as part of the social construction of deviance rather than as his analytical conclusion about use itself [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should also check the other plausible-sounding options. Option J, rebellion against societal norms, might seem attractive, but Becker's analysis is more precise: rebellion is a possible meaning users attach, yet his core point is that use is learned through social processes and shared definitions, not that rebellion is the defining feature; thus G remains the better, more theoretically faithful choice. Options D, E, and F make empirical claims about prevalence or enjoyment that are not Becker's central theoretical proposition, so they do not capture his distinctive contribution [^notfound].

> I will now examine why G is the best answer. Becker documents how novices learn to recognize effects, manage stigma, and develop a deviant identity through interaction, which is precisely a gradual, socially mediated "deviant career". This aligns with symbolic interactionism and labeling theory, distinguishing his account from individualistic or pharmacological explanations and from simple rebellion narratives [^notfound].

> Final answer: G. Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career, reflecting his sociological analysis of how users acquire knowledge, meanings, and identities via social interaction and progressive involvement in a deviant subculture [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **G. learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career**. Howard Becker's classic work shows that cannabis use is not innate or automatic; rather, it is a socially learned behavior acquired through interaction with experienced users, the development of shared meanings, and progressive involvement in a deviant subculture. This process unfolds over time as novices learn to perceive effects, manage stigma, and integrate use into their identity, illustrating Becker's concept of a "deviant career" [^notfound].

## Becker's sociological perspective on cannabis use

Becker's analysis is grounded in **symbolic interactionism**, emphasizing how individuals construct meaning through social interaction. He argues that cannabis use is not inherently pleasurable or meaningful; instead, users must learn to interpret its effects and integrate them into their social world. This learning occurs through a series of stages, collectively termed a "deviant career", which includes:

- **Initial exposure**: Novices are introduced to cannabis in social settings where experienced users guide them through the experience, teaching them how to inhale, recognize effects, and interpret sensations.

- **Learning to perceive effects**: New users often do not initially feel the intended effects. Through repeated use and coaching, they learn to identify and label these sensations, aligning their perceptions with those of experienced users.

- **Developing shared meanings**: Users collectively construct meanings around cannabis use, including its pleasurable aspects, social acceptability within the group, and strategies for managing stigma from outsiders.

- **Progressive involvement**: Over time, users deepen their involvement, adopting the identity of a "marijuana user" and participating in the broader subculture, including rituals, slang, and social norms.

---

## The concept of a "deviant career"

Becker's notion of a "deviant career" describes the **processual nature** of learning deviant behavior, such as cannabis use. Key features include:

- **Sequential stages**: The career unfolds in predictable stages, from initial experimentation to regular use and potential identification with the deviant subculture.

- **Social learning**: Each stage involves learning from others, acquiring skills, and internalizing norms and values associated with the behavior.

- **Identity transformation**: Individuals gradually adopt a deviant identity, reshaping their self-concept and social relationships.

- **Management of stigma**: Users develop strategies to cope with societal stigma, such as secrecy, rationalization, or selective association with like-minded individuals.

---

## Empirical evidence supporting Becker's theory

Becker's theory is supported by **ethnographic research** and qualitative studies that document the social processes underlying cannabis use. These studies consistently show that novice users require guidance to perceive effects, interpret experiences, and navigate the social context of use. They also highlight the role of peer influence, shared rituals, and collective identity formation in sustaining use.

---

## Critiques and limitations of Becker's theory

While Becker's theory has been influential, it has also faced **critiques**:

- **Overemphasis on social learning**: Critics argue that Becker underestimates physiological or psychological factors that may predispose individuals to drug use.

- **Neglect of structural factors**: The theory focuses on micro-level interactions, potentially overlooking broader social, economic, or political influences on drug use patterns.

- **Historical specificity**: Becker's work was conducted in the 1950s and may reflect historical and cultural contexts that differ from contemporary drug use patterns.

---

## Comparison with other sociological theories

Becker's perspective contrasts with other sociological theories of drug use:

| **Theory** | **Key focus** | **View of cannabis use** |
|-|-|-|
| Becker's labeling theory | Social construction of deviance; learning through interaction | Learned behavior acquired through social processes |
| Social control theory | Bonds to conventional society; lack of attachment | Weak social bonds enable deviance, including drug use |
| Strain theory | Structural pressures; goal-means disjunction | Drug use as a response to social strain or inequality |
| Subcultural theory | Group norms and values | Drug use as part of subcultural identity and resistance |

---

## Contemporary relevance and policy implications

Becker's theory remains relevant for understanding contemporary cannabis use, particularly as legalization and normalization reshape social meanings. It underscores the need for **public health approaches** that address social learning, peer influence, and identity formation, rather than relying solely on punitive measures. Policies that recognize the social dimensions of use — such as education, harm reduction, and community-based interventions — align more closely with Becker's insights.

---

## Conclusion

Becker's analysis demonstrates that cannabis use is **learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career**, involving interaction, shared meanings, and identity transformation. This perspective highlights the social construction of deviance and the importance of addressing the social contexts that shape drug use behaviors.

3 RESULTS

Our analyses address all nine of our preregistered hypotheses. To focus on the most meaningful findings, we report our behavioural and cortical findings, as well as the relationships between cortical activation and each ratings of enjoyment and recognition of performed movements in the manuscript. Our findings pertaining to relationships between cortical activation and each ratings of others' abilities to synchrony, empathy, and ratings of enjoyment during mirroring are reported in the Supplementary Materials A.

3.1 Behaviour

We first assessed the relationship between ratings of enjoyment and objectively measured movement synchrony. In line with our hypotheses (1 and 2), we observed a positive association between enjoyment and measured synchrony (ß = 4.33, HPD = [3.58, 5.08]; Figure 2a). We also found that observers rated performed compared to unknown movements as more enjoyable to watch (ß = 3.14, HPD = [0.82, 5.36]; Figure 2b).

### Why the IOM recommendations for vitamin D are deficient [^e568c0e3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail in a major way on logic, on science, and on effective public health guidance. Moreover, by failing to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach constitutes precisely the wrong model for development of nutritional policy.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^dc64b4b4]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

Sensitivity analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding trials with high or unknown risk of bias; excluding trials with high risk or unknown risk of bias of the different domains; excluding quasi randomised or cluster randomised trials; excluding the largest trial; excluding trials with a follow-up of less than one year; using random effect models; adding trials that had been excluded for using vitamin D administered with calcium; adding trials that had been excluded for using hydroxylated vitamin D or vitamin D analogues; and using trial duration rather than long term follow-up.

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing of results. The results will be disseminated to a wide audience, including members of the public, patients, health professionals, and experts in the specialty through social media and networks.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^110c9d1c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

### Questions to measure enjoyment of and satisfaction with physical activity: are they appropriate for use in an older population? [^fd6338c7]. Innovation in Aging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Enjoyment of and satisfaction with physical activity have been proposed as two actionable mechanisms to promote sustained engagement in physical activity. An accurate understanding of how, why, and for whom these two mechanisms work (or not) in response to a particular intervention strategy is contingent on having suitable measures for the population of interest. This study aims to determine whether the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale-8 and a novel approach to the measurement of satisfaction with physical activity are suitable for use among older adults (M age = 66.25 years; range = 55–91 years).

Research Design and Methods

Participants answered an online questionnaire twice across 4 weeks. Measurement invariance was assessed within a structural equation modeling framework; convergent validity was assessed by correlating the latent variables enjoyment and satisfaction with each other and with physical activity behavior.

Results

Both measures were invariant between gender and across time. Enjoyment and satisfaction were related to each other (r = 0.72) and to physical activity (r = 0.48 and 0.64, respectively).

Discussion and Implications

Results support the suitability of these measures as tools to assess enjoyment of and satisfaction with physical activity among older adults.

### Vitamin D and child health: part 2 (extraskeletal and other aspects) [^f52ddd92]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Awareness of embodiment enhances enjoyment and engages sensorimotor cortices [^4272f054]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Whether in performing arts, sporting, or everyday contexts, when we watch others move, we tend to enjoy bodies moving in synchrony. Our enjoyment of body movements is further enhanced by our own prior experience with performing those movements, or our 'embodied experience'. The relationships between movement synchrony and enjoyment, as well as embodied experience and movement enjoyment, are well known. The interaction between enjoyment of movements, synchrony, and embodiment is less well understood, and may be central for developing new approaches for enriching social interaction. To examine the interplay between movement enjoyment, synchrony, and embodiment, we asked participants to copy another person's movements as accurately as possible, thereby gaining embodied experience of movement sequences. Participants then viewed other dyads performing the same or different sequences synchronously, and we assessed participants' recognition of having performed these sequences, as well as their enjoyment of each movement sequence. We used functional near‐infrared spectroscopy to measure cortical activation over frontotemporal sensorimotor regions while participants performed and viewed movements. We found that enjoyment was greatest when participants had mirrored the sequence and recognised it, suggesting that awareness of embodiment may be central to enjoyment of synchronous movements. Exploratory analyses of relationships between cortical activation and enjoyment and recognition implicated the sensorimotor cortices, which subserve action observation and aesthetic processing. These findings hold implications for clinical research and therapies seeking to foster successful social interaction.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8247842f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Consensus and controversial aspects of vitamin D and COVID-19 [^340ac2a4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This work aims to review and discuss controversial topics in the field of vitamin D, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19.

Methods

The International Conferences "Controversies in Vitamin D" are a series of workshops that started in 2017 featuring international experts and leaders in vitamin D research and clinical practice. The fifth annual conference was held in Stresa, Italy, September 15 to 18, 2021.

Evidence

Before the event, participants reviewed available studies on their assigned topic, drafted a related abstract, and presented their findings at the time of the conference. Relevant literature that became available since was also discussed within the panel and updated accordingly.

Consensus

Before the event, the drafted abstracts had been merged to prepare a preliminary document. After the conference presentations, in-depth discussions in open sessions led to consensus. The document was subsequently modified according to discussions and up-to-date literature inclusion.

Conclusions

There is quite consistent evidence for an association between low 25 OH vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and poor COVID-19 outcomes, despite heterogeneous publications of variable quality. However, the low vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients might also reflect reverse causality. Vitamin D supplementation might have a positive role in COVID-19 prevention. The evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 complications is conflicting. Conclusive statements regarding the beneficial effect of vitamin D in this context await high-quality, randomized controlled trials.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^63a00243]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes". It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention", and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined", considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### Cannabis and teens… [^ae9f6c2e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What you need to know about cannabis use and teens The teen years are a time of growth, exploration, and risk-taking. Some risk-taking may foster identity development and independence. However, some risk behaviors — such as using cannabis — can have adverse effects on a teen's health and well-being. Cannabis and the teen brain The teen brain is actively developing and continues to develop until around age 25. Cannabis use during adolescence and young adulthood may harm the developing brain. Compared with teens who do not use cannabis, teens who use cannabis are more likely to quit high school or not get a college degree. Negative effects of teen cannabis use Negative effects include:

- Difficulty thinking and problem-solving
- Problems with memory and learning
- Reduced coordination
- Difficulty maintaining attention
- Problems with school and social life.

The association between cannabis and schizophrenia is stronger in people who start using cannabis at an earlier age and use cannabis more frequently. Impaired driving. Driving while impaired by any substance, including cannabis, is dangerous and illegal. Cannabis negatively affects several skills required for safe driving, such as reaction time, coordination, and concentration. Potential for addiction. Approximately 3 in 10 people who use cannabis have cannabis use disorder. Some signs and symptoms of cannabis use disorder include trying but failing to quit using cannabis or giving up important activities with friends and family in favor of using cannabis. The risk of developing cannabis use disorder is stronger in people who start using cannabis during youth or adolescence and who use cannabis more frequently. How can you educate yourself and others. What teens can do Learn the factsabout cannabis use so that you can make informed decisions.

Share information that you learnwith friends, parents/guardians, teachers, and others. Choose not to driveif you are planning to use, are using, or have used cannabis. What parents can do Talk with your children aboutthe risks of using cannabis while their brains are still developing. Ask your children questions about their cannabis use. Know the facts about cannabis. People that begin using cannabis in their teens are more likely to have lasting brain developmental effects and a higher potential for cannabis use disorder.

4 DISCUSSION

In the present study, we set out to examine the influence of embodying movements on enjoyment of dyadic synchronised movement. We draw five main conclusions from our analyses. First, we replicated previous work demonstrating that greater objectively measured movement synchrony corresponds with greater enjoyment reported by observers. We further established that synchronous movements are most appreciated when the observer recognises the movements as a sequence they have performed themselves. Second, we found that enjoyment is positively associated with observers' ratings of how well other people achieve synchrony and negatively associated with cognitive empathy scores–yet neither of these effects are differentially sensitive to embodiment or recognition of having performed the movements. Third, recordings of cortical activation revealed that observing dyads move in synchrony evoked greater cortical activation in right IFG and bilateral STG, with no substantial difference observed between performed and unknown movements. Finally, we found preliminary evidence for the cortical mechanisms underpinning enjoyment of synchronous movements (left STG), and awareness of embodiment (left IFG and STG, right STG and IPL).

4.1 Behaviour: Enjoyment, embodiment, empathy, and recognition

4.1.1 Awareness of embodiment can enhance enjoyment of synchrony

Our analyses replicate previous findings that observers' enjoyment of dyadic movements increases in concert with the level of synchrony of dyadic movements (Moffat & Cross; Vicary et al.). We also found that participants reported the greatest enjoyment of movement sequences when they were aware of having mirrored the same movements themselves (Figure 2b). This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that embodiment has a positive influence on enjoyment of observed movement (Kirsch et al; Kirsch & Cross). Furthermore, this finding provides new insight into the influence of awareness of embodiment on action aesthetics. Specifically, awareness of embodiment shapes enjoyment of synchronous movements. A potential reason for this is that our approach of assessing embodiment through recall may have prompted observers to evaluate movement sequences analytically. Analytical evaluation involves tracking distinctive features rather than evaluating the movements holistically (Whittlesea & Price,), which may boost familiarity with stimuli, in this case movement sequences, thereby enhancing enjoyment.

### Cannabis and other drugs… [^f482812a]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- People of any age, sex, or economic status can develop a substance use disorder for cannabis or other drugs.
- There is limited evidence suggesting that using cannabis increases the risk of using other drugs. What is known about the risk of using other drugs Researchers disagree on whether cannabis is a "gateway drug" — the idea that cannabis use leads a person to use other more dangerous drugs, like cocaine or heroin. However, there is limited evidence suggesting that using cannabis increases the risk of using other drugs. Most people who use cannabis do not go on to use other, "harder" drugs. People of any age, sex, or economic status can develop a substance use disorder for cannabis or other drugs.

The following things can affect the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder:

- Family history
- Having another mental health illness
- Having peers with substance use disorder
- Loneliness or social isolation
- Lack of family involvement
- Drug availability

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Everybody's working for the weekend: changes in enjoyment of everyday activities across the retirement threshold [^bada1479]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Background

the aim of this study was to explore the associations between use of time and momentary hedonic affect ('enjoyment') in adults in the peri-retirement period.

Methods

a total of 124 adults [61 males, 63 females; age 62 (4) years] completed a computerised use-of-time recall on 4 days at each of four time points (3–6 months pre-, 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement), as well as surveys regarding self-reported health, well-being, sleep quality and loneliness. They reported how much they enjoyed each activity on a 0–10 scale. An individual Enjoyment Index was calculated as the time-weighted average of each participant's enjoyment ratings. Time-weighted enjoyment ratings were also calculated for nine mutually exclusive and exhaustive activity domains (Sleep, Chores, Work, Social, Screen Time, Self-care, Quiet Time, Transport, Physical Activity) and sub-domains.

Results

the mean (± SD) Enjoyment Index was 7.43 ± 0.61, and was significantly and positively associated with well-being (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001) and sleep quality (P = 0.03 to P < 0.0001), and negatively associated with loneliness (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001). Mean Enjoyment Index values increased significantly (P < 0.0001) from pre-retirement (7.19 ± 0.82) to post-retirement (7.46 ± 0.89, 7.42 ± 0.91 and 7.49 ± 0.89 at 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement). There were significant differences in enjoyment across domains, with Physical Activity (7.86 ± 1.11) and Social (7.66 ± 0.85) being the most enjoyable, and Work (7.10 ± 0.89) and Chores (7.09 ± 0.85) the least enjoyable.

Conclusion

enjoyment of everyday activities increased after retirement and remained elevated for at least 12 months. Work appears to constitute a relative hedonic deficit.

### Association between subjective well-being and living longer without disability or illness [^95ae6d44]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Other Measures

Mortality was ascertained from linked register data with follow-up censored in March 2013.

Enjoyment of life was measured at baseline (2002–2003, wave 1) with 4 items from the CASP-19 quality of life instrument, as described previously. Each item ("I enjoy the things that I do"; "I enjoy being in the company of others"; "On balance, I look back on my life with a sense of happiness"; "I feel full of energy these days") was assessed on a 4-point scale from 0, indicating never, to 3, indicating often, and was subsequently coded as 0, never or rarely and 1, sometimes and often. The 4 binary items were summed to generate the number of items for which enjoyment was reported, with a score ranging from 0 to 4. To interpret the meaning of high enjoyment more specifically, from this score we generated a variable for higher enjoyment defined as 0 indicating no enjoyment if reported fewer than 2 scores and 1 indicating high enjoyment if reported 3 to 4 scores (ie, enjoyment on 3 or 4 of the items).

Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline (2002–2003, wave 1) using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Participants were asked whether they had experienced each item much of the time during the past week. The scale had good internal consistency at each wave (Cronbach α ≥ 0.95). A score of 4 or more was used to indicate elevated depressive symptoms, which corresponds to the cut point of 16 or more on the full 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.

From responses to the 2 levels of enjoyment of life and the 2 levels of depression, we generated a categorical variable with the following categories: (1) low enjoyment of life and depressive symptoms, (2) high enjoyment and depressive symptoms, (3) low enjoyment and no depression, and (4) high enjoyment and no depression.

Socioeconomic status at baseline was indexed by 3 equal tertiles of total household wealth, including financial wealth (savings and investments), the value of any home and other property (less mortgage), the value of any business assets, and physical wealth, such as artwork and jewelry, net of debt.

From information on marital and cohabiting status, we derived a dichotomous variable for cohabiting with a partner (0, currently cohabiting with a partner whether married or not and 1, currently not cohabiting with a partner).

### Awareness of embodiment enhances enjoyment and engages sensorimotor cortices [^927a9ae6]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

4.2.2 Enjoyment

We found enjoyment to be positively associated with activation in left STG for performed and unknown movements (Figure 4; top row). The parameter estimates are identical for performed and unknown movements, with a negligibly smaller 95% HPD for performed than unknown movements (Table S9 in Supplementary Materials A). In other words, embodiment induced by mirroring sequences did not modulate the relationship between enjoyment and cortical activation in left STG.

Our findings differ from those reported by Kirsch et al. though our study design is quite similar. Kirsch et al. recorded brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a four‐day full‐body movement training intervention using a dance video‐game. Kirsch et al. report that prior to training (comparable to unknown movements in this study), enjoyment of observed movements correlated with activation in subcortical regions, including the subthalamus and nucleus accumbens. After training (comparable to performed movements in this study), they observed that activation in bilateral STG and right middle temporal gyrus correlated with enjoyment. Finally, when contrasting post versus pre training, they found the left STG to be specifically sensitive to enjoyment after participants had gained experience with movements. Here, we found that left STG activation was contingent on enjoyment but not embodiment. This difference may be related to an underlying difference in the 'strength' of the embodiment of movements.

In Kirsch et al.'s study, participants aimed to learn dance movements and were scored on their performance by a computer algorithm implemented in a video game context. Our participants did not aim to learn movements, rather to mirror them as precisely as possible, and where possible to recognise the sequence. The present study thus does not tap into the same link between strongly embodied experience and enjoyment, but rather the link between minimally or briefly embodied experience and enjoyment. Future research could explore the extent to which attentional mechanisms play a role in behavioural and cortical measures of enjoyment of movements, with particular scrutiny of the trajectory from minimally to more strongly embodied movements, as well as on movements performed in an imitation for imitation's sake context, and those performed in a longer‐term learning/retention context.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^08be1b6f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^fdc15763]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the VDR has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of the evaluation of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international societies and guidelines can differ due to the different approaches used, including clinical perspectives (level of cutoff at which no individual has an undesirable outcome) or public health perspectives (level of cutoff at which 97.5% of individuals do not have an undesirable outcome). Another critical issue is the lack of an accepted laboratory test assay standardization, and this prevents a proper interpretation of data reported by different studies, resulting in enabling rational data pooling and implementation of meta-analyses focused on vitamin D influence in various clinical outcomes of interest. Thus, 25(OH)D laboratory assays should be monitored in their performance through external quality assessment plans providing target reference values from standardized measurement procedures.

### Vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 virus / COVID-19 disease [^bf533f9a]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

### Sustained enjoyment of life and mortality at older ages: analysis of the english longitudinal study of ageing [^b927978d]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test whether the number of reports of enjoyment of life over a four year period is quantitatively associated with all cause mortality, and with death from cardiovascular disease and from other causes.

Design and Setting

Longitudinal observational population study using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), a nationally representative sample of older men and women living in England.

Participants

9365 men and women aged 50 years or older (mean 63, standard deviation 9.3) at recruitment.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to death, based on mortality between the third phase of data collection (wave 3 in 2006) and March 2013 (up to seven years).

Results

Subjective wellbeing with measures of enjoyment of life were assessed in 2002 (wave 1), 2004 (wave 2), and 2006 (wave 3). 2264 (24%) respondents reported no enjoyment of life on any assessment, with 1833 (20%) reporting high enjoyment on one report of high enjoyment of life, 2063 (22%) on two reports, and 3205 (34%) on all three occasions. 1310 deaths were recorded during follow-up. Mortality was inversely associated with the number of occasions on which participants reported high enjoyment of life. Compared with the no high enjoyment group, the hazard ratio for all cause mortality was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.99) for two reports of enjoyment of life, and 0.76 (0.64 to 0.89) for three reports, after adjustment for demographic factors, baseline health, mobility impairment, and depressive symptoms. The same association was observed after deaths occurring within two years of the third enjoyment measure were excluded (0.90 (0.85 to 0.95) for every additional report of enjoyment), and in the complete case analysis (0.90 (0.83 to 0.96)).

Conclusions

This is an observational study, so causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, the results add a new dimension to understanding the significance of subjective wellbeing for health outcomes by documenting the importance of sustained wellbeing over time.

### Vitamin D and schizophrenia: 20 years on… [^ff1fac18]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

With respect to continuous data from the patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), based on seven studies, the SMD was (−0.29, 95% CI [−0.65, 0.07], p = 0.11). Again, high heterogeneity was observed (I 2 = 75.49%, Q (df = 6) = 21.89, p < 0.0013) (Supplementary Fig. 4). We identified five studies reporting OR for vitamin D deficiency (at least < 50 nmol/l) in FEP patients. The pooled OR was 3.78 (95% CI [2.40, 5.94], p < 0.0001). No heterogeneity was detected (I 2 = 0%, Q (df = 4) = 3.01, p = 0.56) (Supplementary Fig. 5). The findings provide robust evidence confirming earlier smaller meta-analyses that those with schizophrenia have an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. However this finding is also consistent with the finding that poor health in general (mental or physical disorders) can lead to vitamin D deficiency mediated by poor diet, reduced physical activity and changes to behavior which are all factors known to increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^64721196]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)", specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years", and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)". For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses". The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications", citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings". The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology".

### Factors influencing physical activity in adults with cystic fibrosis [^789761b2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Enjoyment

Participants who expressed positive attitudes towards and enjoyment of PA: "It's always been a positive, I have been really active most of my life now" (Kevin, 33); "Yeah, very positive. I feel the more exercise I do, the better I feel" (Richard, 49), seemed to engage in more regular PA: "I go to the gym five days a week; I do twenty-five minutes of cardio and then I do one particular muscle" (Kevin, 33), and "I'm very active, I'd get up at 7 o'clock I go for a 3 km run… then in the afternoon I go to the gym for an hour weight session. And I do that for 2 days and then I have the third day off… then I go through all that again" (Robert, 41). Exercise enjoyment appeared to be a motivating factor for adherence: "I think the main thing is to do something you enjoy. Anytime I've been successful at kind of maintaining sport, it's just doing something I enjoy" (William, 34); "I suppose… the main reason is, I enjoy it" (Matthew, 28).

In contrast, some participants reported a lack of enjoyment as a reason for their physical inactivity: "None of it. I'm going to be very honest with you, I do not enjoy PA at all" (Eric, 50); "To be honest, I don't particularly enjoy it!" (Mary, 30); "Mainly, I just don't like exercise" (Peter, 19), which was typically underpinned by poor engagement: "At the moment I would say my PA is pretty much zero… I haven't been doing much exercise" (Peter, 19), and/or negative past experiences with PA: "Very negative. For me, PA was just hard" (Jenny, 44); "I suppose negative. I wouldn't be going to the gym. I wouldn't be interested in any of that" (Eric, 50).

### The association between and development of school enjoyment and general knowledge [^6635d4aa]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

Learning environments can support the development of foundational knowledge and promote children's attitudes toward learning and school. This study explores the relation between school enjoyment and general knowledge from preschool (2016–2017) to kindergarten (2017–2018) in 1359 children (M age = 55, 61months, female = 50%; 58.5% Hispanic, 17% Black, 10% Asian, 10% White, 5% multiracial/other; linguistically diverse). Cross-lagged panel models showed significant bidirectional associations between preschool enjoyment and change in general knowledge from preschool to kindergarten with a standardized coefficient of β = .21 (p < .001) and associations between preschool general knowledge and change in enjoyment, β = .09 (p = .015). Exploratory analyses with teacher characteristics and demographic subgroup comparisons are discussed. These associations suggest the potential intervention strategy of promoting early school enjoyment to support broader academic development.

### Improving staff enjoyment at work in a community mental health team: a quality improvement project [^03769847]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Staffing has been a significant problem for our community rehabilitation team in the past with high vacancy rates, sickness and turnover, impacting negatively on patient care at times. Our project aim was to improve staff enjoyment at work, in the hope that this might also improve staff retention.

Method

We measured enjoyment levels by distributing an anonymous questionnaire weekly at team meetings, scoring enjoyment levels on a scale 1–10 and collecting qualitative feedback. We also calculated monthly staffing levels. The team developed a driver diagram and interventions were introduced from this including reflective practice sessions, monthly teaching sessions, staff social events and a cross-cover/duty policy with guidance on flexible working.

Results

After the interventions were implemented, the median staff enjoyment score increased slightly from 6.75/10 to 7/10 and the median staffing levels increased from 61% to 89% over a period of 18 months. We found that staffing levels and enjoyment levels correlated with each other. From analysis of the qualitative feedback over the duration of the project, the number of negative comments received did reduce. It should be noted that the number of comments around the intensity of workload remained the same when comparing the baseline period to the final weeks of the project.

Conclusion

There was little change in staff enjoyment levels at work. This may be reflective of the general state of the National Health Service with poor levels of morale nationally but may also be linked to ongoing concerns in the qualitative feedback from the team about high workloads. Despite this, we made positive changes and the project helped bring the team together. The project further emphasises the link between staffing levels and enjoyment levels. Overall, our project helped to increase staffing levels and highlight the importance of well-being in the workplace.

### CoGames: development of an adaptive smartphone-based and gamified monitoring tool for cognitive function in multiple sclerosis [^906b792a]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acceptance by participants: enjoyment

In recent years, awareness of the added value of including gamification elements in digital applications for rehabilitation, therapy, or assessment in MS has gained increasing interest. Factors such as enjoyment, user-friendliness, and meaningfulness are fundamental to achieve high adherence to monitoring tools. In this study, we investigated elements of acceptance on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = worst, and 5 = best), with a focus on enjoyment. Our findings show that all games are at least moderately enjoyed (range: 3.13 — 4.22). We assume that gamification aspects, such as audible and visual feedback to correct and false responses, colorful design of interactive items and background, and points as rewards for good performance contribute strongly to the enjoyment factor, hence encouraging the acceptance and use of such tools.

In most of our games, the enjoyment rating stayed the same over the three time points (day 4, 8, and 11). Minor differences in enjoyment ratings across the three different rating days might indicate which difficulty levels were preferred: Lower enjoyment ratings during higher levels in the games Treasure Hunt and Match Maker reflect our results, which show that the difficulty increase in those two games was higher compared to the other games. This might have led to more frustration in higher levels of those games. In support of this interpretation, the "frustration" ratings showed similar changes at the same time of questionnaire completion as the enjoyment ratings (Table 18: Questionnaire ratings).

Acceptance by participants: representation of cognitive function, perceived difficulty increase, clearness of instructions, and frustration

Participants perceived all games as representative of their cognitive abilities and found the difficulty increase well designed, meaning the levels seemed to get more difficult by the day (excluding the repetitions of level 1). The in-app instructions were rated as very clear across all games. Not surprisingly, the frustration ratings correlated strongly with the enjoyment ratings, which is especially visible in the ratings of the higher levels. These findings are comparable to results of our previous study.

Overall, the participants found the CoGames enjoyable, representative, and well designed regarding user friendliness, clarity of instructions, and difficulty level transitions, which is an excellent foundation for high adherence when using a monitoring tool.

### Perceived level of life enjoyment and risk of developing disabling dementia: the Japan public health center-based study [^d7f9d609]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Life enjoyment, linked to the ability to engage pleasurably with one's environment, may be related to the risk of developing dementia. This prospective cohort study examined the association between level of life enjoyment and disabling dementia incidence among Japanese community residents.

Methods

The participants were Japanese, aged 45–74 years old at 5-years follow-up, in the Japan Public Health Center-based Study (N = 38,660). Psychological conditions and other confounding variables were identified through self-administered questionnaires. Incident disabling dementia registered based on the Japan's Long-Term Care Insurance system from 2006 to 2016. Hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Over a median follow-up period of 9.4 years, a total of 4,642 cases of disabling dementia developed. Level of life enjoyment was inversely associated with the risk of disabling dementia: the multivariable hazard ratios were 0.75 [0.67–0.84] (p < .001) and 0.68 [0.59–0.78] (p < .001) with medium and high life enjoyment, respectively, compared to low life enjoyment. Furthermore, the association between greater life enjoyment and low risk for disabling dementia was strongest in the subgroup with low-medium mental stress. In the high mental stress group, this association was evident for poststroke disabling dementia, but not for disabling dementia without a history of stroke.

Discussion

A higher level of life enjoyment was associated with a lower risk of disabling dementia, particularly in the low-medium mental stress group. This finding suggests the importance of having life enjoyment by managing mental stress for reducing risk of disabling dementia.

### Conditional survival and standardized mortality ratios of patients with severe aplastic anemia surviving at least one year after hematopoietic cell transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy [^a0f6ce9c]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

While outcomes after initial IST or HCT have been well-described, and complications after therapy are also better understood, limited data are available regarding the temporal variations of mortality risks on survivors of SAA after IST or HCT. It is known that HCT survivors continue to have substantially higher mortality rates compared with the general population. Socie and colleagues reported the data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR), which included 1029 patients with SAA transplanted between 1980 and 1993, mostly from a matched sibling donor (90%). Their analysis showed a 6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4–7%) mortality incidence at seven years in SAA patients who had survived at least two years after HCT. A subsequent registry study by Wingard and colleagues included 2171 patients with SAA transplanted between 1980 and 2003, again mostly from a matched sibling donor (81%), and reported the relative mortality risk over time, showing increased risks (approx. 5-fold) over more than ten years in these 2-year HCT survivors. A single institution analysis at City of Hope by Wong and colleagues also included patients with SAA (n = 180), demonstrating that the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for 1-year, 5-year, 10-year survivors were 9.0, 4.0, and 2.2, respectively.

However, the above-mentioned registry studies did not have sufficient data on conditional survival and SMR after alternative donor HCT (matched/mismatched unrelated donors, mismatched related donors). Moreover, no studies have evaluated conditional survival or SMR in SAA after IST. As short-term outcomes after HCT and IST improve, the data on ongoing mortality risks in surviving patients are increasingly important and relevant for decision-making and risk-stratification for personalization of treatment. In this study, we enjoyed the benefit of using the resources of the CIBMTR and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to determine the conditional survival rates and SMR in patients with SAA treated with HCT or IST between 2000–2018, conditioned by survival time since treatment. A better understanding of conditional survival and SMR would allow risk-adapted interventions tailored to time-varying mortality risk in survivors to be implemented.

### Development of a psychological intervention to promote meaningful activity in people living with mild dementia: an intervention mapping approach [^a6ec839f]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Theme 1. Enjoying life

Overall, participants endorsed that engaging in activities allows you to "enjoy life" and that despite challenges people can still live well with dementia. Two key concepts identified were accepting loss and valuing the place. Participants talked about accepting and adapting to loss in the context of memory decline, which facilitated living well with dementia despite this being described by most participants as a difficult process. Valuing your current living situation was important in maintaining a positive outlook such as living in a town you enjoy and being surrounded by family, relatives, and friends:

You have to accept it, you can't do many things anymore, and some things you do less well, when you lose something you've been doing for years, it's tough,… but I can still do some things, I can enjoy life. Person with dementia — Participant 1

Another participant said,

I have always lived here, I like my town, and I am happy at home, I love my surroundings very much. Person with dementia — Participant 4

Participants discussed how living with chronic illness and dementia affects the ability to live well. In fact, most participants defined enjoying life as being synonymous with being in good health, with living well being directly linked to individuals' physical health. Being in good health served as an important condition to remain independent, which similarly to memory loss required adapting to physical changes taking place as a result of age.

I have my health so I can enjoy life… illness is very common, you have to learn how to adjust,… health is a big thing…, it helps you stay active and live well. Person with dementia — Participant 5

Participants talked about being as active as you can and how activities allowed one to experience feelings of happiness and enjoying life as much as you can. Almost all participants described "enjoying life" as an opportunity to experience positive emotion in everyday life and that despite "living with loss" individuals can still achieve happiness.

I have a lot more problems now but I can still do things I like and enjoy, it's really getting active when you can when you have dementia, I think you can be happy and enjoy life no matter your medical condition. I was very active before, I want to maintain that as much as I can. Person with dementia — Participant 4

### Music-evoked nostalgia activates default mode and reward networks across the lifespan [^b5e309ba]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, our study differs from previous research in that we did not obtain ratings of pleasantness or enjoyment from participants for each piece of music. Previous investigations have used preference ratings as a primary regressor in their analyses, which were not done here. While it is reasonable to assume that nostalgic music might have been rated as preferred to non‐nostalgic music, we do not see this as a necessary limitation. From valence ratings, we observed that participants felt more positive while listening to nostalgic music compared to familiar and unfamiliar non‐nostalgic music, which is in line with the affective experience of nostalgia. To assess the emotional construct of nostalgia, we expected that these ratings would differ between conditions, and we see this as a separate construct from enjoyment. Given the stimulus matching procedure, we feel confident that enjoyment (specifically, enjoyment due to musical style) was matched across song conditions. Preferences for specific acoustic and musical features predict enjoyment of music (Barone et al; Rentfrow et al.); thus, our steps to match these features should control for this enjoyment aspect. We see this matching as a considerable strength of our experimental design. Yet, it is possible that nostalgic songs, due to their personal relevance, are more enjoyed by listeners than their musically matched counterparts. Relatedly, it is possible that an overall tendency to feel pleasure from music may predict stronger responses to nostalgic music. Future research may probe these questions by including enjoyment ratings and collecting trait‐level music reward information (i.e. the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire; Mas‐Herrero et al.) in their nostalgia‐focused experiments.

### An interpretable approach for social network formation among heterogeneous agents [^79afa776]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

There are of course many other variations for the functional form (Eq. (1)). For example, we can let F i non-separable in terms of the neighbor set S, e.g. The intuition is that when one agent has many neighbors, the benefit brought by each neighbor decreases; Do et al. provide a good example of a decreasing marginal utility. However, this functional form indicates that Δ u i (j) depends on the neighbor set S, which leads to a time-consuming combinatorial optimization in the learning process; specifically, when the learning algorithm chooses, it may needcomputations for the utility functions, which is computationally infeasible for even a small-scale network. This is thus beyond the scope of this paper. We can also change G i into other norms, such asnorm, or change F i into a smoother version of max(x, 0), but these changes do not significantly affect the results in the later sections, as shown in Supplementary Note 9. Therefore, we concentrate on this specific form in later sections (Eq. (5)).

In network game theory, pairwise stabilityrefers to the situation where no increased marginal utility can be brought to both agents of an unconnected pair, and no increased marginal utility can be brought to any agents who want to drop their neighbors. Following the definition, we derive the conditions when pairwise stability in undirected networks is satisfied. The proof is straightforward and can be found in Supplementary Note 1.

Proposition 1

An undirected networkimplied by neighbor sets, i = 1,2. N is pairwise stable, if the following conditions are satisfied:
if, then;, Δ u i (j) ≥ 0;, min(Δ u i (j), Δ u j (i)) < 0.

### Declining drinking among adolescents: are we seeing a denormalisation of drinking and a normalisation of non-drinking? [^883cb427]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Normalisation theory shows how various empirically identified factors and mechanisms of change co-exist and co-produce to provide an overarching theory that more holistically accounts for declines in adolescent drinking. We suggest that research on declining adolescent drinking provides evidence for both denormalisation of drinking and normalisation of non-drinking across Parker et al.'s key criteria. On the one hand, adolescents are drinking less and pursuing intoxication less frequently, and alcohol seems to be a less central feature of their lives. On the other hand, more young people are choosing to abstain and are experiencing less stigma as a result of their abstinence, even in contexts where alcohol use might have previously been perceived as normal (such as parties). This highlights the interrelated, yet distinct nature of these two processes. As we show in Table 1, denormalisation seems to be more supported by epidemiological data, whereas evidence for normalisation of non-drinking can be found in qualitative studies suggesting increasingly positive social and cultural environments for abstainers. The concept of 'differentiated normalisation' usefully captures how declines have varied in manifestations and across subgroups. For example, it seems that regular or heavy drinking is subject to more apparent processes of denormalisation than 'any' use. There also seems to be evidence of age-specific denormalisation in policy efforts to reduce underage drinking and increased perceptions of alcohol as a harmful substance among younger adolescents.

From a public health perspective, the denormalisation of alcohol use, particularly in the context of increased health concerns (like cigarette smoking), may have created an environment more open to regulation. This might have enabled greater support for reinforcing alcohol policies that specifically target younger people. Moreover, the age-specific denormalisation we highlighted may have implications for how alcohol policies and interventions target certain age groups (e.g. focusing on young adults as well as younger adolescents). Alternatively, public health efforts that encourage adolescents to enjoy social contexts without alcohol and destigmatise non-drinking may create a more positive environment for non-drinkers. Normalising non-drinking (rather than denormalising drinking) may also support a more heterogeneous drinking culture that both reduces alcohol-related harms and avoids marginalising abstainers or heavier drinkers.

### Cannabis, the mind and society: the hash realities [^2be9adec]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

Cannabis has been known for at least 4,000 years to have profound effects on the mind — effects that have provoked dramatically divergent attitudes towards it. Some societies have regarded cannabis as a sacred boon for mankind that offers respite from the tribulations of everyday life, whereas others have demonized it as inevitably leading to 'reefer madness'. The debate between the protagonists and prohibitionists has recently been re-ignited, but unfortunately this debate continues mainly in ignorance of our new understanding of the effects of cannabis on the brain and of studies that have quantified the extent of the risks of long-term use.

### Are quitting-related cognitions and behaviours predicted by proximal responses to plain packaging with larger health warnings? Findings from a national cohort study with Australian adult smokers [^5a3596ab]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Balance between enjoyment and concern

Deciding to give up smoking can be conceptualised as a struggle between factors that enhance the enjoyment of smoking and factors that increase concern about the impact of smoking. Although reducing enjoyment and increasing concern were not the primary objectives of the PP legislation, it is likely that these two constructs would be influenced by cigarette appeal, GHW effectiveness and perceived harm, and in combination, they have been found to predict quitting-related outcomes. We created a baseline measure of the balance between enjoyment and concern from items measuring how often respondents had thought about how much they enjoy smoking in the past month: 1 = never; 2 = once or twice; 3 = several times or 4 = many times, and how concerned they were that smoking may affect or has already affected their own personal health: 1 = not at all; 2 = a little concerned; 3 = somewhat concerned; 4 = very concerned and 5 = extremely concerned. We then standardised these two variables using z-scores and subtracted the standardised 'concern' score from the standardised 'enjoyment' score. After inspecting a histogram of resulting scores to identify natural cut points, we constructed a categorical variable with three levels: more enjoyment (< 1 SD below the mean); balanced between enjoyment and concern; and more concern (> 1 SD above the mean).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^0bfb779e]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Despite observational studies consistently confirming lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations in patients with T2D or metabolic syndrome, most MR studies have not supported these conclusions. In a small subgroup of individuals with obesity and prediabetes, supplementation provided some modest benefit, albeit lower than lifestyle modifications or metformin. Of note, daily vitamin D supplementation (4000 IU) in the large D2d trial did not retard the progression of prediabetes into T2D. A post hoc and meta-analysis, however, suggested a possible beneficial effect in individuals with vitamin D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) at baseline or in participants who were able to achieve consistently high (≥ 100 nmol/L) serum 25(OH)D levels. Furthermore, analysis of the combined results of the D2d (US), Tromsø (Norway), and DPVD (Japan) RCTs — which were specifically designed and conducted to test whether vitamin D reduces the risk of diabetes in adults with prediabetes — showed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of developing T2D in people with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency. In all 3 trials, the risk for diabetes was reduced in the group assigned to vitamin D compared to the placebo group, which did so in a remarkably similar way. The observed differences missed statistical significance in any trial because the reported risk reductions were smaller than each trial was powered to detect. An updated individual participant data meta-analysis of the same trials showed that vitamin D reduced the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 15%. Also, vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30%, with no evidence of risk. In additional analyses, participants in the vitamin D group who maintained intratrial blood 25(OH)D of 50 ng/mL or greater (≥ 125 nmol/L) had a 76% risk reduction in new-onset diabetes compared to those who maintained blood 25(OH)D of 20 to 29 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L). All participants received and were encouraged to follow the current lifestyle-based advice for diabetes prevention. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D to lower the risk of developing T2D in adults with prediabetes is favorable. These results should not be extrapolated to the general population at low or average risk for diabetes, as the benefit-to-risk ratio of high doses for diabetes prevention may not be favorable. Despite these promising results, some questions remain, that is, the optimal vitamin D dose or formulation and the specific blood 25(OH)D level to maximize benefit with little or no risk of any side effects.

### Measuring enjoyment of physical activity in adolescent girls [^0070d818]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Enjoyment has been implicated as a determinant of physical activity among youth, but advances in understanding its importance have been limited by the use of measures that were not adequately validated. The present study examined: (1) the factorial validity of the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), and (2) the construct validity of PACES scores.

Methods

Adolescent girls (N = 1797), who were randomly assigned to calibration (n = 899) and cross-validation (n = 898) samples, completed the PACES and measures of factors influencing enjoyment of physical education, physical activity, and sport involvement. The factorial validity of the PACES and the measure of factors influencing enjoyment of physical education was tested using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The hypothesized relationships among the measures were tested using structural equation modeling.

Results

Unidimensional models fit the PACES and the measure of factors influencing enjoyment of physical education in the calibration and cross-validation samples. The hypothesized relationships between the PACES and the measures of factors influencing enjoyment of physical education, physical activity, and sport involvement were supported in the entire sample, were similar in African-American and Caucasian girls, and were independent of physical fitness.

Conclusions

Evidence of factorial validity and convergent evidence for construct validity indicate that the PACES is a valid measure of physical activity enjoyment among adolescent girls, suitable for use as a mediator variable in interventions designed to increase physical activity.

### Improving staff enjoyment at work in a community mental health team: a quality improvement project [^e977362a]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Results

At the end of the project, the median staff enjoyment score improved from 6.75/10 to 7/10. The median staffing level improved from 61% to 87%. Since the project started, staffing levels have remained above 61% and at the end of the project, staffing levels were at 100%. The run chart is included in figure 2 and highlights the interventions, staff changes and significant events that have had an impact on the weekly staff enjoyment levels. The spike that can be seen in the enjoyment scores occurred following new staff members starting. We found that new staff members often gave higher scores as well as additional staff members boosting team morale overall, which may explain the spike. One major finding was that the enjoyment levels were closely correlated with the staffing levels. This can be shown in figure 3. The only point when enjoyment crossed over staffing levels was soon after the interventions had been introduced and staffing had remained consistent. We can hypothesise that the correlation between staffing levels and enjoyment may be because if staff members are happier as a result of the project they may be more likely to stay working in the team. Vice versa, having more staff members in the team may lead to a reduction in workload for individuals, which could lead to increased enjoyment at work. However, we know from the qualitative data (see online supplemental material, figure 1) that workload was still frequently mentioned as a factor affecting enjoyment levels even at the end of the project when our staffing levels were high. The staffing level run chart, shown in online supplemental material figure 2, highlights the significant shift in the staffing levels.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^72eb421b]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

We have known for a long time that 25(OH)D concentrations of people living at high latitudes drop due to the lower daily UV-B light exposure during the dark months of the year. And still, not enough is done to offset the typical seasonal drop in 25(OH)D concentrations at higher latitudes by using appropriately dosed vitamin D supplements. Now in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, renewed attention to the very high prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency there and elsewhere is in order. Advanced age, obesity, dark skin tone and risk-related genotypes, particularly in combination, are alarm signs that should prompt corrective action, typically with a moderate, individually tailored dose of supplemental vitamin D. While the preventive potential of supplemental vitamin D should not be exaggerated and the dose kept within recommended ranges (typically well under 4000 IU per day), preventing vitamin D deficiency should be a widely shared goal.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Brat culture: the public health implications of the glamorization of hedonism [^130a564e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

"Brat culture", an aesthetic that revives early-2000s fashion, attitudes, and behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking, and drug use) framed as rebellious and socially defiant, has emerged as a defining lifestyle among youth. Brat culture is marked by a confident, unapologetic tone that equates substance use with self-expression and non-conformity. The increasing depiction of risky behaviors in popular media-particularly among adolescents-necessitates more accurate substance-use assessments in clinical settings. Current tools and protocols may fall short in addressing this cultural shift. Providers should expand questioning beyond traditional drug categories to encompass new circulating trends. Public health campaigns must evolve to meet youth where they are-on social media, at concerts, and within fandom spaces-delivering narratives that are engaging and aesthetically savvy. As young people gravitate toward brat culture, there is an urgent need to anticipate its effects, adjust our tools, and act decisively to protect adolescent well-being in a rapidly shifting media environment.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^cfbf8017]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

### The use of nonnutritive sweeteners in children [^f05e0b4d]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Published guidance — statements from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) and a joint statement from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Heart Association (AHA) note that consumers can safely enjoy nonnutritive sweeteners within dietary guidelines, that adult weight management benefits may occur, and that NNSs are safe when consumed within acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels, although the ADA/AHA statement did not address children. The AND states that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners within federal nutrition recommendations and that there is a good level of evidence that NNS use as part of weight loss or maintenance programs may be associated with weight loss and improved weight management in adults but with less definitive statements for children; the ADA and AHA support that NNSs are safe within ADI levels and may be helpful in reducing weight gain if used to limit total caloric intake, and their statement specifically did not address NNS use in children.

### Evaluating the impact of physical activity cards (PACs) on motor proficiency and enjoyment of physical activities among primary school students in Turkey [^5c64eac9]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Development level of enjoyment of physical activities

The study revealed that games related to the PAC program, implemented over ten weeks, positively affected the level of enjoyment of physical activities among primary school students (Table 3). It should be considered that physical, psychological and emotional factors mediate increased participation in physical education and games classes. Sotos-Martínez et al. noted that a gamified intervention increased students' psychological satisfaction and intrinsic motivation while decreasing amotivation. This study supports our findings. Additionally, previous research adopting a holistic perspective, including different age groups, supports our findings.

Given that primary school students are at an age where school serves as a place for playing with friends and they make sense of their lives through games, this study, which integrates play into education, positively contributed to their enjoyment of physical activities. Mo et al. conducted a systematic review and found that physical game interventions enhanced enjoyment and promoted fun as experienced by children and adolescents. Demirtoz and Alpkaya found that school children most enjoyed games like dodgeball when investigating their levels of enjoyment from physical activities. Burns et al. in a meta-analysis of 220 studies, found that school-based physical activity interventions effectively increased enjoyment of physical activity among children and adolescents. These results support our study.

Furthermore, students' enjoyment of physical activities was positively influenced by their enjoyment of the play areas in the schoolyard, where they played both the games learned during the study and traditional children's games during recess. Hyndman et al. examined students' active play during lunch breaks in simple and low-cost play areas created in schools. They found that the more behaviours children develop, such as physical health, enjoyment of physical activity, and personal play activities, the more likely they are to adopt an active lifestyle.

### Organized sports for children, preadolescents, and adolescents [^860e5df7]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Organized sports for children, preadolescents, and adolescents — conclusions emphasize that organized sports participation can be an important part of overall childhood and adolescent physical, emotional, social, and psychological health. Supervised motor skill acquisition in preschool and elementary school positively influences long-term participation in organized sports, physical activity, and cardiovascular health. Parental support with encouragement, a focus on fun and progress instead of winning, and avoiding forcing participation are important influencers of whether a child enjoys and continues organized sports, and this is true for youth with disabilities as well as for all youth. Parents are essential in creating safe environments in youth sports and can ask questions of both schools and youth sports organizations about hiring procedures, codes of conduct, and communication between coach and athlete. Positive coaching is an important facet of organized sports, and coaches who approach organized sports with a respectful, development- and fun-focused approach to practices and performance are more likely to have athletes who enjoy and stay in organized sports, whereas unhealthy attitudes or behaviors on the part of parents and coaches can decrease the young athlete's enjoyment of sports and contribute to burnout. Involvement in sports, particularly as a member of a sports team, is an integral way for youth to develop psychosocially and help form their social identity, and sports participation helps athletes develop self-esteem, correlates positively with overall mental health, and appears to have a protective effect against suicide. Youth of all ages involved in organized sports have higher levels of energy expenditure and physical activity than their nonathletic peers, and sports may be an important way to combat obesity. Adolescent athletes appear less likely to smoke cigarettes and use other illegal drugs but are more likely to consume alcohol and use performance-enhancing substances, such as steroids, and bullying and hazing are common among young athletes and it will likely be the responsibility of coaches and team leaders to decrease such practices.

Enhancing shared reading quality: dialogic reading — Dialogic reading is described as an approach for preschool-aged children that enhances parent–child verbal and social-emotional interaction using structured prompts, with testing across various book types including wordless books, and with reported benefits spanning language, phonological awareness, comprehension, narrative, attention, socio-emotional skills, and relational factors. It involves specific types of verbal prompts and responses represented by PEER/CROWD (Table 13). Cited benefits include caregiver-child bonding and interest in reading and enjoyment, and these accrue in a dose-dependent fashion and are also seen at younger ages and for those at risk for reading difficulties.

### Vitamin D and COVID-19: from potential therapeutic effects to unanswered questions [^1ff491bc]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation could potentially be effective either in treatment or prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Indeed, several studies and trials have begun to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanisms of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of Covid-19. We consider whether deficiency of vitamin D may be one of the underlying biological factors that could explain the excess mortality seen among non-Caucasians. We also raise several important questions which need to be addressed to provide a clear picture of the extent to which vitamin D supplementation may benefit patients with Covid-19, particularly those with underlying risk factors.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^182f23e4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

### Novel approaches to obesity prevention: effects of game enjoyment and game type on energy expenditure in active video games [^2b1fd169]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Some active video games have been found to promote physical activity adherence because of enjoyment. However, many active games are exercise themed, which may interfere with the distracting properties that make game-based exercise more enjoyable than traditional exercise. This study compared exercise-themed and game-themed active games to investigate differences in energy expenditure and enjoyment.

Method

Young adults (N = 100, 50 female, 55 overweight, aged 18–35 years) played two of four Wii Fit games (one aerobic game and one balance game per person) for 10 min each. Of the two aerobic games, one was exercise themed (jogging) and the other was game themed (hula hooping). Both balance games were game themed. Energy expenditure and enjoyment were measured.

Results

After adjustment for gender and weight, aerobic games produced 2.70 kcal/kg(-1)/h(-1) (95% confidence interval 2.41, 3.00) greater energy expenditure than balance games (p < .001), but balance games were more enjoyable (p < .001). In aerobic games, jogging produced greater energy expenditure than hula hooping in normal-weight and male participants (p < .001); in overweight and female participants, no differences were found (p > .17). Hula hooping was enjoyed more than jogging (p = .008). Enjoyment predicted energy expenditure in aerobic games (B = 0.767, p = .010).

Conclusions

Aerobic games produced greater energy expenditure but lower enjoyment than balance games, and a game-themed aerobic game was found more enjoyable than an exercise-themed aerobic game. Integrating more strenuous activity into entertaining games instead of games that simply simulate exercise may be a fruitful avenue for active game development.

### Radiologists' performance and their enjoyment of interpreting screening mammograms [^049f400c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

One might speculate that radiologists who enjoy mammography may exhibit better performance than radiologists who do not.

Materials and Methods

One hundred thirty-one radiologists at three Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries completed a survey about their characteristics, clinical practices, and attitudes related to screening mammography. Survey results were linked with BCSC performance data for 662,084 screening and 33,977 diagnostic mammograms. Using logistic regression, we modeled the odds of an abnormal interpretation, cancer detection, sensitivity, and specificity among radiologists who reported they enjoy interpreting screening mammograms compared with those who do not.

Results

Overall, 44.3% of radiologists reported not enjoying interpreting screening mammograms. Radiologists who reported enjoying interpreting screening mammograms were more likely to be women, spend at least 20% of their time in breast imaging, have a primary academic affiliation, read more than 2,000 mammograms per year, and be salaried. Enjoyment was not associated with screening mammography performance. Among diagnostic mammograms, there was a significant increase in sensitivity among radiologists who reported enjoyment (85.2%) compared with those who did not (78.2%). In models adjusting for radiologist characteristics, similar trends were found; however, no statistically significant associations remained.

Conclusion

Almost one half of radiologists actively interpreting mammograms do not enjoy that part of their job. Once we adjusted for radiologist and patient characteristics, we found that reported enjoyment was not related to performance in our study, although suggestive trends were noted.

### Therapeutic and mechanistic intervention of vitamin D in neuropsychiatric disorders [^f6874545]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is believed to affect between 35 and 55% of the world's population, making it a hidden pandemic. In addition to its role in bone and calcium homeostasis, vitamin D has also been linked in preclinical and clinical research to brain function. These outcomes have also been used for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental problems. Nevertheless, these individuals are more prone to develop signs of cognitive decline. This review will emphasize the association between vitamin D and neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism, schizophrenia, depression, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While numerous research show vitamin D's essential role in cognitive function in neuropsychiatric illnesses, it is too early to propose its effect on cognitive symptoms with certainty. It is necessary to conduct additional research into the associations between vitamin D deficiency and cognitive abnormalities, particularly those found in autism, schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD, to develop initiatives that address the pressing need for novel and effective preventative therapeutic strategies.

Chronic pain initial assessment after a positive screen — biopsychosocial evaluation and tools: For persons who screen positive for chronic pain, an initial assessment should take a biopsychosocial approach that includes an evaluation of the pain's onset and duration, intensity and character, exacerbating and alleviating factors, past and current treatments, underlying or co-occurring disorders and conditions, and the effect of pain on physical and psychological function. This should be followed by a physical examination, psychosocial evaluation, and diagnostic workup to determine the potential cause of the pain (strong, very low). A multidimensional instrument such as the brief pain inventory (BPI) or the 3-item patient health questionnaire (PEG; used to assess average pain intensity [P], interference with enjoyment of life [E], and interference with general activity [G]) can be used for pain assessments.

### Physical activity enjoyment, exercise motivation, and physical activity in patients with heart failure: a mediation analysis [^1020f78a]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether physical activity enjoyment mediated the association between motivation and physical activity in patients with heart failure.

Design and setting

A cross-sectional study at the cardiology clinic in the university hospital in Valencia, Spain

Subjects

A total of 134 patients with heart failure.

Main measurements

Physical activity was assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, motivation was assessed with the Exercise Motivation Index and Physical Activity Enjoyment was assessed with the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale.

Analysis

Mediation analysis using Hayes' PROCESS macro (Model 4) for SPSS.

Results

The mean age of the sample was 70 ± 14 years, 47 patients were female (35%), and 87 patients were in New York Heart Association I/II (67%). A positive relationship was found between exercise motivation and physical activity (t = 4.57, p < .01) and physical activity enjoyment (t = 11.52, p < .01). Physical activity enjoyment was found to positively affect physical activity (t = 3.50, p < .01). After controlling for physical activity enjoyment, the effect of exercise motivation on physical activity changed from a significant to non-significant (t = 1.33, p = .89), indicating that enjoyment completely mediated the relationship between motivation and physical activity. Overall, 25% of the variation in physical activity was explained by the mediation model.

Conclusions

Physical activity enjoyment mediates the relationship between exercise motivation and physical activity in patients with heart failure. This means that even highly motivated heart failure patients may not be physically active if they do not enjoy the physical activity.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^77a6fed7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

### Lifestyle interventions for treatment and remission of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in adults: implications for clinicians [^9ab39d21]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Table 2 — Six pillars of lifestyle medicine interventions — summarizes health impacts across nutrition, physical activity, stress management, sleep, social connectedness, and avoidance of risky substances. For nutrition, extensive scientific evidence supports a whole-food, predominantly plant-based eating plan for preventing and treating chronic conditions and, in intensive therapeutic doses, reversing chronic illness. Physical activity emphasizes that regular and consistent activity combats sedentary behavior and that engaging in general activity and purposeful exercise weekly builds mental health, overall health, and resiliency. Stress management notes that excess stress can lead to anxiety, depression, obesity, and immune dysfunction, and that recognizing negative stress responses with coping mechanisms and stress reduction techniques leads to improved well-being. Sleep guidance specifies: Seven to nine hours nightly is associated with optimal health; under six hours or more than nine hours is associated with increased mortality, and sleep is defined by duration, timing, and quality. Social connectedness is exemplified by relationships wherein individuals feel seen, heard, and valued, and positive social connections and relationships affect physical, mental, and emotional health and can help reinforce healthy behaviors. Avoidance of risky substances includes avoiding tobacco, recreational drugs, and excessive alcohol consumption, noting that tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption increase the risk of chronic diseases and death and that treatments take time, requiring varying approaches and many attempts with patience and support.

Youth sport participation pathways and elite attainment — prospective research on youth athlete development pathways is necessary to better understand if success in achieving elite status is more likely by multisport athletes or youth sport specialization for a specific subset of youth, especially youth who show a strong propensity and desire to participate in one sport. Priority should be placed on the design and implementation of sport-specific prospective cohort studies assessing multiple outcomes including lifelong physical activity, enjoyment of sport, development of sport skills, and eventual career performance outcomes among specialized and nonspecialized athletes, and using mixed-method approaches will provide additional and needed insight into reasons for participation in the different athlete development pathways and the role of each pathway in discontinuing sport, premature or otherwise.

### Dissociating social reward learning and behavior in alcohol use disorder [^4048d788]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Compromised social behavior has been suggested as a risk factor in the initiation of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, it is presently unclear why social behavior is reduced in AUD as compared to the healthy population. A two-fold answer may lie in the reward system of the brain that plays a key role in both learning to adapt behavior in healthy social relationships and for ascribing relatively lower value to non-alcoholic rewards as compared to alcohol in AUD. Here, we examined a reward learning mechanism that contributes to social behavior, and that may be impaired in individuals with AUD. To this end, we applied a computational reinforcement learning (RL) framework to understand the formation of associations between one's own actions and rewarding outcomes for others: prosocial learning.

To date, most of the research on prosocial behavior in AUD has focused on decision-making or self-report measures. For instance, previous studies have found an association between AUD and reduced altruistic decisions (i.e. helping without expectations of self-reward) as well as an increased tendency to reject unfair offers from others. Reduced prosocial behavior, such as altruism, has also been demonstrated to be associated with cocaine use disorder, as well as alcohol- and cannabis use, physical aggression, psychopathic personality traits and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Together, these findings of reduced prosocial behavior across different psychiatric conditions highlight the role of similar underlying mechanisms (e.g. reward-related processes), resonating with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative emphasizing transdiagnostic social biomarkers in psychiatry.

Recommendation 7 — general population aged 75 years and older: In the general population aged 75 years and older, we suggest against routine testing for 25(OH)D levels. In this population, 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing. This recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### The power of play: a pediatric role in enhancing development in young children [^f34ea22f]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric play and early childhood development — conclusions emphasize that cultural shifts have limited opportunities for children to play and may negatively affect school readiness, healthy adjustment, and executive functioning skills. Play is described as intrinsically motivated, leading to active engagement and joyful discovery, and free play and recess need to remain integral aspects of a child's day, with essential components of play able to be adopted by parents, teachers, and other caregivers to promote healthy child development and enhance learning. The optimal educational model is for teachers to engage students in activities within each child's zone of proximal development through dialog and guidance rather than drills and passive rote learning; with their understanding of early brain development, the authors state "we suggest that learning is better fueled by facilitating the child's intrinsic motivation through play rather than extrinsic motivations, such as test scores". An alternative model highlights developing a safe, stable, and nurturing relationship with the child to decrease stress, increase motivation, and ensure receptivity, with an emphasis on promoting resilience by enhancing executive functioning skills with free play and guided play. Play provides adults opportunities to scaffold foundational motor, social–emotional, language, executive functioning, math, and self–regulation skills, and to build adaptive behaviors at home, language and math skills in school, safe, stable, and nurturing relationships that buffer against toxic stress, and social–emotional resilience. The text also notes that pediatricians can help parents understand that playful learning moments are everywhere and that even daily chores can be turned into playful opportunities, that young children typically seek more attention from parents, and that active play stimulates children's curiosity and helps them develop the physical and social skills needed for school and later life.

### The association of hearing loss with active music enjoyment in hearing aid users [^2d04a510]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hearing aids (HAs) are designed for speech rather than music listening. The impact of HAs on music enjoyment is poorly studied. We examine the effect of HAs on active music enjoyment in individuals with varying levels of hearing loss (HL).

Study Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Tertiary medical center and community.

Methods

Adult (≥ 18 years) bilateral HA users and normal hearing (NH) controls actively listened to musical stimuli and rated their enjoyment across 3 measures (pleasantness, musicality, naturalness) with and without HAs using a visual analog scale. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between HL (measured by a pure-tone average [PTA] and word recognition score [WRS] of the better ear) and music enjoyment with and without HAs, adjusting for covariates. Music enjoyment was compared between HA users and NH controls, and HA users with and without their HAs.

Results

One hundred bilateral HA users (mean age 66.0 years, 52% female, better ear mean [SD] PTA 50.2 [13.5]dBHL, mean WRS 84.5 [16.5]%) completed the study. Increasing severity of HL (PTA) was independently associated with decreased music enjoyment (pleasantness, musicality, naturalness) with and without HAs (p < .05). HA usage increased music enjoyment (musicality) in those with moderate to moderately severe HL. Music enjoyment in NH controls (n = 20) was significantly greater across all measures compared to HA users.

Conclusion

Increased severity of HL is associated with decreased music enjoyment that can be enhanced with HA usage. Thus, HA usage can positively enhance both speech and music appreciation.

### Risk of using other drugs… [^016a0f15]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk of Using Other DrugsEspañol Researchers disagree on whether marijuana is a "gateway drug" — the idea that marijuana use leads a person to use other more dangerous drugs, like cocaine or heroin. 1, 2 However, there is limited evidence suggesting that using marijuana increases the risk of using other drugs.
3. Most people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, "harder" drugs. 4 People who use marijuana and do go on to use other drugs may have a higher risk of dependence or addiction to those drugs, especially if they started using marijuana at an early age and use it frequently. 4–6. People of any age, sex, or economic status can develop a substance use disorder for marijuana or other drugs.

The following things can affect the likelihood of substance use disorder 6:
- Family history
- Having another mental health illness
- Peer pressure
- Loneliness or social isolation
- Lack of family involvement
- Drug availability
- Socioeconomic status
