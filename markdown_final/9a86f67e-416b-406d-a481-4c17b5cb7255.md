## Question

Different diagnosis for hypernatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of hypernatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypernatremia and excluding pseudohypernatremia. Then, I should classify severity and determine acuity. Next, I will assess volume status and characterize urine indices to build the differential. After that, I need to identify etiologies by pattern recognition and targeted testing, including copeptin when diabetes insipidus is suspected. Finally, I will outline initial management principles, including fluid strategy and correction-rate targets, while double-checking where the evidence conflicts with traditional teaching and noting special populations like pediatrics and neurocritical care patients.

> Let me first confirm true hypernatremia and exclude pseudohypernatremia; I need to ensure the serum sodium is truly elevated and not an artifact from hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, or hyperproteinemia, and I should correct sodium for glucose when hyperglycemia is present because glucose draws water out of cells and artificially raises measured sodium, which can mislead management if I don't adjust it properly [^notfound].

> Next, I should review severity classification to frame urgency; mild hypernatremia is typically 146–149 mmol/L, moderate 150–159 mmol/L, and severe greater than 160 mmol/L, and I should also determine acuity by history and trajectory, with acute defined as less than 48 hours and chronic as longer than 48 hours, because this will influence both the differential and the correction strategy I choose [^114EHymy] [^115Rwx9p] [^112twV2j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check volume status carefully because it immediately narrows the differential into hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic categories, and I should correlate with vital signs, mucous membranes, skin turgor, jugular venous pressure, and edema, while remembering that urine sodium and osmolality will refine the picture further [^111GVLSX] [^114RpkPA].

> I will now examine urine indices to distinguish mechanisms; low urine osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg suggests diabetes insipidus, whereas high urine osmolality greater than 500 mOsm/kg suggests extrarenal water loss or dehydration, and urine sodium less than 20 mmol/L in hypovolemia indicates extrarenal sodium loss, whereas urine sodium greater than 100 mmol/L suggests renal sodium wasting or diuretic effect, so I should double-check medication history for diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors before concluding.

> Let me consider hypovolemic hypernatremia first; the pattern of low urine sodium with high urine osmolality points to extrarenal water loss from gastrointestinal sources, insensible losses, or inadequate intake, whereas low urine osmolality with polyuria suggests diabetes insipidus, and I should confirm the latter with copeptin when needed because a very low copeptin level strongly supports central diabetes insipidus and prompts timely desmopressin therapy [^116t7LQg].

> Wait, let me verify the euvolemic pattern; euvolemia with polyuria and inappropriately dilute urine indicates diabetes insipidus, and I should distinguish central from nephrogenic using copeptin and, when necessary, a water deprivation test, but if urine osmolality is appropriately high, I should reconsider inadequate intake or insensible losses as the driver rather than diabetes insipidus [^117TGcCE].

> For hypervolemic hypernatermia, I need to ensure I'm not missing iatrogenic sodium loading from hypertonic saline, sodium bicarbonate, or high-sodium enteral/parenteral nutrition, and I should also consider hyperaldosteronism or Cushing syndrome as less common endocrine causes, so I should review the chart for fluids and feeds and check for clinical stigmata of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid excess [^117TGcCE].

> But wait, what if the presentation is hypernatremia in hyperglycemic crisis; I should correct measured sodium for glucose to estimate the true water deficit, because effective serum osmolality and corrected sodium better reflect pathophysiology and guide safer rehydration in HHS, and I should remember that concurrent ketonemia and acidosis may be present more often than traditionally taught, which can alter fluid choices and monitoring cadence [^113eZXFr].

> I should double-check special populations; in pediatrics, hypernatremic dehydration requires staged rehydration with isotonic fluids for hemodynamic stabilization followed by hypotonic fluids to correct hypernatremia, and I must avoid overly rapid correction to mitigate cerebral edema risk, whereas in neurocritical care, hypernatremia may reflect osmotherapy or hypothalamic injury, and I should avoid overinterpreting hypernatremia as a standalone prognostic marker after TBI given very low-quality evidence [^117RVSVk] [^1137Padb] [^116nXc8B].

> Next, I should review initial management principles; first, stabilize circulation with isotonic saline if hypovolemic, then replace the free water deficit using a calculated estimate and titrate to ongoing losses, and I need to ensure I am not inadvertently worsening hypernatremia with sodium-rich solutions once perfusion is adequate, as persistent hypernatremia is associated with increased mortality and prolonged length of stay [^111GVLSX] [^1119PAbP] [^114v5tBn].

> Hold on, I should verify correction-rate targets because this is controversial; traditional teaching cautions not to exceed 0.5 mmol/L per hour or 10 mmol/L per 24 hours to avoid cerebral edema, but large recent cohorts in adults show that faster correction is associated with lower mortality without increased neurologic complications, so I should individualize the rate based on acuity, symptoms, and comorbidities while monitoring closely, and I should acknowledge that pediatric guidance still favors more conservative rates given brain development and case reports of osmotic injury in neonates [^111MuVEz] [^117BxCXq] [^111BwnNE] [^117RVSVk].

> Let me reconsider the role of desmopressin; if central diabetes insipidus is confirmed or strongly suspected, I should give desmopressin promptly and pair it with appropriate hypotonic fluid replacement to avoid overly rapid correction from the combination of antidiuresis and high free-water loads, and I should monitor sodium frequently to prevent overshoot hyponatremia [^113nPcfZ] [^117XgQ6K].

> I need to ensure I am monitoring the right things; frequent serum sodium checks every 2–4 hours early on, strict intake-output with urine osmolality and sodium when diagnostic, and reassessment of neurologic status are essential, and I should recalculate the free water deficit and ongoing losses dynamically rather than relying on static formulas that ignore changing outputs [^115n9Lnh].

> Finally, I should confirm that I am addressing modifiable drivers of hospital-acquired hypernatremia; improving fluid orders, limiting unnecessary hypertonic or sodium-rich infusions, recognizing impaired thirst in older adults, and using structured algorithms can reduce incidence and severity, and in refractory or unclear cases, copeptin testing can expedite the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus and guide therapy [^117TGcCE] [^115JmtXD] [^115wJxPT].

Hypernatremia is defined as serum sodium > 145 mmol/L and is best classified by **volume status** and **urine osmolality** to guide diagnosis and management [^115JmtXD]. The key differential includes:

- **Hypovolemic hypernatremia**: renal losses (diuretics, osmotic diuresis, diabetes insipidus) or extrarenal losses (GI, skin, respiratory) [^117TGcCE].
- **Euvolemic hypernatremia**: diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic) or impaired thirst/access to water [^117TGcCE].
- **Hypervolemic hypernatremia**: sodium overload (hypertonic saline, sodium bicarbonate, salt poisoning) [^116t7LQg].

Urine osmolality distinguishes diabetes insipidus (** < 300 mOsm/kg**) from other causes (** > 500 mOsm/kg**), and urine sodium helps separate renal from extrarenal losses [^115JmtXD]. Rapid correction risks cerebral edema; **target 0.5–1 mmol/L/h**, with faster correction only if acute and symptomatic [^113ePgQa].

---

## Classification by volume status

Hypernatremia is classified by **extracellular fluid volume** into three categories:

| **Category** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | Loss of water with greater sodium loss | - Renal losses: diuretics, osmotic diuresis (glucose, urea), diabetes insipidus [^117TGcCE] <br/> - Extrarenal losses: GI (vomiting, diarrhea), skin (burns, sweating), respiratory (mechanical ventilation) [^113wkSSX] |
| Euvolemic | Pure water loss without sodium loss | - Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) [^117TGcCE] <br/> - Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) [^117TGcCE] <br/> - Impaired thirst mechanism or restricted access to water [^117TGcCE] |
| Hypervolemic | Excess sodium intake or retention | - Hypertonic saline administration [^111BnMve] <br/> - Sodium bicarbonate therapy [^notfound] <br/> - Salt poisoning (accidental or intentional) [^117RVSVk] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm hypernatremia**: Serum sodium > 145 mmol/L [^114EHymy].
- **Assess volume status**: Clinical examination (skin turgor, mucous membranes, blood pressure, heart rate, edema) [^113c2B72].
- **Measure urine osmolality**: Differentiates diabetes insipidus from other causes [^115dLVLg].
- **Measure urine sodium**: Helps distinguish renal from extrarenal losses [^115dLVLg].
- **Evaluate underlying causes**: Medication history, comorbidities, clinical context [^117TGcCE].

---

## Differential diagnosis by etiology

### Hypovolemic hypernatremia

Renal losses include diuretics, osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia, mannitol, urea), and diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic) [^117TGcCE], whereas extrarenal losses include gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea), skin (burns, excessive sweating), and respiratory (mechanical ventilation) [^113wkSSX].

---

### Euvolemic hypernatremia

Central diabetes insipidus results from **deficient ADH secretion** (pituitary surgery, trauma, tumors, infiltrative diseases) [^notfound], whereas nephrogenic diabetes insipidus reflects renal resistance to ADH (chronic kidney disease, lithium, demeclocycline, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia) [^notfound]. Impaired thirst or restricted access to water is common in elderly, institutionalized, or critically ill patients [^115wJxPT].

---

### Hypervolemic hypernatremia

Hypertonic saline administration may be iatrogenic or intentional [^111BnMve], and sodium bicarbonate therapy can cause sodium overload [^notfound]. Salt poisoning may be accidental or intentional [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory tests and clinical features

| **Test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Serum sodium | Confirms hypernatremia (> 145 mmol/L) [^114EHymy] |
| Serum osmolality | Elevated (> 295 mOsm/kg) [^notfound] |
| Urine osmolality | - < 300 mOsm/kg: diabetes insipidus [^115JmtXD] <br/> - > 500 mOsm/kg: dehydration, osmotic diuresis [^115JmtXD] |
| Urine sodium | - < 20 mmol/L: extrarenal losses [^notfound] <br/> - > 100 mmol/L: renal losses [^notfound] |
| Plasma glucose | Identifies hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis [^117TGcCE] |
| ADH/copeptin | Differentiates central vs nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^115JmtXD] |

---

Clinical features include thirst, polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, confusion, seizures, and coma; severity correlates with the degree and chronicity of hypernatremia [^113Fgqvj].

---

## Management principles

- **Correct underlying cause**: Stop sodium intake, treat diabetes insipidus, address dehydration [^117TGcCE].
- **Fluid replacement**: Calculate free water deficit and replace gradually [^1119PAbP].
- **Rate of correction**: Target 0.5–1 mmol/L/h; faster correction only if acute and symptomatic [^111MuVEz] [^115YQeus].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent serum sodium, urine output, and neurological status checks [^113nPcfZ].

---

Hypernatremia reflects a **water deficit or sodium excess**; accurate classification by volume status and urine studies guides diagnosis and safe correction.

Key Points

Question

Is the rate of correction associated with mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4265 adults with severe hypernatremia, patient survival was strongly correlated with hypernatremia correction rate. There was no evidence of any neurological complications associated with rapid correction of severe hypernatremia.

Meaning

The results suggest that faster correction rates than currently recommended for severe hypernatremia might translate to better patient outcomes.

### Understanding hypernatremia [^114itjBg]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV or IM vasopressin 1–2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Salt and water: a review of hypernatremia [^116t7LQg]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium disorders are generally a marker of water balance in the body. Thus, hypernatremia is most often caused by an overall deficit of total body water. Other unique circumstances may lead to excess salt, without an impact on the body's total water volume. Hypernatremia is commonly acquired in both the hospital and community. As hypernatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, treatment should be initiated promptly. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology and management of the main types of hypernatremia, which can be categorized as either a loss of water or gain of sodium that can be mediated by renal or extrarenal mechanisms.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^1139hX9K]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Some of the rationale supporting current expert opinion recommending controlled correction of hypernatremia rests on a perceived symmetry with correction of hyponatremia. While it is appealing to group these 2 common sodium disorders together, published data do not support this approach. The evidence supporting slow correction of hyponatremia is supported by animal studies, numerous case reports and large observational studies. In contrast, there are no convincing reports of even 1 adult harmed by rapid correction of hypernatremia. From a physiological perspective the risk of neurological complications seems to be much higher with rapid correction of hyponatremia, as the adaptations of brain cells to hypernatremia are much slower than to hyponatremia. Also, while the risk of complication associated with rapid correction is more common with chronic hyponatremia compared with acute hyponatremia, chronic hypernatremia is considerably less common than acute hypernatremia. Our results were comparable for patients with hypernatremia on admission compared with those who were diagnosed during hospitalization, also supporting the safety of rapid correction of hypernatremia even when there is no clear documentation of an acute condition.

The 30-day mortality was alarmingly high in the reported cohort. This is in line with previous studies of severe hypernatremia. The absolute difference in survival between rapidly and slowly corrected patients was very large and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders. Interestingly, the size of the absolute difference in survival was comparable at 30 days and at 1 year following documentation of severe hypernatremia. This might suggest that the different mortality rates do not represent differences in the patient populations unaccounted by the statistical analysis, but rather the results of the treatment strategies for severe hypernatremia, namely the rate of correction. An additional support to this hypothesis is the strong correlation reported between the absolute sodium correction in the first 24 hours and patient survival. This implies that the high mortality rates known to be associated with severe hypernatremia might be partly attributed to lack of aggressive rehydration, which might improve patient outcomes.

### A clinical approach to the treatment of chronic hypernatremia [^111Jhniq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypernatremia is a commonly encountered electrolyte disorder occurring in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Community-acquired hypernatremia typically occurs at the extremes of age, whereas hospital-acquired hypernatremia affects patients of all age groups. Serum sodium concentration is linked to water homeostasis, which is dependent on the thirst mechanism, arginine vasopressin, and kidney function. Because both hypernatremia and the rate of correction of hypernatremia are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, prompt effective treatment is crucial. Chronic hypernatremia can be classified into 3 broad categories, hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic forms, with each form having unique treatment considerations. In this teaching case, we provide a clinically based quantitative approach to the treatment of both hypervolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia, which occurred in the same patient during the course of a prolonged illness.

Fig. 3
Algorithm for differential diagnosis of hypernatremia, modified according to Bockenhauer et al. and Zieg, J. After excluding pseudohypernatremia, early management is tailored to the volume status and weight of the patient. While free water loss and insufficient water intake are associated with weight loss and low urine sodium, children with salt intoxication gain weight and their urine sodium is high. Measurement of plasma and urine osmolality is important in determining the cause of hypernatremia

Table 2
Etiology of hypernatremia in children

Hypernatremia may lead to neurologic symptoms due to the shift of water from the intracellular compartment, resulting in cellular shrinkage. These symptoms include irritability, fever, and weakness. Severe cases may present with lethargy, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, coma, seizures, and death. Children with hypernatremic dehydration should first receive intravenous isotonic solutions to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion, followed by solutions containing higher free water content to correct hypernatremia. The free water deficit can be estimated using the formula: 4 mL × weight (kg) × desired change in serum sodium (mmol/L). This formula can be applied for patient management in situations where children are experiencing hypernatremia dehydration and require fluid supplements. It is essential to correct hypernatremia gradually with a recommended correction rate of below 1 mmol/L/h and 15 mmol/24 h to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Some experts recommend administering solutions with slightly higher sodium content (10–15 mmol/L lower) in children with severe hypernatremia (greater than 175 mmol/L) to avoid the risk of rapid decline in serum sodium due to excessive free water intake. Regular monitoring of serum sodium is necessary to avoid a rapid drop in serum sodium levels. Following fluid replacement for losses, hypotonic solutions with lower sodium content (Na 75 mmol/L) are recommended for severe hypernatremia and (Na 30 mmol/L) for mild cases to help control and gradually adjust the sodium concentration. Rehydration strategies are different in children with renal concentration defects to control sodium levels according to specific needs. Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should be given hypotonic solutions (dextrose), whereas those with central diabetes insipidus require replacement of water loss with hypotonic fluids alongside desmopressin administration. However, caution is exercised with these treatments as they potentially lead to hyponatremia in cases of renal impairment affecting electrolyte balance. Therefore, careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential when administering desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent the development of hyponatremia. In hemodynamically unstable patients, rapid correction of intravascular volume with isotonic saline should be initially used to stabilize the patient. Once stability is achieved, transitioning to hypotonic solutions may be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Discussion

Despite the high prevalence of hypernatremia, data guiding optimal correction rates are scarce. To our knowledge, we report on the largest cohort to date of patients with severe hypernatremia. Rapid correction rate of hypernatremia was associated with better overall survival and shorter hospitalizations. We did not identify any evidence supporting an association between rapid rate of correction and patient harm, and no neurological complications were observed in patients with rapid correction. These findings challenge current expert opinion advising slower, controlled correction rates to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications.

Most previous studies of patients with hypernatremia included less than 200 patients. Smaller studies are subject to potentially fragile results leading to coincidental findings, selection bias, and publication bias. To our knowledge, the largest study to date, including 450 patients, reported no association between hypernatremia correction rate and patient survival. However, these were patients who were critically ill and hospitalized in ICUs, representing a different patient population. Furthermore, we reported on a considerably larger cohort of patients, making the results more robust.

The currently suggested correction rate of hypernatremia is an extrapolation of the suggested correction rate in neonates, a very different patient population with different physiology, comorbidities, and etiologies for hypernatremia. Faster correction of hypernatremia in adults can theoretically improve patient outcomes in several ways. Faster correction of severe volume contraction and the accompanying acute kidney failure can reduce the risk of potential adverse events, such as electrolyte abnormalities, infections, chronic kidney failure, and cardiovascular complications. Longer hospitalizations associated with slower correction of hypernatremia are also associated with potential complications such as hospital-acquired infections, falls, delirium and deconditioning, more so in patients with kidney failure, all known to be associated with worse patient outcomes. Additionally, it is possible that hypernatremia directly causes time-dependent neurological injury, which can be minimized with rapid correction. This hypothesis, supported by the reported results, should be tested separately, perhaps in an animal model.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^113Pd92s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, this study is notable for its large sample size and the event quantity, which can be representative of the entire patient population of the United States. To the best of our knowledge, the association between hospital-acquired hypernatremia and its outcomes (i.e. in-hospital mortality and discharge dispositions) has not been studied systematically at a large population level. In addition, we addressed a key gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between different levels of hospital-acquired hypernatremia and selected outcomes deeming kidney function level in a large diverse population. Furthermore, we corrected [Na] for hyperglycemia, an adjustment necessary for determining the true prevalence and severity of hypernatremia.

Our study has several limitations as well. First, we were unable to include a disease severity scoring modality, such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. However, this study included the identification of comorbidities (including CKD) and reasons for hospitalization using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to account for the presence of medical conditions. This may have underestimated the reported CKD prevalence. We were also able to adjust for the Quan-CCI, which has been widely used to predict survival of hospitalized and critically ill patients. Second, we did not look for precedence of hypernatremia by AKI or vice versa because this was not the primary aim of this study. There is also the potential of AKI misclassification because of the definition we used. This may have affected the estimated cross-associations of dysnatremia and AKI with the reported outcomes. This study took a parsimonious approach to explore how the other factors can participate in outcomes of iatrogenic hypernatremia. We did not look at patients' diagnoses. However, we looked for predictors of development of iatrogenic hypernatremia in baseline characteristics in a large group of hospitalized individuals. Some eligible patients had multiple admissions. However, they were excluded from the statistical analyses. Finally, because of the observational nature of our study, we cannot obviate the possibility of residual confounding and cannot draw any causal interpretations from our results. However, conducting large randomized controlled trials to overcome this limitation may not be easily practicable. We believe that this last limitation should not undermine the importance of the finding that hospital-acquired hypernatremia, regardless of the cause, is significantly associated with higher in-hospital mortality and discharge to nursing home or hospice.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^113uxLF1]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality of hypernatremic patients reaches 20% to 60% and varies according to comorbidities, associated illness, and whether hypernatremia is present at admission or acquired during hospitalization. Hypernatremia at admission or acquired during the hospitalization is an independent mortality risk factor.

In this study, we report clinical characteristics, management, outcome and mortality risk factors of severely hypernatremic patients admitted to the ED.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^114RpkPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^116XhAVB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

In summary, we show a previously unrecognized role of [Na +] fluctuation in short-term and long-term mortalities in a large cohort of unselected hospitalized adults. We also provide affirmatory data showing an increased mortality in patients with borderline hypo- or hypernatremia irrespective of their admission diagnoses. Prospective controlled trials are required to establish causality.

### Rate of correction of hypernatremia and health outcomes in critically ill patients [^113CE819]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hypernatremia is common in hospitalized, critically ill patients. Although there are no clear guidelines on sodium correction rate for hypernatremia, some studies suggest a reduction rate not to exceed 0.5 mmol/L per hour. However, the data supporting this recommendation and the optimal rate of hypernatremia correction in hospitalized adults are unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We assessed the association of hypernatremia correction rates with neurologic outcomes and mortality in critically ill patients with hypernatremia at admission and those that developed hypernatremia during hospitalization. We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III and identified patients with hypernatremia (serum sodium level > 155 mmol/L) on admission (n = 122) and hospital-acquired (n = 327). We calculated different ranges of rapid correction rates (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour overall and > 8, > 10, and > 12 mmol/L per 24 hours) and utilized logistic regression to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to examine association with outcomes.

Results

We had complete data on 122 patients with severe hypernatremia on admission and 327 patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The difference in in-hospital 30-day mortality proportion between rapid (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour) and slower (≤ 0.5 mmol/L per hour) correction rates were not significant either in patients with hypernatremia at admission with rapid versus slow correction (25% versus 28%; P = 0.80) or in patients with hospital-acquired hypernatremia with rapid versus slow correction (44% versus 40%; P = 0.50). There was no difference in aOR of mortality for rapid versus slow correction in either admission (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.5 to 3.7) or hospital-acquired hypernatremia (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3). Manual chart review of all suspected chronic hypernatremia patients, which included all 122 with hypernatremia at admission, 128 of the 327 hospital-acquired hypernatremia, and an additional 28 patients with ICD-9 codes for cerebral edema, seizures and/or alteration of consciousness, did not reveal a single case of cerebral edema attributable to rapid hyprnatremia correction.

Conclusions

We did not find any evidence that rapid correction of hypernatremia is associated with a higher risk for mortality, seizure, alteration of consciousness, and/or cerebral edema in critically ill adult patients with either admission or hospital-acquired hypernatremia.

### Hypernatremia in the intensive care unit [^114HxUGq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypernatremia is a relatively frequent electrolyte disorder seen in critically ill patients. As many as 27% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) develop hypernatremia of variable severity during an ICU stay. Debate among specialists often ensues as to whether to correct hypernatremia or not. Some practitioners, particularly intensivists, believe that correction of hypernatremia with fluids may cause expansion of the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) thereby worsening ventilation and impeding extubation. Other practitioners, including many nephrologists, do not expect correction of hypernatremia to lead to clinically apparent ECFV expansion, and fear other deleterious effects of hypernatremia. In this review we address the controversy regarding appropriate practice.

Recent Findings

There are no randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) to guide the administration of electrolyte-free fluid administration in hypernatremic patients. However, there are associations, demonstrated in the literature, suggesting that hypernatremia of any severity will increase the mortality and length of stay in these patients. These associations generally support the practice of correction of hypernatremia. In addition, our knowledge of the distribution of total body water influences us towards correcting hypernatremia as an appropriate therapy. We do not expect that adequate RCTs addressing this question will be performed.

Summary

Allowing persistence of any degree of hypernatremia is associated with increased mortality, length of stay (LOS) and postdischarge mortality. We expect that proper use of electrolyte-free water intake will avoid adverse outcomes.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^113ePgQa]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatremia is diagnosed in 1 to 2% of patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). Such patients often have various underlying pathologies implicated in hypernatremia occurrence. In most cases, treatment of hypernatremia is started at ED, but there have been only two reports on the characteristics, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients at ED.

The recommended hypernatremia correction speed, based on pediatric retrospective case-series, is 1 mmol/L/h when hypernatremia occurrence has been quick (a few hours) and 0.5 mmol/L/h when it has been long or is unknown. A too fast correction can induce cerebral edema and irreversible neurologic sequels that are avoided with a slow correction. Unless shock or hypotension are present, isotonic or hypertonic solutes are not recommended. Moreover, experts recommend first replacing fluid losses in dehydrated/hypovolemic patients by use of isotonic or slightly hypotonic fluids (e.g. lactated Ringer's).

To avoid over- or under-treatment, which both might cause neurological complications (cerebral edema, seizure, or coma), management of intravenous fluid must be rationalized. Mathematic calculation of water deficit based on sodium and water distribution in the intra- and extra-cellular spaces has been proposed. This requires two clinical data: natremia measurement and patient weight. For example, Adrogue and Madias's formula serves to calculate natremia variation after perfusion of one liter of solute according to the type of solute, initial natremia, and total body water volume: Attended natremia = ([Na] of solute – initial natremia)/(Total body water volume - 1). Most formulas consider the human body as a closed system and do not integrate undergoing losses of water. Furthermore, total body water volume required for calculation is extrapolated from weight regardless of the percentage of body fat variability. Also, these formulas were found to be imprecise in individual patients with deviations > 10 mmol/L. Their inappropriate use might lead to hypernatremia under-correction or worsening.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^115QoHDe]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first study assessing outcome of hypernatremic patients in an ED according to the provided treatment. It suggests that medical management of hypernatremic patients must be improved regarding evaluation (weight, diuresis, urinary ionogram) and management (type of solute, perfusion speed) and that a too slow correction speed is associated with an increased risk of death regardless of initial natremia.

### Disorders of body water homeostasis in critical illness [^111W6eGQ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Disorders of sodium and water homeostasis are among the most commonly encountered disturbances in the critical care setting, because many disease states cause defects in the complex mechanisms that control the intake and output of water and solute. Because body water is the primary determinant of extracellular fluid osmolality, disorders of body water balance can be categorized into hypoosmolar and hyperosmolar disorders depending on the presence of an excess or a deficiency of body water relative to body solute. Because the main constituent of plasma osmolality is sodium, hypoosmolar and hyperosmolar disease states are generally characterized hy hyponatremia and hypernatremia, respectively. After a brief review of normal water metabolism, this article focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the critical care setting.

### Current prescriptions for the correction of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia: are they too simple? [^115n9Lnh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Hypo- and hypernatraemic (dysnatraemic) disorders are among the most common electrolyte disorders encountered by primary care providers and nephrologists. They represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and inappropriate management can result in serious sequelae. Several formulas addressing the fluid prescription for dysnatraemic patients have been introduced. Many authors stress the importance of considering output as well as input in formulating a treatment plan for the dysnatraemic patient. However, currently available formulas fail to account for ongoing renal and extrarenal fluid and electrolyte losses. We propose a novel, versatile formula based on established principles governing the distribution of Na(+) in body fluids. The formula can be used in a simplified form for a quick but accurate estimate of the change in serum [Na(+)] for any infused fluid, while simultaneously accounting for renal losses. The formula can also be expanded to include more complex losses if desired. Importantly, it forces the caregiver to consider both output and input when formulating a prescription for the dysnatraemic patient.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^115YS5c6]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study describes initial presentation, management, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients (≥ 150 mmol/L) in the ED and during the following hospitalization. Relative to the 50 000 patients hospitalized each year in our ED, severe hypernatremia is a rare event. However, unlike in-hospital acquired hypernatremia, most patients with hypernatremia at hospital admission receive initial treatment in the ED. To our knowledge, very few studies have reported on presentation, management and outcome of severely hypernatremic patients upon their arrival to the hospital (Table 5). Arampatzis et al. reported hypernatremia > 145 mmol/L in 0.9% of patients admitted toED and 1.5% of patients with natremia dosing, and severe hypernatremia ≥ 150 mmol/L in 0.1% of admissions and 0.2% of patients with natremia dosing, which is similar to our results.

Table 5
Studies reporting out-of-hospital acquired hypernatremia

Arampatzis et al. published two studies in the same year. Patients of the second study with hypernatremia defined as ≥ 150 mmol/L were a subgroup of the former larger study, with an unclassical hypernatremia definition.

In our study, hypernatremic patients were old (mean age 79.7 years-old), lived in medical institutions or at home with medical care (55%), and had cognitive impairment (28% had dementia), which are situations of thirst impairment and/or limited access to water and at high risk for dehydration. Moreover, for 47% of patients with severe hypernatremia ≥ 150 mmol/l, the main diagnosis was a situation associated with water loss, and 23% of patients had a treatment modifying renal water excretion.

### Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^114wkuZ7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Hypernatremia at any time point during hospital stay is related to excess in-hospital mortality, whereas hyponatremia at presentation is associated with a higher likelihood of requiring advanced ventilatory support. Hyponatremia was not a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, except for the subgroup of hypovolemic hyponatremia. Therefore, serum sodium values could be used in clinical practice to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of poor outcomes who would benefit from more intensive monitoring and judicious rehydration.

### Hypernatremia in the critically ill is an independent risk factor for mortality [^114bVgGw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatremia is common in the intensive care unit (ICU). We assessed the prevalence of hypernatremia and its impact on mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS).

Study Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting & Participants

All patients admitted to a medical ICU of a university hospital during a 35-month observation period.

Predictor

Hypernatremia (serum sodium > 149 mmol/L) after admission to the ICU.

Outcomes & Measurements

Main outcomes were 28-day hospital mortality and ICU LOS. Demographic factors, main diagnosis, and severity of illness. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for data analysis.

Results

Of 981 patients, 90 (9%) had hypernatremia, on admission to the ICU in 21 (2%) and developed during the ICU stay in 69 patients (7%). Of these 981 patients, 235 (24%) died; LOS was 8 ± 9 (SD) days. Mortality rates were 39% and 43% in patients with hypernatremia on admission or that developed after admission compared with 24% in patients without hypernatremia (P < 0.01). LOS was 20 ± 16 days in patients with hypernatremia compared with 8 ± 10 days in patients without hypernatremia (P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, hypernatremia was an independent risk factor for mortality (relative risk, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.3).

Limitations

Retrospective design, absence of data for long-term mortality.

Conclusions

Most cases of hypernatremia in the ICU developed after admission, suggesting an iatrogenic component in its evolution. Hypernatremia is associated with increased mortality. Strategies for preventing hypernatremia in the ICU should be encouraged.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^114v5tBn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this diverse cohort study from a large database of over 600 hospitals in the United States, we found that 6% of patients diagnosed as normonatremic at admission developed hypernatremia during hospitalization. In our study, hospital-acquired hypernatremia was associated with higher mortality rate compared with normonatremia. Finally, patients with hospital-acquired hypernatremia had higher odds of discharge to hospice and discharge to a nursing facility.

This report confirms previous observations relating hospital-acquired hypernatremia and its severity to mortality in hospitalized patients, and extends previous research by examining discharge dispositions. Our findings for increment of in-hospital mortality along with the increase in the severity of hypernatremia are similar to other studies. In line with our results, previous studies by Hu et al. in China and Funk et al. in Austria demonstrated that there are independent associations between hypernatremia and the risk of in-hospital mortality even after adjusting for potential confounding factors. This is especially true for patients admitted with dysnatremias in the intensive care unit.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^111ebAwa]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, we found that all levels of hospital-acquired hypernatremia were independently associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, and discharge to nursing facilities of the patients. The strength of this association suggests that hypernatremia may serve as a widely available risk factor of poor outcomes among hospitalized patients. These findings underscore the need for more awareness of hospital-acquired hypernatremia, especially among patients with advanced kidney dysfunction, and may provide the opportunity to prevent and minimize subsequent adverse outcomes. Further work focusing on prevention, duration, and rate of correction of hospital-acquired hypernatremia are crucial next steps because treatment of hypernatremia may be inadequate or delayed. Finally, physician training to promote awareness and the development of hospital-based algorithms to prevent fluid prescription errors could result in improved management and even avoidance of hospital-acquired hypernatremia.

### Clinical semiology and neuroradiologic correlates of acute hypernatremic osmotic challenge in adults: a literature review [^115EmDfv]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2013). Low credibility.

The complex interplay between hypernatremic osmotic disturbances and cerebral lesions is yet to be clarified. In this review, we discuss, on the basis of the reported data of hypernatremic CNS challenge in the adult population, the clinical and radiologic features of the condition. Our search captured 20 case studies and 1 case series with 30 patients in total who acquired acute hypernatremia due to different etiologies and developed CNS lesions. We explored the associations between premorbid conditions, clinical presentation, hypernatremic state, correction rate, and radiologic appearance, including the localization of brain lesions and the outcomes. The results revealed that altered mental status was the most commonly reported symptom and osmotic demyelination syndrome in the form of extrapontine myelinolysis was the prevailing radiologic pattern. Finally, we contrasted, when appropriate, clinical and experimental data related to hypernatremic and hyponatremic osmotic insults to aid the understanding of the pathophysiology of CNS osmotic brain injury.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^116BJnXf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding discharge to nursing facilities, unadjusted and adjusted models showed an inconsistent pattern deeming eGFR categories. In adjusted models, the highest ORs were observed among patients with severe hypernatremia and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min per 1.73 m² (16.02 [95% CI, 14.55 to 17.63]) (Figure 3, Table 2).

The longest length of stay was observed with eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² in all serum Na categories (Table 3).

Kidney Function Classification and Outcomes

Regarding kidney function status (acute versus chronic), in crude models, the highest mortality rate in patients with normonatremia, mild hypernatremia, and moderate hypernatremia was observed among patients with AKI and without CKD.

In adjusted models, we found that among patients with severe hypernatremia, the highest in-hospital mortality rate was observed among patients with CKD (Figure 4, Table 4). The highest mortality rate in adjusted models was observed among non-CKD patients with AKI and normonatremia or mild or moderate hypernatremia. The odds of discharge to hospice and nursing facilities are presented in Figure 4 and Table 4. A sensitivity analysis of advanced CKD (stages 3–5) hospitalized patients with CKD diagnosis using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes did not reveal statistically significant differences for outcomes independent of the level of hypernatremia.

Plots of ORs for in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or discharge to nursing facility associated with different intervals of serum sodium levels during hospital stay stratified by kidney dysfunction status. The ORs were derived from multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, selected comorbidities, and reasons for hospitalization. Discharge to home and normal serum sodium levels of 135–145 mEq/L served as referent. Error bars indicate 95% CIs.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^115KCSqN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

A caveat that needs attention in our work is the ascertainment of CKD classification by the use of hospitalized ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Back in 2000 (starting year of data retrieval for this analysis), ICD codes were relatively new and CKD as a diagnosis was underreported, especially mild CKD. Therefore, the prevalence of CKD stages 1–4 reported herein may be undercounted. Nevertheless, an existing diagnostic code for CKD may reflect that the hospitalized patient had previous care and available records, which may, in part, explain why the risk of in-hospital mortality was lower for patients with CKD and no AKI/no hypernatremia.

The fact that our inpatient study population suffered more acute conditions could be a major determinant of our findings. Furthermore, the physiologic plausibility of our findings relies on the strategic role the kidney plays in sodium and water homeostasis. In early stages of CKD, hyponatremia is more common than hypernatremia. In more advanced stages of CKD, water handling becomes more impaired and hypernatremia is more common. When eGFR drops below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², the risk of mortality seems to become the highest. The age distribution of hospital-acquired hypernatremia is usually similar to that of the general hospitalized population. Both the kidneys and the brain collaborate to regulate hospital-acquired hypernatremia. When the kidneys function relatively normal, iatrogenic or central nervous system causes should be considered. Inadequate and inappropriate prescription of fluids to patients with predictably increased water losses and impaired thirst and/or restricted free water intake may result in iatrogenic hospital-acquired hypernatremia, and the treatment is often inadequate or delayed.

### The impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system in acute hypernatremia in rabbits [^115s7nv9]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The harmfulness of hypernatremia is mainly due to the degree of hypernatremia, the duration of hypernatremia, and the dangers brought by incorrect correction of hypernatremia. Studies have found that hypernatremia increases the 28-day mortality rate of patients. The focus of treating hypernatremia is to address the cause, supplement free water, and closely monitor serum sodium concentrations. A study analysis found that current recommendations for treating acute and chronic hypernatremia are not based on high-quality research. For chronic hypernatremia, Richard et al. proposed that no more than 8–10 mEq/L should be corrected in chronic hypernatremia patients every 24 h, with a maximum correction rate of 0.5 mEq/L/h, and regular assessment of serum sodium concentration should be required during the correction phase. In 1995, Borra et al. concluded through experiments that the correction rate of hypernatremia is related to the improvement of mental status, and the frequency of improvement in the level of consciousness is higher when hypernatremia is corrected within 4 days. A retrospective study found that rapid correction of hypernatremia is not related to a higher mortality rate of hypernatremia, defining "rapid correction" as greater than 0.5 mEq/L. Other studies have shown that the mortality rate of hypernatremia is often related to insufficient correction. There are currently no guidelines or consensuses for the rate of sodium reduction during the treatment of acute hypernatremia for clinical reference. It is recommended to quickly reduce serum sodium to normal at a rate of 2 mEq/L/h, and experts in the literature do not mention the reason for reducing sodium at this rate, but consider that it is necessary to quickly reduce serum sodium to normal levels for acute hypernatremia, as persistent hypernatremia itself will have an impact on patients. Some experts also state that reducing sodium at a rate of 1 mEq/L/h is safe, and this is based on case reports. According to pathophysiological theory, some experts also recommend using glucose-based hypotonic solutions to quickly correct acute hypernatremia and reduce it to 145 mEq/L within 24 h. A retrospective study showed that the 30-day and 1-year mortality rates after rapid correction of hypernatremia were lower than those after slow correction.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^115uaRV3]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^1162HiMf]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the non classical management of hypernatremia, the mortality rate of our cohort (24%) is similar to those previously reported, suggesting that our practices are comparable to those of other EDs (Table 5). In intensive care units, hypernatremia occurrence is a known mortality risk factor but patients are different and hypernatremia is frequently iatrogenic. Indeed, the consequences of cerebral edema differ with age, with a major risk at younger age when the size ratio of brain to cranial volume is high. In our study, hypernatremic patients were old and often had dementia, two conditions associated with cerebral atrophy. Moreover, we show that hypovolemia signs (extracellular dehydration, hypotension, and renal insufficiency) are the principal risk factors for death during hospitalization, suggesting that associated illness and medical status are the major risk factors for death in patients with hypernatremia acquired outside the hospital. This hypothesis is supported by the short delay before death (68% in the first week, most of them during the first 2 days). Three of the 4 patients with a diagnosis of shock at ED died during hospitalization.

In this study, we did not find a statistical link between the level of hypernatremia and mortality. Higher calculated plasmatic tonicity and calculated plasmatic osmolarity were associated with death in the monovariate model (Table 4), but not in the multivariate analysis. The 85 cases analyzed represent a relatively small cohort and there were numerous confounding factors such as loss to follow-up, associated comorbidities, and associated acute illness. The small cohort size also probably explains why the relationship between hypernatremia and death did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, our monocentric study might reflect local practices and a local effect. Nevertheless, in our study, a too slow natremia correction speed was associated with death. This is the first study reporting that under-correction of hypernatremia is associated with an increased mortality. Time spent with intracellular dehydration could be more important than the severity of hypernatremia or hyperosmolarity. In hyponatremia, it is well known that a too high correction speed can lead to osmotic demyelination. In hypernatremia, similar recommendations are given, but physicians should also be aware that a too slow correction rate could increase the risk of death.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^113Fgqvj]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypernatremia is a common finding in hospitalized patients, with reported incidence 1% to 3%, and up to 9% in intensive care units (ICUs). Hypernatremia indicates a deficit in total body water, usually occurring in patients with inadequate access to water or impaired thirst mechanisms such as ICU patients, infants, and older adults. The clinical presentation of hypernatremia ranges from mild, nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, headache, and lethargy, to severe neurological symptoms such as seizure and coma. Hypernatremia is associated with higher mortality rates than any other electrolyte abnormality, although this is often attributed to the comorbidities of patients with hypernatremia rather than its direct consequences.

Data regarding the optimal rate of correction of hypernatremia are lacking. Current expert opinion states that hypernatremia correction rate should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h or 10 mmol/L/d to avoid the development of cerebral edema and permanent neurological damage. These complications were documented mainly in neonates. Clinical data supporting the safety and clinical benefits of slow correction of hypernatremia in adults are scarce. Several small studies reported that slow correction of hypernatremia is associated with excess mortality. Faster correction rates of up to 1 millimole per liter per hour have been suggested as appropriate for patients with rapidly developing hypernatremia. A recent study found no association between rate of correction of hypernatremia and clinical outcomes. Whether current guidelines reflect the optimal balance between patient safety and potential harm is unknown.

The current study aimed to elucidate the association between the rate of correction of hypernatremia and patient outcomes. We hypothesized that fast correction rates would be associated with more favorable patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

PICOT Question 11

"When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with msTBI admitted to an ICU, should hypernatremia alone be considered a reliable predictor of mortality?"

Description of the predictor: Hypernatremia defined as a serum sodium level > 160 mmol/L during the ICU stay.

Recommendation: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with msTBI admitted to an ICU, we suggest that hypernatremia during ICU treatment alone not be considered a reliable predictor of hospital mortality or disease-related mortality beyond discharge (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale: The body of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, with various studies demonstrating potential bias in the domains of study attrition, confounding, and self-fulfilling prophecy. Inconsistency and imprecision were present. From a pathophysiological point of view, hypernatremia may be indicative of a particularly severe TBI with hypothalamic dysfunction or may be a marker of the frequent administration of osmotherapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline). Hypernatremia, especially when iatrogenic, is a treatable and reversible condition. Numerous studies have found an association between the occurrence of hypernatremia and outcome/mortality. However, only very few studies met our criteria. These studies had different cutoff points for hypernatremia. One study suggested that possibly co-occurring hyperchloremia, and not hypernatremia itself, may be associated with mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^112gWaK5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Prognostic consequences of borderline dysnatremia: pay attention to minimal serum sodium change [^111iX9Nz]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Dysnatremia is common at ICU admission. Mild to severe hypernatremia and hyponatremia were present in respectively 7.8% and 27.4% of the critically ill patients.

- Dysnatremia is independently associated with ICU mortality. In our study, mild hypernatremia (that is serum sodium concentration > 145 mmol/L) and moderate hyponatremia (that is serum sodium concentration < 130 mmol/L) are independently associated with poor outcome (respective sHR of 1.34 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.57) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.002 to 1.40)).

- Although a causal role for dysnatremia in death is biologically plausible, we cannot determine from our data whether the association between dysnatremia and mortality reflected a direct effect of dysnatremia, a surrogate marker for underlying comorbidities or reason for ICU admission, or both.

### The impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system in acute hypernatremia in rabbits [^112twV2j]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypernatremia is defined as a plasma sodium ion concentration > 145 mEq/L and is closely associated with the severity of patients' conditions. It is relatively common in intensive care units, with an incidence rate of hypernatremia in critically ill patients ranging from 4 to 26%, and it is an independent risk factor affecting patient prognosis. Based on the duration of hypernatremia, it can be divided into acute and chronic hypernatremia, with hypernatremia lasting less than 48 h referred to as acute hypernatremia, and hypernatremia lasting more than 48 h referred to as chronic hypernatremia.

In terms of the rate of sodium reduction, there has been a lack of clear guidelines and consensus, presenting challenges for clinical physicians in practice. Some studies have indicated that rapid correction of hypernatremia is not associated with seizure occurrence, brain edema, or mortality. Other studies have suggested that too slow correction can lead to higher mortality rates. For acute hypernatremia, some recommend rapidly reducing serum sodium to normal levels at a rate of 2 mEq/L/h, while others suggest that a reduction rate of 1 mEq/L/h is safe.

This study uses animal experiments as a means to delve into the impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system during acute hypernatremia. By simulating different sodium reduction conditions in the experiment and measuring neurological indicators such as intracranial pressure, the study clarifies the damage to the central nervous system caused by different sodium reduction rates. Finally, by observing pathological changes in brain tissue, the types of central nervous system damage caused by different sodium reduction rates are identified.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^117BxCXq]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hypernatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is associated with high mortality rates. Current guidelines suggest avoiding fast correction rates but are not supported by robust data.

Objective

To investigate whether there is an association between hypernatremia correction rate and patient survival.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study examined data from all patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center between 2007 and 2021 who were diagnosed with severe hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥ 155 mmol/L) at admission or during hospitalization. Statistical analysis was performed from April 2022 to August 2023.

Exposure

Patients were grouped as having fast correction rates (> 0.5 mmol/L/h) and slow correction rates (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) in accordance with current guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause 30-day mortality.

Results

A total of 4265 patients were included in this cohort, of which 2621 (61.5%) were men and 343 (8.0%) had fast correction rates; the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 78 (64–87) years. Slow correction was associated with higher 30-day mortality compared with fast correction (50.7% [1990 of 3922] vs 31.8% [109 of 343]; P < .001). These results remained significant after adjusting for demographics (age, gender), Charlson comorbidity index, initial sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, hospitalization in an ICU, and severe hyperglycemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.55–2.62]), regardless of whether hypernatremia was hospital acquired (aOR, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.57–3.05]) or documented on admission (aOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.06–2.55]). There was a strong negative correlation between absolute sodium correction during the first 24 hours following the initial documentation of severe hypernatremia and 30-day mortality (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.80 [95% CI, -0.93 to -0.50]; P < .001). Median (IQR) hospitalization length was shorter for fast correction vs slow correction rates (5.0 [2.1–14.9] days vs 7.2 [3.5–16.1] days; P < .001). Prevalence of neurological complications was comparable for both groups, and none were attributed to fast correction rates of hypernatremia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study of patients with severe hypernatremia found that rapid correction of hypernatremia was associated with shorter hospitalizations and significantly lower patient mortality without any signs of neurologic complications. These results suggest that physicians should consider the totality of evidence when considering the optimal rates of correction for patients with severe hypernatremia.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^112fCNVH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysnatremia is a common electrolyte imbalance in hospitalized patients. However, hypernatremia is less prevalent compared with hyponatremia. – The prevalence of hypernatremia among hospitalized patients has been reported to be between 1% and 6%. – Outcomes of hypernatremia have also been less studied, and most studies examined selected patient populations.– In addition, there are limited studies regarding hospital-acquired hypernatremiaand patients' kidney function at admission.

Hypernatremia can be community-acquired or hospital-acquired. In most previous studies, there have been limitations in the selection of clinical settings, such as inpatient or outpatient, which gave rise to variations in the estimate of the prevalence of hypernatremia. In addition, little is known about the association between hospital-acquired hypernatremia and discharge dispositions, specifically discharge to hospice and nursing facility, which are key patient-centered outcomes. Furthermore, most of the studies around hypernatremia and selected outcomes were single-center studies with limited sample sizes.

Impairment in kidney function may be related to hospital-acquired hypernatremia. It is not surprising that AKI, characterized by an abrupt reduction in kidney function, is commonly associated with electrolyte imbalances. A previous study by Kovesdy et al. demonstrated a linear diminish in the hypernatremia-related mortality rate with more advanced stages of CKD. Substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding prognostic implications of hospital-acquired hypernatremia as related to the level of kidney function in hospitalized patients.

The lack of population-based evidence supports the need to evaluate the relationship of hospital-acquired hypernatremia to outcomes and discharge dispositions among hospitalized patients with various levels of acute and/or chronic kidney dysfunction. In this cohort study from a large national database of over 600 hospitals in the United States, we investigated the correlation of hospital-acquired hypernatremia and its outcomes and discharge dispositions in hospitalized patients deeming the status of kidney function and eGFR.

### Hyperglycemic hypernatremic hypertonic state: a predominant HHS subtype and its clinical and diagnostic features [^113eZXFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) with concurrent hypernatremia is an emerging and under-investigated subtype of HHS.

Objective

To investigate the clinical characteristics, prevalence, and diagnostic parameters of this under-recognized HHS subtype.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive adults with diabetes admitted with HHS from 2018 to 2024 at a single institution. We assessed measured and corrected sodium, free water deficit, calculated effective serum osmolarity, calculated total serum osmolarity, and coexisting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and metabolic acidosis.

Results

Among 174 patients with HHS, hypernatremia based on measured sodium (> 145 mmol/L) was uncommon (14/174, 8%), consistent with prior reports. However, hypernatremia based on corrected sodium for hyperglycemia was highly prevalent (166/174, 95.4%), suggesting that HHS with hypernatremia is the predominant subtype of HHS. Effective serum osmolarity > 300 mOsm/L was more sensitive than total serum osmolarity > 320 mOsm/L for diagnosing HHS. Additionally, 65.5% (114/174) of HHS cases had concurrent DKA, suggesting that the traditional exclusion of significant ketonemia and acidemia in HHS diagnosis may warrant reconsideration.

Conclusion

HHS with hypernatremia, defined by corrected sodium, is highly prevalent and clinically relevant, as corrected sodium better reflects the true free water deficit. HHS management should include evaluating both measured and corrected sodium, adopting effective serum osmolarity > 300 mOsm/L as a more sensitive diagnostic criterion, and reevaluating the exclusion criteria of significant ketonemia and acidosis. These refinements may enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable more personalized fluid management in HHS.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^115RGcNV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired hypernatremia is highly prevalent, overlooked, and associated with unfavorable consequences. There are limited studies examining the outcomes and discharge dispositions of various levels of hospital-acquired hypernatremia in patients with or without CKD.

Methods

We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study, and we analyzed the data of 1,728,141 patients extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database (January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2018). In this report, we investigated the association between hospital-acquired hypernatremia (serum sodium [Na] levels > 145 mEq/L) and in-hospital mortality or discharge dispositions with kidney function status at admission using adjusted multinomial regression models.

Results

Of all hospitalized patients, 6% developed hypernatremia after hospital admission. The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 12% and 1% in patients with hypernatremia and normonatremia, respectively. The risk of all outcomes was significantly greater for serum Na > 145 mEq/L compared with the reference interval (serum Na, 135–145 mEq/L). In patients with hypernatremia, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, and discharge to nursing facilities were 14.04 (13.71 to 14.38), 4.35 (4.14 to 4.57), and 3.88 (3.82 to 3.94), respectively (P < 0.001, for all). Patients with eGFR (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) 60–89 ml/min per 1.73 m² and normonatremia had the lowest odds ratio for in-hospital mortality (1.60 [1.52 to 1.70]).

Conclusions

Hospital-acquired hypernatremia is associated with in-hospital mortality and discharge to hospice or to nursing facilities in all stages of CKD.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^113sCFsK]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

About 1% of patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) have hypernatremia, a condition associated with a mortality rate of 20 to 60%. Management recommendations originate from intensive care unit studies, in which patients and medical diseases differ from those in ED.

Methods

We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients in the ED and risk factors associated with death occurrence during hospitalization.

Results

During 2010, 85 cases of severe hypernatremia ≥ 150 mmol/l were admitted to ED. Hypernatremia occurred in frail patients: mean age 79.7 years, 55% institutionalized, 28% with dementia. Twenty four percent of patients died during hospitalization. Male gender and low mean blood pressure (MBP) were independently associated with death, as well as slow natremia correction speed, but not the severity of hyperosmolarity at admission. Infusion solute was inappropriate for 45% of patients with MBP < 70 mmHg who received hypotonic solutes and 22% of patients with MBP ≥ 70 mmHg who received isotonic solutes or were not perfused.

Conclusions

This is the first study assessing outcome of hypernatremic patients in the ED according to the treatment provided. It appears that not only a too quick, but also a too slow correction speed is associated with an increased risk of death regardless of initial natremia. Medical management of hypernatremic patients must be improved regarding evaluation and treatment.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^1132cTTj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the results of this report demonstrated that eGFR at admission was significantly lower in patients with hypernatremia compared with patients with normonatremia. Regarding the different levels of hypernatremia stratified by eGFR levels, we observed that by increasing serum Na levels and decreasing the eGFR level, the risk of outcomes was higher. However, after stratifying each hypernatremia group by eGFR, we could not observe a consistent pattern in the risk of outcomes. In mild hypernatremia groups, the highest odds of in-hospital mortality were observed with eGFR < 15. For the severe hypernatremia group, the highest odds of in-hospital mortality were observed with eGFR ≥ 90 and the lowest odds with eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m². Tsipotis et al. showed that the highest ORs of in-hospital mortality in patients with hospital-acquired hypernatremia on admission were observed among those with eGFR 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m². Han et al. investigated the associations between serum Na levels and CKD and observed that hypernatremia in patients with CKD in the outpatient setting were both short- and long-term risk factors of mortality. Chiu et al. reported no significant association between hypernatremia and mortality in an outpatient population with CKD. Sun et al. also found that the stage of CKD did not seem to affect the mortality associated with hypernatremia. However, Kovesdy et al. demonstrated that more advanced CKD displayed a relatively lower mortality associated with hypernatremia compared with patients with less severe stages of CKD.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^113wkSSX]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A considerable number of patients are admitted to the ICU with dysnatremia, a deranged serum sodium concentration. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients develop dysnatremia during ICU admission.

Hypernatremia ([Na] > 145 mmol/L) is relatively rare at ICU admission but develops in up to 24% of patients during ICU stay and is an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU. ICU patients are predisposed to developing hypernatremia because of the administration of hypertonic solutions, renal-free water loss due to renal disease, diuretics, and gastrointestinal fluid losses.

Hyponatremia ([Na] < 135 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. It is a disorder of water excretion and can occur in many different conditions. Severe hyponatremia ([Na] < 125 mmol/L) can result in neurologic symptoms, coma, and death especially if the decrease in plasma sodium develops rapidly. In ICU patients hyponatremia is often mild and is most often already present at ICU admission. Hyponatremia is independently associated with mortality, which may be due to a direct causal relationship. If this association is causal, correction of hyponatremia would decrease mortality. However, we hypothesize that mild hyponatremia could also be an evolutionary adaptive mechanism in critical illness, as it is common in a wide variety of disease states. If so, the higher mortality rate in patients with mild hyponatremia would reflect the severity of the underlying illness, but increase of serum sodium, either intentional or as side effect of other treatments, would not be beneficial and could even paradoxically be harmful and decrease survival.

The objective of this study was to assess the independent association of changes in serum sodium concentration in the first 48 hours of ICU admission with mortality specifically in patients admitted with mild hyponatremia but also for severe hyponatremia, normonatremia, and hypernatremia in a large cohort of ICU patients.

### Increased mortality risk associated with serum sodium variations and borderline hypo-and hypernatremia in hospitalized adults [^1121qsPg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

[Na +] variations are associated with increased mortality

As shown in Table 2, [Na +] variations were associated with increased hospital mortality. Specifically, after adjustment of multiple potential confounders (including demographics, comorbidities, primary admission diagnoses, eGFR, number of [Na +] measurements and length of hospital stay) using a multivariate regression model (see 'Materials and Methods' section), the mortality increase remained significant (Model 2). Considering admission [Na +], as well as nadir and peak [Na +], can potentially affect the outcome (mortality) measure, we made some additional adjustments. After adjusting admission [Na +] (Model 3), hospital mortality remained significantly increased, with ORs of 1.71 (95% CI 1.21–2.42), 1.85 (1.29–2.65), 3.15 (2.19–4.52) and 5.48 (3.89–7.72) for [Na +] variations of 6–7, 8–9, 10–11 and ≥ 12 mEq/L, respectively (Figure 1). Similarly, a persistent increase in the hospital mortality with [Na +] variations ≥ 6 mEq/L was observed after adjustment of the nadir [Na +] and peak [Na +] (Models 4 and 5) (Table 2). Of note, effect modifications by age, principal admission diagnosis, eGFR and admission [Na +] were noted (Supplementary data, Table S1).

### Hypernatremia [^1119PAbP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia" for hypernatremia.

The Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia calculator estimates the amount of free water (in liters) needed to correct hypernatremia based on the patient's sodium levels, weight, and total body water (TBW) percentage

The calculator assesses the free water deficit in individuals with hypernatremia by integrating five particular inputs: gender, age group, weight, current serum sodium level, and desired serum sodium level. This metric is invaluable for determining how much free water is necessary to adjust serum sodium levels back to normal.

The calculation process unfolds through these steps:

- **Weight Conversion**: The individual's weight can be entered in either kilograms or pounds. If pounds are used, the calculator converts this to kilograms:
Weight in kg = Weight in lbs / 2.20462.

- **Total Body Water (TBW) Fraction**: This fraction represents the portion of body weight that comprises water. Its determination hinges on both the individual's gender and age group:

- The TBW fraction is 0.6 for children, adult males, and non-elderly males.
- For adult females, the TBW fraction adapts to 0.5.
- In the elderly, it decreases to 0.5 for males and further to 0.45 for females.

- **Sodium Levels**: Input for serum sodium levels is accepted in mEq/L or mmol/L, given the equivalence of these units, no conversion is needed.

- **Computation of Free Water Deficit**: This quantity is calculated with the formula:
Free Water Deficit (L) = TBW fraction × Weight (kg) × [(Current Serum Sodium / Desired Serum Sodium) - 1].

- **Outcome**: The free water deficit is calculated and then rounded to one decimal place, delivered in liters.

This calculator offers a tailored analysis essential for the customized management of hypernatremia. This consideration of individual parameters facilitates personalized fluid replacement therapy, ensuring serum sodium levels are safely normalized.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Zh6gJ]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^115wJxPT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding age, in our study, patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia were older compared with patients with normonatremia. However, age was less important in the multivariable model after accounting for CKD status. It is well known that hypernatremia mostly results from net water loss reflecting pure water or hypotonic fluid loss, while thirst provides the ultimate defense against developing hypernatremia assuming the ability to access water. Therefore, hypernatremia in adults largely occurs in older patients with infirmity, cognitive deficits, or altered mental status who depend on others for their water requirements. Thirst is also suppressed in older patients. However, hypernatremia can result from hypertonic sodium gainduring hospitalization as well and may be iatrogenic. A recent study showed that a greater volume of free water prescription was associated with progression to severe hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The prescribed amount of free water was considered inadequate in the context of ongoing use of sodium-rich solutions and lower total volumes during progression of hypernatremia. Finally, hypernatremia is frequently associated with increased extracellular fluid volume, even outside intensive care units.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^114QqoWF]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total number of 3,608,722 patients met our inclusion criteria. The final cohort included 1,728,141 patients (Figure 1). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Of the selected study population, 6% developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia. Patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia were significantly older and had lower eGFR at admission compared with patients with normonatremia (Table 1). All patient characteristics were significantly different between patients with hypernatremia and normonatremia.

Table 1
Characteristics of hospitalized patients with normonatremia and hospital-acquired hypernatremia

The risk of outcomes was significantly higher for patients with hospital-acquired hypernatremia compared with hospitalized patients who remained normonatremic. The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 12% and 1% in patients with hypernatremia and normonatremia, respectively. The relative frequency of discharge to hospice in patients with hypernatremia and normonatremia was 12% and 0.6%, respectively. The relative frequency of discharge to nursing facilities in patients with hypernatremia and normonatremia was 25% and 9%, respectively. Frequencies of outcomes by hypernatremia status and eGFR/kidney condition categories are summarized inand.

### Hospital-associated hypernatremia spectrum and clinical outcomes in an unselected cohort [^1134cmj8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although hypernatremia is associated with adverse outcomes, most studies examined selected populations.

Methods

Discharge data of 19,072 unselected hospitalized adults were analyzed. The crude relationship between serum sodium [Na +] and mortality defined hypernatremia as serum [Na +] > 142 mEq/L. Patients with community-acquired hypernatremia or hospital-acquired hypernatremia were compared with normonatremic patients (admission [Na +] 138–142 mEq/L) regarding in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and discharge disposition. Patients with community-acquired hypernatremia whose hypernatremia worsened during hospitalization were compared with those without aggravation.

Results

Community-acquired hypernatremia occurred in 21% of hospitalized patients and was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.38–2.01) for in-hospital mortality and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.32–1.56) for discharge to a short-/long-term care facility and an adjusted 10% (95% CI, 7–13) increase in length of stay. Hospital-acquired hypernatremia developed in 25.9% of hospitalized patients and was associated with an adjusted OR of 3.17 (95% CI, 2.45–4.09) for in-hospital mortality and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.32–1.59) for discharge to a facility, and an adjusted 49% (95% CI, 44–53) increase in length of stay. Hospital-aggravated hypernatremia developed in 11.7% of patients with community-acquired hypernatremia and was associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.32–2.56) and discharge to a facility (adjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.71–2.69), and an adjusted 16% (95% CI, 7–27) increase in length of stay.

Conclusions

The hypernatremia spectrum in unselected hospitalized patients is independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality and heightened resource consumption.

While hypernatremia is a rare finding in outpatients, it is much more common in hospitalized patients showing a prevalence of 2% to 3%. Hypernatremia results from a free water deficit due to renal (central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, glycosuria) or extrarenal water loss or from iatrogenic sodium overload (eg, uncontrolled saline infusion, tube feeding). In the majority of hospitalized hypernatremia patients, the electrolyte imbalance is not present at admission, but develops during hospitalization. Besides iatrogenic issues, many other factors and comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurological impairment with impaired thirst perception, or inability to drink may promote the development of hypernatremia in the acute setting. Hypernatremia is therefore also a marker of disease severity and, unsurprisingly, studies consistently report increased mortality rates in patients with hypernatremia.

The most important measure to correct hypernatremia is to increase the free water supply, such as by intravenous hypotonic infusion. Additionally, in salt-overloaded patients iatrogenic action has to be stopped and diabetes insipidus patients need timely treatment with desmopressin.

The high rate of hospital-acquired hypernatremia underpins insufficient hypernatremia awareness in hospitalized patients, with the result of inadequate treatment and worse outcome. Specifically, for hospitalized patients with diabetes insipidus, a retrospective audit showed that desmopressin treatment was delayed in 88% of patients at admission, putting them at risk of hypernatremia. This prompted the Society for Endocrinology to publish guidelines on in-hospital management of central diabetes insipidus in 2018. For patients with undiagnosed diabetes insipidus who are also at need for early desmopressin treatment, copeptin has been proposed as a readily available diagnostic marker in the acute setting.

### Poor weight gain, hypernatremia, and jaundice in a 2-month-old male [^116bBnYd]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Poor weight gain is usually due to inadequate caloric intake. It is easily excluded with monitoring weight gain on adequate calories. The differential diagnosis is broad and can be narrowed by a thorough history, physical examination, and guided laboratory testing. Abnormal laboratory results should be further investigated.DI should always be suspected and evaluated in patients presenting with appropriate formula preparation, with or without dehydration, and persistent hypernatremia associated with increased dilute urine output. Isolated or idiopathic central DI is rare; therefore, further evaluation for panhypopituitarism and CNS abnormalities are mandatory.

Both indirect and direct hyperbilirubinemia are associated with hypopituitarism, and resolve with replacement of growth hormone and hydrocortisone. Cholestatic jaundice is never benign and should be evaluated, especially to exclude biliary atresia as surgical intervention prior to 2 months improves the outcome. It is imperative that these patients be closely followed by specialists in addition to their primary care pediatricians.

### Tonicity balance, and not electrolyte-free water calculations, more accurately guides therapy for acute changes in natremia [^114ayGms]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The usual way to decide why hyponatremia or hypernatremia has developed and to plan goals for its therapy is to analyze events in electrolyte-free water (EFW) terms. We shall demonstrate that an EFW balance does not supply this information. Rather, one must calculate mass balances for water and sodium plus potassium separately (a tonicity balance) to understand the basis for the change in natremia and the proper goals for its therapy. These points are illustrated with a clinical example.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Acute severe hypernatremia complicated by osmotic demyelination syndrome in a 13-day-old infant [^1145nB1w]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Sudden osmolar variations due to dysnatremia can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome in neonates, although this complication is exceptionally rare. Clinical signs are nonspecific, and diagnosis relies on brain MRI. While effective treatments are lacking, prevention through careful fluid management remains crucial. Correction rates and rehydration strategies should be tailored to both the speed and magnitude of sodium imbalance, and strictly monitored to avoid iatrogenic complications. This case highlights the importance of vigilance when prescribing fluids in neonates and the need for specific guidelines on hypernatremia management in this vulnerable population.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^1113ixUQ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

During hospitalization, 57% of patients normalized their natremia. Their mean rate of lowering was −0.24 ± 0.2 mmol/L/h in 4.87 ± 3.28 days (from 11 hours to 14 days). Among them, 39% had normal natremia on the third day and 80% on the 7 th day. When leaving the hospital, 27% of patients had no natremia improvement and 19% had not normalized their natremia.

Hospital mortality rate was 24% (19 patients), occurring 5.8 ± 7 days after their arrival in ED, 47% patients died on the first two days (including the patient who died in ED); 68% in the first week; and 32% after 7 days of hospitalization. Last natremia before death was 155 ± 9 mmol/L, with a lowering speed of −0.1 ± 0.15 mmol/L/h. Only 11% of patients had natremia normalized before death.

Because perfusion speed was unknown in 74% of the cohort, we were not able to analyze the link between perfusion speed and natremia correction speed. Taking this limit into account, the type of solute prescribed was not associated with the correction speed during the first day (hypotonic solute −0.2 ± 0.37 mmol/L/h versus − 0.21 ± 0.44 mmol/L/h with isotonic solute, p = 0.98).

In monovariate analysis, risk factors at admission for in-hospital death were (Table 4) older age (p = 0.04), presence of neurologic symptoms (p = 0.03), lower systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), lower diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.001), lower MBP (p < 0.001), higher creatinine (p = 0.004), lower eGFR (p = 0.03), infection as the main diagnosis in the ED (p = 0.004), and having no natremia improvement (p = 0.02).

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

P246 Hypernatremia in septic patients: epidemiology and prognostic impact

M Shirazy 1, K Bousselmi 1, D Abduljabar 2

1 King Hamad University Hospital, Critical Care Department, Muharraq, Bahrain; 2 King Hamad University Hospital, Internal Medicine Department, Muharraq, Bahrain

Introduction: Sepsis and septic shock are common causes of admission in the Intensive Care Unit with a high mortality rate [1,2]. Hence, electrolyte disturbances are common in this group of patients. Acute hypernatremia is one of the multiple features of homeostasis disturbances and available data in the literature suggest that its incidence can reach 47% [3,4].

Methods: A retrospective observational study from August 2017 to November 2018 on the patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis admitted to the ICU in King Hamad University Hospital within 48 h after the onset of the disease. The database contained age, sex, diagnosis, initial APACHE II, initial and daily SOFA scores, Na levels, outcome, and ICU and hospital length of stay. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and the significance level was set at P < 0.05. Data were analyzed with SPSS.

Results: Among 159 patient, 89 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 32 of the included patients (35.9%) developed hypernatremia during the study period. Mortality rate was higher among the hypernatremic patients 22 (68.75%) compared to the eunatremic patients 11 (32.35%) (Fig 1, 2). The main source of sepsis was pneumonia with 37 affected patients (41.57%).

Conclusions: Hypernatremia is significantly associated with higher mortality in septic patients.

### Advanced age, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes are independently associated with hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic crisis [^112ANzS6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of hospital records of admissions for hyperglycaemic crisis during the two year periods of 2008 and 2009. Readmissions of the same patient were included as the levels of serum sodium at presentation may vary in different admissions. The prevalence of hypernatreamia at presentation (as a percentage of total admissions for hyperglycaemic crisis) and its associated factors were determined. Ethical approval was obtained from the Walter Sisulu University.

Definitions

Hypernatreamia was defined as uncorrected serum sodium at presentation above 145 mmol/L, hypotension as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm/Hg, hyperosmolality as calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg, hyperchloreamia as serum chloride > 104 mmol/L, elevated serum urea as serum urea > 7 mmol/L, leukocytosis as white blood count (WBC) > 10 × 10⁶/mm³ and thrombocytopenia as platelet count < 150 × 10⁶/mm³. Types of hyperglycaemic crisis as (a) non-hyperosmolar ketoacidosis: blood glucose > 13.9 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality ≤ 320 mosmols/Kg, (b) hyperosmolar ketoacidosis: blood glucose > 13.9 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg, (c) hyperosmolar non-ketotic state: blood glucose > 33.3 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate ≥ 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg, and (d) hyperglycaemia: blood glucose > 13.9 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate ≥ 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality ≤ 320 mosmols/Kg were as previously defined. Hyperglycaemia without ketoacidosis or hyperosmolality was considered to be in crisis where treatment with intravenous fluids and insulin infusion were considered necessary by the attending medical staff.

Data Source, Measurements, and Variables

Data were obtained using MDClone, a query tool that provides comprehensive patient-level data of wide-ranging variables in a defined timeframe around an index event. Extracted data included age, gender, comorbidities included in the Charlson comorbidity index, and up to 10 consecutive serum sodium measurements following the first documentation of severe hypernatremia. Serum glucose, magnesium, potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bicarbonate, albumin, calcium, and phosphorous concomitant with severe hypernatremia were also extracted. We also collected data regarding diuretic medications potentially related to dehydration, including furosemide, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Vital status was ascertained through the patient's health maintenance organization.

In order to identify potential central nervous system complications of an overly rapid correction of severe hypernatremia, we searched for diagnoses of cerebral edema (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 348.5), altered mental status (ICD-9-CM code 780), seizures (ICD-9-CM code 780.39), or epilepsy (ICD-9-CM code 345.9). The electronic health records of all patients with 1 of these diagnoses were examined by 1 of the authors (E.F.) to ascertain the associations between hypernatremia and central nervous system complications. Complications were deemed related to hypernatremia if the association was clinically plausible to the treating physicians or if no other reasonable explanation was present upon examination of the patient's medical record by the investigators.

Limitations of study

The limitations of this study include its retrospective design and determination of serum osmolality by calculation rather than laboratory measurement. We may have underestimated serum osmolality where osmotically active substances other than glucose and sodium are present in the serum as we calculated rather than measured the serum osmolality. Another limitation is that results of urine osmolality, urine specific gravity and urine electrolytes concentrations were not provided as these are not routinely done in our practice.

### Rising serum sodium levels are associated with a concurrent development of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^112FqqnL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Changes in electrolyte homeostasis are important causes of acid-base disorders. While the effects of chloride are well studied, only little is known of the potential contributions of sodium to metabolic acid-base state. Thus, we investigated the effects of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired hypernatremia on acid-base state.

Methods

We included critically ill patients who developed hypernatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration exceeding 149 mmol/L, after ICU admission in this retrospective study. Data on electrolyte and acid-base state in all included patients were gathered in order to analyze the effects of hypernatremia on metabolic acid-base state by use of the physical-chemical approach.

Results

A total of 51 patients were included in the study. The time of rising serum sodium and hypernatremia was accompanied by metabolic alkalosis. A transient increase in total base excess (standard base excess from 0.1 to 5.5 mmol/L) paralleled by a transient increase in the base excess due to sodium (base excess sodium from 0.7 to 4.1 mmol/L) could be observed. The other determinants of metabolic acid-base state remained stable. The increase in base excess was accompanied by a slight increase in overall pH (from 7.392 to 7.429, standard base excess from 0.1 to 5.5 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Hypernatremia is accompanied by metabolic alkalosis and an increase in pH. Given the high prevalence of hypernatremia, especially in critically ill patients, hypernatremic alkalosis should be part of the differential diagnosis of metabolic acid-base disorders.

### Hypernatremic hydrophobic transient adipsia without organic or severe psychiatric disorder [^116vaD8Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Psychogenic adipsic hypernatremia is an exceedingly rare and life-threatening condition, occurring in those with severe psychiatric disorders. Its diagnosis requires exclusion of congenital or acquired hypothalamic pathologic entities. We present the case of a patient who experienced transient severe hypernatremia without evidence of brain pathologic features or known psychiatric disease. In our patient, the transient adipsic hypernatremia had resulted from an episode of mild depression that resolved spontaneously.

Case Description

A 46-year-old healthy woman who had had three recurrent admissions within 1 month had presented for evaluation of intractable nausea and vomiting with a history of a recent episode of a depressive mood change. Each admission had shown substantial hypernatremia (maximum plasma sodium, 166 mEq/L) accompanied by a strong aversion to consuming water. The findings from the diagnostic evaluation showed elevated serum osmolality and lower than expected urine osmolality (urine osmolality range, 474–501 mOsm/kg). This finding, along with an MRI scan showing the presence of a normal posterior pituitary bright spot, suggested that the osmoregulation of her thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion were both defective during the attack. The patient was evaluated by psychiatry. Mild depression was diagnosed, and the patient started treatment with mirtazapine, which she only took for a few days. The patient's hypernatremia had completely recovered with resolution of her depression within 2 months.

Conclusion

A mild mood disorder can cause transient dysregulation of the thirst mechanism and AVP secretion through not yet identified mechanisms.

There were 12 patients with coded diagnoses of neurological complications: 6 patients with seizures, 5 with changes in consciousness, and 1 with cerebral edema. In all 12 cases, neurological complications were diagnosed and coded prior to initiation of correction of hypernatremia. All 12 cases were in the slow correction rate group. No neurological complications were attributed to rapid rate of correction of hypernatremia by the treating physicians or by the investigators.

### Analysis of electrolyte abnormalities in adolescents and adults and subsequent diagnosis of an eating disorder [^113g3wF7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this population-based case-control study, we found that outpatient electrolyte abnormalities may serve as a precursor to future eating disorder diagnoses. Electrolyte abnormalities commonly occurred well ahead of the time at which an eating disorder diagnosis was made. Hypokalemia was the most common electrolyte abnormality identified while hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and metabolic alkalosis were the most specific for a subsequent eating disorder diagnosis. These results suggest that incidentally discovered electrolyte abnormalities may serve to identify individuals who may benefit from targeted screening for an underlying eating disorder. Ultimately, this may allow for more timely diagnosis and intervention to mitigate the negative impact that eating disorders have on patient morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^112ofLR1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/l, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. It can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, from subtle to severe or even life threatening, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay in patients presenting with a range of conditions. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in widely different conditions and the fact that hyponatraemia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution- and speciality-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment. To obtain a common and holistic view, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA), represented by European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), have developed the Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia. In addition to a rigorous approach to methodology and evaluation, we were keen to ensure that the document focused on patient-important outcomes and included utility for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^115JmtXD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In a prospective, multicenter, observational study including 92 hospitalized patients with severe hypernatremia (> 155 mmol/L), copeptin reliably identified 5 patients with central diabetes insipidus. Copeptin values were very low in this group and a cut-off value of ≤ 4.4 pmol/L showed very high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 99% respectively). In patients with dehydration (n = 65), salt overload (n = 20), and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, (n = 2) copeptin values were high. The highest values were observed in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus patients (up to 78 pmol/L), but no discrimination between these 3 groups was possible (median [IQR] copeptin values in dehydration and salt overload groups were 55 [35–72] and 53 [34–86], respectively) (Fig. 3). Other commonly used parameters in the differential diagnosis of hypernatremia are volume status and urine osmolality. For the distinction of the hypernatremia categories dehydration vs salt overload the volume status performed well (area under curve 0.88; 95% CI 0.97–1.00). However, no further differentiation between hypovolemic patients with dehydration or diabetes insipidus was possible. Urine osmolality was a good marker to differentiate between (both central and nephrogenic) diabetes insipidus (inadequate low levels: median [IQR] 284 mosm/kg [209–306]) and dehydration or salt overload (adequate high levels: median [IQR] 546 mosm/kg [463–647], and 510 mosm/L [462–819]. The utility of urine osmolality was, however, limited by the fact that urine samples were collected only in 41% of patients. In summary, copeptin, together with urine osmolality, is a reliable measure in hypernatremia patients and identifies patients with central diabetes insipidus in need of prompt desmopressin treatment with high diagnostic accuracy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^111zAjNq]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L⁻¹ that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L⁻¹ that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^114x2nk8]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism diagnosis — initial testing and thresholds include early morning fasted pituitary profiles, prioritized screening for diabetes insipidus (DI), and cortisol cutoffs for adrenal insufficiency (AI). An early morning fasted pituitary profile should be arranged, and if DI is strongly suspected, a non-fasted morning blood sample for serum sodium and osmolality should be collected first because patients with complete DI often present with hypernatremia, avoiding the need for a protracted water deprivation test. For AI, a cortisol level < 3 µg/dL indicates AI while a cortisol level > 15 µg/dL reliably excludes AI, with dynamic testing ordinarily used for intermediate results but possibly delayed during the pandemic. Central hypothyroidism is suggested by a low free T4 with low/normal TSH, and central hypogonadism is suggested by low serum testosterone with low/normal gonadotrophins in non-obese males or low estradiol with low/normal gonadotrophins in pre-menopausal women with amenorrhea or in post-menopausal females.

### Prognostic consequences of borderline dysnatremia: pay attention to minimal serum sodium change [^114mpKda]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This large multicenter cohort study, focusing specifically on dysnatremia at ICU admission, demonstrates that this electrolyte disorder is common and is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality. This study confirms that mild hypernatremia and moderate hyponatremia (that is serum sodium concentration < 130 mmol/L or > 145 mmol/L respectively) are independently associated with poor outcome.

In this study, one-third of critically ill patients had a moderate to severe dysnatremia at ICU. Mild to severe hypernatremia and hyponatremia were present in respectively 7.8% and 27.4% of the admitted patients. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. Up to 40% of the overall population of hospitalized patients has a hyponatremia at admission. Presence of severe hyponatremia on hospital admission has been demonstrated to be independently associated with an increased risk for ICU admission and poor prognosis. Hyponatremia may be due to chronic organ dysfunctions (that is heart failure or liver dysfunction) but also to diuretic use, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, adrenal insufficiency, and cerebral or renal salt wasting syndromes. Each of these conditions is frequently encountered in critically ill patients and may explain the high prevalence of hyponatremia at ICU admission. Similarly, although less frequent than hyponatremia, several studies demonstrated hypernatremia to be common at ICU admission. Since thirst and free access to water are the most important mechanisms that prevent hypernatremia, critically ill patients and older patients are at high risk for this disorder. Only 2.5% patients have been found to develop moderate to severe hypernatremia in the general in-hospital population of patients. Higher prevalence has been reported in geriatric or critically ill patients.

### Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^1162BMrk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Dysnatremia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with bacterial pneumonia. There is paucity of data about the incidence and prognostic impact of abnormal sodium concentration in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Objective

This work aimed to examine the association of serum sodium during hospitalization with key clinical outcomes, including mortality, need for advanced respiratory support and acute kidney injury (AKI), and to explore the role of serum sodium as a marker of inflammatory response in COVID-19.

Methods

This retrospective longitudinal cohort study, including all adult patients who presented with COVID-19 to 2 hospitals in London over an 8-week period, evaluated the association of dysnatremia (serum sodium < 135 or > 145 mmol/L, hyponatremia, and hypernatremia, respectively) at several time points with inpatient mortality, need for advanced ventilatory support, and AKI.

Results

The study included 488 patients (median age, 68 years). At presentation, 24.6% of patients were hyponatremic, mainly due to hypovolemia, and 5.3% hypernatremic. Hypernatremia 2 days after admission and exposure to hypernatremia at any time point during hospitalization were associated with a 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.08–5.05; p = 0.0014) and 3.05-fold (95% CI, 1.69–5.49; P < .0001) increased risk of death, respectively, compared to normonatremia. Hyponatremia at admission was linked with a 2.18-fold increase in the likelihood of needing ventilatory support (95% CI, 1.34–3.45, P = 0.0011). Hyponatremia was not a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, except for the subgroup of patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia. Sodium values were not associated with the risk for AKI and length of hospital stay.

Conclusion

Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalization are risk factors for poor prognosis, with hypernatremia and hyponatremia being associated with a greater risk of death and respiratory failure, respectively. Serum sodium values could be used for risk stratification in patients with COVID-19.

OVERDOSAGE:

Excessive administration of 3% Sodium Chloride Injection may lead to hypernatremia (which can lead to CNS manifestations, including seizures, coma, cerebral edema and death) and sodium overload (which can lead to central and/or peripheral edema).

When assessing an overdose, any additives in the solution must also be considered. The effects of an overdose may require immediate medical attention and treatment.

Hypopituitarism during COVID-19 — clinicians should remain vigilant given increased background mortality and management trade-offs. Patients with hypopituitarism have increased mortality, particularly from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. There is a careful balance between preventing adrenal insufficiency and avoiding prolonged glucocorticoid over-replacement with consequent immunosuppression. Diabetes insipidus poses fluid-balance challenges during significant illness, and hypernatremia is linked to increased mortality in intensive care admissions.

### Episodic ventriculomegaly due to hypernatremia mimicking shunt malfunction: case report [^111vnbq2]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with shunted hydrocephalus presenting with altered mental status and ventriculomegaly are generally considered to be in shunt failure requiring surgical treatment. The authors describe a case of shunted hydrocephalus secondary to a disseminated neuroectodermal tumor in a pediatric patient in whom rapid fluctuations in sodium levels due to diabetes insipidus repeatedly led to significant changes in ventricle size, with invasively confirmed normal shunt function and low intracranial pressure. This clinical picture exactly mimics shunt malfunction, requires urgent nonsurgical therapy, and underscores the importance of considering serum osmolar abnormalities in the differential diagnosis for ventriculomegaly.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^1159N61g]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2018, using the Cerner Health Facts database. The Institutional Review Board of the University of New Mexico approved this study protocol (Institutional Review Board: 19–429).

We defined the index hospital admission as the first inpatient encounter during the study period for patients who met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age 18 years or older, (2) patients who had their first serum Na levels during admission or up to 24 hours after admission and was within normal range (135–145 mEq/L), and (3) patients who had at least one serum Na measurement > 145 mEq/L (defined as hypernatremia) after hospital admission for patients who met the second inclusion criterion. The second inclusion criterion reduces the likelihood that serum Na can be affected by chronic conditions before hospital admission. For patients with more than one hospitalization during the study period, we selected the first hospitalization that met our inclusion criteria. Patients who developed hyponatremia during their hospitalization were excluded from this analysis.

The primary outcomes were determined as in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition of hospitalized patients (hospice, nursing facility, and home), and length of stay. We excluded patients with missing eGFR and serum Na values or discharge dispositions other than home, hospice, or nursing facilities. Furthermore, we excluded patients on long-term dialysis (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart of the sample selection process and exclusion criteria. Boxes on the right side represent the exclusion criteria applied to this study.

We discretized serum Na levels into four categories: (1) normonatremia: 135–145 mEq/L (reference category); (2) mild hypernatremia: 145 < Na ≤ 150 mEq/L; (3) moderate hypernatremia: 150 < Na ≤ 155 mEq/L; and (4) severe hypernatremia: Na > 155 mEq/L. The first in-hospital measured serum Na above 145 mEq/L defined the severity of hypernatremia for each patient included in the analyses. We corrected the first inpatient serum Na levels > 145 mEq/L by adding 1.6 mEq/L for each 100 mg/dl above 100 mg/dl of the concomitantly measured serum glucose levels. –

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^115k5zGq]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) in children — hypernatremia risk with isotonic solutions was evaluated as a concern defined as serum sodium > 145 mEq/L. A systematic review found no evidence of an increased risk of hypernatremia associated with isotonic fluids, although the quality of evidence was judged to be low; the report clarifies that there was not evidence of no risk and the risk is unclear from the meta-analysis results. The estimated risk ratio was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.65–2.38), drawn from 9 studies with 937 patients, with 3 studies having no events and not contributing to the estimate, and researchers in 2 large studies published since the meta-analysis did not find evidence of an increased risk of hypernatremia with isotonic IVFs.

Wilderness Medical Society heat illness treatment algorithm — For a person with "Signs or symptoms of heat illness?", assess for "Signs or symptoms of central nervous system alterations?". If present, check "Confirmed or suspected temperature ≥ 40°C (104°F)?"; if yes, "Treat for heat stroke" by "Address airway, breathing and circulation", "Initiate rapid cooling (immersion / conductive cooling is most effective)", "Initiate intravenous fluids (if possible)", and "Arrange for transport to emergency care". If central nervous system alterations are present but the temperature criterion is not met, "Consider alternatives" including "Hypoglycemia", "Seizure", "Severe exercise-associated hyponatremia", "Hypernatremia", "Central nervous system disease", "High altitude cerebral edema", "Infection", "Endocrine issue", and "Toxic ingestion / drugs". If central nervous system alterations are absent, manage as "Mild heat illness: Heat exhaustion, heat syncope, or heat cramps" and "Treat for mild heat illness" by "Orally hydrate", "Cool with convection, conduction, or evaporation", "Consider giving salty food or oral electrolyte fluids in addition to water", and "Observe for symptom resolution". After initial care for mild heat illness, if "Symptoms persist or have worsened?" take the "Yes" branch to "Consider more aggressive cooling", "Consider an alternative diagnosis", and "Arrange transport for evacuation"; if "No", provide "Relative rest", "Remain in cool place", "Education on symptoms and signs of heat illness", and "Consider not returning to activity".

### Hypernatremic dehydration of infancy… [^1137Padb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hypernatremic dehydration is dehydration associated with an elevated serum sodium concentration that is generally defined as a level of 150 mEq/L or higher. Hypernatremia is seen in a variety of clinical states in infancy, but this article is concerned with its occurrence in the clinical setting of diarrheal dehydration in otherwise healthy infants. Such a focus is a practical one, as this is the setting for well over 90% of the cases of HD in infants younger than 2 years of age. Diabetes insipidus, renal disease, mental deficiency, and a number of other conditions may predispose to HD, but although they may help elucidate pathophysiologic findings, they are relatively unimportant contributors to the overall incidence of the disorder. CLINICAL FEATURES The clinical importance of HD stems from its noticeable distinction from nonhypernatremic dehydration as a clinical problem. Almost all clinical reports comment on its relatively high mortality: 785–792.

### Hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the elderly… [^115dLVLg]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

13 SIADH is characterized by the continued release of ADH in the face of dilution of body fluids and increased extracellular volume. The urine is "inappropriately" concentrated when the body is trying to correct a state of hypotonicity. SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion. The diagnostic criteria for SIADH are listed in. Figure 1 shows an algorithm for the evaluation of patients with hyponatremia. 13, 16 The first step is to determine the plasma and urine osmolality and to perform a clinical assessment of volume status. If the urine osmolality is less than 100 mOsm per kg, evaluation for psychogenic polydipsia should be conducted. If the urine osmolality is 100 mOsm per kg or greater, renal function should be evaluated. Evidence of renal failure points to primary renal disease as the likely cause of hyponatremia.

If BUN and creatinine levels are normal, assessment of the extracellular fluid volume should be conducted. The urine sodium determination should be used as a guide in noneuvolemic states to determine whether further evaluation for renal failure or pathophysiologic renal sodium loss is required. It should be kept in mind, however, that diuretics can alter the urine sodium concentration and confuse the clinical picture. The first step in the clinical assessment of the patient with hypernatremia is a detailed analysis of the clinical circumstance. This includes a careful review of the patient's weight, intake and output, and a critical analysis of fluid nutrition and nursing care. The urgency of the clinical state should be evaluated by carefully assessing the volume status and by performing a neurologic examination. Such an analysis provides the answer in most hospitalized patients who acquire hypernatremia during their hospital stay.

Measurements of spot urine/plasma osmolality and urine sodium levels may yield valuable clues in more difficult cases. Finally, a urine osmolality that is quite low is diagnostic of diabetes insipidus in the setting of hypernatremia and polyuria. Sophisticated and more dangerous dehydration testing is rarely necessary in the evaluation of hypernatremia and is reserved for more difficult cases of diabetes insipidus.
