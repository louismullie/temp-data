## Question

Should you give fluids to someone that hasn't been to dialysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fluids should be given to someone who has missed dialysis and how to manage fluids in that situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the immediate risks of missing dialysis. Then, I should verify the patient's current volume status and hemodynamics. Next, I will weigh the risks of fluid overload versus the risks of intradialytic hypotension. After that, I should consider special situations like pulmonary edema or sepsis. Finally, I will outline a practical, guideline-aligned plan for fluids, monitoring, and when to initiate urgent dialysis, with contingencies for patients who decline dialysis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks of missing dialysis. Missing scheduled hemodialysis can precipitate life-threatening fluid overload with pulmonary edema, severe hypertension, and respiratory failure, and it can worsen uremia and electrolyte/acid-base derangements; these are classic indications for emergent dialysis when present, so I need to check for these immediately [^112ZkkL9] [^114RvxAV].

> Wait, let me verify the patient's volume status before thinking about fluids. I should assess for orthopnea, crackles, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and blood pressure; I also need to check for signs of intravascular depletion such as hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities, or flat IVC on ultrasound, because missing dialysis does not automatically mean the patient is intravascularly overloaded and some may be euvolemic or even relatively hypovolemic depending on interdialytic weight gain and comorbidities [^114RvxAV] [^1154rYQx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about giving fluids. The default risk after a missed dialysis session is fluid overload, and giving IV crystalloids can worsen pulmonary edema, hypertension, and delay renal recovery; fluid accumulation is independently associated with mortality and worse outcomes in kidney failure populations, so I should avoid routine fluids unless there is a compelling hemodynamic indication [^11198V47] [^114wv1mb] [^114sfsAy].

> I need to ensure I am balancing competing risks. On one hand, fluid overload from missed dialysis can cause respiratory failure and cardiovascular stress. On the other, overly aggressive ultrafiltration can provoke intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, and loss of residual kidney function, so the safest course is to correct hypovolemia cautiously if present and otherwise prioritize timely dialysis to safely remove excess fluid rather than adding more fluid [^113fbroc] [^115n48Cz].

> Let me consider special situations. If the patient is in pulmonary edema or has severe hypertension, fluids are contraindicated and urgent dialysis should be arranged. Conversely, if the patient is in septic shock with clear intravascular depletion, a small, carefully titrated bolus of balanced crystalloid may be appropriate while preparing for dialysis, but I should reassess frequently and avoid exceeding the minimum effective dose to prevent worsening overload [^112ZkkL9] [^115Y3xdJ] [^116gmNEP].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise approach. First, obtain immediate vitals, exam, ECG, chest X-ray if dyspneic, and basic labs including electrolytes and acid-base status. Second, if there are life-threatening fluid, electrolyte, or acid-base derangements, initiate emergent dialysis rather than fluids. Third, if the patient is hemodynamically stable and not clearly intravascularly depleted, do not give fluids. Fourth, if there is true intravascular depletion, consider a small bolus of balanced crystalloid with close monitoring and transition promptly to dialysis for safe fluid removal. Fifth, if the patient declines dialysis, pivot to conservative management with strict salt and fluid restriction and symptom-directed care rather than attempting volume expansion that cannot be safely removed [^112ZkkL9] [^113fbroc] [^117LKxw6].

> I should double-check fluid choice and dosing if fluids are absolutely necessary. Balanced crystalloids are preferred over saline in patients with or at risk of AKI given the chloride load and potential renal effects; if a bolus is used, typical small aliquots of 250–500 mL can be given with reassessment of blood pressure, heart rate, JVP, lung sounds, and oxygenation, and fluids should be stopped as soon as hemodynamic targets are met or if signs of overload emerge [^116gmNEP] [^115Y3xdJ].

> But wait, what if the patient is borderline and I am unsure about responsiveness. I can use dynamic assessment such as passive leg raise or ultrasound of the IVC to help judge whether additional intravascular volume will improve perfusion, while remembering that static measures like CVP are unreliable; this helps avoid both unnecessary fluids and missed hypovolemia in the right context [^117DfbaX] [^1154rYQx].

> I will now examine the role of permissive hypervolemia. In some dialysis-dependent patients with repeated intradialytic hypotension, a modestly higher target weight may be acceptable to preserve perfusion, but this must be individualized and weighed against the long-term harms of chronic fluid overload. I should document this as a shared decision and reassess frequently [^113fbroc] [^112TMH4G].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For most patients who have missed dialysis, the balance of risk favors avoiding IV fluids and arranging urgent dialysis to safely correct volume and metabolic derangements. Fluids should be reserved for clear, documented intravascular depletion with a plan to transition quickly to dialysis, and in patients who decline dialysis, conservative measures should guide care rather than volume expansion that cannot be removed [^112ZkkL9] [^113fbroc] [^117LKxw6].

In general, **avoid routine IV fluids** in patients who have missed dialysis unless there is clear hypovolemia or shock [^115Y3xdJ]. Missed dialysis often causes fluid overload, and giving fluids can worsen pulmonary edema, hypertension, and heart failure [^114RvxAV]. If fluids are needed for hypovolemia or shock, use the smallest effective dose of a **balanced crystalloid** (e.g. lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte) [^116gmNEP] and reassess frequently to prevent overload [^1147Cvx6]. Prioritize urgent dialysis to safely remove excess fluid and correct electrolyte/acid-base disturbances [^112ZkkL9].

---

## Risks of fluid administration in missed dialysis patients

Patients who miss dialysis are at **high risk of fluid overload** due to impaired excretion; additional IV fluids can exacerbate:

- **Pulmonary edema**: Rapidly life-threatening in missed dialysis.
- **Hypertension**: Worsens cardiovascular strain and complications [^114RvxAV].
- **Heart failure**: Increases risk of decompensation and arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Potassium and acid-base shifts can cause arrhythmias and neuromuscular complications [^notfound].

---

## Indications for fluid administration

IV fluids are **only indicated** in missed dialysis patients when there is clear evidence of hypovolemia or shock — such as:

- **Hypotension**: Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg with signs of hypoperfusion.
- **Shock**: Septic, hemorrhagic, or cardiogenic shock requiring volume resuscitation.
- **Severe dehydration**: Documented volume depletion from vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive diuresis.

In these cases, fluids should be **carefully titrated** with close monitoring to avoid overload [^117973fd].

---

## Recommended fluid types and volumes

If fluids are indicated, **use balanced crystalloids** (lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte) to reduce the risk of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis associated with saline [^116k5eHM]. Avoid potassium-containing solutions in hyperkalemic patients. Limit total volume to the **smallest effective dose**, typically 250–500 mL boluses, with frequent reassessment of hemodynamics and respiratory status [^115Y3xdJ].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring is **essential** when administering fluids to missed dialysis patients:

- **Vital signs**: Monitor BP, HR, RR, and oxygen saturation continuously.
- **Respiratory status**: Assess for signs of pulmonary edema (crackles, dyspnea, hypoxemia).
- **Electrolytes**: Check potassium, calcium, and acid-base status frequently.
- **Fluid balance**: Track strict intake/output and daily weights if feasible.

Stop fluids immediately if signs of **fluid overload** or **electrolyte disturbances** develop [^115Y3xdJ].

---

## Alternative strategies for fluid management

The primary goal in missed dialysis patients is to **restore fluid balance and correct electrolyte/acid-base disturbances**. Alternative strategies include:

- **Urgent dialysis**: The preferred method to safely remove excess fluid and correct electrolyte/acid-base disturbances [^112ZkkL9].
- **Diuretics**: Limited utility in anuric/oliguric patients but may be considered if residual renal function exists.
- **Ultrafiltration**: Mechanical fluid removal may be considered in severe fluid overload refractory to other interventions [^1179EB41].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Fluid administration in missed dialysis patients is associated with **significant complications**:

- **Pulmonary edema**: Increased risk of respiratory failure and ICU admission.
- **Hypertension**: Higher risk of cardiovascular events and stroke.
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Potassium and acid-base shifts causing arrhythmias and neuromuscular complications.
- **Increased mortality**: Fluid overload independently associated with higher mortality in dialysis patients [^114RvxAV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized fluid management** in missed dialysis patients:

- **Avoid routine fluid administration**: Unless clear hypovolemia or shock is present [^115Y3xdJ].
- **Use balanced crystalloids**: Prefer lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte over saline when fluids are indicated [^116gmNEP].
- **Monitor closely**: Continuous reassessment of hemodynamics, respiratory status, and electrolytes [^117973fd].
- **Prioritize dialysis**: Urgent dialysis is the preferred intervention for fluid overload and electrolyte disturbances [^112ZkkL9].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Fluid administration** | **Alternative interventions** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluid overload without hypovolemia | Avoid fluids | Urgent dialysis; ultrafiltration |
| Hypovolemia or shock | Small boluses of balanced crystalloids (250–500 mL) with close monitoring | Urgent dialysis after stabilization |
| Hyperkalemia or severe acidosis | Avoid fluids | Urgent dialysis |
| Mild dehydration with residual renal function | Small oral intake if tolerated | Monitor closely; consider dialysis if worsens |

---

In patients who have missed dialysis, **avoid routine IV fluids** unless there is clear hypovolemia or shock. Use balanced crystalloids in small, carefully titrated doses with close monitoring, and prioritize urgent dialysis to safely manage fluid overload and electrolyte disturbances.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Patients at increased risk for AKI and particularly those with manifest AKI require careful monitoring of their haemodynamic status, in order to balance the risk of renal hypoperfusion on the one hand and fluid overload on the other. Cardiac output and blood pressure should be kept within optimal limits to ensure the best possible kidney perfusion. However, as recently reported, hazardous fluid overload must be avoided, particularly in anuric patients with AKI. Available therapies to manage hypotension should integrate fluid and vasopressor therapy in protocols with appropriate haemodynamic goals. When volume resuscitation is deemed necessary, there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation that there is no additional advantage of (more expensive) colloid over crystalloid solutions; therefore ERBP upgraded the strength of this recommendation. However, ERBP wants to stress that this rule does not apply in patients in whom a decrease in the circulating volume is present, e.g. in haemorrhagic shock. In these conditions, the use of colloids can be warranted; iso-osmolar solutions, with low molecular branching coefficients should be preferred. ERBP also wants to point out that the use of large quantities of isotonic saline can potentially lead to metabolic acidosis.

As renal perfusion pressure is more important than renal blood flow per se, and as the action of vasopressors is immediate and directly reversible, ERBP recommends using vasopressor therapy rather than extra fluid in volume-resuscitated patients. Here, norepinephrine has advantages over dopamine, because of fewer side-effects and lower costs, but vasopressin may be used as an alternative. Several meta-analyses have pointed out that dopamine failed to improve outcomes in patients with AKI. Finally, protocol-based goal-directed therapy is advocated in the early hours of sepsis. Such goal-directed therapy includes avoiding hypotension, optimizing oxygen delivery and careful fluid and vasopressor management when indicated. Some clinical studies have highlighted the need to keep mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg in critically ill patients, but the speed of intervention seems to be very important as well.

### The impact of continuous renal replacement therapy on drug therapy [^112NsDPx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients with multisystem organ failure often require daily administration of large volumes of fluid to provide electrolyte and nutrition support, medications, and blood products. This often results in fluid overload, which has historically been managed with intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Unfortunately, IHD entails a high rate of fluid and solute removal that often exacerbates hemodynamic instability. Accordingly, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), involving slow and continuous removal of water and solutes from the plasma, is currently preferred for managing these patients.

### Fluid and electrolyte management: putting a plan in motion [^112nfvwS]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid and electrolyte management is challenging for clinicians, as electrolytes shift in a variety of settings and disease states and are dependent on osmotic changes and fluid balance. The development of a plan for managing fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should start with correcting the underlying condition. In most cases, this is followed by an assessment of fluid balance with the goal of achieving euvolemia. After fluid status is understood and/or corrected, electrolyte imbalances are simplified. Many equations are available to aid clinicians in providing safe recommendations or at least to give a starting point for correcting the abnormalities. However, these equations do not take into consideration the vast differences between clinical scenarios, thus making electrolyte management more challenging. The supplementation plan, whether delivered intravenously or orally, must include an assessment of renal and gastrointestinal function, as most guidelines are established under the assumption of normal digestion, absorption and excretion. After the plan is developed, frequent monitoring is vital to regain homeostasis. A fluid and electrolyte management plan developed by a multidisciplinary team is advantageous in promoting continuity of care and producing safe outcomes.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^1123x61C]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a principal intervention in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), following admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Approximately 4% of critically ill patients with AKI require renal replacement therapy and up to 80% of AKI patients undergo CRRT as the treatment modality. Because critical illness at admission to ICU and a great burden of comorbidities contribute to being unable to tolerate the hemodynamic shifts of conventional hemodialysis, CRRT is frequently used also in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients admitted to ICU.

Fluid overload is associated with worsening renal dysfunction, an increased length of ICU stay, and elevated mortality risk. Several studies have demonstrated that an increased cumulative fluid balance is significantly associated with greater mortality risk in critically ill patients with AKI. Therefore, negative fluid balance has been considered a basic approach to improve survival rates in critically ill patients with AKI.

Patients with preexisting ESKD are vulnerable to fluid overload and common causes of death are cardiovascular disease and sepsis, which would require a large volume of intravenous fluid for initial resuscitation management. Consequently, ESKD patients with critical illness would become volume-overloaded, contradicting to current knowledge regarding fluid management in patients with AKI. Therefore, we investigated the association between fluid balance and mortality in patients with ESKD undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring CRRT.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^112TMH4G]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D volume management and ultrafiltration — volume and BP assessments need to be conducted at every hemodialysis treatment to set fluid removal goals, and volume management may require a degree of permissive hypervolemia to minimize hypovolemia-induced hypotension; in patients with AKI-D, a more conservative ultrafiltration approach has been associated with lower intradialytic hypotension and we suggest that prescribed ultrafiltration should be < 10 ml/kg per hour. In nonoliguric patients, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs, and we suggest a trial of furosemide 160 mg twice a day (or equivalent dose of torsemide or bumetanide) in all patients with AKI except those with already significant urine output and minimal interdialytic weight gain (< 1 kg); in patients who remain oligoanuric, diuretics can be held until there is a reported or documented increase in urine output. Cool dialysate reduces intradialytic hypotension in ESRD and has been found beneficial in the AKI-D setting and is therefore a reasonable tool for patients at higher risk of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Fluid challenge revisited [^112mYD2U]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the rationale, technique, and clinical application of the fluid challenge.

Data Source

Relevant literature from MEDLINE and authors' personal databases.

Study Selection

Studies on fluid challenge in the acutely ill.

Data Extraction

Based largely on clinical experience and assessment of the relevant published literature, we propose that the protocol should include four variables, namely 1) the type of fluid administered, 2) the rate of fluid administration, 3) the critical end points, and 4) the safety limits.

Conclusions

A protocol for routine fluid challenge is proposed with defined rules and based on the patient's response to the volumes infused. The technique allows for prompt correction of fluid deficits yet minimizes the risks of fluid overload.

Learning Objectives

On completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Explain the signs of hypovolemia. 2. Describe how to administer a fluid challenge. 3. Use this information in a clinical setting.

Pharmacological prevention strategies of CIN

3.4.1 We recommend volume expansion with either isotonic sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate solutions, rather than no volume expansion, in patients at increased risk for CIN. (1A)
3.4.2 We suggest using the oral route for hydration, on the premise that adequate intake of fluid and salt are assured. (2C)

We suggest that, when oral intake of fluid and salt is deemed cumbersome in patients at increased risk of CIN, hydration should be performed by intravenous route. (2C)
3.4.3 We suggest using oral N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) only in patients who receive appropriate fluid and salt loading (2D). We recommend not using oral NAC as the only method for prevention of CIN. (1D)
3.4.4 We do not suggest using theophylline to prevent CIN. (2C)
3.4.5 We do not recommend using fenoldopam to prevent CIN. (1B)

Rationale

There is no doubt that before contrast media administration, adequate salt and fluid should be provided to prevent CIN

The ERBP work group amended the statement on oral fluid loading by the KDIGO work group, as this was based on two small and relatively old studies, in which oral fluid intake did not confer the same degree of protection against CIN than i.v. fluid administration. However, a recent observational study showed a significant inverse correlation between the amount of oral fluid intake and the percentage changes in SCr as well as the absolute changes in eGFR in patients undergoing a coronary computed tomography angiography, and a prospective randomized trial comparing i.v. fluids with oral hydration with or without sodium bicarbonate found no differences in the incidence of CIN in patients with mild CKD. It should be noted that the main difference between oral and i.v. fluid administration concerns not only the volume but the sodium content of the fluids as well. In ambulatory patients, the i.v. route leads to a substantial increase in costs, and a risk for destruction of future vascular access. The ERBP work group accordingly does not recommend hospitalizing low-risk patients just for hydration. Most of the ambulatory patients have a relatively low risk for CIN, and in these patients, oral hydration should be recommended. When i.v. access is in place anyway, e.g. in hospitalized patients, the i.v. route can be used.

### Daily haemodialysis for acute renal failure [^115CsfbZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Current guidelines on dialysis adequacy for patients with acute renal failure are based upon extrapolation from end-stage renal disease. As a result, intermittent haemodialysis - the most commonly used modality of renal replacement therapy - is typically prescribed for 3 or 4 h three or more times per week. Recent data suggest that alternate day dialysis provides inadequate dialysis dosing in the majority of critically ill patients.

Recent Findings

Measurements of urea kinetic modelling show that the delivered dose of dialysis is 20–30% lower than the prescribed dose and even less than adequate for a stable end-stage renal disease patient receiving haemodialysis three times per week. A recently published prospective comparison of two dialysis intensities (alternate day versus daily) demonstrated an association between increased treatment dose and improved outcome in critically ill patients. The beneficial effects of daily dialysis could be explained by lower uraemic toxicity, less fluid overload and a shorter duration of severe acute renal failure.

Summary

The limited data on the effects of dialysis dose on acute renal failure suggest that the relationship between acute renal failure comorbid conditions and death in critically ill patients is more complicated than generally recognized. There is no doubt that alternate day dialysis provides a suboptimal dose of dialysis with negative impact on the outcome. Significant differences render the use of most urea kinetic modelling equations problematic. Despite the current lack of further information we would recommend that haemodialysis should be dosed daily in many cases of hypercatabolic or anuric acute renal failure.

### Dual-faced guardians: SGLT2 inhibitors' kidney protection and health challenges: a position statement by kasralainy nephrology group (KANG) [^1149JnXs]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors and dialysis

Many health organizations recommend discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with severe renal impairment; however, clinical trials have been conducted in patients receiving dialysis. The recommendation is to consider SGLT2is in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hospitalized heart failure patients if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is greater than 20 ml/min/1.73 m². There are no contraindications for low-dose use: the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin should not exceed 10 mg/day, and canagliflozin should not exceed 25 mg/day. Recent guidelines do not advocate initiating SGLT2is in patients receiving dialysis with heart failure and recommend discontinuation if the patient is off dialysis.

A recent trial involving 125 patients with eGFRs below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and stage 5 dialysis (G5D) demonstrated the effectiveness of dapagliflozin and the non-adenosine nature of the treatment. The data provide solid evidence supporting the use of SGLT2is in patients on dialysis. Three phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating SGLT2is, aimed at understanding their impact on kidney survival, cardiovascular events, and mortality, were reviewed to assess benefits for patient management. The nephrology society has modified recommendations for patients with a GFR below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² regarding high doses of the tested SGLT2is. Multidisciplinary stewardship should be applied when using SGLT2is in G5D patients due to patient preferences, the presence of hyperkalemia, fluid restrictions, and comorbidities. Experts advise administering SGLT2is at least 2 h post-dialysis and adjusting doses based on weekly drug clearance.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^1138J2W7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis residual kidney function — hemodynamic management and diuretics: Episodes of intravascular volume depletion that frequently result in hypotension should be minimized and measures to maintain hemodynamic stability should be routine, with strategies to minimize hypotension during HD including avoidance of excessive ultrafiltration, maintaining the target hematocrit, reduction in dialysate temperature, increasing dialysate sodium concentration, and possibly administration of an α agonist, such as midodrine; avoidance of hypotension also helps ensure delivery of adequate dialysis and minimize symptoms during HD, and paradoxically, loop diuretics probably benefit HD patients because they reduce the requirement for fluid removal during dialysis.

### Dialysis 101. acute and chronic fluid shifts [^114SS44G]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

For over 30 years, dialysis has been accepted as a proven therapeutic intervention in sustaining life for patients with end-stage renal disease. As a renal replacement therapy, dialysis only approximates renal function. Derangements in fluids, electrolytes, and acid-base homeostasis occur in the course of progressive renal insufficiency. Nephrons are able to adapt to physiologic needs and maintain a balance for many solutes, until the very late stages of chronic renal failure. This permits survival of the patient with minimal therapeutic intervention. The availability of highly permeable membranes has allowed development of continuous renal replacement therapies that gradually remove fluids and solutes resulting in better hemodynamic stability.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^113fbroc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The two main treatment parameters by which clinicians aim to optimise fluid control, are target weight and ultrafiltration rate.

Since the earliest days of dialysis, setting ultrafiltration to achieve a set target weight post dialysis, at which the patient is at their correct volume (or "dry") has been the accepted method of maintaining a consistent volume state, but the method is dependent on accurate estimation of the correct target weight. Though most often assessed by clinical examination, the inaccuracy of this method is widely appreciated so that both overestimation and underestimation are common, with the former contributing to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, and the latter accelerating the loss of residual kidney function and perhaps risking myocardial stunning.

To improve on clinical assessment, nephrologists at one time advocated "probing" target weight: gradual reduction until patients report symptoms suggesting hypovolaemia, but this may reduce treatment compliance and a more collaborative approach is more common: where possible, patients should be asked to participate in monitoring their fluid status. To this end terminology should be simple and intuitively understood: for example, when discussing target weight, the term "dry weight" can give the impression that the aim is to remove as much fluid as possible, and "ideal weight" can be confusing as it is also used to describe the preferred body mass index. Although less accurate, "hydration" is a more familiar term than "volume" as a description of fluid status. Stable patients should be assessed for target weight changes perhaps quarterly, but staff and patients should be particularly vigilant when changes in flesh weight are likely, such as following hospital admission, or when starting nutritional supplementation. Fluid management often requires input from a multidisciplinary team, so a documented policy may ensure that the approach is consistent.

### Fluid balance and renal replacement therapy initiation strategy: a secondary analysis of the STARRT-AKI trial [^114vLJGr]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a secondary analysis of a large multinational trial comparing accelerated versus standard RRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI, we found that an accelerated strategy mediated a cumulative fluid balance that was lower by about 1 L during the 14 days that followed randomization. However, earlier RRT initiation did not confer improved survival among individuals with greater degrees of baseline fluid accumulation.

Fluid overload is a pervasive complication of AKI and has been associated with adverse outcomes. Extracorporeal ultrafiltration, provided in the context of RRT, can provide a reliable means of decongestion and achievement of net negative fluid balance. In patients with severe AKI but without otherwise pressing indications to commence RRT, mitigation of the adverse effects of positive fluid accumulation or maintenance of a relatively neutral fluid balance could conceivably justify earlier RRT initiation in the absence of other indications. In this regard, accelerated RRT initiation mediated a modestly lower net positive fluid balance compared to the standard strategy. This finding differs from the Initiation of Dialysis Early Versus Delayed in the Intensive Care Unit trial in which patients with Stage 3 AKI and septic shock were randomized to immediate RRT initiation versus a 48-h delay. Despite a median delay to RRT initiation of 44 h in the delayed arm of the trial as compared to the early arm, fluid balance one week after randomization was no different between the early and delayed arms. We also found that earlier RRT initiation did not translate into a reduction in all-cause mortality or a meaningful improvement in other clinical outcomes across baseline fluid balance strata. Ventilator-free days, an outcome that could conceivably be impacted by more aggressive decongestion, was also not improved by accelerated RRT initiation even among patients with the greatest fluid balance at baseline.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^1161eqHR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Prevention and treatment of AKI — KDOQI aligns with key KDIGO recommendations and fluid choices: the section includes 7 level 1 recommendations and 22 level 2 recommendations, and our KDOQI Work Group agreed with the 7 level 1 recommendations; the Work Group agreed with using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for volume expansion in patients at risk of AKI or with AKI and noted harm with starch-containing colloids, therefore these solutions should be avoided; albumin resuscitation has been associated with harm in traumatic brain injury and should be avoided in that setting; in liver disease, intravenous albumin appears to be beneficial for prevention of renal failure and death in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and for prevention of renal failure in large-volume paracentesis; diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome include lack of improvement after volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg/d up to 100 g/d) for at least 2 days and withdrawal of diuretic therapy; avoidance of nephrotoxins is not always possible given pathogen resistance examples.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^114bsQoe]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Fluid overload, AKI and poor outcomes are clearly associated. However, whether AKI has caused fluid overload or vice versa can be difficult to determine. Better tools are necessary to measure intravascular volume status. Until then, fluid therapy needs to be personalised with physiological end-points, guided by dynamic tests like PLR manoeuvre, and monitored by using cumulative fluid balance coupled, where possible, with daily weights to avoid the adverse outcomes associated with fluid overload.

### Fluid resuscitation and progression to renal replacement therapy in patients with COVID-19 [^115pbKxN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with respiratory symptoms and renal effects. Data regarding fluid resuscitation and kidney injury in COVID-19 are lacking, and understanding this relationship is critical.

Objectives

To determine if there is an association between fluid volume administered in 24 h and development of renal failure in COVID-19 patients.

Methods

Retrospective chart review; 14 hospitals in Indiana. Included patients were adults admitted between March 11, 2020 and April 13, 2020 with a positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 within 3 days of admission. Patients requiring renal replacement therapy prior to admission were excluded. Volumes and types of resuscitative intravenous fluids in the first 24 h were obtained with demographics, medical history, and other objective data. The primary outcome was initiation of renal replacement therapy. Logistic regression modeling was utilized in creating multivariate models for determining factors associated with the primary outcome.

Results

The fluid volume received in the first 24 h after hospital admission was associated with initiation of renal replacement therapy in two different multivariate logistic regression models. An odds ratio of 1.42 (95% confidence interval 1.01–1.99) was observed when adjusting for age, heart failure, obesity, creatinine, bicarbonate, and total fluid volume. An odds ratio of 1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.02–2.05) was observed when variables significant in univariate analysis were adjusted for.

Conclusions

Each liter of intravenous fluid administered to patients with COVID-19 in the first 24 h of presentation was independently associated with an increased risk for initiation of renal replacement therapy, supporting judicious fluid administration in patients with this disease.

### Fluid balance management during continuous renal replacement therapy [^114Sp73J]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

In critically ill patients, particularly in the setting of shock and sepsis volume management frequently results in a fluid overloaded state, requiring diuresis or intervention with renal replacement therapy. Achieving appropriate volume management requires knowledge of the underlying cardiovascular pathophysiology and careful evaluation of intravascular and extravascular volume status. In the presence of a failing kidney, fluid removal is often a challenge. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) techniques offer a significant advantage over intermittent dialysis for fluid control, however, any form of RRT in the critically ill patient requires careful attention to prescription and monitoring to avoid complications. In order to utilize these therapies for their maximum potential it is necessary to understand which factors influence fluid balance and have an understanding of the principles and kinetics of fluid removal with extra-corporeal techniques.

### Optimal dialysate sodium-what is the evidence? [^114meeRg]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Oligo-anuric patients with end-stage kidney disease are dependent on hemodialysis to achieve and maintain the desired goal of euvolemia. The dialysis prescription, in addition to sodium and fluid restriction, is therefore a critically important factor in the care of hemodialysis patients. Various dialysate sodium concentrations have been favored throughout the history of dialysis, but the "optimal" concentration remains unclear. In this manuscript, we examine the historical context of changes to the dialysate sodium prescription, review the evidence of its associated effects, discuss 'individualization' of dialysate sodium, and highlight the need for definitive trials that are powered for important clinical outcomes.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^114CnEfu]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that fluid overload and acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated but the exact cause-effect relationship remains unclear. Wang and colleagues analysed patients admitted to 30 intensive care units in China and found that fluid accumulation was independently associated with an increased risk of AKI and mortality. This commentary focuses on the close pathophysiological link between AKI and fluid overload and discusses the implications for clinical practice. It outlines some of the challenges, including the difficulty in diagnosing fluid overload reliably with current methods, and stresses the importance of personalised fluid therapy with physiological end-points to avoid the deleterious effects of fluid overload.

Patient fluid removal

The difference between ultrafiltration and replacement/dialysate volumes determines fluid removal. The speed of fluid removal is referred to as the net ultrafiltration (NUF) rate. A high NUF rate in CRRT may be harmful, although optimal values are not yet established. Because fluid overload is common and undesirable, we regularly reassess fluid status and adjust NUF rate accordingly. We avoid very high NUF rates (> 2 mL/kg/h), unless aggressive fluid removal is indicated by life-threatening fluid overload.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^11769uM8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fluids are probably the most commonly administered intravenous treatment in inpatient care. Because of their excellent safety profile, until recently fluid solutions were not considered "medications". Little to no thought was therefore invested in the choice of fluids to be administered in specific clinical scenarios. However, recent evidence on long-term effects has altered our view on the different types of fluids available for fluid resuscitation. Intravenous fluids should be seen as drugs affecting the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and immune systems and should therefore not be administered "blindly".

Emphasis on the importance of volume above all the other characteristics of the fluids administered was nurtured by early guidelines that focused on administering specific fluid volumes to hemodynamically unstable patients (i.e. the surviving sepsis campaign). It is true that fluid administration is an important component of treatment of overt tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Fluids may expand the intra-vascular compartment, thereby improving cardiac output (CO) and end-organ perfusion. However, the most common error with regards to fluid administration is the belief that resuscitation hinges on transfusion of a specific volume of fluids.

Disease processes are dynamic and their response to fluid may change over time. Specific disease states may also require different fluid therapy. Evidence from perioperative settings has associated both hypo- and hypervolemia with several unfavorable outcomes, including acute kidney injury (AKI), respiratory complications, increased lengths of stays, admission costs and 30-day-mortality rates. Later iterations of the guidelines have therefore clarified that the aim of fluid resuscitation is restoration of end-organ perfusion and correction of physiological imbalance. Follow-up during fluid administration should therefore include surrogate markers of organ perfusion (e.g. mean arterial pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, lactate, CO), markers of circulation, blood electrolyte and acid-base composition and indicators of renal function. No fluid is ideal for all disease conditions at all times. This review presents the current state of knowledge regarding the types of fluids to be administered with an emphasis on several disease states.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^1119zuuW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluids are closely linked through oliguria, which is a marker of the former and a trigger for administration of the latter. Recent progress in this field has challenged the physiological and clinical rational of using oliguria as a trigger for the administration of fluid and brought attention to the delicate balance between benefits and harms of different aspects of fluid management in critically ill patients, in particular those with AKI. This narrative review addresses various aspects of fluid management in AKI outlining physiological aspects, the effects of crystalloids and colloids on kidney function and the effect of various resuscitation and de-resuscitation strategies on the course and outcome of AKI.

### Improving clinical outcomes among hemodialysis patients: a proposal for a "volume first" approach from the chief medical officers of US dialysis providers [^1127sKhs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Addressing fluid intake and volume control requires alignment and coordination of patients, providers, dialysis facilities, and payers, potentially necessitating a "Volume First" approach. This article reports the consensus opinions achieved at the March 2013 symposium of the Chief Medical Officers of 14 of the largest dialysis providers in the United States. These opinions are based on broad experience among participants, but often reinforced by only observational and frequently retrospective studies, highlighting the lack of high-quality clinical trials in nephrology. Given the high morbidity and mortality rates among dialysis patients and the absence of sufficient trial data to guide most aspects of hemodialysis therapy, participants believed that immediate attempts to improve care based on quality improvement initiatives, physiologic principles, and clinical experiences are warranted until such time as rigorous clinical trial data become available. The following overarching consensus opinions emerged. (1) Extracellular fluid status should be a component of sufficient dialysis, such that approaching normalization of extracellular fluid volume should be a primary goal of dialysis care. (2) Fluid removal should be gradual and dialysis treatment duration should not routinely be less than 4 hours without justification based on individual patient factors. (3) Intradialytic sodium loading should be avoided by incorporating dialysate sodium concentrations set routinely in the range of 134–138 mEq/L, avoidance of routine use of sodium modeling, and avoidance of hypertonic saline solution. (4) Dietary counseling should emphasize sodium avoidance.

### Fluid management in chronic kidney disease: what is too much, what is the distribution, and how to manage fluid overload in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^114dViX4]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Assessment of fluid status to reach normovolemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to be a tough task. Besides clinical observation, technological methods have been introduced, yet, the best approach is still uncertain. The present review looks at fluid overload in CKD from three perspectives: the critical fluid threshold leading to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, fluid distribution and its clinical correlates, and direct effect of fluid overload on vascular function related to disturbance of the sodium-skin axis and endothelial glycocalyx dysfunction.

Recent Findings

To determine fluid status, both the absolute and relative fluid overload is used as parameter in clinical practice. In addition, the definition of fluid overload is ambivalent and its relation to symptom burden has not been studied well. Studies on the impact of distribution of fluid are scarce and the limited evidence suggests differences based on the cause of CKD. So far, no standardized technologies are available to adequately determine fluid distribution. After discovering the 'third compartment' of total body sodium in skin and muscle tissue and its potential direct effect on vascular function, other biomarkers such as VEGF-C are promising.

Summary

We propose a multimodal clinical approach for volume management in CKD. Because there are currently no studies are available demonstrating that correction of fluid overload in CKD will lead to better outcome, these are strongly needed.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^112VGHtN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the guidelines — clinical outcomes are optimized when the patient is treated with the delivered dose of dialysis recommended, but because dose as small‑solute clearance is a composite measure, an occasional patient may generate toxins at a rate well above average and therefore require more dialysis than recommended. Clinicians should be alert to subtle symptoms and signs of kidney failure that may indicate a need for more dialysis or a different dialysis modality. After the immediate life‑threatening effects of uremia have been controlled by standard hemodialysis, the patient is often left with symptoms and objective disorders termed a "residual syndrome", whose combined effect may account for the relatively high yearly mortality rate observed in the dialysis population; in many cases, relief from specific aspects of the syndrome requires additional treatments that may not yet be available to clinicians.

### Indications and management of mechanical fluid removal in critical illness [^1179EB41]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) dedicated its Twelfth Consensus Conference (2013) to all aspects of fluid therapy, including the management of fluid overload (FO). The aim of the working subgroup 'Mechanical fluid removal' was to review the indications, prescription, and management of mechanical fluid removal within the broad context of fluid management of critically ill patients.

Methods

The working group developed a list of preliminary questions and objectives and performed a modified Delphi analysis of the existing literature. Relevant studies were identified through a literature search using the MEDLINE database and bibliographies of relevant research and review articles.

Results

After review of the existing literature, the group agreed the following consensus statements: (i) in critically ill patients with FO and with failure of or inadequate response to pharmacological therapy, mechanical fluid removal should be considered as a therapy to optimize fluid balance. (ii) When using mechanical fluid removal or management, targets for rate of fluid removal and net fluid removal should be based upon the overall fluid balance of the patient and also physiological variables, individualized, and reassessed frequently. (iii) More research on the role and practice of mechanical fluid removal in critically ill patients not meeting fluid balance goals (including in children) is necessary.

Conclusion

Mechanical fluid removal should be considered as a therapy for FO, but more research is necessary to determine its exact role and clinical application.

### Dialysate sodium: choosing the optimal hemodialysis bath [^116vSGCH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Fluid overload in patients undergoing hemodialysis contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and is a major cause of hospitalizations. It is often addressed by reinforcing the importance of a low-salt diet with patients and challenging estimated dry weights. More recently, interest has shifted toward the dialysate sodium prescription as a strategy to improve fluid overload and its adverse sequelae. The availability of high-flux high-efficiency dialysis in conjunction with the need to ensure its tolerability for patients has resulted in an increase in dialysate sodium prescriptions from 120 to ≥ 140 mEq/L. However, we are now tackling the unforeseen consequences associated with high dialysate sodium prescriptions. High dialysate sodium concentration is associated with high interdialytic weight gain, a commonly used surrogate for hypervolemia contributing to hypertension. The association between mortality and high dialysate sodium concentration remains controversial with conflicting data. It is clear that fluid management in the diverse end-stage renal disease population is extremely complex and more clinical trials are needed. In the meantime, while patients require treatments and clinical decisions need to be made, this review article attempts to summarize the current evidence for individualized dialysate sodium prescriptions based on patients' volume status, comorbid conditions, plasma sodium level, and hemodynamic response to dialysis therapy.

### Outcomes among patients with advanced kidney disease who forgo maintenance dialysis… [^1121nrDN]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that advances in research and health care delivery are needed to optimize outcomes among patients who are not treated with dialysis. Importance An understanding of the long-term outcomes of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease not treated with maintenance dialysis is needed to improve shared decision-making and care practices for this population. Objective To evaluate survival, use of health care resources, changes in quality of life, and end-of-life care of patients with advanced kidney disease who forgo dialysis. Evidence Review MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched from inception through December 3, 2021, for all English language longitudinal studies of adults in whom there was an explicit decision not to pursue maintenance dialysis.

Two investigators independently reviewed all studies and selected those reporting survival, use of health care resources, changes in quality of life, or end-of-life care during follow-up. Forty-one cohort studies comprising 5102 patients were included in this systematic review. Substantial heterogeneity in study designs and measures used to report outcomes limited comparability across studies. Median survival of cohorts ranged from 1 to 41 months as measured from a baseline mean estimated glomerular filtration rate ranging from 7 to 19 mL/min/1. 73 m2. To support a deeper understanding of the long-term outcomes of patients with advanced CKD who do not pursue dialysis, we performed a systematic review of longitudinal studies reporting survival, use of health care resources, quality of life, and end-of-life care of patients with advanced CKD who did not pursue dialysis.

For studies reporting only a threshold eGFR value, the closest value was used in place of mean values. Median eGFR values were used in place of mean values when the latter were not reported. to 19 mL/min/1. 73 m2 for cohorts published from 2010 to 2015, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 22, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45 and 1 to 39 months and 9 to 16.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114RvxAV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1 - Fluid assessment and management in adults

We recommend assessment of fluid status when prompted by clinical circumstances, and on a quarterly basis for stable patients. [1C]

We suggest a multidisciplinary approach to fluid assessment, with patient involvement and the adoption of patient-friendly terminology such as "target weight", "fluid gain" and "over-hydration". [2D]

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment of fluid status with a validated objective measurement, such as bioimpedance, at regular intervals, when clinical assessment is unclear, and following an intercurrent illness. [2C]

We recommend a dialysate temperature not greater than 36'C if standardised. [1C]

We recommend avoiding excessive ultrafiltration rates by addressing fluid gains, accepting staged achievement of target weight, or using an augmented schedule, as necessary. [1B]

We recommend prompt nursing intervention to restore haemodynamic stability in symptomatic / severe intradialytic hypotension, with such interventions leading to clinical review. [1C]

Rationale

Fluid control is an essential clinical goal of maintenance haemodialysis, but correct fluid management requires clinicians to steer between the two competing / overlapping problems of fluid overload and intra-dialytic hypotension.

Failure to control fluid overload may lead to obvious short-term effects including hypertension and breathlessness, and nephrology trainees quickly become familiar with the emergency dialysis admission with pulmonary oedema. In the longer term also, chronic fluid overload is one of the main drivers of hypertension and is independently associated with poor outcomes: for example, in a US study of over 10 000 prevalent haemodialysis patients, Flythe reported clinical outcomes over 2 years' follow-up, according to achievement of target weight during the baseline month. Compared to those achieving within 2kg of target weight on at least 70% of sessions, the 15% of patients frequently remaining over-hydrated post dialysis had increased mortality (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.15–1.43) as did the 7% of patients who were frequently under-hydrated post dialysis (HR 1.22, 95%CI 1.05–1.40).

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^111xeCnx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important to recognize that deteriorating renal function may require a greater reduction in dosage than that specified in the above guidelines for patients with stable renal impairment.

In adults with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis, the amount of gentamicin removed from the blood may vary depending upon several factors including the dialysis method used. An eight-hour hemodialysis may reduce serum concentrations of gentamicin by approximately 50%. The recommended dosage at the end of each dialysis period is 1 to 1.7 mg/kg depending upon the severity of the infection. In children, a dose of 2 mg/kg may be administered.

The above dosage schedules are not intended as rigid recommendations but are provided as guides to dosage when measurement of gentamicin serum level is not feasible.

A variety of methods are available to measure gentamicin concentrations in body fluids; these include microbiologic, enzymatic and radioimmunoassay techniques.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^1154rYQx]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evidence presented in this review highlights the potential of modern fluid management methods to improve outcomes in dialysis patients. However, incorporating these tools into clinical practice requires a thoughtful and individualized approach. Here, we provide some recommendations for using these methods in different clinical scenarios.

For patients with suspected fluid overload, a combination of LUS (to detect pulmonary congestion) and echocardiography (to assess IVC diameter and collapsibility) can provide a comprehensive assessment of volume status. BIA can be used to quantify the degree of overhydration and guide ultrafiltration goals. VEXUS can be employed to assess venous congestion and guide targeted interventions in patients with persistent volume overload or worsening renal function, while PLR can help predict the risk of intradialytic hypotension and inform ultrafiltration profiling strategies. In this paper, we provide a physiologically guided framework to apply these principles.

### The future of critical care: renal support in 2027 [^117Xg4WY]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was developed originally as an alternative for hemodynamically unstable acute renal failure (ARF) patients who could not tolerate conventional hemodialysis. The early application of CRRT largely involved technology adapted from the maintenance dialysis setting and almost exclusively occurred as a salvage therapy, typically in hypercatabolic patients with severe, diuretic-resistant fluid overload. As CRRT technology evolved over the past four decades to produce devices specifically designed for the critically ill population, utilization of the therapy as a first-line treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI) and the patient populations treated have expanded substantially. Moreover, despite a lack of data definitively showing outcome benefits for CRRT, consensus statements now suggest its use, rather than conventional hemodialysis, for hemodynamically unstable AKI patients.

While CRRT is now a mainstay therapy in the vast majority of large ICUs around the world, this modality can be challenging to implement at some institutions and significant opportunity for improvement exists. Clinicians' uncertainty about numerous aspects of CRRT, including therapy dosing, timing of initiation and termination, fluid management, anticoagulation, drug dosing, and data analytics, may lead to inconsistent delivery of the therapy and even reluctance to prescribe it. In this review, we perform a critical assessment of CRRT, discussing current limitations and potential solutions over the next decade from both a patient management and a technology perspective. In addition, we address the issue of sustainability for CRRT and related therapies beyond 2027 and raise several points for consideration.

### Fluid management for the prevention and attenuation of acute kidney injury [^1147Cvx6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), optimization of systemic haemodynamics is central to the clinical management. However, considerable debate exists regarding the efficacy, nature, extent and duration of fluid resuscitation, particularly when the patient has undergone major surgery or is in septic shock. Crucially, volume resuscitation might be required to maintain or restore cardiac output. However, resultant fluid accumulation and tissue oedema can substantially contribute to ongoing organ dysfunction and, particularly in patients developing AKI, serious clinical consequences. In this Review, we discuss the conflict between the desire to achieve adequate resuscitation of shock and the need to mitigate the harmful effects of fluid overload. In patients with AKI, limiting and resolving fluid overload might prompt earlier use of renal replacement therapy. However, rapid or early excessive fluid removal with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy might lead to hypovolaemia and recurrent renal injury. Optimal management might involve a period of guided fluid resuscitation, followed by management of an even fluid balance and, finally, an appropriate rate of fluid removal. To obtain best clinical outcomes, serial fluid status assessment and careful definition of cardiovascular and renal targets will be required during fluid resuscitation and removal.

### Acyclovir sodium [^117BUxzn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis

For patients who require dialysis, the mean plasma half-life of acyclovir during hemodialysis is approximately 5 hours. This results in a 60% decrease in plasma concentrations following a six-hour dialysis period. Therefore, the patient's dosing schedule should be adjusted so that an additional dose is administered after each dialysis.

Peritoneal Dialysis

No supplemental dose appears to be necessary after adjustment of the dosing interval.

Administration

The calculated dose should be further diluted in an appropriate intravenous solution at a volume selected for administration during each 1 hour infusion. Infusion concentrations of approximately 7 mg/mL or lower are recommended. In clinical studies, the average 70 kg adult received between 60 and 150 mL of fluid per dose. Higher concentrations (e.g., 10 mg/mL) may produce phlebitis or inflammation at the injection site upon inadvertent extravasation. Standard, commercially available electrolyte and glucose solutions are suitable for intravenous administration; biologic or colloidal fluids (e.g., blood products, protein solutions, etc.) are not recommended.

Once diluted for administration, each dose should be used within 24 hours.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Intravenous fluids: effects on renal outcomes [^112Ryokt]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is the most commonly prescribed inpatient medication in hospitals around the world. Intravenous fluids are drugs and have an indication, a dose, and expected and unintended effects. The type and amount of fluid given to patients are both important, and can either hasten or slow recovery depending on how they are administered. This narrative review provides a brief summary of the effect of intravenous fluid administration on kidney function and on renal outcome measures of relevance to both patients and clinicians. Several large clinical trials of fluid therapy are currently underway, the results of which are likely to change clinical practice.

### Fluid removal associates with better outcomes in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy: a cohort study [^111pZ3cZ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In critically ill patients, haemodynamic stabilisation often involves aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Although considered to be crucial for optimisation, this approach tends to lead to fluid accumulation. Evidence is accumulating that fluid overload is associated with harm, including worsening organ dysfunction and mortality. Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are particularly at risk. For instance, in patients with early AKI, fluid overload increases the risk of worsening AKI. In patients treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT), fluid overload on the first day of RRT correlates with mortality, dialysis dependency and reduced renal recovery. However, most studies which demonstrate a relationship between fluid accumulation and mortality are confounded by the fact that patients with fluid overload tend to be sicker and often need more organ support.

In general, strategies for avoiding and managing fluid overload include conservative fluid management, diuretic use and mechanical fluid removal. A sub-analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level of Renal Replacement Therapy (RENAL) study showed that achieving a negative fluid balance during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was associated with a survival benefit. However, the optimal timing and best method of removing fluid and reversing fluid overload during RRT are unknown. As a result, clinical practice is variable. Slower removal rates may result in prolonged exposure to the effects of fluid accumulation, including tissue oedema and progressive organ dysfunction. Murugan et al. analysed critically ill patients with AKI and 5% fluid overload receiving RRT and showed that an ultrafiltration intensity > 25 ml/kg/day was associated with lower 1-year mortality compared to 20 ml/kg/day. More intensive ultrafiltration, however, may not be tolerated and may be associated with an increased risk of haemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction. For instance, the RENAL study showed that net ultrafiltration rates greater than 1.75 ml/kg/h compared with rates less than 1.01 ml/kg/h were associated with a reduced chance of survival. Hypophosphatemia and cardiac arrhythmias were more common in patients exposed to higher ultrafiltration rates.

To reconcile the conflicting messages about ultrafiltration rates, it is important to consider whether the net effect on cumulative fluid balance may be more important than the actual ultrafiltration rate per sé. In addition, there is a need to identify factors which impact the chances of successful fluid removal.

The objectives of our study were to investigate the association between changes in cumulative fluid balance (FB) and mortality during CRRT and to identify relevant clinical parameters which impacted the likelihood of successful decrease of FB.

### Fluid overload and acute kidney injury: cause or consequence? [^117DfbaX]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Third, fluid overload may result from overzealous fluid administration or oliguria or a combination of the two. The differentiation is important since fluid overload caused by excessive fluid therapy is potentially avoidable whereas fluid overload as a result of oliguria may reflect AKI and may not be easily modifiable without RRT. Most studies have not distinguished between the two. In a recent retrospective analysis, it was demonstrated that fluid administration, rather than low urine output, was independently associated with progression from AKI stage I to stage III. Clearly, more detailed work is necessary to identify the exact factors responsible for fluid overload.

Finally, the fact that fluid overload is associated with AKI does not prove causality. One key problem is that the effects of volume overload and the effects of AKI are similar. Both lead to multi-organ dysfunction. They also often have the same denominator, including endothelial dysfunction due to inflammation or ischaemia/reperfusion injury with decay and shedding of the glycocalyx and subsequent capillary leakage. Patients with more severe endothelial dysfunction tend to develop both fluid overload and AKI following fluid administration. Importantly, hypervolaemia may stretch the vascular wall and worsen vascular permeability, possibly by atrial natriuretic peptide-induced damage to the glycocalyx (Fig. 1). Unpicking this vicious circle can be very difficult.

Fig. 1
Interconnected relationship between acute kidney injury and fluid overload. AKI acute kidney injury, ANP atrial natriuretic peptide, SIRS systemic inflammatory response syndrome

Nevertheless, the study by Wang et al. does confirm what other studies have shown previously that a positive fluid balance is associated with worse outcomes. The crucial question for clinical practice is how to ensure appropriate and timely correction of hypovolaemia without causing fluid overload. Unfortunately, the tools to guide fluid management and to inform the clinical team when fluid administration is no longer beneficial are inadequate. Central venous pressure (CVP) or dynamic techniques like fluid responsiveness or echocardiography are often used. However, the CVP does not accurately reflect intravascular volume status and can be misleading. Measuring changes in pulse pressure and stroke volume may provide very useful information for assessing preload and fluid responsiveness but does not diagnose or quantify fluid overload either. Crucially, these techniques are not readily available outside critical care areas. Cumulative fluid balance gives an indication about the fluid input–output relationship but does not correct for non-measurable losses, is often inaccurate and does not indicate whether a patient is intravascularly hypovolaemic, euvolaemic or overloaded.

Dietary water restriction counseling — Attempts at water restriction commonly are futile if sodium limitation is not observed simultaneously, and reducing a patient's water intake alone is not prudent most of the time because excessive sodium ingestion increases ECF osmolality and stimulates thirst; advising water limitation without curtailing sodium intake will cause suffering from unnecessary thirst.

### Assessing and delivering dialysis dose in acute kidney injury [^112daDjR]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Assessing and delivering dialysis dose in acute kidney injury (AKI) has emerged as an important issue in the management of critically ill patients. There is ongoing debate on how dose of dialysis should be expressed and measured. Most studies have focused on clearance of small molecules (blood urea nitrogen) as a marker of delivered dose and for establishing dose-outcome relationships. Recent evidence has shown that other markers may also be important to consider, as acid-base balance and fluid overload have emerged as important factors contributing to outcomes. In this review, we provide an evaluation of current approaches to prescribing and delivering dialysis dose in AKI, identify gaps in practice and propose an integrated approach to optimize dose delivery in dialysis with a goal to improve outcomes.

### Does the use of neutral pH, low glucose degradation product peritoneal dialysis fluids lead to better patient outcomes? [^116geEG1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will examine the impact of neutral pH, low glucose degradation product (GDP) peritoneal dialysis fluid use on patient-level clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Recent Findings

Recently published results from the balANZ trial and a meta-analysis suggest that the use of neutral pH, low GDP peritoneal dialysis fluids leads to better preservation of residual renal function, including residual diuresis, without added harmful effects. The impact of neutral pH, low GDP peritoneal dialysis fluids on other clinical outcomes (e.g. peritonitis) remains uncertain due to conflicting results from randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis was unable to clarify this further due to generally suboptimal trial quality and insufficient statistical power.

Summary

At present, based on the best available evidence, the use of neutral pH, low GDP peritoneal dialysis fluids is associated with some important clinical benefits without added harm. Further studies in the area are needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of this therapy and to clarify the effects of biocompatible fluids on patient-level outcomes, such as peritonitis, quality of life, technique survival and patient survival.

Membrane flux and haemodiafiltration

We recommend that patients with minimal residual function should be treated with high-flux dialysers. [1B]

We suggest that haemodiafiltration may be considered as a treatment for intra-dialytic hypotension refractory to other measures, and for dialysis patients with favourable prognosis who are unable or unlikely to be transplanted. [2B]

Fluid in haemodialysis (Guidelines 4.1–4.2)

Guideline 4.1 - Fluid assessment and management in adults

We recommend assessment of fluid status when prompted by clinical circumstances, and on a quarterly basis for stable patients. [1C]

We suggest a multidisciplinary approach to fluid assessment, with patient involvement and the adoption of patient-friendly terminology such as "target weight", "fluid gain" and "over-hydration". [2D]

We recommend clinical assessment of fluid status on a monthly basis for the majority of patients. [1C]

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment of fluid status with a validated objective measurement, such as bioimpedance, at regular intervals, when clinical assessment is unclear, and following an intercurrent illness. [2C]

We recommend a dialysate temperature not greater than 36'C if standardised. [1C]

We recommend avoiding excessive ultrafiltration rates by addressing fluid gains, accepting staged achievement of target weight, or using an augmented schedule, as necessary. [1B]

We recommend prompt nursing intervention to restore haemodynamic stability in symptomatic / severe intradialytic hypotension, with such interventions leading to clinical review. [1C]

Guideline 4.2 - Paediatric fluid considerations

In growing children we recommend clinical assessment of fluid status and target weight, and dietetic assessment, at least monthly. [1C]

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment with a validated objective measure of fluid status such as bioimpedance, on a monthly basis or more frequently during periods of rapid growth or illness. [2C]

We recommend regular assessment of ultrafiltration tolerance, using extended times to avoid excessive ultrafiltration rates. [1D]

### Fluid accumulation, survival and recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^114wv1mb]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Fluid accumulation is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. Here, we sought to determine if fluid accumulation is associated with mortality and non-recovery of kidney function in critically ill adults with acute kidney injury. Fluid overload was defined as more than a 10% increase in body weight relative to baseline, measured in 618 patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter observational study. Patients with fluid overload experienced significantly higher mortality within 60 days of enrollment. Among dialyzed patients, survivors had significantly lower fluid accumulation when dialysis was initiated compared to non-survivors after adjustments for dialysis modality and severity score. The adjusted odds ratio for death associated with fluid overload at dialysis initiation was 2.07. In non-dialyzed patients, survivors had significantly less fluid accumulation at the peak of their serum creatinine. Fluid overload at the time of diagnosis of acute kidney injury was not associated with recovery of kidney function. However, patients with fluid overload when their serum creatinine reached its peak were significantly less likely to recover kidney function. Our study shows that in patients with acute kidney injury, fluid overload was independently associated with mortality. Whether the fluid overload was the result of a more severe renal failure or it contributed to its cause will require clinical trials in which the role of fluid administration to such patients is directly tested.

Table 4
Assessment of risk of acute renal failure and other complications

In general, serial physical and laboratory examinations are necessary to manage patients with ERM appropriately. In the acute phase, treatment should be aimed at preserving renal function and restoring metabolic derangements. Early and adequate volume replacement with isotonic sodium chloride solution 0.9% (no potassium-containing or lactate-containing solutions) may directly prevent renal injury by aiding clearance of toxic substances and increasing renal perfusion pressure. Volume expansion increases renal blood flow and, consequently, glomerular filtration and urination. A common goal of treatment is to achieve a urine output of 300 mL/hour. This may require infusion of intravenous fluids by 1–2 L/hour until urine output is stable. Intravenous fluid should preferably be continued until serum CK activity in plasma has declined to 1000 IU/L or below. In patients with little or no urine output despite aggressive hydration, profound acidosis or severe hyperkalaemia, consider peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis and consult a nephrologist. Aggressive hydration may not be appropriate in patients with other comorbidities such as heart failure. Furthermore, if kidney injury is already established, overly aggressive hydration in a patient with already established renal failure may lead to volume overload and pulmonary oedema.

Mannitol leads to an increase in blood flow and glomerular filtration, which reduces the obstruction by myoglobin casts. It must only be given after volume replacement and must be avoided in patients with oliguria. It is not routinely recommended, but may be administered if the target urine output cannot be achieved by other means. Loop diuretics have also been investigated, but published data are too limited to support recommending them routinely. Although not proven by randomised control trials, some experts recommend the addition of bicarbonate. Alkalisation of the urine (target pH 6.5) promotes myoglobulin washout and corrects the metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. A recent systematic review has shown that sodium bicarbonate should only be administered to patients with systemic acidosis.

Monitoring for and treating rhabdomyolysis-related electrolyte abnormalities is an important part of managing patients with ERM. Hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hyperuricaemia are common in patients with rhabdomyolysis, and should be treated with standard therapy. Although hypocalcaemia is common in early rhabdomyolysis, hypercalcaemia can occur later. Calcium supplementation should only be prescribed for patients with symptomatic hypocalcaemia or severe hyperkalaemia. More research is needed to determine whether allopurinol may be useful for preventing ERM and acute renal damage.

### Blood volume-monitored regulation of ultrafiltration to decrease the dry weight in fluid-overloaded hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled trial [^112NP4cd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study duration

This study originally had a crossover design with 3 intervention phases (12 hemodialysis sessions each), enabling all participants to use the 3 dialysis techniques. Because patients were not required to revert to their fluid overloaded state after crossing over to another treatment modality, the crossover design solely served the purpose of exploring additional endpoints, for example which method would patients choose as their preferred hemodialysis treatment. The primary outcome, and most secondary outcome measures as well as the sample size calculation were independent of the other intervention phases, however. Because of the high rate of dialysis-related complications (described in the Results section), the study was terminated after the first intervention phase.

### Intravenous solutions in the care of patients with volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities [^1134hMUp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

Lowering dialysate sodium therefore does appear to improve fluid control and blood pressure, albeit with some side effects, however another note of caution arises from observations on mortality in different dialysate sodium groups. Studying almost 30 000 patients from DOPPS phases 1–4, with dialysate sodium varying between 138 and 142mmol/l in 90% of patients, Hecking found that higher dialysate sodium was, as expected, associated with modestly increased fluid gain and systolic blood pressure (increasing by 0.17% body weight and 0.66mmHg per 2mmol/l increase in dialysate sodium). However, when addressing indication bias by studying only the 56% of facilities using a standardised dialysate sodium, they found that higher dialysate sodium was unexpectedly associated with reduced mortality (HR 0.88 per 2mmol/l increase in dialysate sodium, 95%CI 0.83–0.94). There is insufficient consistency in the literature for a clear recommendation on dialysate sodium, though if a standardised dialysate sodium is used for all patients, some clinicians would avoid a choice below 140mmol/l.

### Fluid balance and acute kidney injury [^114sfsAy]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluids are widely administered to patients who have, or are at risk of, acute kidney injury (AKI). However, deleterious consequences of overzealous fluid therapy are increasingly being recognized. Salt and water overload can predispose to organ dysfunction, impaired wound healing and nosocomial infection, particularly in patients with AKI, in whom fluid challenges are frequent and excretion is impaired. In this Review article, we discuss how interstitial edema can further delay renal recovery and why conservative fluid strategies are now being advocated. Applying these strategies in critical illness is challenging. Although volume resuscitation is needed to restore cardiac output, it often leads to tissue edema, thereby contributing to ongoing organ dysfunction. Conservative strategies of fluid management mandate a switch towards neutral balance and then negative balance once hemodynamic stabilization is achieved. In patients with AKI, this strategy might require renal replacement therapy to be given earlier than when more-liberal fluid management is used. However, hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion can occur in patients with AKI if excessive fluid removal is pursued with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy. Thus, accurate assessment of fluid status and careful definition of targets are needed at all stages to improve clinical outcomes. A conservative strategy of fluid management was recently tested and found to be effective in a large, randomized, controlled trial in patients with acute lung injury. Similar randomized, controlled studies in patients with AKI now seem justified.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^115n48Cz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

These studies are non-interventional, therefore associations are with observed (rather than prescribed) ultrafiltration rate, and there is also a close interaction with session length (since rate is obviously the volume over the time) but these data provide a convincing argument for avoidance of excessive rates. This should not however be at the expense of non-achievement of target weight and acceptance of over-hydration (though staged achievement over a number of sessions is frequently appropriate) but rather should focus clinicians on session length or addressing fluid gains between dialysis sessions. The ultrafiltration required during dialysis depends on the degree of over-hydration present at the start of the session, so restricting fluid intake reduces ultrafiltration rate, and is part of standard advice for the majority of patients. Consideration must be given to the cause of increased fluid intake such as habitual drinking or thirst associated with either dietary sodium intake or raised blood glucose. Advice on managing fluid intake is therefore best delivered on an individualised basis, as part of a dietary management plan to support adherence and patient experience. This topic is covered in guidelines for the nutritional management of kidney disease.

Other relevant aspects of the dialysis prescription include dialysate sodium and temperature.

Sodium balance, thirst and fluid control are also influenced by dialysate sodium. Many observational studies report lower fluid gains and lower blood pressure in patients treated with low dialysate Na (typically 136–138mmol/l). Antihypertensive treatment is frequently overlooked in large studies, but reasonable supportive evidence can also be found in interventional studies. For example, Gumrukcuoglu reduced dialysate sodium from 140 to 137mmol/l in 41 patients over 6 months, reporting reduced fluid gains, and no blood pressure change but a reduction in antihypertensive use from 1.9 to 1.2 agents per patient. This potential benefit was not without drawbacks however: in common with other groups, investigators also found that cramps and intra-dialytic hypotension became more frequent.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^1174xQdk]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ESKD patients admitted to the ICU may have low effective arterial blood volume and hemodynamic instability due to various combinations of sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and other underlying diseases. Restoration of intravascular volume and circulation may require the administration of large volumes of intravenous fluids. Moreover, fluid overload (e.g. pulmonary edema, respiration failure, and/or third-spacing) may be present on ICU admission in ESKD patients on dialysis who are vulnerable to poor fluid balance. Thus, clinicians have chosen CRRT as a dialysis option to reduce fluid overload and secure hemodynamic stability. However, it remains unclear how to manage volume status by controlling CRRT input and output in these patients. Although a number of literatures have been dealing with this issue, most studies have focused on AKI patients. To our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to investigate fluid balance in ESKD patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring CRRT.

### Fluid management for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury receiving kidney replacement therapy: an international survey [^114ckrtT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients receiving KRT, high ultrafiltration rates and persistent fluid accumulation are associated with adverse outcomes. The purpose of this international survey was to evaluate current practices and evidence gaps related to fluid removal with KRT in critically ill patients.

Methods

This was a multinational, web-based survey distributed by seven networks comprising nephrologists and intensivists. Physicians involved in the care of critically ill patients were invited to complete a 39-question survey about fluid management practices on KRT. The survey was distributed from September 2021 to December 2021.

Results

There were 757 respondents from 96 countries (response rate of 65%). Most respondents practiced adult medicine (89%) and worked in an academic center (69%). The majority (91%) reported aiming for a 0.5- to 2-L negative fluid balance per day when fluid removal is indicated, although there was important variability in what respondents considered a safe maximal target. Intensivists were more likely than nephrologists to use adjunct volume status assessment methods (i.e., ultrasound, hemodynamic markers, and intra-abdominal pressure), while nephrologists were more likely to deploy cointerventions aimed at improving tolerance to fluid removal (i.e., osmotic agents and low-temperature dialysate). There was a broad consensus that rapid decongestion should be prioritized when fluid accumulation is present, but the prevention of hypotension was also reported as a competing priority. A majority (77%) agreed that performing trials that compare fluid management strategies would be ethical and clinically relevant.

Conclusions

We have identified multiple areas of variability in current practice of fluid management for patients receiving KRT. Most nephrologists and intensivists agreed that several knowledge gaps related to fluid removal strategies should be investigated in future randomized controlled trials.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^111cBXXm]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — patients with renal insufficiency in heart failure: Patients with heart failure (HF) frequently have impaired renal function and may show an impaired response to diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) with increased risk of adverse effects during digitalis; renal function may worsen during treatment with diuretics or ACEIs, although such changes are frequently short-lived, generally asymptomatic, and reversible. Most patients tolerate mild to moderate renal impairment and changes in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine are generally clinically insignificant and can usually be managed without withdrawal of needed HF drugs, but if serum creatinine increases to more than 3 mg per dL, renal insufficiency can severely limit efficacy and enhance toxicity of established treatments; in patients with a serum creatinine greater than 5 mg per dL, hemofiltration or dialysis may be needed to control fluid retention, minimize risk of uremia, and allow response to and tolerance of standard HF therapies.

### Four phases of intravenous fluid therapy: a conceptual model [^1141B1Rp]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

I.V. fluid therapy plays a fundamental role in the management of hospitalized patients. While the correct use of i.v. fluids can be lifesaving, recent literature demonstrates that fluid therapy is not without risks. Indeed, the use of certain types and volumes of fluid can increase the risk of harm, and even death, in some patient groups. Data from a recent audit show us that the inappropriate use of fluids may occur in up to 20% of patients receiving fluid therapy. The delegates of the 12th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Conference sought to obtain consensus on the use of i.v. fluids with the aim of producing guidance for their use. In this article, we review a recently proposed model for fluid therapy in severe sepsis and propose a framework by which it could be adopted for use in most situations where fluid management is required. Considering the dose-effect relationship and side-effects of fluids, fluid therapy should be regarded similar to other drug therapy with specific indications and tailored recommendations for the type and dose of fluid. By emphasizing the necessity to individualize fluid therapy, we hope to reduce the risk to our patients and improve their outcome.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111iK1eK]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The strengths of the recommendations and the level of supporting evidence are coded as previously using the Modified GRADE system.

There are a few changes in scope, for example dialysis water treatment is now covered in another guideline, as are many aspects of dialysis, including:
Planning, initiation & withdrawal of Renal Replacement Therapy
Vascular Access for Haemodialysis
Cardiovascular Disease
Blood Borne Viruses
Assessment of the Potential Kidney Transplant Recipient
Nutrition
Anaemia
CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder
Water Treatment Facilities, Dialysis Water and Dialysis Fluid Quality

We have removed the section on targets for blood testing since these are better covered in other guidelines, and have not covered infrastructure or workforce since these will be addressed separately by the Renal Association in a different format.

However, in most ways the update is broader than previous versions. For example, new sections have been written covering fluid management (surely an essential topic but not really covered previously or elsewhere) and dialysate (often underestimated in importance). In other areas this update seems to make no substantial change to previous guidance (as with dialysis dose, for example, where the literature remains dominated by previous large trials), however whilst key concepts remain valid, their understanding has developed, and the guideline aims to provide greater context, encouraging a more holistic interpretation.

Discussions about dialysis often become overly technical – these concepts are important but hard to fit into a narrative so we have moved a few aspects into the appendix, where we aim to provide simplified summaries. We have tried to maintain a high standard of readability since conceptual understanding is the key goal, and as the guideline is not intended to replace review articles or original papers, it seems correct to favour readability over detail.

### Euvolemia in hemodialysis patients: a potentially dangerous goal? [^1169Gq2Q]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients have high mortality rate and the leading cause of death is cardiovascular disease. Uremic cardiomyopathy differs from that due to conventional atherosclerosis, where cardiovascular changes result in ineffective circulation and lead to tissue ischemia. Modern dialysis has significant limitations with fluid management probably the most challenging. Current evidence suggests that both volume overload and aggressive fluid removal can induce circulatory stress and multi-organ injury. Furthermore, we do not have accurate volume assessment tools. As a result, targeting euvolemia might result in more harm than benefit with conventional hemodialysis therapy. Therefore, it might be time to consider a degree of permissive over-hydration until we have better tools to both determine ideal weight and improve current renal replacement therapy so that the process of achieving it is not so fraught with the current dangers.

### Prerenal acute kidney injury-still a relevant term in modern clinical practice? [^117BvjEb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The traditional taxonomy of acute kidney injury (AKI) has remained pervasive in clinical nephrology. While the terms 'prerenal', 'intrarenal' and 'postrenal' highlight the diverse pathophysiology underlying AKI, they also imply discrete disease pathways and de-emphasize the nature of AKI as an evolving clinical syndrome with multiple, often simultaneous and overlapping, causes. In a similar vein, prerenal AKI comprises a diverse spectrum of kidney disorders, albeit one that is often managed by using a standardized clinical algorithm. We contend that the term 'prerenal' is too vague to adequately convey our current understanding of hypoperfusion-related AKI and that it should thus be avoided in the clinical setting. Practice patterns among nephrologists indicate that AKI-related terminology plays a significant role in the approaches that clinicians take to patients that have this complex disease. Thus, it appears that precise terminology does impact the treatment that patients receive. We will outline differences in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions lying on the so-called prerenal disease spectrum to advocate caution when administering intravenous fluids to these clinically decompensated patients. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may, thus, avert clinical missteps such as fluid and vasopressor mismanagement in tenuous or critically ill patients.

### Fluid overload as a therapeutic target for the preservative management of chronic kidney disease [^114A4Lqn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is growing clinical evidence of adverse effects of fluid overload on kidney outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease who are not yet receiving kidney replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the patient populations most at risk for fluid overload, the pathophysiology associated with fluid overload, and finally treatment options.

Recent Findings

The severity of fluid overload is an independent risk factor for both an increased risk of rapidly declining kidney function and increased risk for the need of kidney replacement therapy. High venous pressure within the kidney secondarily causes a decrease in kidney perfusion, which in turn signals salt retention and the resulting increase in plasma volume completes a vicious cycle propagating ongoing kidney injury. Fluid overload has also been identified as a risk factor for the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. This increased risk in some studies has been identified as more important than hypertension in predicting both the increased risk of kidney disease progression and morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Once fluid status is accurately assessed, a combination of salt restriction and effective diuretic therapy is the first-line therapy to manage this complication. In those patients who require additional therapy, use of a V2 receptor antagonists can be considered. Finally, some patients may benefit from peritoneal dialysis to bring about volume removal even if they do not yet require dialysis for uremic complications.

Summary

Excess fluid or fluid overload appears to enhance chronic kidney disease progression and its treatment and resolution is a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### Self-management interventions for adult haemodialysis patients: a scoping review of randomized controlled trials [^114rtDp8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately eight million people, 0.1% of the world's population, are estimated to have kidney failure. Kidney failure, formerly named end-stage kidney disease, means that kidney function has declined so severely that renal replacement therapy is necessary to sustain life. Based on a global median prevalence of 397 per million people, approximately 3.18 million individuals worldwide are estimated to be undergoing chronic dialysis, the most commonly used form of renal replacement therapy. Haemodialysis, the most frequent form of dialysis, is a medical procedure that filters waste, toxins, excess fluids, and electrolytes from the blood by diverting it via a vascular access through a machine with a specialized filter, thereby partially replicating kidney function.

When starting dialysis, patients encounter new challenges, requiring to restructure their daily routines and acquire new skills. During conservative chronic kidney disease treatment without renal replacement therapy, patients must manage a comprehensive therapeutic regimen including diet and fluid restrictions. After transitioning to dialysis, they must manage additional aspects such as vascular access care and strict dialysis schedule adherence to prevent complications. Patients describe haemodialysis as a demanding treatment regimen, typically requiring three or more sessions per week or more, each lasting four to five hours. While essential for survival, this intensive schedule affects patients' daily lives including financial status, social roles and perceived quality of life and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Patients can experience side effects and symptoms such as fatigue (67–78%), bone and joint pain (70.9%), anxiety (28%) and/or sadness or depressive symptoms (30–49%).

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to hemodynamic monitoring, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer appropriate fluid therapy and vasopressors and/or inotropes as appropriate to optimize hemodynamic status.

### Fluid balance, intradialytic hypotension, and outcomes in critically ill patients undergoing renal replacement therapy: a cohort study [^113Pbv61]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our study provides supportive evidence for reduced mortality with a less positive fluid balance after critically ill patients commence RRT. A less positive fluid management strategy does not appear to influence RRT dependence at hospital discharge. Further multicentre cohort investigations, if confirming these findings, would support the design of a randomized trial of an aggressive vs. less aggressive approach to fluid removal in this population.

### Timing of initiation and discontinuation of renal replacement therapy in AKI: unanswered key questions [^111shZB1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) often require initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Currently, there is wide variation worldwide on the indications for and timing of initiation and discontinuation of RRT for AKI. Various parameters for metabolic, solute, and fluid control are generally used to guide the initiation and discontinuation of therapy; however, there are currently no standards in this field. Members of the recently established Acute Kidney Injury Network, representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI, participated in a 3-d conference in Vancouver in September 2006 to evaluate the available literature on this topic and draft consensus recommendations for research studies in this area. Key questions included the following: what are the indications for RRT, when should acute RRT support be initiated, and when should RRT be stopped? This report summarizes the available evidence and describes in detail the key questions, and some of the methods of answering them that will need to be addressed with the goal of standardizing the care of patients with AKI and improving outcomes.

Rationale for Clinical Practice Guidelines

Dialysis dose in thrice weekly dialysis schedules

We recommend eKt/V as the most clinically valid small-solute measure of dialysis dose, and recommend monitoring of dialysis dose on a monthly basis for the majority of centre-based dialysis patients. [1B]

We recommend targeting dialysis dose to achieve consistently a minimum eKt/V over 1.2 for thrice weekly patients, in the absence of a measured contribution from residual function. [1B]

We recommend a minimum of 12 hours per week for the majority of thrice weekly patients with minimal residual function. This may lead to higher than minimum eKt/V in smaller adult patients which is appropriate. [1B]

Rationale

Dialysis adequacy encompasses concepts including the clinical assessment of general wellbeing, fluid status, and control of laboratory parameters, along with quantification of the dose of dialysis provided.

The purpose of dialysis is to provide enough removal of uraemic solutes and fluid that accumulate in kidney failure to maintain health and quality of life: more specific goals include control of uraemic symptoms, maintenance of safe electrolyte levels, prevention of nutritional decline, and optimum long term mortality. Whilst the earlier items in this list are readily assessed over a short time scale, concepts of dialysis dose are required to define the amount of dialysis likely to achieve longer term goals of treatment.

Due to the simplicity and low cost of measurement of urea in blood, measurement of dialysis adequacy has historically focused on clearance of small solutes, represented by urea. Concentration of a range of uraemic toxins of larger size (e.g. β-2 microglobulin) is likely to be important, but their measurement is not commonly performed. Use of thrice weekly haemodialysis schedules emerged from the realisation during the early era of haemodialysis treatment that once or twice-weekly haemodialysis schedules in patients with minimal residual function was insufficient to control the symptoms and complications of severe uraemia.

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^115fjKWG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with ESRD on dialysis. Fluid overload contributes to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and increased mortality in this population. Conversely, excessive ultrafiltration can lead to intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, and a decline in residual renal function. Accurate fluid status assessment and careful ultrafiltration management are crucial for optimal care of patients on dialysis.

Volume overload is an excess of extracellular fluid beyond the body's homeostatic capacity which manifests as increased total body water leading to venous and pulmonary congestion. Traditionally, nephrologists have relied on clinical parameters such as blood pressure, physical examination findings, and changes in body weight to evaluate the patient's volume status. However, these methods have limitations and can often be misleading. Findings such as edema and pulmonary rales have poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting volume overload in dialysis patients. Chest X-ray, another commonly used tool, can only detect pulmonary edema when a significant degree of volume overload is already present. Even the use of dry weight, a fundamental concept in dialysis management, has its limitations. There is a need for more objective ways to assess volume status. This review focuses on emerging techniques that enable direct visualization of organ congestion or objective measurement of fluid status, complementing established methods like relative blood volume monitoring and biomarkers.

### Perioperative management for people with kidney failure receiving dialysis: a scoping review [^111Z9pkW]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

People with kidney failure receiving dialysis (CKD-G5D) are more likely to undergo surgery and experience poorer postoperative outcomes than those without kidney failure. In this scoping review, we aimed to systematically identify and summarize perioperative strategies, protocols, pathways, and interventions that have been studied or implemented for people with CKD-G5D.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Controlled Trials registry (inception to February 2020), in addition to an extensive grey literature search, for sources that reported on a perioperative strategy to guide management for people with CKD-G5D. We summarized the overall study characteristics and perioperative management strategies and identified evidence gaps based on surgery type and perioperative domain. Publication trends over time were assessed, stratified by surgery type and study design.

Results

We included 183 studies; the most common study design was a randomized controlled trial (27%), with 67% of publications focused on either kidney transplantation or dialysis vascular access. Transplant-related studies often focused on fluid and volume management strategies and risk stratification, whereas dialysis vascular access studies focused most often on imaging. The number of publications increased over time, across all surgery types, though driven by non-randomized study designs.

Conclusions

Despite many current gaps in perioperative research for patients with CKD-G5D, evidence generation supporting perioperative management is increasing, with recent growth driven primarily by non-randomized studies. Our review may inform organization of evidence-based strategies into perioperative care pathways where evidence is available while also highlighting gaps that future perioperative research can address.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^111LF6Fd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Body weight and fluid in CKD — Sodium restriction may slightly reduce body weight and total-body fluid in nondialysis CKD (low certainty evidence), while effects in dialysis remain uncertain. In hemodialysis, two randomized crossover trials compared intake of 60 to 80 mmol/d versus 180 to 200 mmol/d for 2 weeks and evaluated sodium restriction < 2 g/d for 4 weeks (with a 2-week washout), with both trials demonstrating a reduction in extracellular volume. In maintenance dialysis, two RCTs found no significant difference in body weight with salt restriction in PD or both HD and PD. In one randomized HD study, advice to restrict sodium (< 3 g/d) and fluid (< 1 L/d) decreased interdialytic fluid gain within the intervention group, but the control group did not change and the between-group difference was not significant.

### Care practices for patients with advanced kidney disease who forgo maintenance dialysis… [^117LKxw6]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings describe an all-or-nothing approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease in which initiation of dialysis served as a powerful default option with few perceived alternatives. Stronger efforts are needed to develop a more patient-centered approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease that is capable of proactively supporting those who do not wish to start dialysis. Maintenance dialysis is a form of life support for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. However, treatment with dialysis does not always have the intended effect of extending life or restoring health and quality of life for those with advanced CKD.

For some patients, the potential benefits of dialysis in terms of extending life and managing signs and symptoms of uremia may be outweighed by its potential harms, which include the substantial treatment burden and prospect of a highly medicalized lifestyle1–3 and risk of progressive loss of physical, social, and cognitive function. 4–7. Of the patients selected for medical record review, 437 were found to have received dialysis based on documentation in progress notes despite not being registered in United States Renal Data System or having a dialysis procedure code, and 640 had not started dialysis by the end of follow-up but were discussing and/or preparing for this possibility. In parallel, another 2 of us independently reviewed and openly coded abstracted passages for a random 20% sample of patients.

When clinicians did not view patients as candidates for dialysis, their language conveyed a high degree of certainty that dialysis would not be beneficial but would rather be potentially harmful. Clinician documentation also referenced patients' other serious illnesses and whether they were receiving life-prolonging treatment for these illnesses to support arguments about the limited value of dialysis, even for some patients whose prognosis could not be pinpointed. Although patients were generally accepting of clinicians' judgements of candidacy, family members did not always agree with this decision. When patients would not be starting dialysis, clinicians described a shortage of alternative treatments that could be offered to patients in place of dialysis. The decision not to start dialysis also tended to shut down other treatment options.

For example, interventions that might accelerate the loss of remaining kidney function, such as surgery and cardiac catheterization, were intentionally avoided.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^116ASomL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Administration Instructions

Renal Replacement Solution: Not for direct intravenous infusion.

The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of REGIOCIT solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient's fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.

The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient's fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.

Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.

1.2 Suggested Dosing

The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.

Table 1: REGIOCIT Solution Flow Rates to Achieve Citrate Dose of 3 mmol/L of Blood

Prior to initiating therapy, the patient's systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of REGIOCIT, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician's prescription when REGIOCIT is stopped.

Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). REGIOCIT solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.

### Heart failure events in randomized controlled trials for adults receiving maintenance dialysis: a meta-epidemiologic study [^116nTTZN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure versus volume overload

Volume overload and neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms involved in kidney failure can overlap with the symptoms, signs, haemodynamics, and cardiac biomarker profiles of heart failure making the distinction between the two challenging if not impossible. In these cases, the cause of the symptoms and signs of volume overload is a distinct entity to which treatment is often primarily directed, in addition to heart failure if is clinically apparent. Whether or not heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction is present may help guide clinical decision making including additional investigation (e.g. imaging, angiography) and goal directed medical therapy. These events are often relevant to clinical events adjudication committees of RCTs, where events may be considered as an 'events with heart failure' rather than a 'primary heart failure event'. An important concept that supports the differentiation of these competing diagnoses are that the symptoms and signs of heart failure may disappear once the underlying primary cause is treated, for example, symptoms and signs that mimic heart failure may resolve with dialysis if a patient may have missed one or more dialysis treatments or was non-adherent with salt/water restriction, which may also be the case in patients with heart failure without kidney disease. Unfortunately, rigorously distinguishing the two entities is complicated by the high prevalence of abnormal cardiac structure and function in patients with kidney failure. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed that attempt to distinguish those with heart failure that is or is not responsive to ultrafiltration but most patients with CKD, and presumably kidney failure, would meet echocardiographic criteria proposed by Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative resulting in an overdiagnosis of heart failure without providing substantial additional prognostic information or change in clinical management. Nevertheless, clinicians frequently make distinctions between heart failure and volume overload, and administrative data suggest that patients receiving dialysis with a hospitalization diagnosis of heart failure have substantially worse prognosis that those diagnosed with only fluid overload or pulmonary oedema. This implies that valuable clinical distinctions are being made, although the clinical reasoning underlying this is yet to be formalized into a data driven definition with validated diagnostic criteria that can be practically implemented in clinical trial settings.

### Intravenous fluids and risk of AKI among ICU patients… [^116k5eHM]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

There are important differences in the composition, volume, and rate of administration of fluids for these different uses. Numerous observational studies13–15 and a sequential period trial16 have suggested a signal of potential harm when saline administration was compared with administration of fluids with more physiologic chloride concentrations, although the kinds of adverse outcomes have varied. Some studies have shown increased AKI or dialysis, 13, 16 whereas other reports have shown increased hospital mortality without an effect on AKI. 14 This heterogeneity of effect is important because it demonstrates 2 essential aspects about toxicity — that toxicity is dose dependent and that the manifestation of toxicity depends on the susceptibility of the population exposed. It is unlikely that this amount of fluid volume could have demonstrated a plausible hazard, and not in the study population that was at low risk for AKI or other adverse effects.

Third, if the trial had been designed to test the efficacy of fluids on renal function, then the authors would have had to measure renal function or injury in a more granular fashion, perhaps including biomarkers or imaging studies. Prior studies in animals18 or healthy volunteers19 have shown important effects of fluids on the kidney. If the investigators had used the techniques used by Chowdhury et al, 19 then they would most likely have demonstrated similar changes in renal blood flow and function, but these do not necessarily lead to an increase in moderate-severe AKI, as measured by changes in serum creatinine. In the healthy kidney, substantial functional reserve must be exhausted before serum creatinine increases.

This fundamental premise that large pragmatic studies can be used to assess the effectiveness of fluids on outcomes such as AKI, requirement for dialysis, and mortality should be carefully considered when the intervention is not being used specifically for these purposes. Drugs such as 0. 9% saline or other electrolyte solutions might result in differences in these outcomes, but it will be as a result of differences in toxicity, not efficacy, and studies should be designed accordingly. In the meantime, the results of the trial by Young et al provide reassurance that neither 0. 9% saline nor a low-chloride electrolyte solution appears to be particularly hazardous when the total dose used in patients at low to moderate risk is about 2 L. This is an important contribution to the care of patients in the ICU.

However, the large body of "circumstantial" evidence that points to a harm signal for saline — with scant, if any, evidence of comparative benefit — should behoove intensivists and other clinicians to proceed with caution when ordering intravenous fluids.

### Failing kidneys: renal replacement therapies in the ICU [^115rN867]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Which modality is best?

RRT manages fluid balance and solute clearance in the setting of AKI through ultrafiltration, convection, and diffusion. Ultrafiltration refers to the movement and removal of plasma water. Convection (hemofiltration) is a form of solute clearance that relies on the movement of water and its dissolved solutes through the semipermeable membrane dragging solutes along. Diffusion (dialysis) relies on the concentration gradient between the blood and the dialysate to remove solute. In diffusion, clearance is inversely proportional to the size of the molecule. Convection more effectively removes medium to large-sized molecules from the blood compared with diffusion.

There are several modes in which RRT can be delivered to critically ill patients. Most often used are intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT). Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has also been used in the ICU population but is mainly used in limited resource centers or in the pediatric population. The ideal modality should be based on patient parameters including hemodynamics and volume status, metabolic derangements, overall goals of RRT, and local expertise and resources.

CRRT has become the predominant mode within ICUs in the USA. The main rationale for this is CRRT occurs at a lower rate and reduces osmotic shifts decreasing the risk of hemodynamic instability and intradialytic hypotension in critically ill patients. The adoption of CRRT has been facilitated with advances in technology, simplifying modern machines, and educating and incorporating bedside ICU nursing and intensivists to provide therapies in the critical care unit. One major disadvantage of CRRT is that the patient remains connected to the circuit for a prolonged period of time. There are several modes of CRRT including continuous venovenous hemofiltration using convection, continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) using diffusion, and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration using both diffuse and convective modes. These are further described in table 3.

Timing of initiation

Early CRRT initiation may not improve outcomes, and the definition of "early" varies between studies. Therefore, clinical judgement guides CRRT initiation. We aim to prevent or rapidly treat life-threatening derangements in fluid status, electrolytes, and/or acid–base balance and to meet metabolic and fluid needs that residual kidney function cannot address.

### Does acute kidney injury alerting improve patient outcomes? [^116XrDKK]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic alerts (e-alerts) for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) have been implemented into a variety of different Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems worldwide in order to improve recognition and encourage early appropriate management of AKI. We were interested in the impact on patient safety, specialist referral and clinical management.

Methods

All patients admitted to our institution with AKI were included in the study. We studied AKI progression, dialysis dependency, length of hospital stay, emergency readmission, ICU readmission, and death, before and after the introduction of electronic alerts. The impact on prescription of high risk drugs, fluid administration, and referral to renal services was also analysed.

Results

After the introduction of the e-alert, progression to higher AKI stage, emergency readmission to hospital and death during admission were significantly reduced. More prescriptions were stopped for drugs that adversely affect renal function in AKI and there was a significant increase in the ICU admissions and in the number of patients having dialysis, especially in earlier stages. Longer term mortality, renal referrals, and fluid alteration did not change significantly after the AKI e-alert introduction.

Conclusions

AKI e-alerts can improve clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients.

### The future of critical care: renal support in 2027 [^116vdB61]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since its inception four decades ago, both the clinical and technologic aspects of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) have evolved substantially. Devices now specifically designed for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury are widely available and the clinical challenges associated with treating this complex patient population continue to be addressed. However, several important questions remain unanswered, leaving doubts in the minds of many clinicians about therapy prescription/delivery and patient management. Specifically, questions surrounding therapy dosing, timing of initiation and termination, fluid management, anticoagulation, drug dosing, and data analytics may lead to inconsistent delivery of CRRT and even reluctance to prescribe it. In this review, we discuss current limitations of CRRT and potential solutions over the next decade from both a patient management and a technology perspective. We also address the issue of sustainability for CRRT and related therapies beyond 2027 and raise several points for consideration.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114oJDPc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Taken together these studies suggest equivalent mortality and modest improvement in some dialysis-related conditions, offset by increased treatment burden and possible harms to vascular access and residual function. Whilst there is no overall advantage for the average patient these studies do suggest specific groups who would be expected to benefit. For example, adequacy targets could certainly be achieved in those still unable to, despite a reasonably long thrice weekly schedule. Similarly, patients failing to achieve fluid control are likely to benefit from an increase in dialysis frequency - this might include those with resistant hypertension, intra-dialytic hypotension, and those with weekend admissions to hospital. The latter group are the obvious contributors to the excess mortality of the two-day dialysis gap, and may have the most to gain from an increase in dialysis frequency. The augmentation of dialysis in these settings should be aimed at achieving a specific purpose, and it is likely that a fourth session per week would be sufficient in many cases.

In conclusion, augmented schedules offer no clear advantage for the majority of patients, but should be considered as a treatment option for those patients whose adequacy or fluid control targets are not met with a standard schedule. A modestly augmented schedule would be sufficient in the majority of these patients.

Guideline 2.2 - Incremental schedules

We suggest that lower haemodialysis dose targets may be optimal in patients with significant residual renal function. [2D]

We recommend that residual renal function should be quantified intermittently in patients on incremental dialysis schedules. [1D]

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^115Y3xdJ]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Correction of intravascular hypovolemia is a key component of the prevention and management of acute kidney injury (AKI), but excessive fluid administration is associated with poor outcomes, including the development and progression of AKI. There is growing evidence that fluid administration should be individualized and take into account patient characteristics, nature of the acute illness and trajectories, and risks and benefits of fluids. Existing data support the preferential use of buffered solutions for fluid resuscitation of patients at risk of AKI who do not have hypochloremia. There is a limited role for albumin, and starches should be avoided. Fluids should only be administered until intravascular hypovolemia has been corrected and euvolemia has been achieved using the minimum amount of fluid required to achieve and maintain euvolemia. Oliguria alone should not be viewed as a trigger for fluid administration. If fluid overload occurs, fluid therapy needs to be discontinued, and fluid removal using diuretic agents or extracorporeal therapies should be considered.

### Hemodialysis time and Kt / V: less may Be better [^111df53y]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines focus on conventional dialysis defined as 3–5 hours, three times per week, and suggest that longer or more frequent dialysis be considered. This paper presents the case for considering that shorter or less frequent dialysis should also be considered. More frequent and/or longer dialysis facilitates control of fluid overload, blood pressure, and phosphate levels. These benefits will require time to translate into probable hard outcome improvement. Patients are unlikely to participate in productive or pleasurable activities while undergoing dialysis in center or traveling to treatment. So any increase in dialysis time or frequency, during awake hours, will result in an immediate and quantifiable reduction in quality of life. Conventional measures of dialysis adequacy consider only urea clearance. This poorly reflects middle molecule clearance, renal function, and management of fluid and phosphate overload, all of which have a greater impact on outcome than urea clearance. Fluid, phosphate, and uremic toxin overload may be better and less invasively controlled by continuous means such as dietary modification, binders, and preserving renal function. Bioimpedance, blood volume monitoring, and lung ultrasound provide means for improved control of fluid homeostasis. The probability of renal function recovery or preservation is increased by avoiding dehydration. An ideal strategy would be to preserve renal function and employ as little dialysis as possible (if it cannot be avoided altogether). Fluid overload, blood pressure, uremic toxin, and phosphate levels would be monitored and controlled using any means available, preferably by less invasive means than dialysis. Kt/V is useful in controlling the prescribed dose of dialysis, but the achievement of a universal target should not be an end in itself.

### Volume management in continuous renal replacement therapy [^113eN7NN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Volume management is an integral component of the care of critically ill patients to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. The dynamic nature of critical illness often necessitates volume resuscitation and contributes to fluid overload particularly in the presence of altered renal function. Diuretics are commonly used as an initial therapy to increase urine output; however they have limited effectiveness due to underlying acute kidney injury and other factors contributing to diuretic resistance. Continuous renal replacement techniques (CRRT) are often required for volume management. In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate assessment of fluid status, an adequate comprehension of the principles of fluid management with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals. Complications related to excessive ultrafiltration can occur and have serious consequences. A careful monitoring of fluid balance is therefore essential for all patients. This review provides an overview of the appropriate assessment and management of volume status in critically ill patients and its management with CRRT to optimize organ function and prevent complications of fluid overload.

### Selection of dialysate and replacement fluids and management of electrolyte and acid-base disturbances [^113en68J]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Often, too little consideration is given to the fluids used in all forms of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, errors in fluid prescription, delivery, or creation can be rapidly fatal; in addition, fluid associated expenses can be the overriding cost in continuous renal replacement therapies. While a standard solution is frequently acceptable in most clinical circumstances, specific electrolyte and acid-base disturbances may direct changes in fluid delivery and composition. Decisions regarding fluids, whether dialysate versus replacement, including generation and composition of therapy are discussed in this review.

### Water and dialysis fluid purity for contemporary hemodialysis [^115rMisY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purity of water and dialysis fluids is of utmost importance in ensuring the safe and effective administration of hemodialysis treatment to patients with chronic kidney disease. It is crucial to enforce compliance with international standards for dialysis water and fluids, as this is mandatory in reducing chemical hazards, mitigating the adverse effects of bioincompatibility resulting from contaminated water and ultimately enhancing long-term patient outcomes.

Standards and Risks

Within this comprehensive review, we highlight the presence of water contaminants and thoroughly assess the existing international standards for dialysis water and fluids, spanning from pure to ultrapure. Additionally, we delve into the fundamental components of water purification and present a comprehensive range of water treatment options, encompassing pre-treatment, primary treatment (reverse osmosis), and tertiary water treatment. Furthermore, we outline recommended monitoring and maintenance procedures, ensuring the consistent delivery of high-quality water and dialysis fluids at the point of care. WATER PURIFICATION AND MONITORING SUSTAINABILITY AND FUTURE CHALLENGES: Importantly, we raise concerns regarding the sustainability and conservation of water resources in hemodialysis treatment. It is imperative that these concerns be addressed in the future to avert the potential shortage of this essential resource.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the contemporary landscape of hemodialysis conditions has engendered an urgent necessity for advanced water treatment systems and optimized delivery of dialysis fluids. This review serves as a comprehensive update on the latest technological advancements aimed at meeting these critical demands. Dialysis water and fluids must adhere to increasingly stringent purity constraints, encompassing both biochemical and microbiological perspectives.

### We restrict CRRT to only the most hemodynamically unstable patients [^111YbmUh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

From the initial version of an extended renal replacement therapy, the initiative to provide safer, more efficient means for detoxification and volume removal in comparison with intermittent renal replacement therapies (IRRT) has been evaluated. As a result, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for acute kidney injury recommend the preferential use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who suffer from intracranial hypertension. The choice of dialysis modality is also influenced by other factors including clinical expertise, and the availability of each treatment option in individual medical centers. In the scientific community, there is an ongoing debate regarding the choice of dialysis modality. On one side, the inability of recent studies to demonstrate any mortality or renal recovery benefit for CRRT, the need for patient immobilization, and prohibitive additional costs impede widespread adoption of the method. On the other side, the physiological advantages of CRRT in detoxification and volume removal and the identified flaws related to the comparative literature regarding CRRT and IRRT fuel this debate. Fluid overload is a recognized and yet clinically underappreciated factor that increases morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Continuous renal replacement therapy has a distinct advantage over IRRT in achieving euvolemia and thus the potential for improving outcomes in all patients in the ICU setting in which extensive fluid administration is often obligatory. With this in mind, perhaps CRRT should not be restricted to only those patients in whom their hemodynamic status requires it. This article reviews the current literature and the myths that may influence the selection of one mode of therapy over the other among patients requiring renal replacement therapy in the ICU.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^115vivoA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — fluid management and interdialytic weight targets emphasize that "dietary sodium should be restricted and use of a high dialysate sodium concentration and sodium profiling should be avoided"; during fluid reduction, "net fluid losses ideally should not exceed 1 to 2 kg/wk" and "weight gain between dialyses should not exceed 1 kg during the week and 1.5 to 2 kg during the weekend". During dry weight probing, "in 90% of patients, ECF volume becomes normal within a few weeks, but the elevated blood pressure continues to decrease for another 8 months or longer", reflecting a "lag phenomenon", and the figure notes "The secondary decrease in blood pressure seen at 5 months… was observed in all 8 patients studied". As patients lose excess fluid and their hypertension improves, "therapy with antihypertensive medications can be systematically tapered or discontinued".

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162QQi8]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

As with all retrospective observational studies, the data presented must be interpreted in the context of its limitations. There is likely to be significant heterogeneity in the patient case mix, illness severity and overall management. Different permutations of the rate of fluid administered, the type and volume of fluid, method of haemodynamic assessment, threshold for definition of responsiveness, and the time of assessment of fluid challenge does not allow any strong conclusions to be made. Furthermore, we have not accounted for the different methods of haemodynamic monitoring used. However, we highlight the heterogeneity in practice of this commonly applied technique and the need for further investigation to elucidate the clinical effect of the different aspects of a fluid challenge.
