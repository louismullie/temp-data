## Question

If a patient has been bleeding continuously for 20 consecutive days, what is the next step?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the immediate next step should be for a patient with 20 days of continuous vaginal bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hemodynamic stability and triage to rule out an acute gynecologic emergency. Then, I should verify pregnancy status before attributing symptoms to gynecologic AUB. Next, I will structure the history and exam using FIGO System 1 to characterize the bleeding pattern, followed by targeted labs and first-line imaging with transvaginal ultrasound. After that, I need to decide when endometrial sampling is indicated, classify causes using FIGO System 2, and align management accordingly, including medical therapy, structural interventions, coagulopathy care, and iron repletion. Finally, I will synthesize the immediate next step for a stable, nonpregnant patient while preserving contingencies for instability or pregnancy.

> Let me first confirm stabilization and triage, because if the patient is hemodynamically unstable this becomes acute abnormal uterine bleeding that requires emergency management, including assessment of vitals and orthostatics, rapid volume resuscitation, and consideration of IV conjugated equine estrogen with urgent admission if heavy bleeding persists, as recommended by ACOG for acute AUB and orthostatic assessment in adolescents with HMB, and as emphasized in ED-focused reviews that prioritize stability before diagnostics [^111Jc1ER] [^1134TBhh] [^112gEyo9].

> Wait, let me verify the sequencing around pregnancy testing, because I initially thought "the first step is always a pregnancy test", but hold on, I should not jump to conclusions when the patient is unstable; stabilization precedes diagnostics, and then in any reproductive-aged patient with bleeding, an immediate urine or serum hCG is mandatory before imaging or hormonal therapy, since FDA labeling for combined oral contraceptives and multiple guidelines require ruling out pregnancy or malignancy when bleeding is persistent or unexplained, and a positive test redirects to obstetric pathways such as miscarriage or ectopic rather than AUB [^114cUvjW] [^117WcdKk] [^114L2FBU] [^1133YwBK].

> Next, I should review the structured history using FIGO System 1 to define frequency, duration, regularity, and flow volume, and to elicit intermenstrual bleeding, contraceptive use, anticoagulants, and risk factors for malignancy, because this frames downstream testing and helps distinguish ovulatory from anovulatory patterns and potential iatrogenic causes, with FIGO guidance noting the link between HMB and iron deficiency and the value of recognizing IMB as a clue to focal lesions like polyps [^115VTs9D] [^114p2x9Y].

> I will now examine the patient with attention to general appearance and pallor, followed by speculum to localize bleeding and visualize cervical or vaginal lesions, and bimanual examination to assess uterine size, tenderness, and adnexal masses, while screening for signs of coagulopathy if suspected, consistent with ACOG's approach to acute heavy bleeding and common emergency practice patterns in nonpregnant vaginal bleeding [^1134TBhh] [^1133YwBK].

> I need to ensure a focused laboratory panel is obtained in stable patients, including CBC for anemia, a pregnancy test if not already done, ferritin to detect iron deficiency given the high prevalence with HMB, TSH when clinically indicated, and screening for bleeding disorders when history suggests, as FIGO emphasizes HMB's contribution to iron deficiency and ACOG recommends evaluation for coagulopathy in appropriate adolescents and young adults [^115VTs9D] [^1134TBhh].

> Next, I should confirm first-line imaging with transvaginal ultrasound, adding transabdominal or Doppler when needed, because ACR Appropriateness Criteria identify ultrasound as the initial imaging of choice for abnormal uterine bleeding and recommend sonohysterography when TVUS is inconclusive, while in postmenopausal patients the combination of TVUS and endometrial assessment guides biopsy thresholds in line with NAMS guidance [^111qcW9y].

> Hold on, I should verify when to proceed to endometrial sampling, because postmenopausal bleeding warrants biopsy regardless of imaging, and in premenopausal patients endometrial sampling is indicated with age 45 or older, risk factors for unopposed estrogen, failed medical therapy, persistent bleeding, or suspicious ultrasound features, which aligns with menopause and endocrine guidelines and risk-based approaches to exclude hyperplasia and cancer [^notfound].

> Let me consider classification next, since applying FIGO System 2 (PALM-COEIN) helps align etiology and management, distinguishing structural causes such as polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, and malignancy from nonstructural causes including coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial disorders, and iatrogenic, with recognition that multiple contributors can coexist and that anticoagulants are categorized under iatrogenic in the 2018 revisions [^111bV2uk] [^113eRxNq] [^111FKHQz].

> I should double-check medical therapy for stable patients without emergent indications, where ACOG recommends initial management with combined hormonal contraceptives using multidose regimens, oral progestins in cyclic or continuous schedules, tranexamic acid for heavy bleeding, and adjunctive NSAIDs as appropriate, with Cochrane data supporting progestogen-based strategies for anovulatory bleeding, and care individualized to contraindications and patient preferences [^111Jc1ER] [^113X7SoY].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on hormonal contraception; I need to counsel that irregular bleeding is common in the first three months, rule out pregnancy or pathology first, and then consider formulation adjustments including temporary hormone-free intervals for continuous regimens or, if necessary, switching to a higher estrogen dose while balancing thrombosis risk, as outlined in FDA labeling and AAFP guidance [^114cUvjW] [^117WcdKk] [^114L2FBU] [^115yCMEt].

> If a structural lesion is identified, I should verify targeted interventions: hysteroscopic polypectomy for polyps, medical therapy or procedural options for fibroids and adenomyosis with consideration of LNG-IUS, and prompt oncology referral for malignancy, while escalating to endometrial ablation or hysterectomy for refractory symptoms in women who have completed childbearing, following surgical guidelines that weigh symptom burden and preferences [^116h5AGe] [^116gUMpY] [^111vnwe2].

> I need to check for iatrogenic or systemic contributors such as anticoagulants, in which case coordination with hematology to adjust therapy and employ hemostatic agents is appropriate, with consensus guidance for bleeding disorders and observational data noting increased menstrual bleeding with factor Xa inhibitors informing individualized management plans [^112nicKH] [^117Nco9N] [^111LWGs6].

> Let me not forget iron deficiency management, because prolonged or heavy bleeding commonly causes iron deficiency and anemia; I should screen with ferritin and treat deficiency, rechecking hemoglobin after a few weeks to document recovery while addressing the bleeding source, consistent with FIGO's emphasis on the HMB–iron deficiency link [^115VTs9D].

> Next, I should review follow-up and escalation, reassessing bleeding control and anemia within 4 to 8 weeks, and if medical therapy fails after an adequate trial, consider LNG-IUS, endometrial ablation if childbearing is complete, or hysterectomy as definitive therapy, using shared decision-making per surgical guidelines that compare uterus-preserving options with hysterectomy for quality of life outcomes [^116Kc3vU] [^116h5AGe].

> In summary, for a stable, nonpregnant patient with 20 days of continuous bleeding, the immediate next step is to obtain a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate for structural causes while initiating appropriate medical therapy such as combined hormonal contraceptives or progestins after excluding pregnancy and ensuring hemodynamic stability, with emergent pathways for instability or positive pregnancy testing guiding alternative management, which is consistent with ACR imaging recommendations, ACOG acute AUB management, and FDA mandates to rule out pregnancy or malignancy in persistent abnormal bleeding [^111qcW9y] [^111Jc1ER] [^114cUvjW] [^117WcdKk] [^114L2FBU].

---

For a patient with 20 days of continuous vaginal bleeding, **immediately assess hemodynamic stability** [^1134TBhh] and **rule out pregnancy** [^1133YwBK]. If unstable, initiate resuscitation and **urgent gynecologic consultation**. If stable, perform a focused history and exam [^114p2x9Y]; order CBC, TSH, and coagulation studies; and obtain a **transvaginal ultrasound** [^111qcW9y] to evaluate for structural causes. Management depends on findings: treat acute bleeding with high-dose estrogen or combined oral contraceptives, and consider **endometrial sampling** for patients age ≥ 45, those with risk factors, or with persistent bleeding [^111Jc1ER]. Address anemia and arrange close follow-up.

---

## Immediate assessment and stabilization

Immediate assessment and stabilization should include evaluating **hemodynamic stability** by checking vital signs, orthostatics, and signs of shock [^1134TBhh]. Unstable patients need immediate resuscitation and urgent gynecologic consultation [^112gEyo9]. A **pregnancy test** should be obtained in all reproductive-age patients to rule out pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy [^1133YwBK].

---

## Focused history and physical examination

### History

The focused history should characterize the **bleeding pattern** — onset, duration, volume, clots, and associated symptoms (pain, fever, or discharge) — and review menstrual history for cycle regularity, duration, and flow. It should also elicit medical conditions, including coagulopathies, thyroid disorders, PCOS, endometrial hyperplasia, or malignancy; document medication use such as anticoagulants, hormonal contraception, or hormone therapy; and assess family history for bleeding disorders and malignancy [^114p2x9Y].

---

### Physical examination

The physical examination should include a **general exam** to assess for pallor, bruising, petechiae, and signs of systemic illness, and a **pelvic exam** to evaluate for cervical lesions, polyps, masses, uterine enlargement, adnexal masses, and infection [^1133YwBK].

---

## Initial laboratory investigations

- **CBC**: Evaluate hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets.

- **TSH**: Screen for thyroid dysfunction.

- **Coagulation studies**: PT, aPTT, INR, fibrinogen, von Willebrand panel if indicated.

- **Additional tests**: Liver function, renal function, prolactin, androgens as indicated.

---

## Imaging studies

Transvaginal ultrasound is first-line for assessing endometrial thickness, polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis, and malignancy [^111qcW9y]. Use **sonohysterography** for further evaluation of intrauterine pathology when needed [^111qcW9y]. MRI is reserved for complex cases or suspected adenomyosis.

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

- **High-dose estrogen**: IV conjugated estrogen or high-dose combined oral contraceptives for acute bleeding [^111Jc1ER].

- **Progestins**: Medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethindrone acetate for anovulatory bleeding [^113X7SoY].

- **Tranexamic acid**: Antifibrinolytic for heavy menstrual bleeding [^111Jc1ER].

- **Hormonal contraception**: Combined oral contraceptives or levonorgestrel IUD for long-term control [^116wbyeE].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management includes **endometrial ablation** for refractory bleeding in selected patients and hysterectomy as the definitive treatment for severe refractory bleeding or malignancy. Myomectomy or polypectomy is used for symptomatic fibroids or polyps [^116Kc3vU].

---

## Indications for endometrial sampling

- **Age ≥ 45 years**: Persistent bleeding.

- **Age < 45 years**: Risk factors (obesity, PCOS, chronic anovulation, family history of malignancy).

- **Persistent bleeding**: Despite medical therapy.

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Follow-up should reassess bleeding, anemia, and treatment response. Patient education should explain the diagnosis, treatment options, and when to seek care. Anemia management should include **iron supplementation** or transfusion as needed [^115VTs9D].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Assess hemodynamic stability and rule out pregnancy |
| 2 | Focused history and physical examination |
| 3 | Initial laboratory investigations (CBC, TSH, coagulation studies) |
| 4 | Transvaginal ultrasound imaging |
| 5 | Medical management (high-dose estrogen, progestins, tranexamic acid) |
| 6 | Endometrial sampling if indicated |
| 7 | Surgical management if refractory |
| 8 | Follow-up and patient education |

---

The next step for a patient with 20 days of continuous vaginal bleeding is to **first assess stability and rule out pregnancy**, then proceed with focused evaluation, labs, and imaging to guide targeted medical or surgical management.

### Abnormal vaginal bleeding in the nonpregnant patient [^112gEyo9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a common complaint in most emergency departments. Abnormal vaginal bleeding causes many patients a great deal of stress and inconvenience. Although treatment of most cases is straightforward, vaginal bleeding can herald serious occult disease, including cancer, coagulopathy, and systemic illness. Vaginal bleeding can also be the initial complaint in patients suffering sexual abuse or trauma. From an emergency medicine perspective, vaginal bleeding should be approached in terms of whether the patient is stable or not. Subsequent evaluation should exclude or treat problems that might cause the patient's condition to deteriorate. The emergency physician is able to provide initial therapy for most causes of vaginal bleeding, and in most cases, the patient must be referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation and treatment.

### Enskyce [^114cUvjW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, as with all instances of irregular vaginal bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered. For undiagnosed persistent or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology is excluded, time or a change to another formulation may resolve the issue. Switching to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content can minimize menstrual irregularity but should be done only if necessary, as it may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**: If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Risk assessment for endometrial cancer in women with abnormal vaginal bleeding: Results from the prospective IETA-1 cohort study [^111Xme4Y]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

This diagnostic cohort study is part of the International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA)‐1 prospective observational multicenter study, which consecutively recruited premenopausal and postmenopausal women presenting with abnormal vaginal bleeding for transvaginal ultrasound examination between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015. The recruitment occurred in 12 centers specialized in gynecologic ultrasound in nine European countries, including secondary and tertiary centers. The study was approved by the Leuven Ethics Committee EC Research (S52897/ML7087) on April 19, 2010, and by the ethics committees of all participating centers.

The inclusion criterion was abnormal, not pregnancy‐related, uterine bleeding (e.g. postmenopausal bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, bleeding during continuous combined estrogen‐gestagen therapy, or abnormal bleeding during sequential estrogen‐gestagen therapy). Exclusion criteria were failure to perform an ultrasound examination, no initial endometrial thickness measurement result, missing histology combined with follow-up of less than 1 year, pregnancy‐related bleeding, or bleeding not originating in the uterus, such as vaginal or cervical cancer.

All patients provided informed consent. Transvaginal unenhanced ultrasonography was performed using the IETA examination technique. The endometrial thickness was measured in the sagittal plane, including both endometrial layers. If the endometrium could not be seen clearly in its entirety, it was reported as "non‐measurable".

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: Hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116Kc3vU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). High credibility.

To develop recommendations for selecting treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), clinical practice guidelines were formulated using data from randomized clinical trials. These trials compared bleeding, quality of life, pain, sexual health, satisfaction, the need for subsequent surgery, and adverse events between hysterectomy and less-invasive treatment options.

The study focused on women with AUB, mainly due to ovulatory disorders and endometrial causes. Based on a systematic review, clinical practice guidelines were developed, and the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were determined using the Grades for Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.

This paper identified a limited number of high-quality studies that directly compared uterus-preserving treatments, such as endometrial ablation, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, and systemically administered medications, with hysterectomy. The evidence from these randomized clinical trials highlighted that there are trade-offs between hysterectomy and uterus-preserving treatments in terms of efficacy and adverse events.

Selecting an appropriate treatment for AUB involves identifying a woman's most burdensome symptoms and incorporating her values and preferences. This process is crucial when weighing the relative benefits and harms of hysterectomy versus other treatment options.

### Beyond menstrual hygiene: Addressing vaginal bleeding throughout the life course in low and middle-income countries [^111uwH1R]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Although minimal prevalence data exist across low and middle-income countries (LMICs), there are likely significant numbers of women who experience vaginal bleeding related to reproductive health conditions, such as fibroids or endometriosis. One study from Nigeria suggested that 29% of women of reproductive age have fibroids. Both conditions can cause extremely heavy, irregular bleeding along with discomfort. A cross-sectional internet study among 21,476 women in eight high and middle-income countries found that 33% of women with fibroids experienced bleeding between periods compared to 14% of women without fibroids. Significantly greater proportions of women with fibroids reported heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, and more frequent and irregular menses compared with their counterparts. In Senegal and Mali, disability-adjusted life years are estimated for uterine fibroids at 52 and 51 per 100,000, respectively. The causes of both uterine fibroids and endometriosis remain unknown.

As life expectancies increase, women across LMICs are more likely to experience uterine or cervical cancers, both of which cause vaginal bleeding. Cervical cancer, caused by certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), is the most common form of cancer currently reported among women in sub-Saharan Africa, with 34,000 out of 100,000 diagnosed each year. Limited screening suggests underdiagnoses. HPV is spread through vaginal, anal, and oral sex, meaning that previous life events influence risk.

These issues suggest significant implications for the girls, women, and caregivers who may struggle to manage illness-related challenges.

### CIRSE standards of practice on gynaecological and obstetric haemorrhage [^115eEXif]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Genital bleeding is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women, particularly during childbearing years. Severe postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) plays a prominent role as a cause of maternal death, accounting for 25% of maternal deaths worldwide. In developed countries, it is estimated that there are 9–17 maternal deaths related to PPH per every 100,000 deliveries compared to 400 deaths per 100,000 deliveries worldwide [World Health Organization, UNICEF, World Bank, and United Nations Population Fund; Khan et al.].

PPH is divided into primary haemorrhage, indicating excessive bleeding from the genital tract of > 500 mL in the first 24 hours following a vaginal delivery, and secondary haemorrhage, which occurs after the first 24 hours up to 6 weeks after birth [Lopera et al; Briley et al; Gonsalves and Belli].

The most common causes of primary PPH include uterine atony, when the normal myometrium fails to contract after delivery of the placenta, genital tract injuries such as perineal or vaginal lacerations, uterine rupture or inversion, placental implantation abnormalities, pseudo-aneurysms, and congenital or acquired coagulation disorders [Gonsalves and Belli].

Secondary PPH is mainly related to retained products of gestation or infection. Other conditions resulting in significant urogenital haemorrhage include gynaecological cancers, post-operative bleeding, trauma, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), such as congenital and acquired AVMs, and arteriovenous (AV) fistulas [Soyer et al; Mihmanli et al; O'Brien et al; Katz et al; Josephs].

### Risk factors for retained placenta [^1157XK5z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Retained placenta complicates 2–3% of vaginal deliveries and is a known cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Treatment includes manual or operative placental extraction, potentially increasing risks of hemorrhage, infections, and prolonged hospital stays. We sought to evaluate risk factors for retained placenta, defined as more than 30 minutes between the delivery of the fetus and placenta, in a large US obstetrical cohort.

- **Study design**: We included singleton, vaginal deliveries ≥ 24 weeks (n = 91,291) from the Consortium of Safe Labor from 12 US institutions (2002–2008). Multivariable logistic regression analyses estimated the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for potential risk factors for retained placenta stratified by parity, adjusting for relevant confounding factors. Characteristics such as stillbirth, maternal age, race, and admission body mass index were examined.

- **Results**: Retained placenta complicated 1047 vaginal deliveries (1.12%). Regardless of parity, significant predictors of retained placenta included stillbirth (nulliparous adjusted OR, 5.67; 95% CI, 3.10–10.37; multiparous adjusted OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.08–9.94), maternal age ≥ 30 years, delivery at 24 0/7 to 27 6/7 compared with 34 weeks or later, and delivery in a teaching hospital. In nulliparous women, additional risk factors were identified: longer first- or second-stage labor duration, whereas non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic white race was found to be protective. Body mass index was not associated with an increased risk.

- **Conclusion**: Multiple risk factors fo.

### Risk assessment of endometrial cancer and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia in women with abnormal bleeding and implications for clinical management algorithms [^115CgKPw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Most endometrial cancer cases are preceded by abnormal uterine bleeding, offering a potential opportunity for early detection and cure of endometrial cancer. Although clinical guidelines exist for the diagnostic workup of abnormal uterine bleeding, consensus is lacking regarding the optimal management for women with abnormal bleeding to diagnose endometrial cancer.

- **Objective**: We report the baseline data from a prospective clinical cohort study of women referred for endometrial evaluation at the Mayo Clinic, designed to evaluate risk stratification in women at increased risk for endometrial cancer. Here, we introduce a risk-based approach to evaluate diagnostic tests and clinical management algorithms in a population of women with abnormal bleeding undergoing endometrial evaluation at the Mayo Clinic.

- **Study design**: A total of 1163 women aged ≥ 45 years were enrolled from February 2013 to May 2019. We evaluated baseline absolute risks and 95% confidence intervals of endometrial cancer and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia according to clinical algorithms for the diagnostic workup of women with postmenopausal bleeding. This included assessment of initial versus rebleeding episodes and endometrial thickness measured through transvaginal ultrasound. We also evaluated risks among women with postmenopausal bleeding according to baseline age.

The study assessed the clinical efficiency of each strategy by estimating…

### Vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy [^112sJX2j]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). High credibility.

Bleeding in late-term pregnancy can present as an innocuous start to parturition or a catastrophic maternal-fetal hemorrhage masked by the physiological adaptations of pregnancy. The emergency management of late-term bleeding can be challenging, especially when providing stabilizing care in a limited-resource environment. Early recognition of life-threatening vaginal bleeding, potential causes, and emergency management of maternal-fetal distress is reviewed.

- **Maternal resuscitation**: Maternal resuscitation with balanced versus targeted blood products replacement is presented for low-resource versus high-resource environments.
- **Emergency department readiness**: Emergency department readiness for such a patient, in combination with appropriate consultation or transfer, is essential to the effective management of late-term vaginal bleeding.

### Late pregnancy bleeding [^114Szbup]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Effective management of vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy requires recognition of potentially serious conditions, including placenta previa, placental abruption, and vasa previa. Placenta previa is commonly diagnosed on routine ultrasonography before 20 weeks' gestation, but it ultimately resolves in nearly 90 percent of patients. Women who have asymptomatic previa can continue normal activities, with repeat ultrasonographic evaluation at 28 weeks. Persistent previa in the third trimester mandates pelvic rest and hospitalization if significant bleeding occurs. Placental abruption is the most common cause of serious vaginal bleeding, occurring in 1 percent of pregnancies. Management of abruption may require rapid operative delivery to prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality. Vasa previa is rare but can result in fetal exsanguination with rupture of membranes. Significant vaginal bleeding from any cause is managed with rapid assessment of maternal and fetal status, fluid resuscitation, replacement of blood products when necessary, and an appropriately timed delivery.

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: Hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116h5AGe]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), specifically in relation to general principles, the SGS 2012 guidelines recommend considering any of the following treatment options for patients with AUB presumed to be caused by predominantly ovulatory disorders or endometrial hemostatic disorders, with the choice of treatment based on the patient's values and preferences:

- **Hysterectomy**: Considered for definitive treatment.
- **Endometrial ablation**: Offered as a minimally invasive option.
- **Systemically administered medical therapies**: For those preferring non-surgical treatments.
- **Levonorgestrel intrauterine system**: Considered for localized hormonal treatment.

### Jantoven [^111LWGs6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise patients to notify their physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or symptoms occur. Signs and symptoms of bleeding include pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, nosebleeds, bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness [see Box Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Concomitant medications and botanicals (herbals)**: Advise patients not to take or discontinue any other drug, including salicylates (e.g. aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter drugs, and botanical (herbal) products except on the advice of their physician [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Pregnancy and nursing**: Advise patients to notify their physician if they are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or considering breastfeeding [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3)]. Avoid Jantoven during pregnancy except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves who are at risk of thromboembolism [see Contraindications (4)]. Use effective measures to avoid pregnancy while taking Jantoven. This is crucial because their unborn baby could be seriously harmed if they take Jantoven while pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Balloon compression as treatment for refractory vaginal hemorrhage [^116jPykq]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Severe vaginal hemorrhage is a rare but serious life threat in the emergency department (ED). Historically, initial management has been limited to vaginal packing, fluid resuscitation, and emergency surgical intervention. An alternative approach is presented that can be effectively employed in the ED: balloon compression of the vaginal mucosa. In the present case, this method was successful in arresting life-threatening hemorrhage. The patient survived subsequent hemodynamic stabilization and surgical intervention and was ultimately discharged home.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^112Rqtnw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is common, often debilitating, and may affect over 50% of reproductive-aged women and girls. AUB is a collection of symptoms that include intermenstrual bleeding and abnormalities in period duration, cycle length, and regularity. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is most contributory to iron deficiency and related anemia. It is apparent that AUB, in general, and HMB, in particular, remain underrecognized and underreported.

- **FIGO systems for assessing AUB**: FIGO created two systems for assessing and classifying AUB. FIGO System 1 defines the bleeding pattern using four primary descriptors: frequency, duration, regularity, and flow volume. FIGO System 2 provides a structured classification system of possible causes of AUB, using the acronym PALM-COEIN. "PALM" refers to structural causes of AUB (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy), and "COEI" refers to nonstructural causes (Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, and Iatrogenic). The "N" is reserved for those entities that are currently not otherwise classified. Using FIGO System 1 as a gateway to FIGO System 2 streamlines the investigation of reproductive-aged women and girls with AUB.

Understanding the pathogenesis of the FIGO System 2 "PALM-COEIN" causes helps interpret investigations and the onward management of AUB. Numerous evidence gaps exist concerning AUB; however, if researchers and trialists universally adopt FIGO Systems 1 and 2 for the assessment and diagnosis of AUB, clear translatable research findings can be applied globally.

### Can initial vaginal bleeding patterns in etonogestrel implant users predict subsequent bleeding in the first 2 years of use [^11685ooa]. Contraception (2019). Low credibility.

To evaluate if a simple method for characterizing vaginal bleeding patterns in etonogestrel contraceptive implant users can predict subsequent patterns and bleeding-related discontinuation over the first 2 years of use, we reanalyzed phase 3 study bleeding data for non-breastfeeding participants from the United States, Europe, Russia, and Chile. This was done during the first 2 years of implant use to characterize and correlate bleeding patterns.

- **Study design**: We used 90-day reference periods with period 1.1 starting at Day 29 and ending at Day 118. We dichotomized bleeding patterns as "favorable" (amenorrhea, infrequent bleeding, and normal frequency bleeding without prolonged bleeding) or "unfavorable" (prolonged and/or frequent bleeding). User groups were tracked based on these bleeding patterns in reference period 1.1 through Year 1 and from Year 1 through Year 2, respectively.

- **Results**: We evaluated data from 537 and 428 women with up to 1 and 2 years of use, respectively. Of the 325 (60.5%) women with favorable bleeding in reference period 1.1, 275 (84.6%) reported favorable bleeding also in reference period 2. Moreover, 197 (60.6%) reported favorable bleeding throughout Year 1, and favorable bleeding was observed in 75–85% of reference periods in Year 2. Among 212 (39.5%) women with unfavorable bleeding in reference period 1.1, 118 (55.7%) continued with unfavorable bleeding in reference period 2, while about 40%-50% reported favorable patterns in RP 2, 3, and/or 4. Initial favorable bleeding resulted in lower discontinuation rates than initial unfavorable bleeding in Year 1 (3.7% vs. 12.7%, p ≪ .0001).

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^1175FnBY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

- **System 1**: FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal, and therefore abnormal, features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

- **Figure 1**: FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB. The normal range is age-dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, the application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters: frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume. It also considers the presence or absence of intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO Systems 1 and 2 [^116uw9ae]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

In the endometrium of a woman with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), there is likely to be dysregulation in the aforementioned homeostatic control mechanisms. Coordinated events no longer occur in a synchronized fashion, resulting in increased menstrual blood loss. An example is the events that occur in the endometrium of a woman with leiomyomas (AUB‐L, uterine fibroids). Research on endometrium from women with leiomyomas has shown paradoxically higher levels of PGF2α and decreased levels of endothelin receptors, potentially leading to faulty vasoconstriction and HMB. Transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) is produced in excess quantities in the endometrium from women with submucous leiomyomas, reducing endometrial levels of PAI‐1, TM, and ATIII. This shift in plasminogen modulators may contribute to disturbed endometrial hemostasis and, thus, HMB. These changes may suggest a secondary disorder within the endometrium due to the presence of leiomyomas within the uterus, as opposed to a primary disorder within the endometrium (AUB‐E), which would occur without any other cause of AUB.

Unfortunately, the currently available evidence regarding endometrium from women with leiomyomas does not adequately identify the impact of the location of the leiomyoma (submucous versus other) on the altered behavior of the endometrium. While there is evidence that submucous leiomyomas are associated with global endometrial changes in molecular expressions related to endometrial receptivity, these changes are not seen in women with intramural leiomyomas or without leiomyomas at all.

### Enskyce [^115SNZ7Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Bleeding irregularities can occur in patients using oral contraceptives, especially within the first three months of use. If breakthrough bleeding or spotting is experienced, nonhormonal causes should be considered, and appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in cases of abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology is excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In case of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, particularly if such a condition pre-existed.

Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy can occur in cases of contraceptive failure.

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^111vnwe2]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly concerning hysterectomy, the SGS 2012 guidelines recommend considering either performing a hysterectomy or placing a levonorgestrel intrauterine system. This decision should be based on whether the patient's primary preference is the improvement of overall quality of life or sexual health, with the choice of treatment further influenced by additional patient preferences.

### The FIGO classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years [^111FKHQz]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical management, education for medical providers, and the design and interpretation of clinical trials have been hampered by the absence of a consensus system for nomenclature describing symptoms and classifying the causes or potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). To address this issue, the Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) has designed the PALM-COEIN (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy and Hyperplasia, Coagulopathy, Ovulatory Disorders, Endometrial Disorders, Iatrogenic Causes, and Not Classified) classification system for causes of AUB in the reproductive years.

### Non-surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women with bleeding disorders [^112vShmC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding without an organic lesion is mainly due to an imbalance of various hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle. Another cause of heavy menstrual bleeding without pelvic pathology is the presence of an acquired or inherited bleeding disorder. The haemostatic system plays a central role in controlling the amount and duration of menstrual bleeding, leading to abnormally prolonged or profuse bleeding in most women affected by bleeding disorders. Whereas irregular, pre-menarchal, or post-menopausal uterine bleeding is unusual in inherited or acquired hemorrhagic disorders, severe acute bleeding at menarche and chronic heavy menstrual bleeding during the entire reproductive life are common.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of non-surgical interventions versus each other, placebo, or no treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss in women with bleeding disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (13 March 2014), Embase (May 2013), LILACS (February 2013), and the WHO International Clinical Trial registry (February 2013).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled studies of non-surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women of reproductive age suffering from congenital or acquired bleeding disorders.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

Three cross-over studies were conducted.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^114g2tCN]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Congenital platelet disorders (CPDs) are rare bleeding disorders associated with mucocutaneous bleeds. However, data on vaginal bleeding in women with CPDs are scarce. A set of generic and bleeding-specific questionnaires was used to evaluate the prevalence of vaginal bleeding, its impact on quality of life (QoL) and sexual functioning, and the consequences for pregnancy, miscarriage, and delivery in a cohort of women who were referred for diagnostic evaluation for CPDs. A total of 78 women included in the study were either diagnosed with a CPD (n = 35) or were clinically suspected of a CPD (n = 43). Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) was reported by a large proportion of women, mainly starting at menarche.

In all, 76% of women received some form of HMB treatment, often leading to surgical procedures. The impact of HMB on QoL was significant, but it improved upon treatment. Though women reported that vaginal bleeding affects sexuality, this topic is not frequently discussed with physicians. Heavy blood loss frequently occurred after miscarriage or delivery, often requiring treatment. Women with (suspected) CPDs frequently encounter HMB, which negatively impacts daily life and sexual functioning. Together with peripartum bleeding, these data highlight the burden of vaginal bleeding in CPDs and the importance of adequate treatment.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^117VsfsT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

- **Endometrial disorders**: The category of primary endometrial disorders is assigned to presumed ovulatory women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) for whom there is no other demonstrable cause. While likely extremely common, the diagnosis of AUB-E may be difficult to make for a number of reasons. The most obvious case is the symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in the context of an entirely normal investigation. However, AUB-E may occur when the evaluation demonstrates asymptomatic abnormalities such as a leiomyoma not in contact with the endometrium, or a single adenomyosis feature, neither of which is likely to cause the symptom of heavy bleeding.

	- Fundamentally, these disorders of endometrial hemostasis reflect primary dysfunction in the mechanisms by which menstrual bleeding is controlled locally. This likely comprises some combination of deficiencies in the mechanisms of vasoconstriction, alterations in the formation or maintenance of intravascular thrombi, and impairment in the process of endometrial repair. Unfortunately, while there exists almost half a century of study of these molecular mechanisms in women with AUB‐E, there are currently no diagnostic tests available to clinicians, making it necessary to presume this category's diagnosis. This circumstance may contribute to what is likely a vast underdiagnosis and normalization of the symptoms of women with AUB‐E.

- **Iatrogenic**: There are many mechanisms through which medications or other interventions may lead to AUB. These include medicated or inert intrauterine devices, drugs that interfere with the coagulation cascade, as well as other medical interventions.

### Toremifene citrate [^114YrNHb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Vaginal bleeding has been reported in patients using toremifene citrate. Patients should be informed about this and instructed to contact their physician if such bleeding or other gynecological symptoms, such as changes in vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, or pressure, occur. Patients should have a gynecological examination prior to the initiation of therapy and at regular intervals while on therapy.

Liver disorders, including transaminits grade 3 and 4, hyperbilirubinemia, and jaundice, have been reported in patients using toremifene citrate. Patients should have liver function tests performed periodically while on therapy.

Toremifene citrate may harm the fetus and increase the risk for pregnancy loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Premenopausal women using toremifene citrate should use nonhormonal contraception during treatment and should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus should pregnancy occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Patients with bone metastases should be informed about the typical signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and instructed to contact their physician for further assessment if such signs or symptoms occur.

Patients who must take medications known to prolong the QT interval or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be informed of the effect of toremifene on the QT interval. Toremifene has been shown to prolong the QTc interval in a dose-related manner [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Prolonged vaginal bleeding in an adolescent secondary to a foreign body: Need for a comprehensive assessment and complex surgery [^111rY2e3]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding is common in adolescents and results from a variety of etiologies.

A 13-year-old, virginal girl was referred for prolonged, heavy vaginal bleeding despite combined oral contraceptive use and elected management with a levonorgestrel intrauterine device. A preprocedure exam revealed a plastic foreign body embedded in the posterior vaginal fornix; however, attempted removal in the office was unsuccessful. Subsequent computed tomography imaging of the pelvis revealed a vaginal foreign body, complex adnexal mass, and hydroureter. The patient underwent an exam under anesthesia and diagnostic laparoscopy but required conversion to exploratory laparotomy for removal of a foreign body because of vaginal perforation abutting the rectum.

Foreign bodies not easily removed in the outpatient setting should be considered for surgical removal with consideration of preoperative multidisciplinary coordination when imaging reveals intra-abdominal pathology, such as tubo-ovarian abscess and hydroureter.

### Uterine venous malformation as a rare cause of prepubertal vaginal bleeding [^115GH5nu]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a common reason for the referral of young girls to pediatric endocrinology and gynecology consultations. A physical examination should be performed, with particular attention paid to breast development and growth acceleration suggestive of precocious puberty. In the absence of pubertal signs and a vulvovaginal cause of bleeding on physical examination, pelvic ultrasound is a reasonable, cost-effective first choice for imaging.

We report here two rare cases of prepubertal uterine bleeding in young girls with an enlarged uterus on ultrasound, highly suggestive of precocious puberty but completely discordant with the concentration of estradiol, which was undetectable. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a dedicated ultrasound examination with a high-frequency probe made it possible to diagnose the rare condition of uterine venous malformation. In this clinical setting, discordance between conventional ultrasound features suggestive of precocious puberty and negative hormonal assessment results should lead to MRI. Indeed, MRI is the gold standard imaging tool for the diagnosis and evaluation of the extension of such venous malformations, which can be suggested using a high-frequency probe demonstrating venous myometrial ectasia.

### Ultrasound for diagnosis of postpartum retained products of conception-how accurate we are [^114zFRSH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical parameters that correlated with sonographic RPOC greater than 7 mm included prolonged vaginal bleeding without postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Studies have shown that RPOC may be a cause of PPH. In this case, the focus is on vaginal bleeding and not PPH. Another important parameter that can help with the diagnosis is the timing of the evaluation. Patients with a longer interval from delivery to hysteroscopy had smaller sonographic RPOC, usually less than or equal to 7 mm.

- **Strengths of the study**: The strengths include that it was conducted in a single center with a standard protocol for follow-up and treatment. In addition, all sonograms were performed by experienced sonographers in a tertiary level hospital. Finally, the waiting period between delivery and hysteroscopy was an average of 78 days. It is believed that earlier intervention would find many other RPOC that resolved spontaneously.

- **Limitations of the study**: The main limitations are its retrospective nature and relatively small sample size. A larger cohort may have enabled the demonstration of stronger statistically significant findings.

### The patient with non-pregnancy-associated vaginal bleeding [^1111i6bw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) unrelated to pregnancy affects 20% to 30% of women at some point in their life and is a common emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) presentation. AUB is a complex condition with extensive terminology, a broad differential diagnosis, and numerous treatment options, yet few published evidence-based guidelines. In the ED or UC setting, most affected patients are often more frustrated than acutely ill. These factors can make for a challenging patient encounter in the ED/UC setting. This article reviews acute and chronic AUB in the nonpregnant patient and suggests a simplified approach for its evaluation and management.

### Kalliga [^114L2FBU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Additional instructions for all dosing regimens: Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed, persistent, or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^115VTs9D]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is common, often debilitating, and may affect over 50% of reproductive-aged women and girls. Whereas AUB is a collection of symptoms that include intermenstrual bleeding and abnormalities in period duration, cycle length, and regularity, it is heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) that is most contributory to iron deficiency and related anemia. It is apparent that AUB, in general, and HMB, in particular, remain underrecognized and underreported.

FIGO created two systems for assessing and classifying AUB:

- **FIGO system 1**: Defines the bleeding pattern using four primary descriptors: frequency, duration, regularity, and flow volume.
- **FIGO system 2**: Provides a structured classification system of possible causes of AUB, using the acronym PALM-COEIN.
	- **PALM**: Refers to structural causes of AUB (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy).
	- **COEI**: Refers to nonstructural causes (Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, and Iatrogenic).
	- **N**: Reserved for those entities that are currently not otherwise classified.

Using FIGO system 1 as a gateway to FIGO system 2 streamlines the investigation of reproductive-aged women and girls with AUB. Understanding the pathogenesis of the FIGO system 2 "PALM-COEIN" causes helps interpret investigations and the onward management of AUB.

Numerous evidence gaps exist concerning AUB; however, if researchers and trialists universally adopt FIGO systems 1 and 2 for the assessment and diagnosis of AUB, clear translatable research findings can be applied globally.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^114p2x9Y]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

FIGO System 1 is instrumental in organizing the menstrual history, providing essential insights into the potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). Regular cycles with normal frequency often indicate ovulation, whereas irregular menses suggest ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O). Intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) may signal a focal lesion such as a polyp (AUB-P), and clinicians should evaluate for malignancy or endometrial hyperplasia accordingly (AUB-M). If IMB occurs consistently early in the cycle, during the follicular phase, appearing as dark spotting or bleeding, it may indicate a cesarean scar defect.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in the context of ovulatory cycles often reflects a hemostatic disorder, which could be systemic (AUB-C) or local, such as a primary endometrial disorder (AUB-E) or a condition secondary to adenomyosis (AUB-A) or leiomyoma (AUB-L, uterine fibroids), typically submucous (AUB-L SM). HMB is frequently linked with iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA), leading to fatigue and decreased physical and cognitive function.

The structured history necessary for FIGO System 1 offers clinicians insight into disorders that women and girls may have considered normal, possibly due to familial, social, or previous healthcare advice. This is often true for HMB, a condition many women have normalized.

### Tests for diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage at vaginal birth [^115B9xAg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

We considered including studies that evaluated at least one of the index tests. Index tests used to diagnose postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) include the following.

- **Visual estimation of blood loss**: This involves the attendant estimating the blood loss by observing the extent to which drapes and sheets are soaked with blood, along with visually estimating any blood collected in non-calibrated collection devices such as drapes, bowls, cylinders, and jugs.

- **Calibrated collection devices (volumetric)**: Examples include a plastic drape with a blood collection pouch placed under the woman giving birth. Blood is collected in the drape, and graduations in the collection pouch indicate the volume of blood gathered. Calibrated trays, bowls, cylinders, and jugs can also be used.

- **Diagnostic approach using calibrated drape plus observations**: Cumulative blood loss volume reading is taken using the calibration lines on the drape, with the assessment of uterine tone every 15 minutes. Blood pressure and pulse measurements are taken at least once in the first hour and repeated if abnormal or if there is ongoing bleeding. Abnormal observations include tachycardia (> 100 beats per minute (bpm) or an increase of 20 bpm from baseline), decreasing systolic blood pressure (< 100 mmHg or a decrease of 20 mmHg from baseline), soft uterine tone, heavy vaginal blood flow, large clots being expelled, or a constant trickle of blood. PPH is diagnosed and treated if any of the following three criteria are met: (1) Clinical judgement – heavy vaginal blood loss, large blood clots, a constant trickle, or some other concern.

### Progestogens versus oestrogens and progestogens for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation [^113X7SoY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is excessively heavy, prolonged, or frequent bleeding of uterine origin which is not due to pregnancy or recognizable pelvic or systemic disease. Anovulation may be inferred from several observations, but in a typical clinical situation, it is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged, or frequent bleeding. This is particularly true for those at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) estrogen production, there will be no progesterone withdrawal from estrogen-primed endometrium, resulting in irregular cycles. Prolonged estrogen stimulation may cause a buildup of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled.

This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and prevent estrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and estrogens and progestogens in combination, are already widely used in managing irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB. However, the regime, dose, and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.

### Management and outcomes of vaginal bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive age on direct oral anti-factor Xa inhibitor therapy: a case series [^117Nco9N]. The Lancet Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational data and results from post-hoc analyses in clinical trials suggest that direct oral factor Xa inhibitors might increase menstrual bleeding intensity in women of reproductive age, but the extent of this effect is unknown. We aimed to investigate the management and outcomes of vaginal bleeding complications during therapy with direct oral factor Xa inhibitors in a case series of women of reproductive age.

- **Methods**: To identify individuals for inclusion in this case series, we searched two sources of prospectively collected data from women of reproductive age treated with direct oral factor Xa inhibitors: the non-interventional Dresden NOAC Registry (NCT01588119), which is based in the administrative district of Dresden (Saxony, Germany), and all locally archived data from phase 3 trials of direct oral factor Xa inhibitors conducted at University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. Vaginal bleeding events were defined as any vaginal bleeding complications as reported by the patient. We collected data on the type and dosage of anticoagulation; suspected or confirmed bleeding events, hospital admissions, and mortality; and the pattern and management of vaginal bleeding events. For all cases of bleeding identified, we reviewed all available source data to identify examination results suggesting potential underlying anatomical causes of bleeding.

- **System 2**:

	- **Classification**: FIGO's AUB System 2 was first published in the peer-reviewed literature in 2011 and later updated in 2018. It serves to categorize the potential causes or contributors to a patient's AUB symptoms and has been presented as a two-part acronym that encompasses structural ("PALM") and nonstructural ("COEI") entities, as well as a category for potential contributors that are not otherwise classified (N).

	- **PALM group**: The "PALM" group comprises polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyomas (uterine fibroids), and malignancy, including atypical endometrial hyperplasia or epithelial intraepithelial neoplasia.

	- **COEI contributors**: The "COEI" contributors include coagulopathy, ovulatory disorders, endometrial dysfunction (which may be considered primary and not related to the presence of any other causes of AUB), and iatrogenic causes. Modifications in 2018 moved anticoagulants from AUB-C and agents causing ovulatory disorders from AUB-O to AUB-I.

### Crinone [^115XCAvE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pretreatment physical examination should include special reference to breast and pelvic organs, as well as a Papanicolaou smear. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular vaginal bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered. For cases of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures should be undertaken.

Because progestogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions influenced by this factor (e.g. epilepsy, migraine, asthma, cardiac or renal dysfunction) require careful observation. The pathologist should be advised of progesterone therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. Patients with a history of psychic depression should be carefully observed, and the drug should be discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious degree. A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in a small percentage of patients on estrogen-progestin combination drugs. The mechanism of this decrease is unknown. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving progestin therapy.

- **Information for patients**: The product should not be used concurrently with other local intravaginal therapy. If other local intravaginal therapy is to be used, there should be at least a 6-hour period before or after Crinone administration. Small, white globules may appear as a vaginal discharge, possibly due to gel accumulation, even several days after usage.

- **Drug interactions**: No drug interactions have been assessed with Crinone.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Nonclinical studies have not assessed these areas.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116fdu8w]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

With regard to diagnostic investigations for menopause, particularly in the evaluation of vaginal bleeding, the Endocrine Society 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology. Most importantly, this evaluation should focus on identifying endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in patients experiencing persistent unscheduled bleeding while undergoing menopausal hormone therapy.

### Vaginal bleeding disturbances and implantable contraceptives [^114QZWQa]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

Implantable contraceptives allow for safe and effective fertility regulation for up to 5 years. Currently available devices release low doses of progestogens. Disruption of vaginal bleeding patterns is almost inevitable, particularly during the initial months of use. Irregular and prolonged bleeding, as well as amenorrhea, are common. Irregular bleeding is unpopular with most women and unacceptable to some.

This review describes the vaginal bleeding disturbances induced by modern implantable contraceptives and discusses the implications of these in terms of method use and discontinuations. The cause of irregular bleeding is not fully understood, but recent evidence suggests that an increase in endometrial vascular fragility might precipitate vessel breakdown and, hence, breakthrough bleeding.

- **Mechanisms of bleeding**: This review discusses this evidence and outlines the possible mechanisms underlying breakthrough bleeding associated with implantable contraceptives.
- **Therapies for bleeding**: In addition, therapies for bleeding disturbances are described, and their efficacy is reviewed.

### Prolonged amenorrhea and resumption of menses in women with HIV [^113tJDht]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

To compare etiologies of prolonged amenorrhea in a cohort of HIV-infected women with a cohort of similar uninfected at-risk women, women from the Women's Interagency HIV Study were seen every 6 months and completed surveys about their menstruation. Those who reported no vaginal bleeding for at least one year ("prolonged amenorrhea") with subsequent resumption of bleeding were compared with women in whom bleeding had stopped permanently ("menopause"). Characteristics associated with reversible prolonged amenorrhea were ascertained.

Of 828 women with prolonged amenorrhea, 37.6% had reversible amenorrhea, and 62.4% never resumed menses. HIV-seropositive women with prolonged amenorrhea were significantly younger at the cessation of menses than HIV-negative women (p < 0.0001). Of those with reversible prolonged amenorrhea, approximately half were taking medications associated with amenorrhea, including 95 (30.6%) hormonal contraception, 80 (25.7%) opiates/stimulants, 16 (5.1%) psychotropic medications, and 6 (1.9%) chemotherapy. HIV-seropositive women were less likely to have medications as a cause of amenorrhea than seronegative women (p = 0.02).

In multivariable analysis, women with reversible prolonged amenorrhea of unknown etiology were younger (p < 0.0001), more often obese (p = 0.03), and less educated (p = 0.01) than those with permanent amenorrhea. Among HIV-seropositive women, markers of severe immunosuppression were not associated with prolonged amenorrhea. Women with HIV infection have unexplained prolonged amenorrhea.

### Obstetrical outcomes after vaginal repair of caesarean scar diverticula in reproductive-aged women [^115syBaT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

The study demonstrated that vaginal repair can not only resolve CSD-associated prolonged menstrual bleeding but can also restore the anatomical structure in patients with CSD. Furthermore, subsequent satisfactory obstetrical outcomes can be achieved in vaginal repair-treated CSD patients.

### Vaginal foreign body: A delayed diagnosis [^111FtLLj]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The article describes a case of prolonged vaginal bleeding in a prepubertal girl. It includes a review of medical records and a literature search.

A 7-year-old female was referred to our pediatric and adolescent gynecologic clinic for evaluation of vaginal bleeding and an ovarian cyst on ultrasonography. Her parents denied any history of trauma or sexual abuse. The initial evaluation revealed pre-pubertal luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, and follow-up ultrasonography indicated normal pre-pubertal pelvic anatomy. However, a skeletal survey, obtained to assess for the presence of skeletal fibrous dysplasia, revealed a metal spring in the vagina. The patient ultimately underwent an examination under anesthesia and vaginoscopy, resulting in the removal of three foreign bodies and subsequent termination of symptoms.

In cases of pre-pubertal vaginal bleeding, the possibility of a vaginal foreign body should not be excluded despite normal sonographic imaging. If clinical suspicion for a vaginal foreign body persists, additional imaging modalities or an examination under anesthesia should be considered.

### Tests for diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage at vaginal birth [^112trPCK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

At least two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the searches to determine if they satisfied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved the full texts of potentially eligible studies for detailed screening and selected the eligible studies. Any disagreements were resolved through consensus or by consulting another review author if required. A PRISMA flowchart is included to detail the record screening process and selection of included studies (Figure 1).

- **Data extraction and management**: A data extraction form was developed, piloted, and used by at least two review authors, working independently, to extract data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and by consulting another review author if required. Study data were entered into Review Manager software.

	- **Study characteristics**: We extracted information on study author and date, study design, study country and continent, study income setting, study healthcare setting, funding sources, and reported conflicts of interest.

	- **Participants**: Details extracted included the total number of participants, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and demographic details such as maternal age, parity, body mass index (BMI), gestational age, history of PPH, and admission haemoglobin.

	- **Index test**: Information on the type of index test, positivity threshold, timing, and the person who performed the index test was collected.

	- **Reference standard**: We also extracted data on the type of reference standard, positivity threshold, timing, and the individual who performed the reference standard.

### Incidence, management and outcomes of prolonged second stage of labour in a rural setting in Malawi: a retrospective cohort study [^115HYi64]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Prolonged second stage of labour may lead to maternal and perinatal complications. Options for clinical management include augmentation with oxytocin, instrumental vaginal birth, or second-stage caesarean section. This study aimed to describe the incidence, management, and outcome of a prolonged second stage of labour in a rural hospital in Malawi.

Methods involved a retrospective analysis of medical records and partographs of all women who gave birth in 2015–2016 at a rural mission hospital in Malawi. Labour tracings were compared with management protocols. Primary outcomes included the incidence of prolonged second stage, instrumental vaginal birth, and caesarean section. Additionally, management and outcomes were assessed. Women arriving at the hospital in the second stage of labour were compared to those arriving earlier in labour.

Results revealed that out of all 3,426 women who gave birth during the study period, 566 (16.5%) presented while already in the second stage. Among these, 307 (9.0% of 3,426) were diagnosed with prolonged second stage based on their partographs. Of these women, 22 (7.2%) had labour augmented with oxytocin, 31 (10.1%) gave birth by vacuum extraction, and 64 (20.9%) by caesarean section. Spontaneous vaginal birth occurred in 212 (69.0%). Women with prolonged second stage had an increased risk of complications, with postpartum haemorrhage being the most common. There was no difference in neonatal outcomes between women with or without a documented prolonged second stage. Of the 566 women presenting in the second stage, 538 (95.1%) had spontaneous vaginal births, and 38 (6.7%) ended up having prolonged second stage labour.

### Emergency evaluation and management of vaginal bleeding in the nonpregnant patient [^1133YwBK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the nonpregnant patient presenting to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding requires the emergency physician to be aware of the potential for a variety of underlying causes. Patients with vaginal bleeding may have non-life-threatening problems such as fibroids, endometriosis, or treatable sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydial infection. However, care must be taken to differentiate these from more serious causes of pelvic pain and bleeding such as ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic cyst, ovarian torsion, and rare complications from fibroids, such as intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Abnormal bleeding unrelated to structural problems could have an anovulatory or ovulatory cause.

### Insight: Prolonged vaginal bleeding during central precocious puberty therapy with a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist: a proposed mechanism and management plan [^111kEB3G]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

We have previously described our data collected after administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) to delay sexual maturation in premenarchal girls suffering from idiopathic central precocious puberty. Episodes of bleeding are due to the discontinuation of estrogen support for the proliferative and stable endometrium.

In recent years, the recognition of the extra-pituitary functions of GnRH-a, the ability of GnRH to stimulate prostaglandin production, and the known role of prostaglandins in irregular vaginal bleeding prompted us to seek alternative explanations for our data. We suggest considering a potential clinical use of combination therapies of GnRH agonists and prostanoid receptor antagonists to treat central precocious puberty.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^116aVqhk]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

The FSDS-R (Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised) was used to measure sexual-related distress levels among the 72 women in the analysis group. The six remaining women did not feel comfortable returning a questionnaire on this topic. Sexual distress was reported by 34 of the 72 women. The median (IQR) FSDS-R score was 10.5 (2.0–22.8). A large proportion of women reported feeling sexually inadequate (17%) or guilty about sexual difficulties (15%).

- **Sexual functioning**: To test whether the sexual-related distress within the analysis group was related to the bleeding tendency, we compared the FSDS-R results with the results from the sexual functioning questionnaires. The FSDS-R score was higher in women reporting limitations in sexual activity due to their bleeding tendency (27 women), compared to women without self-reported limitations (40), with a median (IQR) FSDS-R score of 20 (8–26) versus 6 (1–14) (P = 0.002).

- **Pregnancy and delivery**: Miscarriages were reported by 23 women, of which 18 women experienced heavy blood loss due to miscarriage. In total, 12 women reported having received treatment for blood loss caused by miscarriage, including iron tablets (4), hormonal treatment (2), tranexamic acid (3), desmopressin (1), clotting factors (2), curettage (9), platelet transfusion (3), and blood transfusion (2). Three of these women reported an emergency hospital visit and treatment.

Of the analysis group, a total of 138 live infants (117 vaginal deliveries, 21 caesarean sections) were born to 58 women.

### Clomid [^114hy7FS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated with regard to the following:

- **Estrogen levels**: Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen, as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone. Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.

- **Primary pituitary or ovarian failure**: Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.

- **Endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma**: The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age, as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. An endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.

- **Other impediments to pregnancy**: Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.

- **Uterine fibroids**: Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^113eRxNq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

- **Figure 2**: FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 2 describes the PALM-COEIN Classification System for causes of AUB in the reproductive years. Four categories define visually objective structural criteria (PALM: polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; and malignancy and hyperplasia), four are nonstructural anomalies (COEI: coagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; endometrial disorders; iatrogenic causes), and one (N) is reserved for entities categorized as "not otherwise classified". The leiomyoma category (L) is subdivided into patients with at least one submucous myoma (LSM) and those with leiomyomas that do not impact the endometrial cavity (Lo).

It is essential to perform an appropriately thorough evaluation of women and girls with chronic AUB. Each potential cause or contributor may be found in isolation or may be present alongside other possible causes of AUB, and it is important to understand that many structural causes, including polyps, adenomyosis, and most leiomyomas, may indeed be asymptomatic and unrelated to the patient's symptoms. Consequently, even when a potential structural cause is identified, it is important to complete an assessment for nonstructural causes of AUB, which may be the main contributor to the patient's symptoms. One of the main tools to assist in this assessment is a structured history that complements the history taken for FIGO System 1. An example of a necessary aspect of the structured history includes a screening tool for coagulopathies (i.e. AUB-C). FIGO recommends a screening tool that is 90% sensitive for the detection of a coagulation disorder.

### Guidelines for bleeding disorders in women [^115dY6BA]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Women with bleeding disorders are disproportionately affected by reproductive tract bleeding and other related complications. Data on the management of women with bleeding disorders are limited by the absence of randomized trials, case-control studies, or even large case series. In the absence of strong evidence to guide practice, government agencies and hemophilia organizations have developed consensus guidelines. This paper summarizes existing recommendations from these guidelines.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^115RAwNh]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

- **Evidence gaps**: In recent years, there has been an overall development of female technology designed to assist with women's health. Examples include software programs to track fertility or menstrual cycles, and hardware devices such as skin-worn sensors and intelligent technology menstrual cups. Frameworks are being developed to encourage these products to be inclusive. These products can potentially improve the characterization and diagnosis of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), such as ovulatory disorders and contributing factors. Recent advances in the estimation of menstrual blood loss via digital applications may also help women understand their symptoms, encourage presentation to healthcare professionals, and help elucidate the true prevalence of AUB in the reproductive years.

- **Role of iron in menstrual physiology**: The need to monitor AUB patients for iron deficiency (ID) or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is an important clinical consideration. It has been found that iron plays a crucial role in the repair of injured mucosal surfaces; however, physiologically, iron's role in endometrial repair and thus the menstrual cycle is yet to be determined.

### Perimenopausal vaginal bleeding: diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic options [^114hZwdq]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

While significant awareness has been raised about menopause, less attention has been focused on the perimenopausal or "menopausal transition" period. Many women and their physicians remain unaware of the impact of this transitional phase into menopause. Specifically, heavy and unpredictable perimenopausal bleeding is extremely common. It is a normal phenomenon of aging and tends to improve over time. However, about one quarter of perimenopausal women will have heavy flow that persists beyond three months and will require medical assistance.

The purpose of this review is to focus on the hormonal and physiological changes associated with perimenopausal heavy vaginal bleeding, to present the essential evaluation of causes for this heavy flow, and to outline the evidence for effective medical and surgical treatments. Advances in understanding the normal physiology of perimenopause have led to medical therapies that may result in fewer surgical procedures and hysterectomies, which should be of interest to healthcare practitioners focusing on women's health. Although these issues are addressed in the gynecologic literature, there is relatively less published in other disciplines.

### The two FIGO systems for normal and abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms and classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years: 2018 revisions [^115L1hCU]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) systems for nomenclature of symptoms of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years (FIGO AUB System 1) and for classification of causes of AUB (FIGO AUB System 2; PALM-COEIN) were first published together in 2011. The purpose was to harmonize the definitions of normal and abnormal bleeding symptoms and to classify and subclassify underlying potential causes of AUB in the reproductive years to facilitate research, education, and clinical care. The systems were designed to be flexible and to be periodically reviewed and modified as appropriate.

- **Objectives**: To review, clarify, and, where appropriate, revise the previously published systems.

- **Methodology and outcome**: To a large extent, the process has been an iterative one involving the FIGO Menstrual Disorders Committee, as well as a number of invited contributions from epidemiologists, gynecologists, and other experts in the field from around the world between 2012 and 2017. Face-to-face meetings have been held in Rome, Vancouver, and Singapore, and have been augmented by a number of teleconferences and other communications designed to evaluate various aspects of the systems. Where substantial change was considered, anonymous voting, in some instances using a modified RAND Delphi technique, was utilized.
