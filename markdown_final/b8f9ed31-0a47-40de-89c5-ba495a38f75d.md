## Question

what are the treatments for long covid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the available treatments for long COVID. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining long COVID and the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify which interventions have the best evidence versus those that are promising but uncertain. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options, followed by non-pharmacologic rehabilitation strategies. After that, I need to check special populations and safety considerations. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical, symptom-guided care pathway and highlight knowledge gaps and research directions, ensuring I continuously self-verify claims against the cited evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the condition and the evidentiary starting point. Long COVID, or post-COVID-19 condition, is generally defined by persistent or new symptoms for at least 3 months after acute infection, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months and not explained by alternative diagnoses, although definitions vary across organizations and studies, which complicates trial comparability and guideline formulation [^114h9MhB] [^114tNeiy]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatments; I should double-check the certainty of evidence. Across living systematic reviews and guidelines, most long COVID interventions have low to very low certainty, and many guidelines issue only conditional suggestions or emphasize rehabilitation rather than drugs, underscoring the nascent state of the evidence base [^1157Ur5N] [^114tNeiy] [^1149uJ4j].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapies, starting with metformin, because I recall a signal for long COVID prevention. Wait, let me verify the directionality and certainty. A WHO-commissioned meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests metformin started during acute non-severe COVID-19 may reduce incident long COVID, but the evidence is low certainty from a single trial and pertains to prevention rather than treatment of established long COVID, so it cannot be used to treat existing post-COVID symptoms at this time [^114rz56i] [^1176iEkQ] [^1158hfNx]. I should confirm that no guideline endorses metformin for treating long COVID itself; indeed, major guidelines do not recommend metformin for post-COVID management, reinforcing that this remains investigational for prevention and not a treatment for established long COVID [^114tNeiy].

> Next, I should review other drugs often discussed for long COVID. Let me consider anticoagulation, antivirals, and immunomodulators. The PAHO living review notes anticoagulant regimens as promising but with low certainty, and no definitive recommendation exists for long COVID treatment; similarly, agents like Actovegin and palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin show signals in small studies but remain low certainty and are not guideline-endorsed for long COVID treatment [^1157Ur5N]. I need to ensure I don't conflate acute COVID-19 therapies with long COVID; for example, colchicine has conditional or negative recommendations in acute COVID-19 and is not established for long COVID, and convalescent plasma is not indicated for long COVID management, so extrapolation would be inappropriate [^1116bpoF] [^115ddUJU]. Hold on, I should verify that no living guideline currently recommends pharmacologic therapy to cure or reverse long COVID; WHO and ESCMID emphasize rehabilitation and symptom management rather than disease-modifying drugs at this stage [^1149uJ4j] [^114tNeiy].

> Now, I will examine non-pharmacologic rehabilitation, since this is where the strongest, though still imperfect, evidence lies. Let me first confirm the scope of rehabilitation trials. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials show exercise-based and respiratory rehabilitation can improve functional exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life in post-COVID patients, with moderate certainty for some outcomes, while acknowledging uncertainty about adverse events and the need for careful patient selection and monitoring [^115UjJ6i] [^111ck8k7]. I should double-check guideline alignment; WHO living guidance recommends individualized, symptom-guided rehabilitation programs, with multidisciplinary teams, continuity of care, and shared decision-making, and it advises assessing for exertional desaturation, cardiac impairment, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional symptom exacerbation before prescribing exercise [^1149uJ4j] [^111SkXac] [^111EQNTr].

> Let me think about pacing and energy conservation, because post-exertional malaise is common. WHO recommends education and skills training in pacing and energy conservation, with cautious, symptom-titrated return to physical activity in the absence of post-exertional symptom exacerbation, and it suggests assistive devices and environmental modifications when fatigue limits instrumental activities of daily living [^116F8zvq] [^111jGh3k]. But wait, what if I overgeneralize graded exercise therapy from other conditions? I should confirm that guidance cautions against rigid, one-size-fits-all exercise prescriptions; contemporary recommendations emphasize symptom-guided, flexible programs and close monitoring for deterioration, reflecting ongoing debate and heterogeneity in responses [^112dtkZH] [^1149uJ4j].

> Next, I should review organ-specific symptom management where evidence is emerging. For breathlessness, WHO suggests education, self-management strategies such as nasal breathing and pacing, and exercise training when safe, while acknowledging extrapulmonary contributors and the potential role of adapted pulmonary rehabilitation. ESCMID notes insufficient evidence for or against respiratory rehabilitation specifically for COVID-19 but supports considering multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the post-acute stage [^115NRn9G] [^111CYPnx] [^115K8hNQ]. For fatigue, I should confirm that WHO recommends combining education, pacing, and cautious exercise, with assistive strategies as needed, and with assessment for underlying cardiopulmonary drivers before exercise prescription [^116F8zvq] [^111EQNTr]. For neurocognitive sequelae, WHO suggests education, self-management, and cognitive exercises, with environmental modifications to support daily functioning, recognizing the limited but growing intervention base [^112EW2TG]. For psychological distress, anxiety, and depression, WHO supports mindfulness-based approaches, peer support, and psychological support integrated with physical activity when tolerated, again with shared decision-making [^114UCwpk] [^111wHfXX]. For arthralgia, WHO proposes pain education, self-management, short-term anti-inflammatories, and exercise in the absence of post-exertional worsening, reflecting a pragmatic, multimodal approach [^116krYto].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and safety. In pediatrics, evidence is sparse and care is largely extrapolated. Pediatric post-COVID programs report fatigue, headache, and cognitive symptoms as common, and management is often limited to physical therapy and psychological support pending stronger evidence, so I should caution against adult-only generalizations [^116rTZqg]. For patients with prior severe or critical illness, I should confirm that some sequelae reflect ARDS, sepsis, or chronic critical illness trajectories rather than unique SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, which shapes rehabilitation needs and expectations for recovery timelines [^113k4xus]. Before exercise, I should double-check that cardiopulmonary assessment is advised to mitigate risks of exertional desaturation or arrhythmia, aligning with WHO safety guidance [^111EQNTr].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic and care delivery framework, because treatment hinges on appropriate assessment. ESCMID recommends selective testing based on persistent symptoms, including routine labs, chest imaging, and pulmonary function tests for respiratory symptoms around 3 months, while avoiding unnecessary broad panels, and it emphasizes coordinated multidisciplinary care and longitudinal follow-up given the multisystem nature of long COVID [^114tNeiy]. WHO supports a hybrid in-person and remote model for rehabilitation delivery, individualized program length, and re-engagement if new functional decline occurs, which is practical for health system capacity and patient access [^116WVS1b]. I should confirm that shared decision-making and alignment with patient preferences are core principles across WHO guidance, reinforcing patient-centered care in the absence of curative pharmacotherapies [^111SkXac] [^116wqQBJ].

> Let me integrate this into a pragmatic, symptom-guided care pathway while keeping the evidence limitations front and center. First, confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternative etiologies for symptoms, using targeted tests guided by the clinical picture and duration since acute infection, and avoid anchoring bias on COVID-19 alone [^113JDxja] [^114tNeiy]. Second, screen for safety before rehabilitation: assess for exertional desaturation, cardiac involvement, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional symptom exacerbation, and tailor activity accordingly [^111EQNTr]. Third, initiate individualized rehabilitation with pacing education, symptom-titrated exercise when safe, respiratory strategies for breathlessness, cognitive rehabilitation as indicated, and psychological support, delivered by a multidisciplinary team with continuity of care and shared decision-making [^1149uJ4j] [^111SkXac]. Fourth, manage specific symptoms pragmatically: consider short-term anti-inflammatories for pain, mindfulness and peer support for distress, assistive devices and environmental modifications for functional limitations, and occupational adaptations for return to work planning [^116krYto] [^114UCwpk] [^116UktNv]. Fifth, embed follow-up to monitor trajectory, detect new complications, and adjust the plan iteratively, recognizing that recovery is nonlinear and heterogeneous [^113JDxja].

> Hold on, I should verify the key uncertainties and research directions so we don't overstate conclusions. The field urgently needs larger, high-quality randomized trials with standardized definitions, core outcome sets, and diverse populations to clarify which interventions are effective for which phenotypes, and to resolve safety questions around exercise in patients with post-exertional malaise [^113feR8W] [^112dtkZH]. I should confirm that metformin's signal for prevention requires replication before routine use, and that most repurposed drugs for treatment remain unsupported pending higher-certainty evidence [^1176iEkQ] [^1157Ur5N]. Finally, I need to ensure we communicate that current best practice is symptom-targeted, multidisciplinary rehabilitation within a patient-centered framework, with explicit acknowledgment of evidence gaps and a plan for reassessment as new data emerge [^1149uJ4j] [^114tNeiy].

Current treatments for long COVID are **supportive and symptom-targeted**, as no pharmacologic therapy has proven effective for the condition as a whole [^1157Ur5N]. Management centers on **rehabilitation and self-management** [^1149uJ4j], including pacing, graded exercise, and respiratory training [^115UjJ6i], with psychological support and cognitive rehabilitation as needed [^111wHfXX] [^112EW2TG]. Metformin during acute COVID-19 may reduce the risk of developing long COVID, but evidence is limited and not for treating established long COVID [^1176iEkQ] [^114rz56i]. Pharmacologic treatments should be individualized to symptoms, and patients should be enrolled in clinical trials when possible [^113P1VF3] [^1167jXYU].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are the cornerstone of long COVID management, emphasizing **rehabilitation, self-management, and multidisciplinary care** [^111SkXac].

---

### Rehabilitation strategies

- **Exercise-based rehabilitation**: Moderate-certainty evidence shows improvements in functional capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life with individualized, symptom-guided programs [^115UjJ6i] [^111ck8k7].

- **Respiratory rehabilitation**: Breathing exercises, airway clearance, and pulmonary rehabilitation are recommended for persistent respiratory symptoms [^115NRn9G] [^114tNeiy].

- **Pacing and energy conservation**: Essential for managing fatigue and post-exertional malaise, with cautious, symptom-titrated return to activity [^116F8zvq] [^111jGh3k].

---

### Psychological and cognitive interventions

Psychological support — including **mindfulness-based approaches, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and peer support** — addresses anxiety, depression, and stress-related symptoms [^114UCwpk] [^111wHfXX]. Cognitive rehabilitation uses cognitive exercises and self-management strategies for brain fog and cognitive impairment [^112EW2TG].

---

### Multidisciplinary care

Multidisciplinary teams coordinate **personalized care plans** across rehabilitation, psychology, and primary care [^111SkXac] [^116WVS1b]. Shared decision-making ensures patient involvement in setting goals and choosing interventions [^111SkXac] [^116wqQBJ].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Currently, **no pharmacologic therapy has robust evidence** for treating long COVID as a whole; management is symptom-specific and individualized [^1157Ur5N].

---

### Medications under investigation

- **Metformin**: Low-certainty evidence suggests metformin during acute COVID-19 may reduce incident long COVID, but it is not for treating established long COVID [^1176iEkQ] [^1157Ur5N].

- **Anticoagulants**: Investigated for microclot-related symptoms; evidence is preliminary and not practice-changing [^1157Ur5N].

- **Immunomodulators**: Trials are evaluating agents targeting persistent immune activation, but no definitive benefits have emerged [^1157Ur5N].

---

### Symptom-specific pharmacologic management

Symptom-specific pharmacologic management includes **analgesics** for pain, antidepressants or anxiolytics for mood symptoms, and sleep aids for insomnia. Medications are tailored to symptom severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111SkXac] [^116krYto].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized, symptom-targeted care** and highlight the need for more high-quality evidence [^114tNeiy].

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Exercise-based rehabilitation | Recommended | Moderate |
| Respiratory rehabilitation | Recommended | Moderate |
| Psychological support | Recommended | Low |
| Cognitive rehabilitation | Recommended | Low |
| Metformin (for prevention) | Considered | Low |
| Anticoagulants | Under investigation | Very low |
| Immunomodulators | Under investigation | Very low |

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

Research is rapidly evolving, with **hundreds of trials** evaluating pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions [^1167jXYU]. Key initiatives include the NIH RECOVER program and WHO-supported studies, aiming to define effective treatments and clarify mechanisms [^1167jXYU].

---

## Challenges and limitations

- **Heterogeneity**: Diverse symptoms and pathophysiology complicate trial design and treatment standardization [^113feR8W].

- **Lack of biomarkers**: No validated biomarkers hinder diagnosis, stratification, and outcome assessment [^notfound].

- **Limited evidence**: Most interventions have low or very low certainty evidence, necessitating cautious, individualized care [^1157Ur5N].

---

## Future directions

Future work should prioritize **high-quality randomized trials** to identify effective treatments and define patient subgroups [^115J4Lwq]. Efforts should also develop standardized diagnostic criteria and core outcome sets to improve comparability [^113feR8W]. Exploration of novel therapies targeting persistent immune activation, microclots, and neuroinflammation is needed [^notfound].

---

Current long COVID care is **supportive and symptom-targeted**, with rehabilitation and self-management as the foundation [^1149uJ4j]. Metformin may reduce incident long COVID when given acutely, but evidence is limited and not for established disease [^1176iEkQ]. Management should be individualized, with patient preference and shared decision-making guiding care [^111SkXac].

Better evidence for better care

Although we are still at the stage of symptom-driven treatment, there are sufficient therapeutics to address long COVID. Adequately designed and implemented clinical trials with greater transparency are essential for the practice of evidence-based medicine. In May 2022, the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly approved a new resolution (WHA75.8) on 'Strengthening clinical trials to provide high-quality evidence on health interventions and to improve research quality and coordination'. The communication of scientific results in a timely and clear manner is also fundamental for clinical management and for the organisation of the response of health systems for long COVID.

The PAHO technical team on post COVID-19 condition will continuously monitor the rapidly evolving literature, particularly if it applies to any special population subgroups such as children, pregnant women, those with immune condition, those with comorbidities, ethnic and minority groups and those affected by contextual factors. As new evidence emerges, studies will be assessed and updated in the living review, complemented through an interactive online version that will facilitate the use of the review's results through interactive tables and figures. This living review will support countries, organisations and regional collaborations in the development of guidelines and policies for the management of patients with long COVID. PAHO continues to support Latin American and Caribbean countries in developing or adapting guidelines to specific contexts based on this evidence.

National and global response efforts should be kept informed, and while we may not have exact mechanisms on the aetiology and prevalence of this condition, we can still create a roadmap to support a research agenda, as well as to support clinicians to improve diagnosis and management of people living with long COVID.

### Comparison of WHO versus national COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines across the world: not exactly a perfect match [^111eHqYb]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

As a consequence, there has been substantial variation between countries in their COVID-19 treatment recommendations. Different conclusions derived from the same evidence, different timing of treatment guideline development, lack of evidence in early infections, lack of pharmacometric evaluation, lack of comparative information, the high cost of new therapeutics and political pressures have all contributed to the heterogeneity in guidance observed between countries.

WHO has regularly updated its 'living' COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines, making this recommendation on the basis of a standardised review of the latest evidence. With some exceptions, its recommendations have been delineated by disease severity.

Many countries, particularly in low-resource settings, rely on guidance from WHO to develop and update their infectious diseases national treatment guidelines. We reviewed WHO member state national guidelines (NGs) for COVID-19 treatment and compared them to the WHO therapeutic guidelines.

### Long covid-mechanisms, risk factors, and management [^114vUgnS]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe. As of 4 July 2021, more than 183 million confirmed cases of covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, and 3.97 million deaths. Recent evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is now coined long covid by recognized research institutes. Studies have shown that long covid can affect the whole spectrum of people with covid-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like acute covid-19, long covid can involve multiple organs and can affect many systems including, but not limited to, the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of long covid include fatigue, dyspnea, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. This review summarizes studies of the long term effects of covid-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and describes the persistent symptoms they endure. Risk factors for acute covid-19 and long covid and possible therapeutic options are also discussed.

### Developing treatment guidelines during a pandemic health crisis: lessons learned from COVID-19 [^115tU3SM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines began in March 2020 in response to a request from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Within 4 days of the request, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel was established and the first meeting took place (virtually-as did subsequent meetings). The Panel comprises 57 individuals representing 6 governmental agencies, 11 professional societies, and 33 medical centers, plus 2 community members, who have worked together to create and frequently update the guidelines on the basis of evidence from the most recent clinical studies available. The initial version of the guidelines was completed within 2 weeks and posted online on 21 April 2020. Initially, sparse evidence was available to guide COVID-19 treatment recommendations. However, treatment data rapidly accrued based on results from clinical studies that used various study designs and evaluated different therapeutic agents and approaches. Data have continued to evolve at a rapid pace, leading to 24 revisions and updates of the guidelines in the first year. This process has provided important lessons for responding to an unprecedented public health emergency: Providers and stakeholders are eager to access credible, current treatment guidelines; governmental agencies, professional societies, and health care leaders can work together effectively and expeditiously; panelists from various disciplines, including biostatistics, are important for quickly developing well-informed recommendations; well-powered randomized clinical trials continue to provide the most compelling evidence to guide treatment recommendations; treatment recommendations need to be developed in a confidential setting free from external pressures; development of a user-friendly, web-based format for communicating with health care providers requires substantial administrative support; and frequent updates are necessary as clinical evidence rapidly emerges.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^114tvbH1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation", and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option". Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention", and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Studying the post-COVID-19 condition: research challenges, strategies, and importance of core outcome set development [^113feR8W]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Core Outcome Sets for COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 condition

A number of COVID-19-related COS are registered at the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative web-registry of planned, ongoing, and completed COS studies. These initiatives provide clinicians, researchers, and policymakers with important information on the relevant aspects of COVID-19 and allow for the generation of harmonised high-quality data. Notably, COVID-19 COS development projects were undertaken in a rapid fashion, in contrast with the usual COS development process which typically takes several years.

Although none of the available COVID-19-related COS projects is solely dedicated to the post-COVID-19 condition, some include outcomes for "rehabilitation period", "longer term impacts", and "recovery" outcomes. Despite a well-established and standardised approach to COS development, which is generally guided by the COMET Handbook, the development of COS for the post-COVID-19 condition may be a complex task given the diversity and multisystem nature of infection sequelae. COS previously developed for other conditions, which may be relevant for people recovering from COVID-19, should be considered a potential option for certain groups of individuals (e.g. acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors after hospital discharge). We reviewed studies; assessed in the living systematic review of long COVID, data from the clinical trial registries, and available case report forms; and outlined outcomes previously measured in long COVID studies (Table 1).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113P1VF3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

### Urgent needs to accelerate the race for COVID-19 therapeutics [^117KLtoy]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

On December 8, 2020, a 91-year-old woman made history as the first person to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom. Worldwide vaccination coverage will take time, especially in low-middle-income countries (LMICs) where access to coronavirus vaccines is limited and health systems are ill equipped to deal with sustained pressures associated with COVID-19. Meanwhile, hospital and critical care capacity will remain strained and basic therapies, including oxygen, are in urgent short supply.

COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted the world's poorest and most vulnerable, posing additional challenges in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to basic supportive therapies, there are still not enough effective therapeutic interventions widely available. There remains an urgent need to develop efficacious COVID-19 therapeutics to prevent severity and mortality, and to forestall the collapse of overburdened health systems in resource-limited settings.

It has been over a year since the world's biomedical community began to contend this novel coronavirus. Having effective treatments to target COVID-19 stages would lead to significant benefits. These include treatments to (i) prevent the development of infections (ii) prevent disease progression, and (iii) reduce mortality. To better understand COVID-19 therapeutics, much had to be learned about the virus, disease evolution, how to conduct trials under pandemic conditions, and how to link testing and treatment strategies.

Two major therapeutic strategies based on disease pathophysiology were developed: antiviral agents, which aim to stop virus spread in the respiratory tract, and host-directed therapeutics (anti-inflammatory and immunomodulators), which have mostly become later-stage interventions aimed at preventing downstream consequences of severe COVID-19.

### Pharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review [^115EA7jr]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection.

Observations

No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions and Relevance

The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — recommendation on lopinavir/ritonavir: The panel determined the certainty of evidence to be moderate due to concerns with imprecision for most critical outcomes across indications, and the guideline panel made a strong recommendation against treatment with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir for post-exposure prophylaxis, and ambulatory as well as hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The guideline panel recommends against treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir across patient groups at risk for or with COVID-19.

### What next? New drugs, old drugs, and new challenges in choosing treatments for COVID-19 [^115G5SmU]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Much has changed since March 2020, when the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic and clinicians around the world began desperately searching for therapies that could help afflicted patients. Barely 2.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, we have solid evidence for the efficacy and safety of repurposed and novel agents for pre- and postexposure prophylaxis and for mild and severe disease, not to mention highly effective vaccines.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

Certainty of evidence assessment

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We made judgments of imprecision using the minimally important difference as a threshold and therefore rated certainty for each outcome in an important or unimportant effect. The corresponding WHO GDG decided and agreed on the following minimally important differences to inform therapeutic recommendations for patients with non-severe covid-19: mortality — 3 per 1000; mechanical ventilation — 15 per 1000; admission to hospital — 15 per 1000; adverse effects leading to discontinuation — 15 per 1000; patients with long covid — 20 per 1000; duration of hospital stay — 1 day; time to symptom resolution — 1 day.

Reviewers rated the certainty of outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. As fewer than 10 studies are included in the pooled estimate, we could not assess publication bias statistically. However, our search strategy included several databases, trial registries, and preprint repositories to capture published and unpublished studies, reducing the likelihood of missing relevant trials. Therefore, our approach reduces the risk of publication bias, but does not rule it out. We used standardised lay language to interpret and communicate the results, reflecting the level of certainty in the evidence.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were part of the WHO guideline development group and were involved in the outcome selection and generation of WHO recommendations, and therefore, in the outcome selection for this systematic review. On publication, the findings of the review will be disseminated to relevant patients and the public.

### JAK inhibitors and COVID-19 [^114FVoJw]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

As more molecules keep being approved in emergency for treatment of COVID-19, RCTs are important to compare their definitive effect and determine the best indication(s) for each molecule. Also, RCTs with combination therapies would be all the more important for patient who might be already on treatment with JAKi — which it might be dangerous to stop abruptly in an emergency situation.

More data will emerge on secondary effects of JAKi in the setting of COVID-19. For example, both JAKi and COVID-19 were linked to potential thrombotic risk of their own but no evidence to date exist for an increased thrombotic risk while using JAKi for treating COVID-19. Moreover, adverse effects known from long-term treatment with JAKi, as immunosuppression, are less likely to be relevant in COVID-19, where treatment is of short duration, but should be kept in mind.

Table 1
Studies registered in ICTRP for post COVID-19 condition (as of February 2023)

Due to this rapid production of many trials and the urgency to critically appraise, synthesise and disseminate the evidence, the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) developed the 'Living rapid review for post COVID-19 interventions'. This initiative, well received by the Member States and the scientific community of the region, has become a practical and timely tool for technical cooperation. The detailed methodology including analysis and result interpretation is available from.

At the time of drafting this article, the PAHO living rapid review summarised 47 potential therapeutic options for post-acute and post COVID-19 condition from 65 RCTs. Twenty-six per cent (n = 17) of trials assessed repurposed drugs, 46% (n = 30) tested non-pharmacological interventions and 18% (n = 12) trials were on natural supplements. At present, there are no ongoing trials on newly developed drugs to address this condition.

The certainty of the evidence for most of the interventions was low or very low, which means that currently there is no drug that is proved to be effective for the management of patients with long COVID. A trial assessing 'respiratory training' which is a non-pharmaceutical intervention for patients with respiratory symptoms has a moderate certainty of evidence. We grouped the interventions according to main organ/systems affected and assessed the certainty of evidence as summarised in table 2.

Table 2
Summary of findings by affected organ/system

Although there are currently no broadly effective treatments for long COVID, treatments for certain components have been effective for subsets of populations (table 2) including symptom-specific pharmacological options. Respiratory training is the only intervention that showed important benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms due to long COVID, with moderate to high certainty. Other interventions showed promising results but with low certainty evidence, for example, Actovegin potentially addresses asthenia/fatigue and respiratory symptoms, anticoagulant regimens are a promising way to address abnormal clotting, and palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin supplements have shown promise in treating olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction. These interventions deserve further study.

### Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: understanding and addressing the burden of multisystem manifestations [^113k4xus]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop symptoms that persist well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19 or emerge after the acute phase, lasting for weeks or months after the initial acute illness. The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, which include physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments, are known collectively as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition. The substantial burden of this multisystem condition is felt at individual, health-care system, and socioeconomic levels, on an unprecedented scale. Survivors of COVID-19-related critical illness are at risk of the well known sequelae of acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and chronic critical illness, and these multidimensional morbidities might be difficult to differentiate from the specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We provide an overview of the manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition after critical illness in adults. We explore the effects on various organ systems, describe potential pathophysiological mechanisms, and consider the challenges of providing clinical care and support for survivors of critical illness with multisystem manifestations. Research is needed to reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19-related critical illness and to optimise therapeutic and rehabilitative care and support for patients.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — convalescent plasma: Section last reviewed and updated on 2/22/2023. Last literature search conducted 1/31/2023. Recommendation 13 (UPDATED 2/22/2023): Among immunocompetent patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel recommends against COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty of evidence). Recommendation 14 (NEW 2/22/2023): Among immunocompromised patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who do not qualify for other treatments, who place a higher value on the uncertain mortality reduction and a lower value on the potential adverse effects of convalescent plasma would reasonably select convalescent plasma.

Executive summary — interpretation of recommendation strength and clinical-trial use policy states that, per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", and that "recommend" indicates strong recommendations while "suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. It also notes that when promising interventions were judged to have insufficient evidence of benefit with potential appreciable harms or costs, the expert panel recommended their use in the context of a clinical trial, acknowledging the current "knowledge gap" and aiming at avoiding premature favorable recommendations for potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### COVID-19 treatments: then and now [^115DhzUS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved over the past 3+ years, and strategies to prevent illness and treat infection have changed over time. As COVID-19 transitions from a pandemic to an endemic infection, widespread nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and governmental policies requiring social distancing have given way to more selective strategies for risk mitigation. Monoclonal antibody therapies used for disease prevention and treatment lost utility owing to the emergence of resistant viral variants. Oral antiviral medications have become the mainstay of treatment in nonhospitalized individuals, whereas systemic corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy in those requiring supplemental oxygen. Emerging literature also supports the use of additional immune-modulating therapies in select admitted patients. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both unprecedented research and development of medical interventions while also drawing attention to significant pitfalls in the global response. This review provides a comprehensive update in prevention and management of COVID-19.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1176iEkQ]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Implications for practice and research

The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis will inform the WHO clinical practice guideline on metformin in patients with non-severe covid-19. Because the only finding suggesting a beneficial effect of metformin is the reduction in long covid, and that finding is informed by low certainty evidence from a single trial, more randomised trials are needed to provide definitive evidence. Future randomised controlled trials should aim to include larger and more diverse populations to ensure broader applicability of findings. Studies should prioritise enrolling patients admitted to hospital and those who have been vaccinated because these groups are underrepresented in existing randomised controlled trials. Establishing a consistent diagnostic approach and a standardised definition for long covid would strengthen outcome assessment and comparability across studies. Additional research into the mechanisms through which metformin might affect viral dynamics and inflammatory responses could further clarify its role in long covid and as an adjunct treatment in covid-19. Future research addressing these gaps might provide more substantial evidence to guide clinical practice and optimise the use of metformin in managing patients with covid-19.

Conclusions

Low certainty evidence suggests that metformin might have little or no impact on mortality when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection. The effects of metformin on admission to hospital remain uncertain, and it shows little or no difference in adverse effects leading to discontinuation. Metformin might reduce incidence of long covid when used to treat patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection, but this was suggested by low certainty evidence from a single trial. Further research is required to establish the impact of metformin on long covid.

### Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges [^112y4RNp]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Long COVID: rapid evidence review [^113JDxja]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

### Rehabilitation interventions for physical capacity and quality of life in adults with post-COVID-19 condition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115UjJ6i]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Current rehabilitation guidelines for patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) are primarily based on expert opinions and observational data, and there is an urgent need for evidence-based rehabilitation interventions to support patients with PCC.

Objective

To synthesize the findings of existing studies that report on physical capacity (including functional exercise capacity, muscle function, dyspnea, and respiratory function) and quality of life outcomes following rehabilitation interventions in patients with PCC.

Data Sources

A systematic electronic search was performed from January 2020 until February 2023, in MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Clinical Trials Registry. Key terms that were used to identify potentially relevant studies included long-covid, post-covid, sequelae, exercise therapy, rehabilitation, physical activity, physical therapy, and randomized controlled trial.

Study Selection

This study included randomized clinical trials that compared respiratory training and exercise-based rehabilitation interventions with either placebo, usual care, waiting list, or control in patients with PCC.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. A pairwise bayesian random-effects meta-analysis was performed using vague prior distributions. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool version 2, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE system by 2 independent researchers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was functional exercise capacity, measured at the closest postintervention time point by the 6-minute walking test. Secondary outcomes were fatigue, lower limb muscle function, dyspnea, respiratory function, and quality of life. All outcomes were defined a priori. Continuous outcomes were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) and binary outcomes were summarized as odds ratios with 95% CrIs. The between-trial heterogeneity was quantified using the between-study variance, τ², and 95% CrIs.

Results

Of 1834 identified records, 1193 were screened, and 14 trials (1244 patients; 45% female participants; median [IQR] age, 50 [47 to 56] years) were included in the analyses. Rehabilitation interventions were associated with improvements in functional exercise capacity (SMD, -0.56; 95% CrI, -0.87 to -0.22) with moderate certainty in 7 trials (389 participants). These improvements had a 99% posterior probability of superiority when compared with current standard care. The value of τ² (0.04; 95% CrI, 0.00 to 0.60) indicated low statistical heterogeneity. However, there was significant uncertainty and imprecision regarding the probability of experiencing exercise-induced adverse events (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CrI, 0.32 to 9.94).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that rehabilitation interventions are associated with improvements in functional exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life, with a high probability of improvement compared with the current standard care; the certainty of evidence was moderate for functional exercise capacity and quality of life and low for other outcomes. Given the uncertainty surrounding the safety outcomes, additional trials with enhanced monitoring of adverse events are necessary.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a combination of education, skills training on energy conservation techniques (such as pacing approaches), and a cautious return to symptom-titrated physical exercise training (in the absence of post-exertional symptom exacerbation) for the clinical rehabilitation management of fatigue in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Consider providing training in the use of assistive products and environmental modifications in patients experiencing levels of fatigue limiting instrumental activities of daily living. Consider offering psychological support to support coping with the symptom.

### COVID-19 drug discovery and treatment options [^115zAruS]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, and serious social and economic disruptions worldwide. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated older individuals with underlying diseases are especially prone to severe disease. In patients with non-fatal disease, long COVID affecting multiple body systems may persist for months. Unlike SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which have either been mitigated or remained geographically restricted, SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated globally and is likely to continue circulating in humans with possible emergence of new variants that may render vaccines less effective. Thus, safe, effective and readily available COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. In this Review, we summarize the major drug discovery approaches, preclinical antiviral evaluation models, representative virus-targeting and host-targeting therapeutic options, and key therapeutics currently in clinical use for COVID-19. Preparedness against future coronavirus pandemics relies not only on effective vaccines but also on broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved viral components or universal host targets, and new therapeutics that can precisely modulate the immune response during infection.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114rz56i]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Given the biological rationale for metformin use in covid-19, investigators have conducted several observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with results summarised in systematic reviews; however, these reviews have limitations. Several reviews included low quality observational studies and did not incorporate data from recent randomised controlled trials. One review of randomised controlled trials omitted a formal quantitative meta-analysis and did not adhere to current GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluations) guidance. Initial randomised controlled trials assessing intervention effects on non-severe covid-19 did not address long covid, and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline development group (GDG) responsible for WHO covid-19 guidelines did not identify long covid as a key outcome. Additionally, previous reviews did not consider the role of metformin in preventing and treating long covid. When the metformin trial addressing long covid was published, the GDG added long covid as a key outcome for studies of treatment for non-severe covid-19. The GDG also commissioned this review to support their clinical guidelines on metformin in patients with non-severe covid-19, including long covid, a previously unaddressed outcome.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Drug treatments for COVID-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113dpQ9y]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As of 23 March 2022, more than 475 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19); of these, more than six million have died. Despite global efforts to identify effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of covid-19, which have resulted in approximately 3000 trials completed or underway, evidence for effective treatment remains limited.

Summarising the rapidly growing evidence base has been a challenge. Living systematic reviews deal with the main limitation of traditional reviews — that of providing an overview of the relevant evidence only at a specific time. This is crucial in the context of covid-19, in which the best evidence is constantly changing. The ability of a living network meta-analysis to present a complete, broad, and updated view of the evidence makes it the best type of evidence synthesis to inform the development of practice recommendations. Network meta-analysis, rather than pairwise meta-analysis, provides useful information about the comparative effectiveness of treatments that have not been tested head to head. The lack of such direct comparisons is certain to limit inferences in the covid-19 setting. Moreover, the incorporation of indirect evidence can strengthen evidence in comparisons that were tested head to head.

### Rehabilitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with long COVID: position statement [^115qgzmV]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Long COVID, a term used to describe ongoing symptoms after COVID-19 infection, parallels the course of other postviral syndromes. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of long COVID can be persistent and interfere with quality of life and functioning. Within the biopsychosocial framework of chronic illness, rehabilitation professionals can address the neuropsychiatric sequelae of long COVID. However, current practice models are not designed to address concurrent psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in adults living with long COVID. Thus, we present a biopsychosocial framework for long COVID and provide treatment strategies based on evidence from current literature of postviral chronic illness. These recommendations will guide rehabilitation professionals in identifying common neuropsychiatric symptoms in long COVID that can be targeted for intervention and addressing these symptoms via integrative interventions taking into account the biopsychosocial presentation of long COVID symptoms.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has led to a pandemic of acute respiratory illness. Pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 have included treatments that target infection prevention, prevention of viral replication, reduce inflammation, and manage symptoms of respiratory failure caused by the disease. This is a review of key pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 based on peer-reviewed articles from 2020.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: perspectives and lessons learned [^112YJtzt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

Methods

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

Recommendations

The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

### Comparison of WHO versus national COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines across the world: not exactly a perfect match [^1171ZNcX]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Publicly available COVID-19 National Guidelines vary substantially in their therapeutic recommendations. Ineffective, unaffordable and unavailable therapies are widely recommended, particularly in low-resource settings. The formalisation of processes in the development of NGs for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is essential for ensuring that these guidelines are grounded in the best available evidence. A systematic and structured approach would not only enhance the credibility of the guidelines but could also contribute to their effectiveness in guiding public health interventions, especially in a pandemic setting.

### A multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach to chronic pain patients in the post-COVID-19 era [^112MJpdC]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The global health care system has been shaken by the unprecedented pandemic. Chronic pain management has suffered through the pandemic due to lack of access and challenges in care delivery only to be faced by a new set of chronic pain conditions resulting from prolonged and persistent COVID-19 symptoms referred to as "long COVID syndrome".

Objectives

Long COVID is emerging as a complex and debilitating condition that occurs in a subpopulation of patients following acute COVID-19 infection. Our goals were to explore how to best treat and manage long COVID syndrome based on current experience.

Methods

This is a perspective rather than a systematic review. It is based on the limited available literature and current clinical experience.

Results

Although a few pharmacological agents have been proposed to mitigate symptoms, none have emerged to provide meaningful, long-term pain relief. Long COVID is associated with numerous and diverse symptoms. Risk factors for developing long COVID subsequent to acute COVID-19 remain unknown. Due to the multidimensional impact of long COVID chronic pain, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model has been proposed to relieve pain, restore function, and maximize quality of life.

Limitations

This is a perspective with an editorial point of view rather than a systematic literature study. Long COVID syndrome is a new condition, with which no clinicians have extensive experience. This is not a systematic review so there is no Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram. This is not a clinical study so there was no need for institutional review board approvals.

Conclusions

Treatment goals for the postviral syndrome of long COVID are multifaceted. In addition to pain control, patients may have functional deficits, cognitive issues, mental health issues, and reduced quality of life. Thus, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model seems most appropriate to manage long COVID.

Key Words

Chronic pain, long COVID, pandemic, COVID-19, brain fog, fatigue, pain program, functional restoration, back pain, joint pain.

### Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: a narrative review [^113MDbQs]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

"Long COVID", a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.

Methods/Results

In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.

Conclusions

Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

### Respiratory sequelae of COVID-19: pulmonary and extrapulmonary origins, and approaches to clinical care and rehabilitation [^115K8hNQ]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Although the exact prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) is unknown, more than a third of patients with COVID-19 develop symptoms that persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These sequelae are highly heterogeneous in nature and adversely affect multiple biological systems, although breathlessness is a frequently cited symptom. Specific pulmonary sequelae, including pulmonary fibrosis and thromboembolic disease, need careful assessment and might require particular investigations and treatments. COVID-19 outcomes in people with pre-existing respiratory conditions vary according to the nature and severity of the respiratory disease and how well it is controlled. Extrapulmonary complications such as reduced exercise tolerance and frailty might contribute to breathlessness in post-COVID-19 condition. Non-pharmacological therapeutic options, including adapted pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and physiotherapy techniques for breathing management, might help to attenuate breathlessness in people with post-COVID-19 condition. Further research is needed to understand the origins and course of respiratory symptoms and to develop effective therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies.

### Interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID: a systematic review of registered trials [^1135V2uA]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a substantial proportion are experiencing ongoing symptoms for months after infection, known as 'long COVID'. Long COVID is associated with a wide range of physical and neuropsychological symptoms, including impacts on mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing. However, intervention research is only beginning to emerge. This systematic review synthesizes currently registered trials examining interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in patients with long COVID.

Methods

Standard systematic review guidelines were followed. Trials registered in two large trial registries in 2020 to May 2022 were reviewed. Included studies were narratively synthesized by type of intervention and a risk-of-bias assessment was conducted.

Results

Forty-two registered trials were included, with a total target sample size of 5814 participants. These include 11 psychological interventions, five pharmacological and other medical interventions, and five evaluating herbal, nutritional, or natural supplement interventions. An additional nine trials are examining cognitive and neurorehabilitation interventions and 12 are examining physiotherapy or physical rehabilitation. Most trials are randomized, but many are feasibility trials; trials are evaluating a wide spectrum of outcomes.

Conclusions

While there is a newly emerging body of research testing interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID, the breadth and scope of the research remains limited. It is urgently incumbent on researchers to expand upon the intervention research currently under way, in order to generate high-quality evidence on a wide range of candidate interventions for diverse long COVID patient populations.

### ESCMID rapid guidelines for assessment and management of long COVID [^114tNeiy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of individuals with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 infection and to provide a definition for this entity, termed 'long COVID'.

Methods

We performed a search of the literature on studies addressing epidemiology, symptoms, assessment, and treatment of long COVID. The recommendations were grouped by these headings and by organ systems for assessment and treatment. An expert opinion definition of long COVID is provided. Symptoms were reviewed by a search of the available literature. For assessment recommendations, we aimed to perform a diagnostic meta-analysis, but no studies provided relevant results. For treatment recommendations we performed a systematic review of the literature in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We aimed to evaluate patient-related outcomes, including quality of life, return to baseline physical activity, and return to work. Quality assessment of studies included in the systematic review is provided according to study design.

Recommendations

Evidence was insufficient to provide any recommendation other than conditional guidance. The panel recommends considering routine blood tests, chest imaging, and pulmonary functions tests for patients with persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 months. Other tests should be performed mainly to exclude other conditions according to symptoms. For management, no evidence-based recommendations could be provided. Physical and respiratory rehabilitation should be considered. On the basis of limited evidence, the panel suggests designing high-quality prospective clinical studies/trials, including a control group, to further evaluate the assessment and management of individuals with persistent symptoms of COVID-19.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pharmacologic treatments for children: research priorities and approach to pediatric studies [^114w9AU8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials of pharmacologic treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being rapidly designed and implemented in adults. Children are often not considered during development of novel treatments for infectious diseases until very late. Although children appear to have a lower risk compared with adults of severe COVID-19 disease, a substantial number of children globally will benefit from pharmacologic treatments. It will be reasonable to extrapolate efficacy of most treatments from adult trials to children. Pediatric trials should focus on characterizing a treatment's pharmacokinetics, optimal dose, and safety across the age spectrum. These trials should use an adaptive design to efficiently add or remove arms in what will be a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, and should involve a large number of sites across the globe in a collaborative effort to facilitate efficient implementation. All stakeholders must commit to equitable access to any effective, safe treatment for children everywhere.

### Repurposing existing drugs for COVID-19: an endocrinology perspective [^112AMxH3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Except for dexamethasone in severe COVID-19, while effective and safe drugs for SARS-CoV-2 lack, researches should be encouraged to consider testing existing drugs with well-established safety profile, known risks and contraindications, notorious clinical management, favorable cost-effectiveness, and promising results in COVID-19. Specific combination of some of the candidates for COVID-19 may exhibit synergistic effects for COVID-19, and should also be considered for clinical trials.

Besides tested in clinical trials for COVID-19, drug classes listed as candidates for COVID-19 should also be evaluated in patients using these drugs regular- and chronically for original purposes, before COVID-19 is installed, since acute and chronic use of overall drugs may present distinct effects.

Finally, it must be emphasized that regardless of theoretical potential to protect from COVID-19 or preliminary favorable outcomes, drug treatment for COVID-19 patients must be prescribed only after consistent demonstration of efficacy in randomized clinical trials. After proven efficacy, use of drug must be restricted for patients in the specific stage of COVID-19 for which drug has demonstrated efficacy, since drugs can lead to opposite results, as demonstrated with dexamethasone, which while reduced mortality in critically ill patients, subgroup analysis suggested that its use in mild and non-hospitalized patients led to increased mortality. Drugs must prove efficacy in terms of reduction of hospitalization, need of intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and death, and prevention of long-term pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and other physical and mental consequences, in order to be clinically used.

### Drug treatments for COVID-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111P9jqd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This living systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence for drug treatments of covid-19 up to 1 December 2021 and a comprehensive list of drug trials to 3 December 2021. There are now more than 400 randomised trials examining many different interventions for treating covid-19, and as a result, the certainty in evidence for multiple interventions is improved.

For patients with severe covid-19, three anti-inflammatory drugs probably reduce mortality: systemic corticosteroids, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists (when given with systemic corticosteroids), and Janus kinase inhibitors. Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists, when co-administered with systemic corticosteroids, also probably reduce mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. When they are provided without systemic corticosteroids, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists might not reduce mortality or length of hospital stay. The subgroup effect is consistent with evidence from other meta-analyses. A single dose of either sarilumab and tocilizumab appears to be similarly efficacious.

These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### Challenges to delivering evidence-based management for long COVID [^1167jXYU]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

What is the current evidence for the management of long COVID?

Government, non-government organisations and academe have taken steps to support, fund and conduct research on repurposed drugs, newly developed medications and non-pharmacological interventions that may alleviate symptoms and optimise function and quality of life for patients with post COVID-19 condition; as well as disseminate research findings to raise awareness and understanding among the public and health professionals of post COVID-19 symptoms. Patient networks are also influencing the research agenda and accelerating progress in research.

Most trials recruited patients with persistent symptoms after a specific time range (usually 3 or more months since acute infection) and focused on fatigue, asthenia and respiratory symptoms. Most frequently reported outcomes included symptom improvement (usually assessed with specific scales) and health-related quality of life.

This has led to the implementation of large-scale trials, such as the US National Institutes of Health $1.5 billion RECOVER studyand the UK STIMULATE-ICP study. Due to the multiple pathogenesis and varied clinical presentations of post COVID-19 condition, medical management is vast and tailored at an individual level. This has led to the production of small-scale and large-scale clinical trials as reflected in the International Clinical Trial Registry (ICTRP). As of February 2023, 444 interventional studies and 342 observation studies on post COVID/ long COVID were registered in the ICTRP (table 1). There were 314 randomised trials from 36 countries, 81 studies testing drug interventions, 26 studies on homeopathic or supplementals, and 175 trials on non-pharmacological interventions.

Search strategy

We worked with an experienced research librarian to search Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and CINAHL from inception to December 2023 (see supplement 1). Our search combined terms related to long covid with a filter for randomised trials. In February 2024, we supplemented our search using the Epistemonikos covid-19 Repository — a living catalogue of covid-19 research — and by reviewing the references of relevant systematic reviews and soliciting experts for eligible trials.

Study selection

Following training and calibration exercises to ensure sufficient agreement, pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen the titles and abstracts of search records and subsequently the full texts of articles considered potentially eligible. We used the online systematic review software Covidence to assist with screening. Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion, or, if necessary, adjudication by a third reviewer.

Data extraction

Following training and calibration exercises to ensure sufficient agreement, pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to collect data from eligible trials using a pilot tested Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2019). Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. A third experienced reviewer checked all consensus data to confirm accuracy.

Reviewers collected data on trial characteristics (eg, trial design, country of origin, funding sources, diagnostic criteria for long covid), patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, employment and education status, receipt of covid-19 vaccination, method of acute covid-19 diagnosis, severity of acute covid-19 infection, duration of long covid symptoms, number of covid-19 infections, long covid symptoms), characteristics of interventions and comparators (eg, type of intervention, treatment duration), and patient important outcomes. Our outcomes of interest were informed by a published core outcome set for long covidand discussions with patient partners and clinicians. We included fatigue, pain, post-exertional malaise, changes in education or employment status, cognitive function, mental health, dyspnoea, quality of life, patient reported physical function, recovery or improvement, and serious adverse events (as defined by each trial). We extracted data for all instruments used in trials that measured any of our outcomes of interest.

### Lessons learned from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies: critical perspectives from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 treatment guideline panel [^115J4Lwq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the challenges of the pandemic, there has been substantial progress with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies. Pivotal COVID-19 trials like SOLIDARITY, RECOVERY, and ACCT-1 were rapidly conducted and data disseminated to support effective therapies. However, critical shortcomings remain on trial conduct, dissemination and interpretation of study results, and regulatory guidance in pandemic settings. The lessons that we learned have implications for both the current pandemic and future emerging infectious diseases. There is a need for establishing and standardizing clinical meaningful outcomes in therapeutic trials and for targeting defined populations and phenotypes that will most benefit from specific therapies. Standardized processes should be established for rapid and critical data review and dissemination to ensure scientific integrity. Clarity around the evidence standards needed for issuance of both emergency use authorization (EUA) and biologic license application (BLA) should be established and an infrastructure for executing rapid trials in epidemic settings maintained.

### Drug treatments for mild or moderate COVID-19: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1164Z5M6]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As of November 2024, more than seven million people have died with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). The evidence on covid-19 continues to evolve as global efforts to identify effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 have resulted in more than 8000 completed or ongoing trials.

Summarising the rapidly growing evidence base has proved challenging. Network meta-analysis, rather than pairwise meta-analysis, provides useful information about the comparative effectiveness of treatments that have not been tested head-to-head. The lack of such direct comparisons can otherwise limit our understanding of important comparisons, and the incorporation of indirect evidence can strengthen evidence in comparisons that were tested head-to-head.

The current evidence supports two stages of covid-19 disease, an early phase marked by viral replication (non-severe disease) and a later inflammatory phase (severe disease). The different pathogenesis and resulting severity of symptoms at each of these stages suggest different interventions are most effective at certain stages of the disease. Consequently, our systematic review and network meta-analysis now addresses patients with mild or moderate covid-19 (also known as non-severe covid-19) separate from those with severe covid-19. In this publication, we compare the effects of drug treatments for mild or moderate covid-19. A separate publication will compare the effects of drug treatments for severe or critical covid-19, and together these two publications replace our previous living systematic review of covid-19 of all severities. Although we used living systematic review methods to conduct this review, no further updates or analyses are planned, and this publication represents our final analysis for mild or moderate covid-19. This systematic review and network meta-analysis will inform the World Health Organization living guidelines on covid-19 treatments. These guidelines were initiated and are dynamically updated to provide trustworthy, actionable, and living guidance to clinicians and patients soon after new and potentially practice-changing evidence becomes available (box 1). Drugs for prophylaxisand antibody based treatmentsare addressed separately.

### Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges [^111GRF1z]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Challenges in treating COVID-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which appeared in December 2019, presents a global challenge, particularly in the rapid increase of critically ill patients with pneumonia and absence of definitive treatment. To date, over 81,000 cases have been confirmed, with over 2700 deaths. The mortality appears to be around 2%; early published data indicate 25.9% with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required ICU admission and 20.1% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.

There is presently no vaccine or specific anti-viral drug regime used to treat critically ill patients. The management of patients mainly focuses on the provision of supportive care, e.g. oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid management. Combination treatment of low-dose systematic corticosteroids and anti-virals and atomization inhalation of interferon have been encouraged as part of critical COVID-19 management. Other reported therapeutic agents that are used for the treatment of seriously ill patients have been noted in Table 1.

### Outpatient management of COVID-19: rapid evidence review [^112pdBpk]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

New COVID-19 variants of concern continue to develop. Incubation period, transmissibility, immune escape, and treatment effectiveness differ by variants of concern. Physicians should be aware that the characteristics of the predominant variants of concern determine aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Multiple testing modalities exist; the most appropriate testing strategy varies depending on the clinical scenario, with factors of test sensitivity, turnaround time, and the expertise required for specimen collection. Three types of vaccines are available in the United States, and all people six months and older should be encouraged to receive one because vaccination is effective in reducing the incidence of and hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19. Vaccination may also reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., long COVID). Consider medications, such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, as first-line treatment for eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 unless logistical or supply constraints occur. National Institutes of Health guidelines and local health care partner resources can be used to determine eligibility. Long-term health effects of having COVID-19 are under investigation.

### International care programs for pediatric post-COVID condition (long COVID) and the way forward [^116rTZqg]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric Post-COVID-Condition (PPCC) clinics treat children despite limited scientific substantiation. By exploring real-life management of children diagnosed with PPCC, the International Post-COVID-Condition in Children Collaboration (IP4C) aimed to provide guidance for future PPCC care.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional international, multicenter study on used PPCC definitions; the organization of PPCC care programs and patients characteristics. We compared aggregated data from PPCC cohorts and identified priorities to improve PPCC care.

Results

Ten PPCC care programs and six COVID-19 follow-up research cohorts participated. Aggregated data from 584 PPCC patients was analyzed. The most common symptoms included fatigue (71%), headache (55%), concentration difficulties (53%), and brain fog (48%). Severe limitations in daily life were reported in 31% of patients. Most PPCC care programs organized in-person visits with multidisciplinary teams. Diagnostic testing for respiratory and cardiac morbidity was most frequently performed and seldom abnormal. Treatment was often limited to physical therapy and psychological support.

Conclusions

We found substantial heterogeneity in both the diagnostics and management of PPCC, possibly explained by scarce scientific evidence and lack of standardized care. We present a list of components which future guidelines should address, and outline priorities concerning PPCC care pathways, research and international collaboration.

Impact

Pediatric Post-COVID Condition (PPCC) Care programs have been initiated in many countries. Children with PPCC in different countries are affected by similar symptoms, limiting many to participate in daily life. There is substantial heterogeneity in diagnostic testing. Access to specific diagnostic tests is required to identify some long-term COVID-19 sequelae. Treatments provided were limited to physical therapy and psychological support. This study emphasizes the need for evidence-based diagnostics and treatment of PPCC. The International Post-COVID Collaboration for Children (IP4C) provides guidance for guideline development and introduces a framework of priorities for PPCC care and research, to improve PPCC outcomes.

### Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline, 10 November 2023 [^111EQNTr]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to assess for and manage exertional desaturation and cardiac impairment following COVID-19 before offering physical exercise training in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Recognize that the presence of orthostatic intolerance and post-exertional symptom exacerbation, although amenable to rehabilitation, will require interventions to be modified in view of these diagnoses for rehabilitation to be safe.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^112HiRSU]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Persistent symptoms are common after acute COVID-19, often referred to as long COVID. Long COVID may affect the ability to perform activities of daily living, including work. Long COVID occurs more frequently in those with severe acute COVID-19. This guidance statement reviews the pathophysiology of severe acute COVID-19 and long COVID and provides pragmatic approaches to long COVID symptoms, syndromes, and conditions in the occupational setting. Disability laws and workers' compensation are also addressed.

IDSA COVID-19 outpatient therapy — molnupiravir recommendation states that the guideline panel suggests the use of molnupiravir for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who are within five days of symptom onset and have no other treatment options. More data are needed on the potential adverse effects of this medication. The evidence supporting this recommendation will be reassessed with the release of updated published information from newer trials. Outcomes had a high risk of bias so were not considered for making the recommendation.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for long COVID, more specifically with respect to return to normal activities, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering education and skills training on energy conservation techniques and provide training in the use of assistive products in patients requiring further assistance with activity management and mobility for the rehabilitation for a return to everyday activities in post-COVID-19 condition. Consider providing a return to work action plan with a prolonged and flexible phased return. Consider advising environmental modifications at work based on an individualized workplace risk assessment of personal capabilities matched to work requirements.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^114h9MhB]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We submitted our review protocol to MedRxiv in March 2024.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible studies enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with long covid — defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as symptoms at ≥ 3 months after laboratory confirmed, probable, or suspected covid-19 infection that persisted for at least two months — and randomised them either to any drug or non-drug intervention, placebo or sham, usual care, or to alternative drug or non-drug interventions, without any restrictions on date or language of publication. This definition, although broad, is consistent with the most recent definition published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and reflects the limitations in current scientific knowledge about long covid. Based on empirical evidence showing that preprints and published reports of randomised trials generally provide consistent results, we included both preprint and published trial reports.

We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses excluding trials that did not report the time since acute covid-19 infection or the duration of long covid symptoms according to WHO criteria. It was not possible to perform these analyses, however, owing to the limited number of trials addressing each class of intervention and outcome.

We excluded trials if ≥ 20% of patients had recovered from covid-19 less than three months before randomisation; pseudorandomised trials; trials of animals; and trials investigating treatments for acute covid-19 or interventions to prevent long covid. Trials were also excluded that targeted patients experiencing only anosmia and hyposmia after covid-19 infection, as these patients likely form a group that is distinct from those with other typical symptoms of long covid (eg, fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, cognitive impairment). Additionally, we excluded randomised trials with fewer than 25 participants in each arm. Smaller trials are unlikely to meaningfully contribute to meta-analyses, more likely to include unrepresentative samples and arms that are prognostically imbalanced, and at higher risk of publication bias.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — efficacy findings report associations with reduced utilization but uncertain certainty of evidence: Receipt of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was associated with a reduction in hospitalization (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.98; moderate CoE) and a trend toward a reduction in COVID-19 related hospitalizations or medically attended visits (emergency room or urgent care; RR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.00; moderate CoE); similarly, evidence showed a possible reduction of progression to severe respiratory disease (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.94; low CoE), but the evidence remains uncertain and convalescent plasma failed to show or exclude a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality based on the body of evidence from two RCTs (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.14, 1.98; low CoE); additional deaths beyond 15 days were reported in one RCT and included five deaths in the plasma group versus one in the placebo arm.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — convalescent plasma use in patients with limited options: For those with disease who have no other treatment options, the IDSA guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset rather than no high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty of evidence). Other options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir; patient-specific factors and logistical considerations should drive agent choice, and data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting. Remarks note that in the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) only authorizes use in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, and that patients, particularly those who are not immunocompromised, who place a low value on uncertain benefits and a high value on avoiding possible adverse events would reasonably decline convalescent plasma. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Phase-adapted rehabilitation for acute coronavirus disease-19 patients and patient with long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease-19 [^115J5hxu]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, many papers have highlighted the need for the rehabilitation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most papers refer to the need for respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase; however, the fact that the infection also affects other organ systems has to be considered in rehabilitation interventions. Long-term symptoms in many cases severely limit activity and participation and alter quality of life, leading to rehabilitation needs. This article proposes a phase-adapted model of linking the acute, postacute, and long-term symptoms of COVID-19 with the well-established matrix of acute, postacute, and long-term rehabilitation services. A review of currently available recommendations for phase-adapted rehabilitation strategies, including the relevance of prehabilitation within this context, is provided.

### Effect of physical exercise-based rehabilitation on long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ck8k7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The number of persons living with post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) conditions or long COVID continues to rise worldwide; however, the etiology and the treatment of long COVID remain nebulous. Therefore, efficient, feasible, and cost-effective therapeutic strategies for a large population with long COVID remain warranted. Physical exercise-based rehabilitation is a promising strategy for long COVID, although its therapeutic effects remain to be determined. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of physical exercise-based rehabilitation on long COVID.

Methods

The electronic databases Medline, Embase, Global Health (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, WHO Global Research Database on COVID-19, LitCovid, and Google Scholar were searched from their inception to November 2022. The identified articles were independently screened by three reviewers, and a random-effects model was used to determine the mean differences in the meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-three studies involving 1579 individuals who had COVID-19 (752 women) were included. Physical exercise-based rehabilitation showed beneficial effects on long COVID-related symptoms characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and depression, as well as on the 6-min walk test, forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity, and quality of life in people who had COVID-19.

Conclusions

Physical exercise-based rehabilitation is a potential therapeutic strategy against long COVID and can be applied as a routine clinical practice in people who have recovered from COVID-19. However, customized physical exercise-based rehabilitation programs and their effects on specific types of long COVID require future large-scale studies.

### Use of symptom-guided physical activity and exercise rehabilitation for COVID-19 and other postviral conditions [^112dtkZH]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

There are many similarities in symptoms between postviral conditions, including clinical features such as fatigue, reduced daily activity and postexertional symptom exacerbation. Unfavourable responses to exercise have influenced the wider debate on how to reintegrate physical activity (PA) and exercise while simultaneously managing symptoms during recovery from post-COVID-19 syndrome (or Long COVID). This has resulted in inconsistent advice from the scientific and clinical rehabilitation community on how and when to resume PA and exercise following COVID-19 illness. This article provides commentary on the following topics: (1) controversies surrounding graded exercise therapy as a treatment modality for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation; (2) evidence supporting PA promotion, resistance exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness for population health, and the consequences of physical inactivity in patients with complex rehabilitation needs; (3) population-based challenges for UK Defence Rehabilitation practitioners for the management of postviral conditions; and (4) 'symptom guided PA and exercise rehabilitation' as an appropriate treatment option for managing individuals with multifaceted medical needs.

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to antithrombotic therapy (AF), ACCP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation in hospitalized (either non-ICU or ICU) patients with COVID-19 and new-onset AF, irrespective of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Consider initiating long-term oral anticoagulation if the score is ≥ 1 in males or ≥ 2 in females.

### Transparency and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 randomized controlled trials [^1148TmCh]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

This study is part of the COVID-NMA initiative (PROSPERO CRD42020182600). The two first pillars of this initiative are a living mapping and living evidence synthesis of all randomized controlled trials assessing treatments and preventive interventions for COVID-19. All results are updated weekly and made available on an open access platform.

The third pillar of this initiative, which is described in this manuscript, is the monitoring of trial reports in terms of transparency and reporting (protocol on Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.5810076). Because of the context and resource constraints, the scope was reduced to trials of pharmacological treatments and to the assessment of transparency, completeness, and consistency of reporting. Because of the role of preprint in scholarly communication, we added the comparison between preprint and related peer-reviewed publication.

Study design

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials published for the treatments of COVID-19 up to May 31, 2021.

Eligibility criteria

We included RCTs assessing pharmacological treatments such as antivirals, interferons, other antimicrobials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamins, kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants, antithrombotic but also convalescent plasma, and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP).

Trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. prone positioning, physiotherapy), pharmacological treatment of long-COVID, and preventive interventions, including vaccines, were excluded. Studies that did not randomly allocate patients to a treatment arm (e.g. quasi-randomized studies, phase one trials, single-arm trials) and modeling studies of interventions for COVID-19 were also excluded. We included trials published as research articles (i.e. full report), while other publication formats (e.g. conference abstracts or comments) were excluded. We only included trials written in English.
