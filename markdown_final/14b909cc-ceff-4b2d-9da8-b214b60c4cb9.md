## Question

whats the approach to patient with microproteinuria, urine protein of 257 mg/day

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the approach to evaluating and managing a patient with 257 mg/day of urinary protein, i.e., "microproteinuria". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the proteinuria and characterizing it correctly. Then, I should verify chronicity and stage CKD using GFR and albuminuria categories. Next, I will evaluate etiologies, including diabetic kidney disease, primary glomerular disease, and tubular or overflow causes. After that, I need to assess cardiovascular and renal risk and set monitoring intervals. Finally, I will outline initial management, including blood pressure targets, RAAS blockade, lifestyle measures, and when to refer to nephrology, while double-checking thresholds and exceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the proteinuria and make sure I am using the right terminology. Wait, let me verify the threshold: "microproteinuria" is not a standard term; I should classify this as moderately increased albuminuria (formerly microalbuminuria) if the albumin excretion is 30–300 mg/day, or simply as non-nephrotic proteinuria if total protein is 257 mg/day, which falls below nephrotic-range definitions. I need to check whether this 257 mg/day represents total protein or albumin; if it is total protein, the albumin fraction is typically about 60–80%, so the albumin excretion would likely be in the 150–200 mg/day range, consistent with A2 albuminuria. I should confirm with a first-morning urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and repeat to ensure persistence, because transient elevations are common and confirmation is required before labeling CKD [^117ErQGq] [^1175ZuJn] [^1151kJym].

> Hold on, I should verify the best confirmatory approach. KDIGO and KDOQI recommend using a first-morning ACR as the preferred initial test. If ACR is ≥ 30 mg/g, I should repeat with another first-morning sample to confirm persistence, ideally over 3–6 months, before assigning an albuminuria category. If non-albumin proteins are suspected (e.g., light chains), I need to ensure I order specific assays. Only if immunosuppression is being considered or if there is discordance would I pursue a 24-hour collection for total protein or albumin excretion rate, given the logistical burden and limited added value in most CKD evaluations [^117ErQGq] [^1175ZuJn] [^114ZHmzt].

> Next, I should review chronicity and CKD staging. I need to ensure persistence beyond 3 months or document prior abnormal results to establish chronic kidney disease. CKD is defined by either kidney damage markers (including albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/day or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² persisting for at least 3 months. I should calculate eGFR using CKD-EPI from serum creatinine and, if needed, cystatin C for better accuracy, then classify GFR categories G1–G5 and albuminuria categories A1–A3 to inform risk and follow-up frequency [^114RathD] [^115REmR6] [^117R5P3C].

> I will now examine likely etiologies. Let me consider diabetic kidney disease first, since diabetes is the leading cause of albuminuria. I should confirm diabetes status, assess glycemic control, and look for retinopathy as supportive evidence. If diabetes is absent or atypical features are present, I should evaluate for primary glomerular diseases and consider serologies guided by clinical context. But wait, what if the protein is mostly non-albumin? I should double-check for tubular proteinuria or overflow states (e.g., light chains) with a urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation if indicated, and consider uAPR to estimate glomerular versus tubulointerstitial predominance when PCR is ≥ 200 mg/g [^112bBHEU] [^11368Ms7] [^117R5P3C].

> I need to ensure I am framing risk appropriately. Moderately increased albuminuria (A2) independently increases risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality, and the combination of reduced eGFR and albuminuria amplifies risk. I should confirm that the patient's risk is stratified on the KDIGO heat map and set monitoring frequency accordingly; higher-risk patients warrant more frequent albuminuria and eGFR checks, with a practical threshold to escalate evaluation if ACR doubles or eGFR falls by more than 20–30% depending on context and therapies initiated [^1149n6iE] [^112g2Y3D] [^117R5P3C].

> Now, I should outline initial management while I double-check blood pressure targets. For patients with CKD and albuminuria, first-line therapy includes RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose change. Blood pressure should generally be lowered toward < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, recognizing that 130–139 mmHg systolic may be acceptable in some patients; I should individualize based on tolerance and eGFR changes. If albuminuria remains ≥ 300 mg/g despite optimized RAAS blockade, I should consider adding an SGLT2 inhibitor in appropriate patients, and if still persistently elevated, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as finerenone can be considered, especially in type 2 diabetes, while watching potassium and kidney function closely [^117Corcw] [^1161d9kB] [^114bM5bH].

> Let me think about lifestyle and supportive measures. I should confirm dietary protein intake around 0.8 g/kg/day in adults with CKD G3–G5, avoiding high protein intake (> 1.3 g/kg/day) in those at risk of progression, and tailor sodium restriction to those with high sodium intake. Weight optimization, physical activity, and smoking cessation should be emphasized. For patients with diabetes, I should target HbA1c around 7% if safe, balancing hypoglycemia risk, and integrate statins and antiplatelet therapy when indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction [^112rSvt4] [^114bM5bH].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and thresholds for action. Annual albuminuria and eGFR assessments are reasonable for stable CKD, but higher-risk patients merit more frequent checks, often every 3–6 months. A doubling of ACR or a > 20% decline in eGFR on subsequent testing exceeds expected variability and should trigger evaluation for progression or acute contributors; after starting hemodynamically active agents like RAAS inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors, a > 30% eGFR decline warrants reassessment of volume status, blood pressure, and concurrent medications. I need to ensure I am not anchoring on a single abnormal value; trends and confirmation are key [^113ZuwxZ] [^112g2Y3D] [^1161d9kB].

> Hold on, I should verify referral triggers. I will refer to nephrology if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², if albuminuria is ≥ 300 mg/g (A3) or proteinuria is > 1 g/day, if there is active urine sediment, rapid eGFR decline, refractory hypertension or electrolyte disturbances, or if the etiology remains unclear after initial workup. For this patient with 257 mg/day total protein, if albumin excretion is confirmed ≥ 300 mg/day or if eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² with other risk features, referral is reasonable; otherwise, primary care management with close follow-up is appropriate [^1138ivYJ] [^117R5P3C] [^114Cgs1r].

> Let me reconsider special contexts briefly. If the patient is on or being considered for nephrotoxic or proteinuria-inducing agents (e.g., certain TKIs), I should align monitoring with drug-specific algorithms that often use spot UPCR for convenience but still require 24-hour urine confirmation at higher proteinuria thresholds. If I suspect orthostatic proteinuria, especially in adolescents, I should split urine collections or use first-morning samples to avoid false positives. If the patient is pregnant, I should apply obstetric thresholds and protocols for proteinuria given different decision points and risks [^112Sj9st] [^116tChsX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the following: confirm with a first-morning ACR and repeat testing to establish persistence, classify CKD by GFR and albuminuria categories, evaluate etiologies with emphasis on diabetes and glomerular disease, initiate RAAS blockade and optimize blood pressure, implement lifestyle measures, and monitor trends with predefined thresholds for escalation and nephrology referral. This structured approach aligns with KDIGO/KDOQI guidance and balances timely intervention with avoidance of overdiagnosis from transient abnormalities [^1118bEds] [^117ErQGq] [^112g2Y3D].

---

A urine protein excretion of 257 mg/day is **moderately increased proteinuria** (A2 albuminuria) and confers a 1.5–2.5-fold higher risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^1149n6iE]. Confirm with a **first-morning ACR or PCR** [^1175ZuJn] and repeat in 3–6 months to establish persistence [^112bBHEU]. Evaluate for diabetes, hypertension, and glomerular disease; check eGFR, electrolytes, and urine microscopy [^113BoctC]. If confirmed, start an ACEi/ARB [^117Corcw], target BP < 130/80 mmHg, and optimize glycemic/lipid control; monitor eGFR and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation [^115zcuh3]. Refer to nephrology if proteinuria rises, eGFR declines > 20% [^112g2Y3D], or the etiology is unclear [^115zcuh3].

---

## Confirm and quantify proteinuria

- **Confirmatory testing**: Use a first-morning urine ACR or PCR [^1175ZuJn] to confirm and quantify proteinuria, as these are preferred over random samples due to lower variability [^113YWT6t].

- **Repeat testing**: Repeat ACR/PCR in 3–6 months to confirm persistence, as transient elevations are common [^112bBHEU].

- **24-hour collection**: Consider a 24-hour urine collection if accurate quantification is needed or if spot tests are inconclusive [^117ErQGq].

---

## Evaluate underlying causes

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Screen for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) with ACR and eGFR, as diabetes is a leading cause of proteinuria [^112bBHEU].

- **Hypertension**: Assess for hypertensive nephropathy, especially if long-standing or poorly controlled [^117R5P3C].

- **Glomerular disease**: Evaluate for primary or secondary glomerulopathies if proteinuria is > 300 mg/day or if hematuria/red cell casts are present [^112fFSEn].

- **Other causes**: Consider interstitial nephritis, reflux nephropathy, or overflow proteinuria (e.g. multiple myeloma) if clinically suspected [^117ErQGq].

---

## Initial laboratory evaluation

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Serum creatinine and eGFR | Assess kidney function and CKD staging [^117GUsQJ] |
| Electrolytes (Na, K, HCO3-) | Identify electrolyte disturbances [^113BoctC] |
| Urine microscopy | Detect hematuria, casts, or infection [^1143meSj] |
| Hemoglobin A1c | Assess glycemic control in diabetes [^114bM5bH] |
| Lipid profile | Assess cardiovascular risk [^notfound] |
| ANA, ANCA, complement levels | Screen for autoimmune glomerulonephritis if suspected [^notfound] |

---

## Risk stratification and prognosis

At 257 mg/day, proteinuria is **moderately increased (A2)** and is associated with a 1.5–2.5-fold higher risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^notfound]. Risk increases with higher proteinuria, lower eGFR, hypertension, and diabetes [^114ZsWZj].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **sodium restriction** to < 2 g/day to reduce proteinuria and blood pressure [^notfound]. Weight loss to a BMI of 20–25 kg/m² improves blood pressure and metabolic risk, and smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular and renal risk [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: First-line therapy to reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression; monitor for hyperkalemia and creatinine rise [^117Corcw].

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, using ACEi/ARB as part of the regimen [^notfound].

- **Glycemic control**: Target HbA1c ~7.0% in diabetes, individualized to avoid hypoglycemia [^114bM5bH].

- **Statins**: Initiate for cardiovascular risk reduction in appropriate patients [^114bM5bH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **annual assessment** of eGFR and albuminuria for all CKD patients, with more frequent checks if risk is higher or treatment changes occur [^113ZuwxZ]. After initiating ACEi/ARB, reassess eGFR and potassium in 1–2 weeks, then every 3–6 months. Escalate care if ACR doubles or eGFR declines by > 20% from baseline [^112g2Y3D].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

- **Progression**: Proteinuria increases to > 300 mg/day or ACR > 300 mg/g.

- **Declining eGFR**: Rapid decline (> 5 mL/min/year) or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Unclear etiology**: Suspected glomerular disease or atypical features.

- **Resistant hypertension**: Difficult-to-control BP despite therapy [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education should explain the **significance of proteinuria** and its link to CKD and cardiovascular risk [^111b3w4D]. Emphasize adherence to medications, blood pressure control, and lifestyle changes, and teach home blood pressure monitoring and symptom recognition.

---

A urine protein excretion of 257 mg/day is **moderately increased** and warrants confirmation, evaluation of causes, risk stratification, and targeted management to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk.

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt –1 · day –1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt –1 · day –1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (urine albumin excretion rate and GFR) and is recommended. (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of urine albumin excretion to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, or rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

Initial evaluation — urinalysis and renal function assessment indicate that patients with a positive dipstick test (1+ or greater) should undergo confirmation by quantitative measurement (protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio). The serum creatinine level should be utilized to calculate an eGFR by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease or CKD-EPI equations, and microscopic hematuria, defined as greater than 3 RBC/ hpf, should also be further assessed to rule out a co- existing urinary tract neoplasm.

Urine albumin reporting and terminology — reporting albumin or total protein as a ratio to urine creatinine helps account for concentration variability in spot samples, but direct conversion from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to albumin excretion rate (AER) is cautioned: "Assuming a creatinine excretion of 1 g/d, an ACR of 1,000 mg/g would translate to an albumin excretion rate (AER) of 1,000 mg/d. However, this assumption is not correct". Implementation notes that "Clinicians may be resistant to switching from urine protein to urine albumin", and the commentary states, "we endorse the elimination of 'microalbuminuria' and 'macroalbuminuria' from the diagnostic testing lexicon".

Objective

To evaluate the importance of proteinuria in the expectant management of early onset, severe pre-eclampsia.

Methods

In this prospective series of 340 women, 24-h urine collections were performed and monitored twice weekly in a high-care ward.

Results

Seventy-four women with at least two 24-h urine collections were grouped into women with a proteinuria increase of ≥ 2 g (n = 29) and with women whose proteinuria decreased, or increased by < 2 g (n = 45). Major maternal complications, prolongation of gestation, and perinatal outcomes were comparable. Fifty-six (75%) women experienced an increase in proteinuria. When patients with heavy proteinuria (n = 83) were compared to those with moderate proteinuria (n = 257), maternal and perinatal outcomes were comparable. More days were gained before delivery in the heavy proteinuria group than in the moderate (12 vs. 9; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Most patients experienced increased proteinuria. Neither the rate of increase nor the amount of proteinuria affected maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Protein intake recommendations — KDOQI commentary on KDIGO 2024 — state that Subsection 3.3.1 includes the recommendation to maintain a dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg per day in adults with CKD G3–G5 (2C). The KDOQI 2020 Update recommends a low–protein diet (0.55–0.60 or 0.28–0.43 g/kg per day with keto-acid analogs) for nondiabetic and metabolically stable patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD, to be done under close clinical supervision, preferably by a dietitian, to reduce any risk that might be associated with decreased nutrient intake; for patients with diabetic kidney disease, a more modest dietary protein restriction is recommended (0.6–0.8 g/kg per day). The commentary adds that the challenges in implementation of dietary restrictions are appropriately noted in the guideline, that additional guidance is warranted, and that there is a lack of data to guide various methods to implement dietary modifications in patients with CKD, especially patients with stages 3–5d.

Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) — transplant considerations note that strict dietary management does not necessarily protect against further episodes of metabolic decompensation; patients with classic variant MSUD defined by severe leucine intolerance (< 15–30 mg/kg/day) have undergone LT successfully with elimination of dietary protein restriction and stabilization but without reversal of underlying neurocognitive deficits, and explanted livers from MSUD patients may be transplanted to a non-MSUD patient as a "domino" transplant, thereby improving organ utilization.

Type 1 diabetes microalbuminuria — histopathology and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) trajectory indicate that lesions are intermediate in severity and GFR decline accelerates with higher albumin excretion rate (AER): In microalbuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes, lesions are less severe than in macroalbuminuria but more advanced than in normoalbuminuria, particularly with hypertension; GFR is stable at low-level microalbuminuria, but decreases at 1 to 4 mL/min/y as AER increases and more rapidly with poorly controlled hypertension.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^114Riz3B]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Evaluation of proteinuria redux [^115c2VDE]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

All of the methods for quantitative evaluation of proteinuria (or albuminuria) suffer from some methodological flaw. A new modification that improves the accuracy of the urine protein-to-creatinine ratios for predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion has been examined in a well-characterized cohort of patients with glomerular disease. This approach needs to be systematically compared with other techniques before it can be universally recommended to replace the time-honored 24-hour urine collection.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^115uJsQ9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

### Urinary protein and enzyme excretion as markers of tubular damage [^112FAb3m]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review we intend to evaluate the clinical usefulness of measurement of urinary excretion of microproteins and tubular enzymes.

Recent Findings

Studies of patients with acute tubular necrosis showed that the excretion of some well known enzymes and of new markers such as kidney injury molecule-1 has higher value than classic renal function tests for the early detection of the disease as well as for the prediction of the development of overt acute renal failure. Tubular dysfunction may be detected by measurement of the excretion of tubular enzymes and microproteins not only in workers chronically exposed to heavy metals but also in population exposed to low environmental level below the limits set by the WHO. In chronic glomerulonephritis the excretion of alpha1-microglobulin is significantly associated with the extent of tubulo-interstitial damage and predicts outcome better than proteinuria/day; in the same diseases NAG excretion is significantly dependent on immunoglobulin G and alpha1-microglobulin excretion and predicts remission, progression and response to therapy.

Summary

The measurement of urinary excretion of tubular enzymes and microproteins may be clinically useful in several different kidney diseases (such as acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis) both for diagnosis and prediction of fractional outcome.

Urine glucose on dipstick is defined as glycosuria in the absence of diabetes, or in diabetics with well-controlled blood glucose and is diagnostic of renal tubular injury. Fractional excretion of phosphate is interpreted as < 10% is normal and > 20% is abnormal, and an upward trend in urinary phosphate wasting is suggestive of tubular injury. Tubular maximum for phosphate corrected for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) is lower than reference value (normal, 2.8–4.4 mg/dL) to assess renal phosphate handling independent of plasma phosphate and renal function. For purine handling, the fractional excretion of uric acid is < 15% is normal and > 20% is abnormal, and an upward trend in urinary uric acid wasting is strongly suggestive of proximal tubular dysfunction. Protein selectivity can be screened with the urine albumin-to-protein ratio, where uAPR < 0.4 suggests predominantly tubulointerstitial disease, whereas uAPR > 0.4 suggests predominantly glomerular disease, and it is only evaluated in individuals with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200 mg/g.

Proteinuria — spot urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) guidance and correction: The guideline discourages random (spot) UPCR assessments in patients with glomerular disease, yet in clinical practice a trend in spot UPCR in an individual patient over time provides meaningful input; if using the spot UPCR, efforts should be made to collect samples at the same time of day with similar activity, often with the first morning sample providing the most consistency. A correction is noted for Figure 4 on page 91: instead of " < 300 mg/g (< 30 mg/mmol)" for UPCR, the values should be " < 3,000 mg/g (< 300 mg/mmol) or < 3,500 mg/g" in order to correspond to the traditional thresholds for nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Nephrology referral and chronic kidney disease risk/monitoring: Clinicians should consider referral to nephrology in patients with a high risk of CKD progression, including those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45 mL/ min/1.73m2, confirmed proteinuria, diabetics with preexisting CKD, or whenever eGFR is expected to be less than 30 mL/ min/1.73m2 after intervention. (Expert Opinion) Patients who present with eGFR less than 45 mL/ min/1.73 m² or confirmed proteinuria are at particularly high risk from a functional standpoint, and should be considered for nephrology consultation. Therefore, repeat assessment of blood pressure, eGFR, and proteinuria should be performed soon after nephrectomy then again in 3–6 months to assess for development or progression of CKD. With any compromise in eGFR or presence of CKD complications, additional regular monitoring of kidney function should be performed and further management of CKD would be recommended with involvement of nephrology. Patients with DM are at even higher risk for AKI compared with those without DM, even among those with normal eGFR prior to nephrectomy, and careful management of DM and HTN and avoidance of substantial weight gain may slow or prevent CKD progression and should be prioritized on a long-term basis.

Renal response and related definitions — complete renal response (CRR) is defined as occurring "Within 6–12 months of starting therapy (may take > 12 months)" with "Stabilization or improvement in kidney function", while partial renal response (PRR) within 6–12 months requires "Reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 3 g/g (300 mg/mmol)… AND Stabilization of kidney function". Inadequate renal response/nonresponse is "Lack of achieving at least a PRR… by 6–12 months", and refractory disease is "absence of at least a PRR to at least two different appropriate 6-month courses of therapy for active LN of any class". Proteinuria measurement is defined as "24-hour collection (g/24hr) or random urine protein-creatinine ratio (g/g)", and glomerular hematuria as "Urine sediment positive for acanthocytes, ≥ 5%, RBC casts".

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^1113fNgY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Suspicion

Patients who have symptoms of polyuria, nocturia, or polydipsia are candidates for further evaluation of a possible arginine vasopressin-related polyuria (AVP-D or AVP-R). However, before embarking on more complex pathways of investigation, it is important to exclude common causes of polyuria and polydipsia, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Certain scenarios are suggestive of a solute diuresis, for example uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high protein intake from parenteral or enteral feeding, tissue catabolism from high-dose glucocorticoids, resolving kidney injury including relief of urinary obstruction, use of diuretics and SGLT-2 inhibitors, administration of mannitol or high volumes of isotonic NaCl. The presence of nocturia without daytime polyuria suggests nocturnal polyuria (production of 20%-33% of total urine volume during sleep). In the absence of such obvious causes of symptomatic polyuria, possible AVP-related disorders should be evaluated. The first step is measurement of plasma osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration. Although these are within normal ranges in most patients with polyuria due to the ability of thirst and renal water excretion to maintain osmotic homeostasis, hypernatremia strongly suggests AVP-D or AVP-R, and hyponatremia strongly suggests PP as the most likely causes of polyuria. If the plasma osmolality and serum sodium are normal, the next step is confirming the presence of hypotonic polyuria. Because patients' estimations of both fluid intake and urine output are not always reliable, this should be assessed via measurement of a 24-hour urine. It is notable that there is no universally accepted definition of polyuria. Past studies have used an absolute urine volume (eg, ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children), and others have used a weight-based urine volume (eg, > 40 mL/kg/24 hours or > 50 mL/kg/24 hours). Consequently, clinical judgment and experience should be used to identify patients requiring further evaluation, but the least stringent criteria would be either a urine volume ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children, or > 40 mL/kg/24 hours. If these minimal criteria are not met, the patient should undergo urological evaluation for causes of increased urine frequency or nocturnal polyuria. Once polyuria is established, the second step is to confirm hypotonicity via measurement of osmolality in the 24 hours urine sample. A urine osmolality ≤ 300 mOsm/kg H 2 O confirms a hypotonic urine, and a urine osmolality ≥ 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O indicates a solute diuresis (due to glucose, sodium, urea, or administered diuretics such as mannitol). Urine osmolalities between 300 and 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O can be seen with partial AVP-D or AVP-R, so in such cases further evaluation is necessary. Once hypotonic polyuria is confirmed, additional testing is necessary to identify the cause (Table 1).

Then Monitor and assess for CKD progression and development of complications periodically (e.g., blood pressure [BP], serum creatinine/eGFR, UACR or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [UPCR], electrolytes, calcium [Ca], phosphate [PO4], hemoglobin [Hgb]). The algorithm then asks Is there evidence of disease progression or development of indications for nephrology consultation? leading to Consult nephrology if yes or continued periodic monitoring if no.

CKD IN MEN AND WOMEN

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that CKD is more common among women than men, at least in part to their longer life expectancy, there still appear to be major differences in terms of detection, monitoring, referral and therapy-related adverse event rates. In a North European study, women with newly detected CKD were less likely to be monitored for their kidney function, receive a clinical diagnosis, be referred to nephrologist care or initiate antiproteinuric treatment compared with equal men. Such differences are worrisome and should be further investigated (and if present corrected) in other countries.

### A practical approach to dietary interventions for nondialysis-dependent CKD patients: the experience of a reference nephrology center in Brazil [^113t1527]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, as part of the individual dietary management, lists of food substitutes for the main sources of carbohydrates are also provided for our CKD patients. And, when energy requirement is not reached, foods with great amount of energy and low amount of protein are encouraged (Table 4) as appropriate, and oral energy supplements such as maltodextrin has been used. It is important to mention that besides protein and energy dietary managements, reinforcing general diet quality (including preferences for wholesome foods) and stimulation of physical activity, by the support of the health care team, have been a continuously process.

Table 4
Foods with high energy content and low amount of protein

a These foods should be avoided by patients with hyperlipidemia

b These foods should be avoided by patients with diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia

Assessment of protein and energy intake

Periodic monitoring of protein and energy intake of patients undergoing dietary control is essential to evaluate the adherence to treatment, the quality of the protein ingested, the quality of the overall diet and to allow adjustments when needed in order to assure long-term successful therapy. The protein and energy intake as well as the quality of the overall diet can be estimated by methods of food intake as the 24-h recall, food surveys, etc. In our clinic, the food frequency questionnaire comprising the main protein sources and the typical daily overall food consumption of the patient are assessed in all visits. The 3-day food diary is applied once a year, together with a more complete nutritional status evaluation including anthropometric measures, subject global assessment and handgrip strength. Specifically for protein intake, a biomarker has been additionally used when the 24 h urine collection is available. Based on the nitrogen urinary excretion, protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (PNA) is calculated according to the equations as summed up in Table 5.

Table 5
Equations to estimate protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (PNA)

*Adjusted body weight should be calculated when actual body weight is lower than 95% adequacy or higher than 115% adequacy

It is important to emphasize that the protein intake estimated by the PNA must be interpreted with caution, since some conditions as listed below can compromise the results and therefore may not reflect the actual protein intake:
Incorrect collecting of 24-h urine
Catabolic conditions (e.g. infection, inflammation, marked weight loss, etc.) overestimate protein intake
Anabolic conditions (e.g. recovery of nutritional status) underestimate protein intake
PNA is determined from 1-day urine collection and may not reflect the usual protein intake

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^112yEMN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

KDOQI US commentary — eGFR and UACR variability thresholds and related actions — states that a practice point suggests that a doubling of the UACR may exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation. It notes that the American Diabetes Association standards of care recommend for people with diabetes and ACR ≥ 300 mg/g reducing ACR by 30% or greater to slow CKD progression. KDIGO addresses eGFR variability with a practice point suggesting that a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation, and if a hemodynamically active therapy is initiated (eg, RAS inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors), a threshold of > 30% is suggested to exceed the expected variability and warrant further evaluation. Post hoc analyses after SGLT2 inhibitors have shown that individuals with initial eGFR decreases of > 10% have similar eGFR trajectories and long-term kidney benefits as those with an initial eGFR decrease of ≤ 10%. Treatment with diuretics may increase the risk of an eGFR dip with SGLT2 inhibitors. Initial eGFR declines of > 30% are rare and should warrant review of volume status, blood pressure (BP), and other causes. Residual albuminuria detected while on appropriately dosed RAS inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitors should prompt a clinician to consider adding a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in a patient with type 2 diabetes.

It is widely accepted that proteinuria reduction is an appropriate therapeutic goal in chronic proteinuric kidney disease. Based on large randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy have emerged as the most important antiproteinuric and renal protective interventions. However, there are numerous other interventions that have been shown to be antiproteinuric and, therefore, likely to be renoprotective. Unfortunately testing each of these antiproteinuric therapies in RCT is not feasible. The nephrologist has two choices: restrict antiproteinuric therapies to those shown to be effective in RCT or expand the use of antiproteinuric therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies. This work describes 25 separate interventions that are either antiproteinuric or may block injurious mechanisms of proteinuria. Each intervention is assigned a level of recommendation (Level 1 is the highest; Level 3 is the lowest) according to the strength of the evidence supporting its antiproteinuric and renoprotective efficacy. Pathophysiologic mechanisms possibly involved are also discussed. The number of interventions at each level of recommendation are: Level 1, n = 7; Level 2, n = 9; Level 3, n = 9. Our experience indicates that we can achieve in most patients the majority of Level 1 and many of the Level 2 and 3 recommendations. We suggest that, until better information becomes available, a broad-based, multiple-risk factor intervention to reduce proteinuria can be justified in those with progressive nephropathies. This work is intended primarily for clinical nephrologists; therefore, each antiproteinuria intervention is described in practical detail.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^116qeBca]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

Study dependent urine based outcomes

To determine the rates of two clinical outcomes, change in urinary protein excretion and change in kidney function will be determined in both major disease groups (MCD/FSGS and MN that are fully histopathologically characterized; Additional file 1: Table S2). The urine protein measures will be performed at a single Central Reference Laboratory (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota). A 24-h urine protein quantitation will be performed at each clinical site per this protocol for real time clinical care. The urine outcome will be performed on one of the three 5 mL tubes for each collection. A spot and 24-h urine albumin, creatinine (gold standard) and total protein will be measured by the Central Reference lab for the study primary outcomes. Spot urines for protein/creatinine ratio will also be obtained according to the study protocol and compared with the values from the 24-h urines. Each enrollee receives a unique patient identifier (PID), which is applied to all components of their collected urine samples (Additional file 1: Table S2). The NEPTUNE study, including the urine collection protocol, was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at all participating institutions (currently at 21). The study was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from participants or, where participants are children, a parent or guardian.

Local center collections

Clinical Research Units are used at each site for these standardized biosample collections. All sites have received standardized training. Special attention will be given to facilitate the collection of urines in pediatric patients enrolled in this study. For incontinent infants and children, urine may be collected using a urine collection bag for a spot sample or a timed void.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^112Sj9st]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria is a class effect of antiangiogenic agents, and a well-documented lenvatinib-associated adverse effect.– Rates of any-grade/grade ≥ 3 proteinuria observed in lenvatinib-treated patients were 25%/6% in the phase 3 REFLECT study in unresectable HCC,31%/10% in the phase 3 SELECT in patients with RR-DTC, and 31%/19% in a phase 2 study in patients with advanced/metastatic RCC.

Patients receiving lenvatinib are monitored regularly for proteinuria using a urine sample dipstick method. The current standard management requires a 24-hour urine protein test if a dipstick proteinuria result of ≥ 2+ is detected, with the recommendation that lenvatinib treatment should be withheld if a proteinuria level of ≥ 2 g/24 h is detected. This 24-hour urine protein test relies on patient collection of urine overnight, which is burdensome and may be influenced by patient compliance. However, the single ("spot") urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a simple and convenient alternative test that is often used to detect proteinuria associated with certain medical conditions, e.g. chronic kidney disease and diabetes. UPCR is calculated by dividing the level of protein (mg/dl) in a spot urine test by the creatinine level (mg/dl). This approach was first validated in 1983 by Ginsberg and colleagues. It is based on the premise that urinary creatinine excretion and the protein excretion rate in the presence of a stable glomerular filtration rate are fairly constant in a given patient. Thus, a simple ratio of the 2 in a single-void urine sample would reflect cumulative protein excretion over a day (because the ratio of 2 stable rates would cancel out the time factor).

To determine whether UPCR could be a useful and more convenient assessment for proteinuria in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between proteinuria assessment by UPCR and 24-hour urine protein in patients with HCC from the REFLECT study.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m², persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons — detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

### Should proteinuria reduction be the criterion for antihypertensive drug selection for patients with kidney disease? [^111RVuwX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proteinuria, that is, more than 200 mg/day of urinary albumin, is associated with the presence of kidney disease. Its increase over time is strongly correlated with progression of nephropathy. Retrospective analyses of nephropathy outcome trials show that proteinuria reduction of 30% or more after initiation of blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is associated with slower nephropathy progression than lowering BP without its reduction.

Recent Findings

Retrospective analyses of five large nephropathy outcome trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression slowed by an additional 28–39% over the control or placebo group when proteinuria was reduced in concert with BP. Two separate trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression was slowed to a lesser degree when BP was reduced to a similar degree, but proteinuria reduced less than 30%. These associations do not hold for those with microalbuminuria, in which BP reduction is the key element to slowing nephropathy progression. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials fail to show a relationship between reductions in proteinuria and nephropathy outcomes. This large cardiovascular endpoint trial, however, was not only powered for nephropathy outcomes but also failed to show a benefit between proteinuria reduction and cardiovascular events, a previously established observation.

Summary

All patients with a history of hypertension and either kidney disease or diabetes should have an annual check for albuminuria. If albumin is present in amounts of more than 200 mg/day, strategies for BP-lowering therapy should also focus on a reduction of more than 30% of urinary protein.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^113Yv8Mz]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Proteinuria monitoring is required in patients receiving lenvatinib, however, current methodology involves burdensome overnight urine collection.

Methods

To determine whether the simpler urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) calculated from spot urine samples could be accurately used for proteinuria monitoring in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein results from the phase 3 REFLECT study. Paired data (323 tests, 154 patients) were analysed.

Results

Regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between UPCR and 24-hour urine protein (R²: 0.75; P < 2 × 10⁻¹⁶). A UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 had 96.9% sensitivity, 82.5% specificity for delineating between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria. Using this UPCR cut-off value to determine the need for further testing could reduce the need for 24-hour urine collection in ~74% of patients.

Conclusion

Incorporation of UPCR into the current algorithm for proteinuria management can enable optimisation of lenvatinib treatment, while minimising patient inconvenience.

Prevention of CKD progression (Recommendations 3.1.12–3.1.18) emphasizes AKI risk recognition, protein intake, and glycemic control: We recommend that all people with CKD are considered to be at increased risk of AKI (1A) and that in people with CKD, the recommendations detailed in the KDIGO AKI guideline should be followed for those at risk (Not Graded). For diet, we suggest lowering protein intake to 0.8 g/kg/day in adults with diabetes (2C) or without diabetes (2B) and GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G4-G5), with appropriate education, and we suggest avoiding high protein intake (> 1.3 g/kg/day) in adults with CKD at risk of progression (2C). For diabetes management, we recommend a target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ~7.0% (53 mmol/mol) (1A), recommend not treating to an HbA1c target of < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) in patients at risk of hypoglycemia (1B), and suggest that target HbA1c be extended above 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) in those with a limited life expectancy, comorbid conditions, or an elevated risk of hypoglycemia (2C); in people with CKD and diabetes, glycemic control should be part of a multifactorial intervention strategy addressing blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk, promoting the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade, statins, and antiplatelet therapy where clinically indicated (Not Graded).

For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (evaluation), KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a first morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria in pediatric patients (in descending order of preference):

- both urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio

- reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading

- reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

Box 3
Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome

Cirrhosis with ascites
Serum creatinine > 133 µmol/L
No improvement of serum creatinine to < 133 µmol/L after at least 2 days with diuretic withdrawal and volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg up to a maximum of 100 g/day)
Absence of shock
No current treatment with nephrotoxic drugs
Absence of parenchymal kidney disease as indicated by proteinuria (> 500 mg/day) or microhaematuria (> 50 red blood cells per high-power field) and/or a normal renal ultrasonography

Early intervention in patients with AKI can prevent further deterioration in renal function leading to renal failure. Initial management of AKI should include suspension of all diuretics and nephrotoxic drugs. Patients should be fluid-resuscitated with 0.9% saline or 5% albumin, giving boluses of 250 mL with regular volume status reassessment aiming to achieve euvolaemia with a urine output of > 0.5 mL/kg/h based on dry weight. Accurate fluid balance monitoring and daily weight charts should be commenced. Usually 1–2 L of intravenous fluid will correct most losses and render the patient euvolaemic. If after 6 h the target urine output is not achieved, or the patient's clinical parameters are worsening, then escalation to high-dependency care for more invasive monitoring, inotropic support or renal support should be considered.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and can be caused by multiple factors including: hormonal dysregulation of salt and water balance in response to portal hypertension, dehydration, treatment with diuretics, infections and excessive use of hypotonic fluids, such as 5% dextrose. Patients with serum sodium levels < 125 mmol/L are at risk of seizures. A careful history, clinical examination, medication review and review of other biochemistry are essential to determine the cause of hyponatraemia. Assessment of the patient's volume status is fundamental, and subjects who are hypovolaemic should be fluid-resuscitated. Patients with hypervolaemic hyponatraemia should be treated with fluid restriction. However, it should be noted that some patients with significant ascites, peripheral oedema and low serum albumin levels who appear hypervolaemic are actually intravascularly deplete, and treatment with intravenous albumin can correct the hyponatraemia. Correction of hyponatraemia should be slow (< 10 mmol/L increase per 24 h), as rapid changes in serum sodium can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^112kS5RG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical laboratories play a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The age-standardized global prevalence of CKD stages 1–5 in adults aged ≥ 20 years is 10.4% in men and 11.8% in women. Early diagnosis and management may improve long-term outcomes.

Albuminuria, characterized by the presence of excessive albumin in urine, serves as a crucial indicator of kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. Early detection of albuminuria is imperative for timely diagnosis, intervention, and management of patients predisposed to kidney damage. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are two laboratory-based criteria for the diagnosis of CKD. In CKD populations, urinary albumin may be the first and only sign of kidney disease, making it a highly sensitive marker for the detection of CKD, particularly in its early stages.

The measurement of albuminuria is important in screening for early CKD. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown a graded relationship between increased albuminuria and mortality and kidney outcomes in diverse study populations, in addition to and independent of low eGFR and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The KDIGO guidelines, as well as the EFLM European urinalysis guideline 2023, primarily recommend screening using quantitative albumin tests. However, the cost of laboratory-based quantitative methods and reimbursement restrictions (e.g. in Belgium) may hamper the routine use of quantitative urinary albumin by clinicians as a screening tool in the general population or even populations at risk, and thus, potentially leading to underdiagnosis of CKD. For example, in Spain, it was previously shown that urinary albumin is under requested to properly monitor patients with diabetes and arterial hypertension. Screening by test strip analysis is suggested in the guidelines, albeit with lower priority and without further details on the type of reading to be used for screening or with the suggestion to use the total protein read-out.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of test strip analysis as a cost-effective tool for screening albuminuria. Several studies have shown promising results in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of albuminuria. However, most of these studies were performed in cohorts in which known and unknown CKD patients were mixed or the CKD status was unknown. In the current study, we aimed to provide novel insights into the analytical performance of urine test strips as a screening tool for unknown CKD by comparing the performance of multiple test strip readouts in several patient cohorts, including a patient cohort not known to have CKD.

Guidance to clinical laboratories for urine albumin and creatinine: Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in original guideline Table 17 to ensure accuracy and reliability of the findings when assessing urine samples. Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories.
