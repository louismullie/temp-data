## Question

What kind of pain is dexamethasone helpful with?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kinds of pain dexamethasone helps with. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action to anchor where dexamethasone is most plausible. Then, I should categorize pain syndromes by pathophysiology and map the strength of evidence for each. Next, I will verify dosing nuances and timing that change outcomes. After that, I need to check safety trade-offs and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically prioritized list with caveats and exceptions, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too broad or uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get that wrong, I'll misclassify indications. Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid that reduces pain primarily via anti-inflammatory effects: suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, modulation of vascular permeability, and stabilization of neuronal membranes, which can dampen ectopic firing and peripheral sensitization; these effects are most relevant when pain is driven by inflammation or nerve injury with inflammatory components [^f0c6c862] [^607a5464].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize pain syndromes where dexamethasone has been studied. The clearest benefits emerge in inflammatory postoperative pain, cancer-related pain with inflammatory drivers, and certain neuropathic or block-related phenomena, whereas evidence is weak or mixed for visceral pain, chronic noninflammatory pain, and primary headache beyond recurrence prevention, so I need to keep those distinctions explicit [^f3c09f7b] [^c078fd46] [^54599256] [^2df66400].

> Next, I will examine postoperative pain, where the signal is strongest. Multiple meta-analyses and large RCTs show that a single perioperative dose of dexamethasone, typically 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV or 8–24 mg depending on context, reduces pain scores and opioid consumption across diverse surgeries, with the best evidence in tonsillectomy, total joint arthroplasty, third molar surgery, and cesarean delivery; preoperative administration tends to outperform intraoperative, and higher doses may confer additional benefit in high pain responders, though heterogeneity exists and optimal dosing remains debated [^f3c09f7b] [^70577d6d] [^8450638d] [^814bb096] [^a63d097d] [^c2040c71] [^f774b0ce].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical relevance. In tonsillectomy, PROSPECT recommends IV dexamethasone as part of multimodal analgesia, and meta-analytic data show modest but consistent reductions in pain and improved recovery metrics; in TKA, the DEX-2-TKA trial demonstrated reduced 48-hour escape morphine use with 24 mg IV dexamethasone, reinforcing opioid-sparing effects; in cesarean delivery, meta-analysis shows lower early pain and prolonged time to rescue analgesia with IV dexamethasone, supporting routine use when not contraindicated [^8450638d] [^814bb096] [^a63d097d] [^c2040c71].

> I will now examine cancer-related pain, but I need to be cautious because the evidence base is heterogeneous. Dexamethasone is recommended for metastatic spinal cord compression at 8–16 mg/day to reduce edema and compressive pain, and it is used as an adjuvant for bone pain from metastases and for neuropathic cancer pain, with Cochrane suggesting small, short-term improvements in pain scores and ESMO endorsing use in specific complications; importantly, dexamethasone also prevents radiation-induced pain flare when given prophylactically around palliative radiotherapy, which is a distinct, clinically valuable niche [^18759233] [^6ec898f9] [^c078fd46] [^edf53aca].

> Let me consider neuropathic and block-related pain, where the mechanism fits but the evidence varies. Dexamethasone as a perineural or IV adjunct prolongs peripheral nerve block duration and reduces rebound pain, with Cochrane and subsequent meta-analyses showing longer sensory block and lower pain at 12–24 hours; this is particularly useful when blocks wear off and pain escalates, and both IV and perineural routes reduce rebound incidence, though IV may have the strongest signal for prevention in network meta-analysis [^54599256] [^f9bf662a] [^ee5268f4].

> But wait, what about primary headache disorders? I should double-check the acute treatment versus recurrence data. For acute migraine in the ED, dexamethasone does not improve immediate pain relief compared with standard abortives, yet it reduces 24–72 hour recurrence by about 26% when added to standard therapy; thus, its role is in preventing recurrence rather than aborting acute attacks, and routine use for acute treatment is not supported [^2df66400] [^d1fce4a7] [^7f83cc08].

> I need to check visceral and inflammatory non-surgical pain. Small studies suggest a single dose of dexamethasone can modestly reduce early pain in dental abscess and sore throat, likely via reduction of local inflammatory mediators; however, effects are small, transient, and should be balanced against risks, so it is not a substitute for definitive care and should be used selectively [^387f513a] [^80fdcbeb].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing thresholds because low-dose regimens may be ineffective for pain. Meta-analytic data indicate that doses above about 0.1 mg/kg are generally required to see analgesic and opioid-sparing effects, with intermediate doses of 0.11–0.2 mg/kg commonly used; higher doses such as 24 mg IV have been tested in TKA and appear safe in appropriately selected patients, though glycemic effects and individual risk must be considered [^f3c09f7b] [^814bb096] [^0a4e967b].

> Next, I should review safety and special populations so I don't overgeneralize. A single perioperative dose is generally safe regarding infection and wound healing, but transient hyperglycemia is common and more pronounced in patients with diabetes; in diabetics undergoing TKA, IV dexamethasone still reduced pain but increased insulin requirements and glucose in the first 24–48 hours, so glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment are prudent; repeated or high-dose systemic steroids carry risks of HPA axis suppression, mood changes, and immunosuppression, so chronic or repeated use warrants caution [^1bbe2e00] [^6950173f] [^dfeeb70c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dexamethasone might help broadly with visceral pain, but I should correct that. Evidence for visceral pain is limited and inconsistent; while anti-inflammatory effects are plausible mechanistically, clinical data do not support routine use for visceral pain outside specific inflammatory contexts, so I should not overstate this indication [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a clinically prioritized list, keeping the strength of evidence in mind. Dexamethasone is most helpful for inflammatory postoperative pain as part of multimodal analgesia, including tonsillectomy, total joint arthroplasty, third molar surgery, and cesarean delivery; for cancer-related pain, it is indicated for metastatic spinal cord compression, bone metastases, and neuropathic cancer pain, and it prevents radiation-induced pain flare; for neuropathic and block-related pain, it prolongs regional blockade and mitigates rebound pain; for primary headache, it prevents migraine recurrence but does not treat acute attacks; for acute inflammatory non-surgical pain such as dental abscess or severe sore throat, it may provide short-term relief but should be used selectively and not as a substitute for definitive therapy [^8450638d] [^814bb096] [^a63d097d] [^18759233] [^edf53aca] [^54599256] [^f9bf662a] [^2df66400] [^387f513a] [^80fdcbeb].

> Finally, I should confirm practical pearls and exceptions. Preoperative administration tends to yield more consistent analgesic effects than intraoperative dosing, intermediate doses of 0.11–0.2 mg/kg IV are a reasonable default, and in patients with diabetes or high glycemic risk, plan for glucose monitoring and insulin titration; avoid relying on dexamethasone for chronic noninflammatory pain or as monotherapy for severe acute pain, and integrate it within multimodal regimens that include acetaminophen, NSAIDs when appropriate, and regional techniques as indicated [^f3c09f7b] [^6950173f] [^c2040c71].

Dexamethasone is most helpful for **inflammatory pain** [^f0c6c862] — such as postoperative pain [^f3c09f7b], cancer-related pain [^c078fd46], and pain from inflammatory conditions — by reducing inflammation and swelling that compress nerves or tissues [^607a5464]. It is also effective for **neuropathic pain** from nerve compression or injury (e.g. spinal cord compression, radiculopathy) [^18759233] and for preventing **rebound pain** after peripheral nerve blocks [^f9bf662a] [^ee5268f4]. Dexamethasone is not effective for **non-inflammatory pain** (e.g. fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis without inflammation) and should be used cautiously in patients with diabetes or infection risk due to hyperglycemia and immunosuppression [^1bbe2e00].

---

## Mechanisms of analgesic action

Dexamethasone exerts its analgesic effects through several mechanisms:

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and prostaglandins, thereby decreasing inflammation and swelling that compress nerves or tissues [^607a5464].

- **Neuropathic pain modulation**: Suppresses ectopic neuronal firing and central sensitization, providing relief in nerve compression or injury-related pain [^f0c6c862].

- **Prolongation of regional anesthesia**: Enhances the duration of peripheral nerve blocks, reducing rebound pain and opioid consumption [^54599256] [^f9bf662a].

---

## Clinical evidence for dexamethasone in pain management

### Postoperative pain

Multiple meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that a single perioperative dose of dexamethasone (typically 8–16 mg IV) significantly reduces postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption across various surgical procedures, including:

- **Tonsillectomy**: Reduces pain and opioid consumption, with PROSPECT recommending intravenous dexamethasone as part of multimodal analgesia [^8450638d] [^7fdd7253].

- **Total knee arthroplasty (TKA)**: Reduces pain, opioid consumption, and nausea, with guidelines recommending perioperative intravenous dexamethasone [^814bb096] [^f27e593f].

- **Cesarean section**: Improves early postoperative pain control and reduces opioid consumption [^a63d097d] [^c2040c71].

---

### Cancer-related pain

Dexamethasone is widely used in palliative care for cancer-related pain, particularly for **bone metastases**, neuropathic pain, and pain from spinal cord compression [^18759233]. It reduces inflammation and swelling, thereby alleviating pain from tumor compression and nerve invasion [^c078fd46]. A Cochrane review indicates modest, short-term pain relief in cancer patients, though evidence quality is low and long-term benefits are uncertain [^c078fd46].

---

### Neuropathic pain

Dexamethasone is effective for neuropathic pain resulting from nerve compression or injury, such as **radiculopathy** and **complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)** [^f0c6c862]. It reduces inflammation around compressed nerves and modulates neuronal excitability, providing symptomatic relief [^607a5464].

---

### Rebound pain after peripheral nerve blocks

Rebound pain — characterized by intense pain as regional anesthesia wears off — is a common clinical issue. Both intravenous and perineural dexamethasone significantly reduce the **incidence and severity of rebound pain**, likely by prolonging analgesia and reducing inflammation [^f9bf662a] [^ee5268f4].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While dexamethasone is effective for inflammatory and neuropathic pain, it has limitations:

- **Non-inflammatory pain**: Less effective for chronic non-inflammatory pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or osteoarthritis without inflammation.

- **Adverse effects**: Potential hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and mood changes, necessitating caution in patients with diabetes, infections, or psychiatric conditions [^1bbe2e00].

- **Optimal dosing**: The ideal dose, timing, and frequency remain unclear, with most studies using single-dose regimens (8–16 mg IV) [^f3c09f7b].

---

Dexamethasone is most helpful for **inflammatory pain** (postoperative, cancer-related, inflammatory conditions), **neuropathic pain** (nerve compression, radiculopathy), and for preventing **rebound pain** after regional anesthesia. It is less effective for non-inflammatory chronic pain and requires careful consideration of adverse effects and patient-specific factors.

Background

One of the most feared symptoms associated with cancer is pain. Opioids remain the mainstay of pain treatment but corticosteroids are often used concurrently as co- or adjuvant analgesics. Due to their anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, corticosteroids are said to provide effective analgesia for pain associated with inflammation and in the management of cancer-related complications such as brain metastasis and spinal cord compression. However, corticosteroids have a wide range of adverse effects that are dose and time dependent.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating cancer-related pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OVID) (1966 to 29 September 2014), EMBASE (OVID) (1970 to 29 September 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 29 September 2014), Science Citation Index (Web of Science) (1899 to 29 September 2014) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science) (1990 to 29 September 2014).

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or prospective controlled trial that included patients over 18 years with cancer-related pain were eligible for the review. Corticosteroids were compared to placebo or usual treatment and/or supportive care.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used arithmetic means and standard deviations for each outcome to report the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 1926 participants. The trial size varied from 20 to 598 patients. Most studies compared corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, to standard therapy. We included six studies with data at one week in the meta-analysis for pain intensity; no data were available at that time point for the remaining studies. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in less pain (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with a lower score indicating less pain) compared to control at one week (MD 0.84 lower pain, 95% CI 1.38 to 0.30 lower; low quality evidence). Adverse events were poorly documented. Factors limiting statistical analysis included the lack of standardised measurements of pain and the use of different agents, dosages, comparisons and routes of drug delivery. Subgroup analysis according to type of cancer was not possible. The quality of this evidence was limited by the risk of bias of the studies and small sample size. The results were also compromised by attrition, with data missing for the enrolled patients.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the efficacy of corticosteroids for pain control in cancer patients is weak. Significant pain relief was noted in some studies, albeit only for a short period of time. This could be important for patients with poor clinical status. Further trials, with increased numbers of participants, are needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of corticosteroids for the management cancer pain in adults, and to establish an ideal dose, duration of therapy and route of administration.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^862ceabf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study focused on specific steroid regimens, potentially overlooking other effective dosing strategies or steroid types. Our focus on the immediate postoperative period also precluded assessment of long‐term outcomes or delayed side effects. Although we acknowledge that some patients may experience prolonged pain beyond our assessment period, our primary aim was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of steroid regimens during the acute postoperative period rather than extended recovery. The inclusion of multiple institutions and surgeons with varying levels of experience strengthens the external validity of our findings while addressing the potential variability through mixed‐effects modeling with site as a random effect. The comparable outcomes between treatment groups, despite this procedural heterogeneity, suggest that the efficacy of these steroid regimens remains consistent across different clinical settings and surgeon experience levels — an important consideration for broad clinical implementation.

Despite limitations, the multi‐institutional design and use of a previously validated control arm strengthen our findings, providing valuable insights into postoperative pain management for pediatric AT patients. By demonstrating comparable efficacy between a single‐dose dexamethasone regimen and a 3‐day prednisolone course, our results provide clinicians with evidence‐based flexibility in their postoperative steroid prescribing. For example, prednisolone is more widely available in liquid form, potentially improving administration compliance in younger children, whereas the single‐dose dexamethasone approach may be preferable for families concerned about medication adherence over multiple days. The choice between these regimens can be personalized based on patient and family preferences, medication access, and institutional formulary considerations.

Future studies should address these limitations by incorporating a wider range of surgical techniques, exploring additional steroid regimens, newer and safer anti‐inflammatory and analgesic drugs, controlling for additional variables, and with longer‐term follow‐up until complete resolution of pain with return to normal diet and activity.

### Does intra-operative IV dexamethasone reduce postoperative pain more effectively with nonopioids or opioids? [^b1e74566]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids reduce postoperative swelling and trismus. However, their role in pain management, particularly when combined with opioid versus nonopioid analgesics, is less understood.

Purpose

The purpose of the study was to determine whether intra-operative corticosteroids reduce postoperative pain following third molar surgery and compare its effect on pain relief within nonopioid (NSAIDs and acetaminophen) and opioid analgesic treatment arms.

Study Design, Setting, and Sample

This retrospective cohort study is based on the multicenter Opioid Analgesic Reduction Study (OARS) (n = 1,815). Participants who received oral corticosteroids (n = 41) were excluded.

Predictor Variable

The primary predictor was the therapeutic treatment (opioid, nonopioid). Within each treatment arm, participants were grouped based on intra-operative steroid use (steroid, no steroid).

Main Outcome Variable(S)

Average pain (numeric rating scale: 0 to 10) was measured on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 and entire postoperative period. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction with pain medication, unused analgesic tablets, use of rescue opioids, and emergency clinic visits.

Covariates

Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, preoperative pain and swelling, number of teeth extracted, impaction level, anesthesia type, use of antibiotics, and the administration of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.

Analyses

Mixed-effects models estimated the interaction of analgesics by steroid use by time with random effects for study sites and participants. Differences were assessed using P < .00625 to account for multiple comparisons.

Results

The sample included 1,774 subjects with a mean age (SD) of 25.7(6.2) and 893(50.3%) were female. Analgesics by steroid groups were distributed as follows: nonopioid + no-steroid (626(35.3%)), opioid + no-steroid (635(35.8%)), nonopioid + steroid (265(14.9%)), and opioid + steroid (248(14.0%)). Steroid exposure was associated with lower day 1 postoperative pain in both the nonopioid group (mean difference 0.78; 99.375% CI 0.25 to 1.30; P < .001) and the opioid group (1.22; 0.68 to 1.77; P < .001). Across all days, the nonopioid + steroid group had the lowest pain scores, with a mean difference of 0.55 (-0.04 to 1.14; P = 0.026) compared with the nonopioid+ no steroid group.

Conclusion

Intra-operative IV dexamethasone was associated with reduced pain for the first 24 hours following third molar surgery. Adding dexamethasone to either analgesic group improved pain control. Providers should consider incorporating intra-operative IV dexamethasone with postoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen.

### Perioperative single dose systemic dexamethasone for postoperative pain: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f3c09f7b]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Dexamethasone is frequently administered in the perioperative period to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. In contrast, the analgesic effects of dexamethasone are not well defined. The authors performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the dose-dependent analgesic effects of perioperative dexamethasone.

Methods

We followed the PRISMA statement guidelines. A wide search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of a single dose systemic dexamethasone on postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model. Effects of dexamethasone dose were evaluated by pooling studies into three dosage groups: low (less than 0.1 mg/kg), intermediate (0.11–0.2 mg/kg) and high (≥ 0.21 mg/kg).

Results

Twenty-four randomized clinical trials with 2,751 subjects were included. The mean (95% CI) combined effects favored dexamethasone over placebo for pain at rest (≤ 4 h, -0.32 [0.47 to -0.18], 24 h, -0.49 [-0.67 to -0.31]) and with movement (≤ 4 h, -0.64 [-0.86 to -0.41], 24 h, -0.47 [-0.71 to -0.24]). Opioid consumption was decreased to a similar extent with moderate -0.82 (-1.30 to -0.42) and high -0.85 (-1.24 to -0.46) dexamethasone, but not decreased with low-dose dexamethasone -0.18 (-0.39–0.03). No increase in analgesic effectiveness or reduction in opioid use could be demonstrated between the high- and intermediate-dose dexamethasone. Preoperative administration of dexamethasone appears to produce a more consistent analgesic effect compared with intraoperative administration.

Conclusion

Dexamethasone at doses more than 0.1 mg/kg is an effective adjunct in multimodal strategies to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption after surgery. The preoperative administration of the drug produces less variation of effects on pain outcomes.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^fb12a1f8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings reveal comparable efficacy between prednisolone and dexamethasone‐based regimens regarding average pain scores, return to normal diet, and resumption of regular activities. Both steroid regimens exhibited favorable safety profiles, with no adverse events reported throughout the study. The choice between prednisolone and dexamethasone may be influenced by factors such as medication availability, ease of administration, and individual patient characteristics. We recommend involving caregivers in shared decision‐making to select the regimen best suited to their child's circumstances. This approach allows personalized care while maintaining effective pain control and minimizing potential risks. Future research should focus on refining steroid dosing, newer analgesics, and anti‐inflammatory protocols with good safety profiles and early return to normal function.

### Impact of perioperative dexamethasone on postoperative analgesia and side-effects: systematic review and meta-analysis [^70577d6d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single perioperative dose of dexamethasone are unclear. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the impact of a single i.v. dose of dexamethasone on postoperative pain and explore adverse events associated with this treatment.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Register were searched for randomized, controlled studies that compared dexamethasone vs placebo or an antiemetic in adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia and reported pain outcomes.

Results

Forty-five studies involving 5796 patients receiving dexamethasone 1.25–20 mg were included. Patients receiving dexamethasone had lower pain scores at 2 h {mean difference (MD) -0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.83, -0.15]} and 24 h [MD -0.48 (95% CI: -0.62, -0.35)] after surgery. Dexamethasone-treated patients used less opioids at 2 h [MD -0.87 mg morphine equivalents (95% CI: -1.40 to -0.33)] and 24 h [MD -2.33 mg morphine equivalents (95% CI: -4.39, -0.26)], required less rescue analgesia for intolerable pain [relative risk 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.93)], had longer time to first dose of analgesic [MD 12.06 min (95% CI: 0.80, 23.32)], and shorter stays in the post-anaesthesia care unit [MD -5.32 min (95% CI: -10.49 to -0.15)]. There was no dose-response with regard to the opioid-sparing effect. There was no increase in infection or delayed wound healing with dexamethasone, but blood glucose levels were higher at 24 h [MD 0.39 mmol litre(-1) (95% CI: 0.04, 0.74)].

Conclusions

A single i.v. perioperative dose of dexamethasone had small but statistically significant analgesic benefits.

### High dose glucocorticoids for treatment of postoperative pain: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis [^c288695a]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Glucocorticoids as a component of multimodal analgesia have been studied for many years and their post-operative analgesic effects appear to be dose-dependent. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the evidence of peri-operative high dose corticosteroid therapy in comparison to placebo (placebo drug) or control group (no treatment) for improving the quality of post-operative analgesia as indicated by a reduction of 10 mm in 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or reduction of 1 point in a 0–10 point VAS scale, or a reduction of 1 point in an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score, or reduction of rescue opioid analgesia, in patients undergoing all types of surgery.

Design

Systematic review of RCTs with meta-analysis.

Setting

Acute postoperative pain treatment in non-obese adult population.

Interventions

Perioperative administration of high dose of Dexamethasone (≥ 0,2 mg/Kg or ≥ 15 mg), or a corresponding dose of a systemic glucocorticoid.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were postoperative pain measured in 0–100 mm VAS score at 24 h after surgery upon rest and movement. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain 0–100 mm VAS score 48 h after surgery, postoperative rescue analgesic requirement, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), relevant adverse events.

Main Results

47 RCT's were included (3943 patients). The Mean Difference (MD) of 100 mm VAS scores for pain at rest 24 h after surgery was -6.18 mm 95% CI [-8.53, -3.83], at motion -8.86 mm 95% CI [-11.82, -5.89]. Opioid analgesic requirements evaluated in Oral Morphine Equivalents (OME) was -10.00 mg 95% CI [-13.65, -6.34]. PONV events Odds Ratio of 0.29 95%CI [0.24, 0.36]. Major adverse events OR was 0.88 95% CI [0.65, 1.19]. Minor adverse events OR 1.29 95% CI [0.86, 1.92].

Conclusion

High doses of glucocorticoids are one of the many possible tools available in multimodal postoperative analgesia, possibly reducing opioids consumption and recurrence of PONV but with no relevant effects in terms of reduction of postoperative VAS score. Available data show a safe therapeutic profile, without increase adverse events.

### The place of corticosteroids in migraine attack management: a 65-year systematic review with pooled analysis and critical appraisal [^880c5b4c]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Headaches recur in up to 87% of migraine patients visiting the emergency department (ED), making ED recidivism a management challenge. We aimed herein to determine the role of corticosteroids in the acute management of migraine in the ED and outpatient care.

Methods

Advanced search strategies employing PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases inclusive of a relevant gray literature search was employed for Clinical Studies and Systematic Reviews by combining the terms "migraine" and "corticosteroids" spanning all previous years since the production of synthetic corticosteroids ca. 1950 until August 30, 2014. Methods were in accordance with MOOSE guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five studies (n = 3989, median age 37.5 years, interquartile range or IQR 35–41 years; median male:female ratio 1:4.23, IQR 1:2.1–6.14; 52% ED-based, 56% randomized-controlled) and four systematic reviews were included. International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria were applied in 64%. Nineteen studies (76%) indicated observed outcome differences favoring benefits of corticosteroids, while six (24%) studies indicated non-inferior outcomes for corticosteroids. Median absolute risk reduction was 30% (range 6%-48.2%), and 11% (6%-48.6%) for 24-, and 72-hour headache recurrence, respectively. Parenteral dexamethasone was the most commonly (56%) administered steroid, at a median single dose of 10mg (range 4-24mg). All meta-analyses revealed efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids to various abortive medications-indicating generalizability. Adverse effects were tolerable. Higher disability, status migrainosus, incomplete pain relief, and previous history of headache recurrence predicted outcome favorability.

Conclusions

Our literature review suggests that with corticosteroid treatment, recurrent headaches become milder than pretreated headaches and later respond to nonsteroidal therapy. Single-dose intravenous dexamethasone is a reasonable option for managing resistant, severe, or prolonged migraine attacks.

### Efficacy and safety of steroid use for postoperative pain relief. update and review of the medical literature [^f4162f51]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of various analgesic regimens, patient surveys have indicated that moderate-to-severe postoperative pain is still poorly managed. The use of corticosteroids for postoperative pain relief, although popular, has yet to gain wider acceptance because of concerns over side effects, in particular adrenal suppression, osteonecrosis, impaired wound-healing, and concerns about efficacy. The medical literature provides evidence that should substantially decrease these concerns with regard to low and short-dose applications. The results of randomized trials have shown low, short-dose corticosteroid regimens to be safe and effective for reducing postoperative pain. There is strong, grade-A evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids in multimodal analgesia protocols to contribute to the postoperative recovery of the patient by minimizing opioid doses and therefore side effects. However, the optimal mode, dose, and timing of administration remain unclear.

### Dexamethasone and chronic postsurgical pain: the pendulum meets reductionistic thinking [^d4d68148]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Reductionist thinking results in the bulk of anaesthesia trial designs being a single intervention to address what are in fact complex processes. The Perioperative Administration of Dexamethasone and Infection (PADDI) trial assessed the safety of a single preoperative dose of dexamethasone. Surprising to most, in the original report, a single dose of dexamethasone increased the incidence of the secondary outcome chronic postsurgical pain. Was this a chance finding or does dexamethasone increase chronic postsurgical pain? In an attempt to address this question, the PADDI investigators have now analysed this prespecified secondary outcome in two ways: as a substudy published earlier in this Journal, and as a retrospective analysis of the ENIGMA-II chronic pain database in this issue of the Journal. The PADDI investigators have now presented enough data to convince us that indeed a single dose of dexamethasone is safe and effective. However, the increase in chronic postsurgical pain seen in the original PADDI publication highlights the complexities, and the possible immunologic mechanisms, behind the genesis of chronic postsurgical pain. These publications from the PADDI group raise questions about other anti-inflammatory agents we use regularly for long-term postoperative pain management, and highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials to address this critically important patient-centred adverse functional outcome.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^42813b9d]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids given orally or IV can decrease the use of opioid analgesics by 50%. Benefits of corticosteroids include a decrease in postoperative nausea, decrease in opioid requirements, decrease in the length of hospital stay, and more complete pain relief. The smallest dose that is effective should be prescribed. Doses ranging from 15 mg of dexamethasone to 0.1 mg/kg have been shown to be effective with no complications.– A meta-analysis of perioperative use corticosteroids concludes that an "intermediate-dose dexamethasone (0.11–0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective multimodal pain strategy after surgical procedures. The preoperative administration of the drug provides a greater effect on postoperative pain". Physicians should consider perioperative dosing of corticosteroids in low-risk patients, especially in patients at risk of dependency.

Managing Acute Pain for Patients on Long-Term Opioids at Presentation

The panel recommends that perioperative analgesia should be managed with a MMA regimen in all opioid-tolerant patients (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends coordinating with acute pain service (APS) (or addiction medicine or psychiatry depending on resources) when inpatient and the patient's prescriber when outpatient to ensure that there is only 1 prescriber for patients on medication-assisted therapy (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone), patients using illicit opioids, or patients misusing prescription opioids (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Opioid-tolerant patients present a clinical challenge to effective perioperative pain management. These patients have a medical condition and should be treated with the same respect and dignity as a patient with any other presurgical medical condition. Developed nations have observed a large increase in the number of opioid-tolerant patients over the last decade. In the United States, a combination of expanding heroin abuse, pain control metrics, and pharmacologic development of long-acting opioids has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of opioid-tolerant patients. Managing perioperative pain in the opioid-tolerant patient is both a medical and a social challenge. Opioid-tolerant patients are at an increased risk of receiving inadequate perioperative analgesia. This risk exists as the result of (1) a social stigmatization of opioid prescription and consumption; (2) concerns for drug-seeking behavioror relapse of recovering addicts, or both; and (3) an incomplete understanding of opioid agonist and opioid replacement therapy pharmacokinetics.

### Pain management after total knee arthroplasty: PROcedure SPEcific postoperative pain managemenT recommendations [^01795cc2]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids for a long time have been considered as the 'ultimate anti-inflammatory drugs', and there has been increased attention given to their peri-operative use to provide PONV prophylaxis, analgesia and fatigue reduction. Glucocorticoid administration was beneficial both in terms of pain relief and opioid-sparing effects even when used as a component of multimodal analgesic regimen. Therefore, a single intra-operative intravenous dexamethasone dose is recommended, being simple, safe and effective with concomitant use of basic analgesics and LIA. It is worth noting that glucocorticoids represent a highly valuable alternative for some patients who have contraindications to NSAIDs and COX-2-specific inhibitors. However, the safety of repeated doses of glucocorticoids to improve postoperative recovery remains questionable. The optimal dose of preoperative dexamethasone still remains undetermined as the dose used in the different RCTs varied significantly from 10 to 25 mg. However, a previous meta-analysis in a mixed surgical population has reported that dexamethasone greater than 0.1 mg kg⁻¹ was an effective adjunct to multimodal strategies. In the TKA setting, a recent study reported a significant reduction of postoperative pain from 12 to 21 h when a preoperative dose of 0.15 mg kg⁻¹ dexamethasone was used. Although side effects of wound healing and infections are of potential concern, these have so far not been demonstrated, although more data are required in diabetic patients.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^543dbd9b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Dexamethasone versus intravenous morphine for migraine — patients 18 to 65 y received blinded administration of 8 mg dexamethasone or IV morphine at 0.1 mg/kg, with headache severity measured using a VAS 10-cm scale at baseline, 10 min, 60 min, and 24 h after intervention. N = 190 patients had clinically important decreases (> 2.2 cm) in both study arms with no significant differences between groups: 0 min 8.49 dexamethasone vs 8.75 morphine, 60 min 2.89 dexamethasone vs 2.33 morphine, and 24 h 0.64 dexamethasone vs 1.03 morphine; and VAS scores ≤ 1 at 24 h.

### The effect of preoperative dexamethasone on pain 1 year after lumbar disc surgery: a follow-up study [^a3dcf58f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An increasing number of studies have explored the role of glucocorticoids as a potential adjuvant in analgesic regimens for acute postoperative pain management. Reviews and metaanalyses' indicate that dexamethasone in doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg provides an opioid-sparing effect and lower pain scores after surgery. Moreover, it is speculated that perioperative administration of glucocorticoids may prevent persistent postoperative pain but follow-up periods have been relatively short and insufficient to detect possible long term beneficial or harmful effects.

The mechanisms that influence the transition from acute, adaptive postoperative pain to persistent, maladaptive pain are uncertain, but nerve injury and ongoing inflammation play important roles. Peripheral- and central sensitizations are fundamental mechanisms of the development of pain chronicity in the postoperative period. Proinflammatory cytokines secreted at or near the site of a nerve injury are involved in the development and maintenance of central sensitization and neuropathic pain. Glucocorticoids suppress proinflammatory cytokines and induce expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. By inhibiting the release of prostaglandins, and production of proinflammatory cytokines, excitatory amino acids, and growth factors in animal models, glucocorticoids prevent the development of neuropathic pain.

Persistent postsurgical pain is a serious and widely unnoticed clinical problem, difficult to treat and often permanent. The level of acute postoperative pain is associated with the risk of developing persistent pain. However, knowledge of the impact of aggressive, early therapy for persistent, postoperative pain is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to explore the pre-emptive effect of 16 mg dexamethasone IV administered preoperatively on persistent postoperative pain 1 year after lumbar disc surgery.

### Effectiveness of single intravenous dexamethasone in prolongation of spinal anesthesia for postoperative analgesia in elective cesarean section: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^1cc64dee]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Administering high-dose dexamethasone intraoperatively (greater than 0.2 mg/kg) reduces postoperative pain and spares opioids. Following surgery, an effective multimodal pain management strategy is the use of intermediate dose dexamethasone (0.11 to 0.2 mg/kg), which is safe and has few side effects. Preoperative IV dexamethasone administration has a stronger impact on postoperative pain control during cesarean delivery. Furthermore, single dosage intraoperative administration of dexamethasone also decreased incidence of rebound pain by providing a considerable analgesic benefit in the early postoperative phase. Additionally administration of dexamethasone lowers 6-h pain at rest as well. Pain with movement was lower among patients who received dexamethasone at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h.

The majority of strong studies comparing dexamethasone doses by categorizing them into three groups, low dose (0.1 mg/kg), intermediate dose (0.1–0.2 mg/kg), and high dose (more than 0.2 mg/kg), came to the conclusion that a dose of dexamethasone at 0.1 mg/kg is an efficient adjuvant in multimodal approaches to lower opioid use and postoperative pain. Depending on the complexity of the operation and the degree of tissue injury, the dexamethasone dosage may vary. In order to prevent the need for further analgesics and prolong the analgesic effects of spinal anesthesia after surgery, a wide range of doses of intravenous dexamethasone administration is required prior to cesarean delivery.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^48bf45f2]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Prior systematic reviews on corticosteroids for mandibular third-molar extraction — findings and gaps: A third SR and meta-analysis, including 8 RCTs, assessed submucosal dexamethasone and suggested reduction in swelling and pain with no difference versus placebo for trismus. A fourth SR, including 7 RCTs, concluded that preoperative submucosal corticosteroid injection significantly diminished facial swelling, postoperative pain, and trismus compared with a placebo; the magnitude of effect in the present review was lower than the clinically significant threshold (10%), and the optimal dosage and administration route were unknown. A fifth SR included 27 RCTs and concluded that corticosteroids could be used as an adjuvant for pain reduction, with methylprednisolone and dexamethasone via an intramuscular route as the best interventions and the preoperative period as ideal; however, this review did not find a difference in pain intensity among corticosteroids, and the SRs mentioned did not assess certainty of evidence.

### Dexamethasone as an adjuvant to peripheral nerve block [^54599256]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral nerve block (infiltration of local anaesthetic around a nerve) is used for anaesthesia or analgesia. A limitation to its use for postoperative analgesia is that the analgesic effect lasts only a few hours, after which moderate to severe pain at the surgical site may result in the need for alternative analgesic therapy. Several adjuvants have been used to prolong the analgesic duration of peripheral nerve block, including perineural or intravenous dexamethasone.

Objectives

To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of perineural dexamethasone versus placebo, intravenous dexamethasone versus placebo, and perineural dexamethasone versus intravenous dexamethasone when added to peripheral nerve block for postoperative pain control in people undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, DARE, Web of Science and Scopus from inception to 25 April 2017. We also searched trial registry databases, Google Scholar and meeting abstracts from the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, and the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perineural dexamethasone with placebo, intravenous dexamethasone with placebo, or perineural dexamethasone with intravenous dexamethasone in participants receiving peripheral nerve block for upper or lower limb surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 35 trials of 2702 participants aged 15 to 78 years; 33 studies enrolled participants undergoing upper limb surgery and two undergoing lower limb surgery. Risk of bias was low in 13 studies and high/unclear in 22. Perineural dexamethasone versus placeboDuration of sensory block was significantly longer in the perineural dexamethasone group compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.70 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.54 to 7.85; participants1625; studies 27). Postoperative pain intensity at 12 and 24 hours was significantly lower in the perineural dexamethasone group compared with control (MD -2.08, 95% CI -2.63 to -1.53; participants 257; studies 5) and (MD -1.63, 95% CI -2.34 to -0.93; participants 469; studies 9), respectively. There was no significant difference at 48 hours (MD -0.61, 95% CI -1.24 to 0.03; participants 296; studies 4). The quality of evidence is very low for postoperative pain intensity at 12 hours and low for the remaining outcomes. Cumulative 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption was significantly lower in the perineural dexamethasone group compared with placebo (MD 19.25 mg, 95% CI 5.99 to 32.51; participants 380; studies 6). Intravenous dexamethasone versus placeboDuration of sensory block was significantly longer in the intravenous dexamethasone group compared with placebo (MD 6.21, 95% CI 3.53 to 8.88; participants 499; studies 8). Postoperative pain intensity at 12 and 24 hours was significantly lower in the intravenous dexamethasone group compared with placebo (MD -1.24, 95% CI -2.44 to -0.04; participants 162; studies 3) and (MD -1.26, 95% CI -2.23 to -0.29; participants 257; studies 5), respectively. There was no significant difference at 48 hours (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.41; participants 172; studies 3). The quality of evidence is moderate for duration of sensory block and postoperative pain intensity at 24 hours, and low for the remaining outcomes. Cumulative 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption was significantly lower in the intravenous dexamethasone group compared with placebo (MD -6.58 mg, 95% CI -10.56 to -2.60; participants 287; studies 5). Perinerual versus intravenous dexamethasoneDuration of sensory block was significantly longer in the perineural dexamethasone group compared with intravenous by three hours (MD 3.14 hours, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.59; participants 720; studies 9). We found that postoperative pain intensity at 12 hours and 24 hours was significantly lower in the perineural dexamethasone group compared with intravenous, however, the MD did not surpass our pre-determined minimally important difference of 1.2 on the Visual Analgue Scale/Numerical Rating Scale, therefore the results are not clinically significant (MD -1.01, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.50; participants 217; studies 3) and (MD -0.77, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.08; participants 309; studies 5), respectively. There was no significant difference in severity of postoperative pain at 48 hours (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.61; participants 227; studies 3). The quality of evidence is moderate for duration of sensory block and postoperative pain intensity at 24 hours, and low for the remaining outcomes. There was no difference in cumulative postoperative 24-hour opioid consumption (MD -3.87 mg, 95% CI -9.93 to 2.19; participants 242; studies 4). Incidence of severe adverse eventsFive serious adverse events were reported. One block-related event (pneumothorax) occurred in one participant in a trial comparing perineural dexamethasone and placebo; however group allocation was not reported. Four non-block-related events occurred in two trials comparing perineural dexamethasone, intravenous dexamethasone and placebo. Two participants in the placebo group required hospitalization within one week of surgery; one for a fall and one for a bowel infection. One participant in the placebo group developed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I and one in the intravenous dexamethasone group developed pneumonia. The quality of evidence is very low due to the sparse number of events.

Authors' Conclusions

Low- to moderate-quality evidence suggests that when used as an adjuvant to peripheral nerve block in upper limb surgery, both perineural and intravenous dexamethasone may prolong duration of sensory block and are effective in reducing postoperative pain intensity and opioid consumption. There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of dexamethasone as an adjuvant to peripheral nerve block in lower limb surgeries and there is no evidence in children. The results of our review may not apply to participants at risk of dexamethasone-related adverse events for whom clinical trials would probably be unsafe. There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of dexamethasone as an adjuvant to peripheral nerve block in lower limb surgeries and there is no evidence in children. The results of our review may not be apply to participants who at risk of dexamethasone-related adverse events for whom clinical trials would probably be unsafe. The nine ongoing trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov may change the results of this review.

### Parenteral dexamethasone for acute severe migraine headache: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials for preventing recurrence [^2df66400]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of parenteral corticosteroids for the relief of acute severe migraine headache and prevention of recurrent headaches.

Design

Meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL), conference proceedings, clinical practice guidelines, contacts with industry, and correspondence with authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which corticosteroids (alone or combined with standard abortive therapy) were compared with placebo or any other standard treatment for acute migraine in adults.

Review Methods

Two reviewers independently assessed relevance, inclusion, and study quality. Weighted mean differences and relative risks were calculated and are reported with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

From 666 potentially relevant abstracts, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. All included trials used standard abortive therapy and subsequently compared single dose parenteral dexamethasone with placebo, examining pain relief and recurrence of headache within 72 hours. Dexamethasone and placebo provided similar acute pain reduction (weighted mean difference 0.37, 95% confidence interval -0.20 to 0.94). Dexamethasone was, however, more effective than placebo in reducing recurrence rates (relative risk 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.90). Side effect profiles between dexamethasone and placebo groups were similar.

Conclusion

When added to standard abortive therapy for migraine headache, single dose parenteral dexamethasone is associated with a 26% relative reduction in headache recurrence (number needed to treat = 9) within 72 hours.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^8450638d]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures; however, pain management remains challenging. Procedure‐specific efficacy as well as specific risks of treatment options should guide selection of pain management protocols based on evidence and should optimise analgesia without harm. The aims of this systematic review were to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after tonsillectomy. A systematic review utilising preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis guidelines with procedure‐specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language up to November 2019 assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Out of the 719 potentially eligible studies identified, 226 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, excluding the studies examining surgical techniques. Pre‐operative and intra‐operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol; non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs; intravenous dexamethasone; ketamine (only assessed in children); gabapentinoids; dexmedetomidine; honey; and acupuncture. Inconsistent evidence was found for local anaesthetic infiltration; antibiotics; and magnesium sulphate. Limited evidence was found for clonidine. The analgesic regimen for tonsillectomy should include paracetamol; non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone, with opioids as rescue analgesics. Analgesic adjuncts such as intra‐operative and postoperative acupuncture as well as postoperative honey are also recommended. Ketamine (only for children); dexmedetomidine; or gabapentinoids may be considered when some of the first‐line analgesics are contra‐indicated. Further randomised controlled trials are required to define risk and combination of drugs most effective for postoperative pain relief after tonsillectomy.

### Pre-emptive scalp infiltration with dexamethasone plus ropivacaine for postoperative pain after craniotomy: a protocol for a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^577aaeae]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Approximately 55–87% of the patients undergoing craniotomy experience moderate to severe pain during the first 48 hrs after surgery, which negatively influences patients' postoperative rehabilitation. Recently, local infiltration of analgesia (LIA) has been widely performed clinically as a promising analgesic method that could avoid the side effects of analgesics but only has a short pain-free duration; researchers have clarified that the addition of dexamethasone to LIA could provide significant analgesic effects and significantly prolong the duration of analgesic effects without obvious complications for various types of surgeries. To date, no studies have evaluated the addition of dexamethasone to LIA for patients receiving craniotomy. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that pre-emptive scalp infiltration with a steroid (dexamethasone) plus a local anesthetic (ropivacaine) could achieve superior postoperative analgesic effects to a local anesthetic (ropivacaine) alone in adult patients undergoing a craniotomy.

Study design and methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial that will include one intervention and one control group involving a total of 140 adults scheduled for elective craniotomy for resection of supratentorial tumors under general anesthesia and with an anticipated full recovery within 2 hrs postoperatively. The intervention will involve pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine plus dexamethasone (the dexamethasone group) or ropivacaine alone (the control group), and the participants in both groups will complete a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the cumulative sufentanil consumption within 48 hrs postoperatively.

Discussion: The intervention, if effective, this study will provide clinically important information on the role of dexamethasone in scalp infiltration for post-craniotomy pain management.

### The effects of dexamethasone on the time to pain resolution in dental periapical abscess [^387f513a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dental infections are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED), with periapical abscesses being among the most painful. Traditional pain management strategies include local anesthetic injections, oral analgesics, and intravenous opioids.

Objectives

We sought to identify an alternative pain management strategy with early use of dexamethasone as adjunct to conventional therapies for inflammation and pain at the site of infection.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the analgesic effect of dexamethasone and placebo in ED patients with periapical abscess during a 2-year timeframe at two urban academic EDs. Adult patients presenting with physical examination findings consistent with a diagnosis of periapical abscess were randomized to receive oral dexamethasone or an identical placebo. Pain was assessed using the verbal numeric scale in person at discharge and via telephone at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after discharge from the ED.

Results

Seventy-three patients were enrolled, with 37 receiving dexamethasone and 36 receiving placebo. Follow-up pain scores were obtained for 52 patients at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Ten patients from the dexamethasone group and 11 from placebo group were lost to follow-up. Patients who received dexamethasone reported a greater reduction in pain at 12 h compared with the placebo group (p = 0.029). Changes in pain scores from baseline and at 24, 48, and 72 h were not statistically significant. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Single-dose dexamethasone as adjunct to conventional medical management for pain caused by periapical abscess demonstrated a significant reduction in pain 12 h post treatment compared with placebo.

### Effect of an intravenous dexamethasone added to caudal local anesthetics to improve postoperative pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^1382de67]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Caudal anesthesia has been used for postoperative pain control in pediatric surgical patients, but the duration of the analgesic effect is occasionally unsatisfactory. Intravenous steroids have been shown to be effective for postsurgical pain management after certain surgeries. The aim of this meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was to evaluate the analgesic effect of steroids in patients administered with caudal anesthesia.

Methods

This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search of published literature was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases and in trial registration sites. Randomized controlled trials that compared intravenous steroids with a placebo in pediatric patients who had received caudal anesthesia for surgery were included in the study. The primary outcomes from the present meta-analysis were the analgesic duration and the number of patients who required rescue analgesics. The analgesic duration and incidence of rescue use were summarized using mean difference or risk ratio with a 97.5% confidence interval (CI), respectively. If the 97.5% CI of the mean difference or risk ratio included a value of 0 or 1, respectively, we considered the difference not to be significant. We used the random effects model to combine the results. Heterogeneity was quantified with the I statistic. The quality of the trials was evaluated using the Cochrane methodology. Moreover, a TSA with a risk of type 1 error of 2.5% and power of 90% was performed. We established the minimum clinically meaningful difference of analgesic duration as 3 hours. The target sample size for meta-analysis was also calculated in the TSA. We also assessed adverse events.

Results

Six trials with 424 patients were included; 211 patients received intravenous steroids. All trials compared dexamethasone of at least 0.5 mg/kg dose with a placebo. Dexamethasone prolonged the duration of caudal analgesia (mean difference, 244 minutes; 97.5% CI, 188–300). Heterogeneity was considerable with an I value of 94.8%. Quality of evidence was very low. The TSA suggested that only 17.0% of the target sample size had been reached, but the cumulative Z score crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary to indicate a benefit. Rescue use was reported in 4 studies with 260 patients. Rescue use was not significantly reduced in the dexamethasone group (risk ratio, 0.53; 97.5% CI, 0.09–3.30; I, 98.7%). No increase in adverse events was reported.

Conclusions

Intravenous dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of caudal anesthesia. Trials to investigate the effectiveness of a lower dose of the dexamethasone in prolonging analgesic effects would be of interest. Further trials with a low risk of bias are necessary.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^09861920]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain flare is an adverse effect of radiotherapy for bone metastases that occurs in approximately 40% of patients. It can be defined in one of two ways: as an a priori 2‐point increase in worst pain score using a 0–10 numerical rating scale when compared with baseline, with no decrease in analgesic intake; or as a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. To distinguish from a general progression of pain, analgesic intake and pain scores need to return to baseline after the flare. This phenomenon is often observed within a few days of treatment and can last up to a week before subsiding. The mechanism underlying pain flare is multifactorial and is thought to include localised inflammation caused by damage to tissues, leading to the release of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α); interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) and prostaglandins; stimulation of the highly innervated periosteum; increased activation of osteoclasts; and tumour necrosis. Due to the temporary nature, if the initial flare can be managed the patient is likely to experience good resolution of their pain longer term. The risk of experiencing pain flare is included in patient information and informed consent for radiotherapy treatment. While pain flares may be managed with increased doses of analgesia, this approach may be associated with worsening of adverse effects. Patients generally favour a preventative approach and dexamethasone can be administered as an effective prophylactic drug at the time of radiotherapy.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^7fdd7253]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures; however, pain management remains challenging. Procedure-specific efficacy as well as specific risks of treatment options should guide selection of pain management protocols based on evidence and should optimise analgesia without harm. The aims of this systematic review were to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after tonsillectomy. A systematic review utilising preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language up to November 2019 assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Out of the 719 potentially eligible studies identified, 226 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, excluding the studies examining surgical techniques. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intravenous dexamethasone; ketamine (only assessed in children); gabapentinoids; dexmedetomidine; honey; and acupuncture. Inconsistent evidence was found for local anaesthetic infiltration; antibiotics; and magnesium sulphate. Limited evidence was found for clonidine. The analgesic regimen for tonsillectomy should include paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone, with opioids as rescue analgesics. Analgesic adjuncts such as intra-operative and postoperative acupuncture as well as postoperative honey are also recommended. Ketamine (only for children); dexmedetomidine; or gabapentinoids may be considered when some of the first-line analgesics are contra-indicated. Further randomised controlled trials are required to define risk and combination of drugs most effective for postoperative pain relief after tonsillectomy.

### The role of neuro-immune interactions in chronic pain: implications for clinical practice [^f0c6c862]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Steroids and Neuro-Immune Interface

Injection of steroids into or around pain generators is one of the keystones of interventional pain management. Epidural glucocorticoid injection, for example, is one of the most commonly performed interventional pain procedures for the treatment of chronic spinal pain, with over 2.2 million lumbar epidural glucocorticoid injections performed each year in the Medicare population alone. Epidural steroids are effective in reducing pain severity, decreasing opioid use, improving function, avoiding the need for surgery, and even treating pain in patients who have not responded to surgical intervention. Steroids may exert anti-inflammatory effects on the neuroimmune interface. Consistently with preclinical models, steroid administration (local, intrathecal, or systemic administration) before or at the time of injury reduces proinflammatory cytokines, neuronal firing rates, glial cell activation in the spinal cord, and correlates with a reduction in pain behavior after nerve injury. It is interesting to point out that, although steroids reduce proinflammatory cytokines after injury, anti-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-4 and IL-10, which also decrease after injury, are not affected by steroids – supporting a steroid-independent anti-inflammatory process.

However, there are mixed results regarding the ability of steroids to reverse established pain behavior in animal models. Similarly, clinical evidence supporting the use of epidural steroids for spinal pain is also not always positive. Steroids used in clinical practice (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone) can activate pro-inflammatory mineralocorticoid receptors found in DRG sensory neurons. Co-administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with dexamethasone is more effective in reducing SGC activation in the DRG, evoked and spontaneous pain behaviors than dexamethasone alone in rodent models of lower back pain. It is interesting to wonder if the propensity to activate different steroid receptors may account for why steroids are sometimes ineffective or wane in efficacy over time in clinical practice. Ultimately, this could be a promising area of future clinical research as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) are widely used in the clinical treatment of hypertension and heart failure.

### Dexamethasone and persistent wound pain: a prespecified analysis of the randomised perioperative administration of dexamethasone and infection (PADDI) trial [^a34c6699]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dexamethasone is commonly administered intraoperatively to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting and is believed to have analgesic properties. It is unknown whether it has an impact on chronic wound pain.

Methods

In this prespecified embedded superiority substudy of the randomised PADDI trial, patients undergoing non-urgent noncardiac surgery received dexamethasone 8 mg or placebo intravenously after induction of anaesthesia, and were followed up for 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the incidence of pain in the surgical wound at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included acute postoperative pain and correlates of chronic postsurgical pain.

Results

We included 8478 participants in the modified intention-to-treat population (4258 in the dexamethasone group and 4220 in the matched placebo group). The primary outcome occurred in 491 subjects (11.5%) in the dexamethasone arm and 404 (9.6%) subjects in the placebo arm (relative risk 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.41, P = 0.003). Maximum pain scores at rest and on movement in the first 3 postoperative days were lower in the dexamethasone group compared with the control group {median 5 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 3.0–8.0) vs 6 (IQR 3.0–8.0) and median 7 (IQR 5.0–9.0) vs 8 (IQR 6.0–9.0), P < 0.001 for both}. Severity of postoperative pain was not predictive of chronic postsurgical pain. The severity of chronic postsurgical pain and the frequency of neuropathic features did not differ between treatment groups.

Conclusion

Administration of dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. was associated with an increase in the risk of pain in the surgical wound 6 months after surgery.

### The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in total joint arthroplasty: a direct meta-analysis [^dbb92e3b]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are commonly used intraoperatively to treat pain and reduce opioid consumption and nausea associated with primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in primary TJA to support the combined clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Hip Society, Knee Society, and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Management.

Methods

The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for studies published before February 2020 on corticosteroids in TJA. All included studies underwent qualitative and quantitative homogeneity testing followed by a systematic review and direct comparison meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids.

Results

Critical appraisal of 1,581 publications revealed 23 studies regarded as the best available evidence for analysis. Intraoperative dexamethasone reduces postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and nausea and vomiting. Multiple doses lead to further reduction in pain, opioid consumption, nausea and vomiting. There is insufficient evidence on the risk of adverse events with perioperative dexamethasone in TJA.

Conclusion

Strong evidence supports the use of a single dose or multiple doses of intravenous dexamethasone to reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption, nausea and vomiting after primary TJA. There is insufficient evidence on perioperative dexamethasone in primary TJA to determine the optimal dose, number of doses, or risk of postoperative adverse events.

### Pre-emptive scalp infiltration with dexamethasone plus ropivacaine for postoperative pain after craniotomy: a protocol for a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^8c922f0e]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Approximately 55–87% of the patients undergoing craniotomy experience moderate to severe pain during the first 48 hrs after surgery, which negatively influences patients' postoperative rehabilitation. Recently, local infiltration of analgesia (LIA) has been widely performed clinically as a promising analgesic method that could avoid the side effects of analgesics but only has a short pain-free duration; researchers have clarified that the addition of dexamethasone to LIA could provide significant analgesic effects and significantly prolong the duration of analgesic effects without obvious complications for various types of surgeries. To date, no studies have evaluated the addition of dexamethasone to LIA for patients receiving craniotomy. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that pre-emptive scalp infiltration with a steroid (dexamethasone) plus a local anesthetic (ropivacaine) could achieve superior postoperative analgesic effects to a local anesthetic (ropivacaine) alone in adult patients undergoing a craniotomy. Study design and methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial that will include one intervention and one control group involving a total of 140 adults scheduled for elective craniotomy for resection of supratentorial tumors under general anesthesia and with an anticipated full recovery within 2 hrs postoperatively. The intervention will involve pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine plus dexamethasone (the dexamethasone group) or ropivacaine alone (the control group), and the participants in both groups will complete a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the cumulative sufentanil consumption within 48 hrs postoperatively. Discussion: The intervention, if effective, this study will provide clinically important information on the role of dexamethasone in scalp infiltration for post-craniotomy pain management.

### Dexamethasone does not provide additional clinical analgesia effect to local wound infiltration: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis [^f0bbcec7]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective: Although the use of dexamethasone as an adjunct agent is associated with alleviating pain and prolonging analgesic duration in local wound infiltration (LWI), efficacy and safety of dexamethasone infiltration have not been fully explored. The study sought to quantify the pooled effects of dexamethasone infiltration on postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, and side effects through a review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Approach: RCTs comparing dexamethasone + LWI with LWI alone were retrieved from seven electronic databases. Co-primary outcomes were rest pain scores and cumulative morphine equivalent consumption within 24h postoperatively. The study followed PRISMA, AMSTAR, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Eight trials comprising 609 patients were included in the final analysis. Results indicated that dexamethasone infiltration effects were only statistical but not clinically significant at individual time points of rest pain and patient satisfaction scores. Notably, the effect of dexamethasone infiltration therapy on other pain-related parameters, including cumulative morphine consumption (mean difference, -9.05mg; 95% CI: -22.47 to 4.37), was not significantly different compared with the control group. Analysis showed no significant differences in safety indicators between the two groups. The overall quality of evidence was high to very low. Innovation: Although statistically significant effects of dexamethasone infiltration were observed for some outcomes of postoperative wound pain, the overall benefits were below the expected minimal clinically important difference. Conclusions: In summary, the current evidence does not support routine clinical use of dexamethasone in LWI. However, further studies should explore the clinical value of preemptive analgesia and safety of a combination of dexamethasone with ropivacaine for LWI.

### PROSPECT guideline for total hip arthroplasty: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^9a72ce0e]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to develop recommendations for the management of postoperative pain after primary elective total hip arthroplasty, updating the previous procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) guidelines published in 2005 and updated in July 2010. Randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses published between July 2010 and December 2019 assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic, surgical or other interventions were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases. Five hundred and twenty studies were initially identified, of which 108 randomised trials and 21 meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria. Peri-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain include: paracetamol; cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective inhibitors; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone. In addition, peripheral nerve blocks (femoral nerve block; lumbar plexus block; fascia iliaca block), single-shot local infiltration analgesia, intrathecal morphine and epidural analgesia also improved pain. Limited or inconsistent evidence was found for all other approaches evaluated. Surgical and anaesthetic techniques appear to have a minor impact on postoperative pain, and thus their choice should be based on criteria other than pain. In summary, the analgesic regimen for total hip arthroplasty should include pre-operative or intra-operative paracetamol and cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, continued postoperatively with opioids used as rescue analgesics. In addition, intra-operative intravenous dexamethasone 8–10 mg is recommended. Regional analgesic techniques such as fascia iliaca block or local infiltration analgesia are recommended, especially if there are contra-indications to basic analgesics and/or in patients with high expected postoperative pain. Epidural analgesia, femoral nerve block, lumbar plexus block and gabapentinoid administration are not recommended as the adverse effects outweigh the benefits. Although intrathecal morphine 0.1 mg can be used, the PROSPECT group emphasises the risks and side-effects associated with its use and provides evidence that adequate analgesia may be achieved with basic analgesics and regional techniques without intrathecal morphine.

### Dexamethasone 0.4mg sustained-release intracanalicular insert in the management of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery: design, development and place in therapy [^3e6ae60d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While surgical techniques and equipment have advanced over the years, inflammation is still a common consequence of most ocular surgeries, including cataract surgery. If left untreated, post-operative inflammation can lead to elevated intraocular pressure, photophobia, ocular pain, and an increased probability of posterior capsule opacification, macular edema, secondary glaucoma and synechia formation. Appropriate management of post-operative inflammation is critical for achieving the best corrected visual acuity, anatomical surgical outcome, and patient satisfaction in the most expedient way.

Corticosteroids are widely used to manage inflammation in post-operative patients as well as in ophthalmic conditions such as allergic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular edema, macular edema, and uveitis due to their inherent anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties.–Numerous types of steroids have been utilized to control inflammation, including dexamethasone. Several studies have shown the beneficial effect of dexamethasone in reducing pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.–One study involving phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, demonstrated that dexamethasone administered four times daily during the first week and twice daily during the second, third, and fourth week, significantly reduced post-operative inflammation compared to a placebo.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the management of cancer-related breathlessness (dyspnoea) in adults [^dd8005d3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dyspnoea is a common symptom in advanced cancer, with a prevalence of up to 70% among patients at end of life. The cause of dyspnoea is often multifactorial, and may cause considerable psychological distress and suffering. Dyspnoea is often undertreated and good symptom control is less frequently achieved in people with dyspnoea than in people with other symptoms of advanced cancer, such as pain and nausea. The exact mechanism of action of corticosteroids in managing dyspnoea is unclear, yet corticosteroids are commonly used in palliative care for a variety of non-specific indications, including pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue and low mood, despite being associated with a wide range of adverse effects. In view of their widespread use, it is important to seek evidence of the effects of corticosteroids for the management of cancer-related dyspnoea.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids for the management of cancer-related breathlessness (dyspnoea) in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Web of Science, Latin America and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) and clinical trial registries, from inception to 25 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that included adults aged 18 years and above. We included participants with cancer-related dyspnoea when randomised to systemic corticosteroids (at any dose) administered for the relief of cancer-related dyspnoea or any other indication, compared to placebo, standard or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Five review authors independently assessed trial quality and three extracted data. We used means and standard deviations for each outcome to report the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence using GRADE. We extracted primary outcomes of sensory-perceptual experience of dyspnoea (intensity of dyspnoea), affective distress (quality of dyspnoea) and symptom impact (burden of dyspnoea or impact on function) and secondary outcomes of serious adverse events, participant satisfaction with treatment and participant withdrawal from trial.

Main Results

Two studies met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 157 participants (37 participants in one study and 120 in the other study), of whom 114 were included in the analyses. The studies compared oral dexamethasone to placebo, followed by an open-label phase in one study. One study lasted seven days, and the duration of the other study was 15 days. We were unable to conduct many of our predetermined analyses due to different agents, dosages, comparators and outcome measures, routes of drug delivery, measurement scales and time points. Subgroup analysis according to type of cancer was not possible. Primary outcomesWe included two studies (114 participants) with data at one week in the meta-analysis for change in dyspnoea intensity/dyspnoea relief from baseline. Corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone resulted in an MD of lower dyspnoea intensity compared to placebo at one week (MD -0.85 lower dyspnoea (scale 0–10; lower score = less breathlessness), 95% CI -1.73 to 0.03; very low-quality evidence), although we were uncertain as to whether corticosteroids had an important effect on dyspnoea as results were imprecise. We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels from high to very low due to very serious study limitations and imprecision. One study measured affective distress (quality of dyspnoea) and results were similar between groups (29 participants; very low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence three times for imprecision, inconsistency, and serious study limitations. Both studies assessed symptom impact (burden of dyspnoea or impact on function) (113 participants; very low-quality evidence). In one study, it was unclear whether dexamethasone had an effect on dyspnoea as results were imprecise. The second study showed more improvement for physical well-being scores at days eight and 15 in the dexamethasone group compared with the control group, but there was no evidence of a difference for FACIT social/family, emotional or functional scales. We downgraded the quality of the evidence three times for imprecision, inconsistency, and serious study limitations. Secondary outcomesDue to the lack of homogenous outcome measures and inconsistency in reporting, we could not perform quantitative analysis for any secondary outcomes. In both studies, the frequency of adverse events was similar between groups, and corticosteroids were generally well tolerated. The withdrawal rates for the two studies were 15% and 36%. Reasons for withdrawal included lost to follow-up, participant or carer (or both) refusal, and death due to disease progression. We downgraded the quality of evidence for these secondary outcomes by three levels from high to very low due to serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. Neither study examined participant satisfaction with treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There are few studies assessing the effects of systemic corticosteroids on cancer-related dyspnoea in adults with cancer. We judged the evidence to be of very low quality that neither supported nor refuted corticosteroid use in this population. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine if corticosteroids are efficacious in this setting.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^217eab65]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on available evidence and the PROSPECT approach to providing recommendations, combinations of paracetamol and NSAIDs are recommended pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively, and continued into the postoperative period, unless there are contra‐indications (Table 1). In addition, a single intra‐operative dose of i.v. dexamethasone is also recommended (Table 1). Several interventions are not recommended for analgesia after tonsillectomy (Table 2).

Table 1
Overall recommendations for pain management in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.

Table 2
Analgesic interventions that are not recommended for pain management in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.

A systematic review [161] including 29 randomised controlled trials considered that single analgesics (e.g. paracetamol; NSAIDs; gabapentinoids; dextromethorphan; dexamethasone) provide only a weak to moderate benefit on post‐tonsillectomy pain on the day of surgery. Thus, the authors recommend a multimodal analgesic approach. These findings are in line with our recommendations. Of note, the concerns regarding the potential bleeding risk with the use of NSAIDs are not substantiated in recent studies. Several meta‐analyses did not report an increase in the risk of postoperative bleeding [18, 19]. Thus, most guidelines have been modified. Indeed, Swedish [4] and French [5] guidelines recommend NSAIDs as a first line treatment after tonsillectomy. Similar to NSAIDs, dexamethasone was once incriminated as increasing postoperative bleeding [162].

### Postoperative pain management strategies following peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM): a review [^4cee57f0]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, have been demonstrated to provide significant analgesic effects postoperatively, in addition to their anti-inflammatory properties. Studies indicate that dexamethasone can reduce inflammation and postoperative nausea and vomiting, both of which are common after POEM. Dexamethasone has been shown to decrease opioid requirements in patients undergoing ESD procedures. Furthermore, its administration prior to surgery has been associated with superior analgesic effects in comparison to postoperative administration. While its use is well-established for reducing inflammation, care should be taken when using dexamethasone to avoid potential side effects such as delayed wound healing or immune suppression. These findings emphasize the need for careful consideration in incorporating glucocorticoids into multimodal analgesia protocols for POEM.

Intravenous lidocaine is another effective non-opioid analgesic, recognized for its analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have confirmed that lidocaine reduces postoperative pain and accelerates recovery in gastrointestinal procedures, including POEM. A meta-analysis highlighted the benefits of intravenous lidocaine in reducing post-procedural pain and lowering the incidence of adverse events in gastrointestinal endoscopy patients. Its mechanism of action, involving sodium channel blockade, helps decrease neuronal excitability and prevent central sensitization, which is often a significant factor in postoperative pain. Lidocaine is particularly effective for managing visceral pain, a predominant type of pain following POEM, due to its action on the peripheral nerves.

Magnesium sulfate has been identified for its potential to enhance analgesia during and after surgery by inhibiting NMDA receptors and reducing central sensitization. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that magnesium administration during POEM significantly reduced opioid requirements and esophageal discomfort in the first 24 hours post-surgery. These findings suggest magnesium's role in reducing visceral hyperalgesia, which is a key component of post-POEM pain. Although magnesium shows promise in pain management, further research is needed to fully assess its therapeutic potential and optimal dosing in POEM analgesia.

### Preoperative dexamethasone for acute post-thoracotomy analgesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^64f0fa9a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients experience intense pain following thoracotomy. Although thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is believed to be the most effective single technique for controlling post-thoracotomy pain, it often fails to treat post-thoracotomy pain. Thus, anesthesiologists require some adjuvant treatments for thoracotomy pain relief.

Recent studies have suggested that glucocorticoids are beneficial as postoperative analgesic agents because of their anti-inflammatory property in various surgeries. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis suggested that dexamethasone is an effective adjunct to multimodal strategies for reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption. However, the efficacy of dexamethasone in controlling post-thoracotomy pain remains uncertain.

Our hypothesis is that the preoperative administration of dexamethasone may be an effective adjuvant treatment for post-thoracotomy pain like other surgeries. Thus, in this randomized, controlled double-blind study, we investigated whether the preoperative administration of this drug reduces post-thoracotomy pain during the recovery period.

### Benefits versus harm of intraoperative glucocorticoid for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis [^f3aa7a7c]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative use of glucocorticoids is effective for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis and can also provide early postoperative analgesic effects, but the consequences for chronic post-surgical pain are debatable. In a secondary analysis of the large pragmatic Perioperative Administration of Dexamethasone and Infection trial (n = 8478), the primary outcome of pain at the surgical wound at 6 months after surgery was increased in subjects receiving dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, a dose not associated with the detrimental effect of surgical site infection in the original study. In contrast, a more detailed assessment of chronic post-surgical pain after exclusion of patients with preoperative pain at the surgical site showed no differences with or without intraoperative dexamethasone regarding chronic post-surgical pain characteristics (intensity and neuropathic features). Because of several confounding factors especially regarding surgical details, these unexpected findings call for more well-designed studies about the potential risk of intraoperative treatments, such as glucocorticoids, on late post-surgical pain.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6c2008fb]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars — study characteristics indicate that surgical tooth extraction (impacted third molar) was evaluated across parallel group and split mouth designs with varied corticosteroid regimens and placebo comparators. Interventions included dexamethasone given by intramuscular, submucosal, or oral routes at doses such as 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg with timing examples of 1 h preoperatively and 10–18 h postoperatively or 12 h preoperatively and 12 h postoperatively; prednisolone given intramuscularly or orally at 10 mg, 20 mg, or 25 mg; methylprednisolone 40 mg intramuscular; and a regimen of 120 mg of etoricoxib preoperatively with 30 mg of prednisolone immediately postoperatively. Comparators were "no corticosteroid treatment (placebo)" or "no treatment (placebo)".

### Nerve blocks for post-surgical pain management: a narrative review of current research [^68a05fa8]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Rebound pain is a common occurrence after peripheral nerve blocks, affecting 35–50% of patients. Additionally, rebound pain was observed in 61.7% of the patient with post-peripheral nerve block, and 50.6% experienced severe rebound pain. Preoperative dexamethasone use, preoperative pain, type of surgery, postoperative NSAID use, and opioid use were independent risk factors. Healthcare providers should employ preventive measures for patients who are at increased risk of experiencing rebound pain. Current evidence supports the use of dexamethasone, either intravenously or perineurally, to mitigate rebound pain in patients who have undergone a peripheral nerve block following surgery. The consistent and noteworthy positive outcomes render this approach robust; therefore, dexamethasone should be used whenever possible to prevent rebound pain with peripheral nerve blocks. While continuous infraclavicular BPB did not result in a decrease in overall opioid usage compared to BPB alone, it proved to successfully manage rebound pain at 9 and 12h after surgery for distal radius fracture fixation under BPB. The double-blind prospective study found that one dose of intravenious ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) did not diminish the incidence or intensity of rebound pain following surgery. Predictive risk factors for rebound pain included bone surgery, severe preoperative pain, and high pain catastrophizing. By Day 30, patients with rebound pain reported increased daily pain with neuropathic features, but central sensitization was not involved. The findings indicate that despite adequate postoperative analgesia, rebound pain is common, highlighting the need for individualized pain management strategies based on preoperative pain intensity and patient pain perception.

It is often underreported in clinical trials but is prevalent in routine practice. Younger patients, females, and those undergoing bone surgeries are at higher risk for this challenging postoperative pain response. The use of adjuvants in peripheral nerve blocks was associated with a lower likelihood of developing rebound pain compared to nerve blocks without adjuvants. This effect may be due to the addition of adjuvants, which prolong the duration of analgesia and reduce the overall dose of local anesthetics required, thereby decreasing the incidence of rebound pain when the nerve block wears off. A RCT found that the combination of pre-operative dexamethasone and post-operative FICB resulted in significantly lower VAS scores, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing times, serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, CRP), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores compared to the control group and the FICB-only group.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^341f22e6]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are frequently employed in CRPS management due to their potent anti-inflammatory properties. They suppress the expression of multiple inflammation-related genes activated during chronic inflammation, thereby alleviating swelling, pain, and immune responses. Moreover, corticosteroids may inhibit microglial activation in the central nervous system, thereby reducing central sensitization and promoting pain relief. The efficacy of oral corticosteroids in controlling inflammatory symptoms, such as edema, localized warmth, and erythema, in patients with CRPS has been demonstrated in several studies. However, evidence supporting their analgesic effects remains limited. A systematic narrative review by Kwak et al suggests that prednisolone may help alleviate various CRPS symptoms, including pain, sensory and motor disturbances, edema, and limited range of motion. A scoping review by Her et al indicates that systemic corticosteroids provide effective short-term pain relief but do not lead to improved functional outcomes. However, a meta-analysis by Zhu et al reveals that corticosteroids did not produce significant analgesic effects in the short or long term. Moreover, the study reports that glucocorticoids are safe, exhibiting no significant difference in adverse events compared to that of a placebo. Overall, while evidence regarding the analgesic efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in CRPS remains inconsistent, their safety profile appears to be well-established. Regarding dosage, earlier studies administered 30 to 100 mg/day of prednisolone. Conversely, several reports suggest that even 30 mg/day can yield significant clinical benefits, suggesting it is an optimal dose. Moreover, a comparative study found no significant difference in efficacy between low-dose (30 mg/day) and high-dose (60 mg/day) regimens, supporting the lower dose's effectiveness and safety. While typical treatment duration ranges from 1 to 3 months, shorter courses of 1–2 weeks have shown effectiveness. Approximately 30% of patients may experience mild, reversible side effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort, mood changes, and weight gain.

### Do corticosteroids provide analgesic effects in cancer patients? A systematic literature review [^c1a2ac62]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Corticosteroids are frequently used in cancer patients for their analgesic properties. The evidence for analgesic effects of corticosteroids in palliative care has not been established.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the use of corticosteroids in cancer pain management.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed. The articles were evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations system by two independent reviewers.

Results

The search provided 514 references, four of which were included. Another two trials were identified from reference lists. Two of these six studies were excluded from the qualitative review. One crossover study showed a significant reduction in pain intensity of 13 (visual analogue 0–100 scale) accompanied by significant lower analgesic consumption in favor of the steroid group. In another study, the addition of steroids did not have any effect on pain. In two studies, outcomes of pain intensity or analgesic consumption were not adequately reported. However, one of these studies showed significant pain reduction, whereas the other found no effect. Corticosteroids given in medium doses were well tolerated in studies for up to seven days. However, the studies indicated that corticosteroids may have serious toxicity and even higher mortality when administered in high doses over eight weeks.

Conclusion

Corticosteroids may have a moderate analgesic effect in cancer patients. The paucity of relevant studies was striking; consequently, the evidence was graded as "very low". More studies addressing the analgesic efficacy in cancer patients are required.

### Dexamethasone as an additive to bupivacaine in an ultrasound-guided adductor canal block for the management of persistent pain after arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: a randomized, double-blind study [^d76c9989]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is defined as "pain that persists for three months after surgical intervention; that was not present before intervention. The characteristics of PPSP differ from those of preoperative pain, which is localized to the surgical site with the exclusion of other causes of pain (e.g. malignancy recurrence, infection). Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) can lead to limitations in activities and psychological burdens, as well as disappointment and frustrating feelings of the surgical team. Therefore, preventive measures to minimize PPSP should be considered. Although arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is a common minimally invasive ambulatory knee surgery, it is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain. Persistent pain after ACL reconstruction can be severe enough to limit daily and sports activities, with an incidence ranging from 5–22%, but the cause remains uncertain. The major risk factors for PPSP are the type of surgery, surgical technique, and perioperative pain level. The level of preoperative pain is one of the strongest and most consistent independent risk factors for PPP regardless of surgery type. Specifically, for ACL reconstruction, regional analgesia (RA) has become an essential component of the postoperative multimodal analgesic regimen. RA not only improves acute postoperative pain but also attenuates chronic postoperative pain. Compared with other orthopedic medical procedures, including rotator cuff repair, meniscal debridement, and labral repair, ACL reconstruction has subjectively been ranked as the most painful.

Dexamethasone is the most commonly used regional anesthesia adjuvant for prolonging the postoperative analgesic effect of peripheral nerve block, with satisfying results. To the best of our knowledge, no trials have investigated the effect of perineural dexamethasone on persistent postoperative pain after ACL reconstruction. We hypothesize that dexamethasone might be able to decrease incidence of persistent postoperative pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to prevent C fiber mediated nociception and block ectopic neuronal firing. The aim of the present study investigated the effect of dexamethasone, an adjuvant to local anesthetics in ultrasound-guided adductor canal blocks, on persistent postsurgical pain after ACL reconstruction.

### Epidural methadone results in dose-dependent analgesia in cancer pain, further enhanced by epidural dexamethasone [^48af20ee]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Spinal analgesics have been suggested as the fourth step in the World Health Organisation guidelines in the management of cancer pain for those patients who suffer from severe and refractory pain, or are incapable to bear the adverse effects from oral opioids. Although there are not sufficient clinical trials to evaluate spinal opioids in adult cancer patients, morphine has been one of the cornerstones for the management of chronic intractable cancer pain. Due to the proximity to the receptor sites, the therapeutic efficacy of spinal opioid application lasts longer and also reduces systemic side effects. However, some patients unable to tolerate spinal morphine may suffer with side-effects from high doses. The opioid methadone has a broad-spectrum of suggested spinal actions: μ receptor agonist, N -methyl-𝒟-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor antagonist, glial activator, and has been increasingly used as a second-line opioid in recent years in the management of cancer-related pain. In addition, corticosteroids were described to be commonly used in cancer pain, in spite of its limited scientific evidence. The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential role of epidural methadone in cancer pain therapy. Its efficacy was further evaluated by the association of epidural dexamethasone.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^66abe616]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids vs placebo for acute dental pain — pain outcomes indicate that at 6 h follow-up on a visual analog scale (0–100), the mean difference was 8.79 points lower (14.8 to 2.77 points lower) with corticosteroids, based on 396 participants from 7 RCTs, with certainty rated Low; at 24 h, the mean difference was 8.89 points lower (10.71 to 7.06 points lower) from 1,555 participants in 23 RCTs, with certainty rated Very low. Median pain with no treatment was 32.43 points at 6 h and 26.06 points at 24 h. The table notes "There may be a trivial benefit of corticosteroids compared with no treatment (placebo) in terms of pain measured 6 h postoperatively", and "There is very low certainty evidence regarding the difference between corticosteroids and no treatment (placebo) in terms of pain measured 24 h postoperatively". Total Pain Relief at 6 h and Global Efficacy Rating at 6 h were not measured; Mood Alteration was not measured.

### Effectiveness of single intravenous dexamethasone in prolongation of spinal anesthesia for postoperative analgesia in elective cesarean section: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^9ebe7dfe]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative administering of high-dose dexamethasone (greater than 0.2 mg/kg) reduces postoperative pain and spares opioids. After surgical procedures, an effective multimodal pain management strategy using intermediate dose dexamethasone (0.11 to 0.2 mg/kg) has been found to be safe with minimal side effects. During cesarean sections, preoperative IV dexamethasone administration has a stronger impact on postoperative pain management.

Intravenous dexamethasone prolongs spinal anesthesia during a cesarean section, improving pain control, and lowering postoperative pain and opioid consumption. It also lessens sore throats caused by intubation and reduces opioid consumption. Additionally, there is a decreased incidence of rebound pain when intraoperative IV dexamethasone is administered. Early postoperative administration of a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg significantly reduces the need for overall analgesic medication and provides a substantial analgesic benefit.

Administering high-dose dexamethasone intraoperatively (greater than 0.2 mg/kg) reduces postoperative pain and spares opioids. Following surgery, an effective multimodal pain management strategy is the use of intermediate dose dexamethasone (0.11 to 0.2 mg/kg), which is safe and has few side effects. Preoperative IV dexamethasone administration has a stronger impact on postoperative pain control during cesarean delivery. Additionally, there is a decreased incidence of rebound pain when intraoperative IV dexamethasone is administered. A single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg reduces the need for overall analgesics by providing a substantial analgesic benefit in the early postoperative phase.

This systematic review set out to bring the body of research on dexamethasone's effectiveness for postoperative analgesia and spinal anesthesia prolongation in women having cesarean deliveries up to date and draw conclusions. Additionally, it offers dosage guidelines for achieving the best possible effects from this medication.

### Effect of dexamethasone as an analgesic adjuvant to multimodal pain treatment after total knee arthroplasty: randomised clinical trial [^0a4e967b]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strength and limitations

Our trial has several strengths. Firstly, our methodology was predefined before starting the trial, and similarly, the detailed statistical analysis plan was published before the analysis of trial data began. Secondly, participants, staff, investigators, surgeons, outcome assessors, statisticians, and those drawing conclusions were blinded to the intervention. Thirdly, the trial had a pragmatic design and broad inclusion criteria for participation, giving clinical relevance of trial results to patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Combined with a multicentre setup, this trial broadly mimics daily clinical routines assuring a high external validity of our findings. Lastly, our primary outcome (48 hour escape morphine use) is a cumulative proxy measure of patients' total pain, which increases the clinical importance of this outcome.

Our trial also has limitations. Firstly, our results on opioid consumption and pain levels are limited to the first 48 hours after surgery, so the potential long term adjuvant analgesic effects of dexamethasone are unclear based on our results. Secondly, we did not include a quality of recovery measure, which might have increased information on the effect of glucocorticoids on postoperative rehabilitation. Thirdly, we tested the effects of one and two doses of 24 mg dexamethasone and therefore cannot conclude that other doses and treatment regimens of dexamethasone might have adjuvant analgesic effects. Fourthly, as reported in the statistical analysis plan, no previous reliable reports of follow-up data at 48 hours for selected secondary and explorative outcomes exist. Therefore, power estimations of non-primary outcomes in this trial are uncertain. This uncertainty requires reservations about reaching a clear cost-benefit conclusion between the positive effects of the intervention and the possible risk for the patients. Fifthly, the choice of anaesthetic technique was at the discretion of the anaesthetist, which might have affected the outcomes. The type of spinal and general anaesthesia was standardised and according to protocol, however, and was balanced between the three groups (table 1). Sixthly, blood sugar levels were not assessed as an outcome, but in previous trials the rise in blood sugar caused by dexamethasone was shown to be negligible. Thus we excluded only participants with dysregulated diabetes. Seventhly, we recognise that the risk of remifentanil administered to patients operated on under general anaesthesia might result in postoperative opioid induced hyperalgesia, although the clinical effect is debateable. Eighthly, we did not systematically involve patients or patient unions in the construction of the trial and trial protocol, which might have improved the choice of trial outcomes. Ninthly, the pragmatic design might introduce a small difference in how each patient was treated, from the type of operation to the way in which rehabilitation at the ward was handled. This randomised clinical trial comprised a predefined sample size, which was reached, and the randomisation and stratification for site should result in similar distributions of the surgical and rehabilitative methods in the groups compared. Furthermore, each site followed uniform local standard protocols, and analyses showed no interaction between site and the trial interventions. Tenthly, our measurement of intraoperative blood loss does not allow firm conclusions to be reached about the effects of intervention on perioperative blood loss, as such measurements are complex, and also include, for example, postoperative and hidden blood losses. Lastly, our trial does not offer evidence transferable to patients who did not fulfil the eligibility criteria — in particular, patients with BMI above 40 or who used opioids above 30 mg of oral morphine equivalent dose before surgery.

### Efficacy of different routes of dexamethasone administration for preventing rebound pain following peripheral nerve blocks in adult surgical patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ee5268f4]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rebound pain, characterised by intense pain or discomfort as the effects of a peripheral nerve block diminish, remains a clinical problem. Peri-operative dexamethasone administration may reduce the incidence of rebound pain. This systematic and network meta-analysis aimed to determine the optimal route of dexamethasone administration for the prevention of rebound pain.

Methods

We searched databases for randomised controlled trials according to pre-determined criteria. We compared intravenous and perineural dexamethasone as an adjunct to peripheral nerve blocks, with the control group as a common comparator. The primary outcome was the incidence of rebound pain. The likelihood of an intervention ranking highest was calculated using the surface area under the cumulative ranking curve.

Results

In total, 14 studies with 1058 patients were included. When compared with the comparator group, we found that intravenous dexamethasone ranked the highest, with an anticipated effect of 298 fewer cases of rebound pain per 1000 people (odds ratio (OR) (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.12 (0.03–0.44)); moderate certainty evidence). This was followed by perineural dexamethasone with an anticipated effect of 190 fewer cases per 1000 people (OR (95%CrI) 0.34 (0.07–1.32); low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of an effect between the route of administration and time to onset of rebound pain.

Discussion

Intravenous dexamethasone was associated with a high probability of decreasing the incidence of rebound pain following peripheral nerve block. This is based on moderate certainty of evidence. Future studies on identifying the optimal dose are now warranted.

### Dexamethasone for symptom burden in advanced cancer patients… [^c01fcc95]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone for Symptom Burden in Advanced Cancer PatientsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Dexamethasone decreases inflammation and also suppresses the immune system. If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will be randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone or a placebo by mouth in the morning and at night with food every day for 14 days. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but which has no active ingredients. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either of the 2 groups. You, the medical staff, and researchers will not know to which group you have been assigned. If you develop intolerable side effects while on this study, the medication will be stopped and you will be removed from the study. This is an investigational study. Dexamethasone has been approved by the FDA and is a commercially available drug. It is FDA approved at this dose level.

Its use in this study, for this purpose, is investigational. About 160 patients will take part in this study. Up to 110 will be enrolled at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The other sites participating in this study are Lyndon Baines Johnson breast oncology clinic Houston Texas, and Four Seasons Hospice in Flat Rock, North Carolina.
- Present with 3 or more symptoms during the last 24 hours, with an average intensity of ≥ 4 on a 0–10 scale, in which 0 = no symptom, and 10 = worst possible symptom.
- No clinical evidence of cognitive failure as evidenced by Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score of 13 or less at baseline
- Must be 18 years of older.
- No longer a candidate for aggressive anticancer therapy-such as receptor blockers Patients on oral or palliative chemotherapy are eligible for study if approved by primary oncologist prior to inclusion. Patients who are receiving IV chemotherapy are eligible for study if approved by primary oncologist and they have completed 1st line of chemotherapy and are deemed stable by primary oncologist. The PI of this study will obtain and document approval from the primary oncologist in the patient's study documents.

### Effect of intravenous dexamethasone on postoperative pain after spinal anaesthesia-a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^b7bd0420]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

There are data suggesting that intravenous dexamethasone has an effect on postoperative analgesia when given during single-shot spinal anaesthesia. However, the research literature is equivocal. We performed a systematic literature search followed by conventional meta-analysis (random effects model). We used trial sequential analysis to control for type-1 and -2 statistical errors. We also performed a leave-one-out meta-analysis for our primary outcome, the consumption of intravenous morphine in the first 24 postoperative hours. We applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the level of evidence. We obtained data from 1133 patients, reported in 17 trials. Reporting quality was high, with low risk of bias. Dexamethasone use was associated with a significant reduction in 24-h morphine consumption, the mean difference (95%CI) being -4.01 (-5.01 to -3.01) mg, 6 trials, 326 participants, I² = 0%. Trial sequential analysis showed that there was firm evidence for the primary outcome, and leave-one-out meta-analysis showed that our result was not driven by one single trial. The GRADE evaluation showed a high level of evidence, suggesting that further studies are unlikely to alter the result. The time to first analgesic request (95%CI) was significantly prolonged by 86.62 (10.62–162.62) min, I² = 93%, in the dexamethasone group. For other secondary outcomes including number of patients requiring rescue analgesia, or visual analogue scale pain scores, we found no evidence of a significant difference between the treatment arms. We report a high level of evidence that intravenous dexamethasone improves postoperative analgesia after spinal anaesthesia.

### Adverse side effects of dexamethasone in surgical patients [^1bbe2e00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In the perioperative period, dexamethasone is widely and effectively used for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), for pain management, and to facilitate early discharge after ambulatory surgery. Long-term treatment with steroids has many side effects, such as adrenal insufficiency, increased infection risk, hyperglycaemia, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and development of diabetes mellitus. However, whether a single steroid load during surgery has negative effects during the postoperative period has not yet been studied.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a steroid load of dexamethasone on postoperative systemic or wound infection, delayed wound healing, and blood glucose change in adult surgical patients (with planned subgroup analysis of patients with and without diabetes).

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science for relevant articles on 29 January 2018. We searched without language or date restriction two clinical trial registries to identify ongoing studies, and we handsearched the reference lists of relevant publications to identify all eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing an incidental steroid load of dexamethasone versus a control intervention for adult patients undergoing surgery. We required that studies include a follow-up of 30 days for proper assessment of the number of postoperative infections, delayed wound healing, and the glycaemic response.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data from relevant studies, and assessed all included studies for bias. We resolved differences by discussion and pooled included studies in a meta-analysis. We calculated Peto odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. Our primary outcomes were postoperative systemic or wound infection, delayed wound healing, and glycaemic response within 24 hours. We created a funnel plot for the primary outcome postoperative (wound or systemic) infection. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included in the meta-analysis 38 studies that included adults undergoing a large variety of surgical procedures (i.e. abdominal surgery, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopaedic surgery). Age range of participants was 18 to 80 years. There is probably little or no difference in the risk of postoperative (wound or systemic) infection with dexamethasone compared with no treatment, placebo, or active control (ramosetron, ondansetron, or tropisetron) (Peto OR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.27; 4931 participants, 27 studies; I² = 27%; moderate-quality evidence). The effects of dexamethasone on delayed wound healing are unclear because the wide confidence interval includes both meaningful benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.43; 1072 participants, eight studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Dexamethasone may produce a mild increase in glucose levels among participants without diabetes during the first 12 hours after surgery (MD 13 mg/dL, 95% CI 6 to 21; 10 studies; 595 participants; I² = 50%; low-quality evidence). We identified two studies reporting on glycaemic response after dexamethasone in participants with diabetes within 24 hours after surgery (MD 32 mg/dL, 95% CI 15 to 49; 74 participants; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

A single dose of dexamethasone probably does not increase the risk for postoperative infection. It is uncertain whether dexamethasone has an effect on delayed wound healing in the general surgical population owing to imprecision in trial results. Participants with increased risk for delayed wound healing (e.g. participants with diabetes, those taking immunosuppressive drugs) were not included in the randomized studies reporting on delayed wound healing included in this meta-analysis; therefore our findings should be extrapolated to the clinical setting with caution. Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that dexamethasone induces a mild increase in glucose. For patients with diabetes, very limited evidence suggests a more pronounced increase in glucose. Whether this influences wound healing in a clinically relevant way remains to be established. Once assessed, the three studies awaiting classification and two that are ongoing may alter the conclusions of this review.

### Randomized trial comparing low-vs high-dose IV dexamethasone for patients with moderate to severe migraine [^b0a17054]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Dexamethasone decreases the frequency of migraine recurrence after emergency department (ED) discharge. However, the optimal dose of dexamethasone is unknown. We hypothesized that dexamethasone 16 mg IV would allow greater rates of sustained headache relief than 4 mg when coadministered with metoclopramide 10 mg IV.

Methods

This was a randomized double-blind study. Adults who presented with a headache meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, migraine criteria were eligible if they rated the headache as moderate or severe in intensity. Pain intensity was assessed for up to 2 hours in the ED and through telephone 48 hours and 7 days later. The primary outcome was sustained headache relief. Secondary outcomes included headache relief within 2 hours and the number of headache days during the subsequent week. Relying on a priori criteria, the data safety monitoring committee recommended halting the study early for futility.

Results

A total of 1,823 patients were screened, and 209 patients were randomized. The mean age was 38 years (SD 11). One hundred seventy-nine of 209 (86%) identified as women. One hundred fifty-one of 209 (72%) of the population reported severe intensity; the rest reported moderate. Thirty-five of 102 (34%) participants in the metoclopramide +4 mg arm achieved sustained headache relief as did 42/102 (41%) participants in the metoclopramide +16 mg arm (absolute difference 7%, 95% CI -6% to 20%). Headache relief within 2 hours occurred in 77/104 (74%) low-dose and 82/105 (78%) high-dose participants (absolute difference 4%, 95% CI -8% to 16%). During the week after ED discharge, low-dose participants reported a median of 2 headache days (25th, 75th percentile 1, 5); in the high-dose arm, this was also 2 (25th, 75th percentile 0, 4) (mean difference 0.4, 95% CI -0.3 to 1.2).

Discussion

When added to 10 mg IV metoclopramide, doses of dexamethasone greater than 4 mg are unlikely to benefit patients in the ED with migraine.

Trial Registration Information

This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on October 2, 2019 (NCT04112823). The first patient was enrolled on December 22, 2019.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that 16 mg of IV dexamethasone is unlikely to provide greater rates of sustained headache relief than 4 mg of IV dexamethasone among patients in the ED with migraine treated concurrently with IV metoclopramide.

### Subcutaneous betamethasone: an alternative to out-of-stock dexamethasone [^2364ef9c]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2025). High credibility.

Dexamethasone is the most widely used corticosteroid in palliative care due to its potent anti-inflammatory action. When oral administration is not feasible, dexamethasone is often administered subcutaneously. During a recent shortage of injectable dexamethasone, we were required to consider alternatives. However, evidence and clinical experience regarding the use of alternative subcutaneous corticosteroids in the palliative population remain limited. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of subcutaneously administered betamethasone in the palliative demographic as an alternative to out-of-stock dexamethasone injection. Eight patients received subcutaneous betamethasone for various indications, including intracranial hypertension, liver capsule pain, superior vena cava obstruction, malignant spinal cord compression and subacute bowel obstruction. All patients tolerated the treatment at different doses (range 1–16 mg) for various periods (range 6–27 days) without developing injection-site reactions or severe adverse effects. Improvement in symptom scores and relevant clinical assessments were observed. Subcutaneously administered betamethasone was well tolerated and effective in managing various indications in palliative patients, demonstrating its potential as a viable alternative to dexamethasone during stock shortages. Further prospective studies are required to establish its utility and tolerability in this demographic.

### Does the addition of dexamethasone to standard therapy for acute migraine headache decrease the incidence of recurrent headache for patients treated in the emergency department? A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^d1fce4a7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Neurogenic inflammation is thought to play a role in the development and perpetuation of migraine headache. The emergency department (ED) administration of dexamethasone in addition to standard antimigraine therapy has been used to decrease the incidence of recurrent headaches at 24 to 72 hours following evaluation. This systematic review details the completed trials that have evaluated the use of dexamethasone in this role.

Methods

The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, recent emergency medicine scientific abstracts, and several prepublication trial registries for potential investigations related to the research question. The authors included studies that incorporated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology and that were performed in the ED. A fixed-effects and random-effects model was used to obtain summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the self-reported outcome of moderate or severe headache on follow-up evaluation.

Results

A pooled analysis of seven trials involving 742 patients suggests a modest but significant benefit when dexamethasone is added to standard antimigraine therapy to reduce the rate of patients with moderate or severe headache on 24- to 72-hour follow-up evaluation (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.95; absolute risk reduction = 9.7%). The treatment of 1,000 patients with acute migraine headache using dexamethasone in addition to standard antimigraine therapy would be expected to prevent 97 patients from experiencing the outcome of moderate or severe headache at 24 to 72 hours after ED evaluation. The sensitivity analysis yielded similar results with sequential trial elimination, indicating that no single trial was responsible for the overall result. Adverse effects related to the administration of a single dose of dexamethasone were infrequent, mild, and transient.

Conclusions

These results suggest that dexamethasone is efficacious in preventing headache recurrence and safe when added to standard treatment for the management of acute migraine headache in the ED.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). High credibility.

Areas for future research in TJA corticosteroid use: The best available evidence on corticosteroids in primary TJA includes high quality data but has many limitations, and a majority of studies evaluate intravenous dexamethasone; evidence for other intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone is limited by a small number of studies and inconsistent outcome reporting, limiting conclusions on their efficacy. It is unclear if there are any differences in efficacy or side effect profiles between intravenous dexamethasone and other intravenous corticosteroids, and further research should compare the various corticosteroids in TJA.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^9e6fd376]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP lumbar epidural steroid injection approaches and steroid type — One trial showed the transforaminal approach to be superior to interlaminar and caudal in a small study with only a 6-month follow-up, while other studies found no significant difference between specific technique variations (pre-ganglionic vs ganglionic at 6 months; supraneural safe triangle vs Kambin triangle at 3 months). In steroid formulation comparisons, transforaminal injections with particulate versus nonparticulate corticosteroid showed effectiveness of triamcinolone and dexamethasone with pain relief and functional improvement up to 6 months without clear group differences. In a comparative evaluation with randomization into 3 groups, 140 patients were allocated to caudal (80 patients), transforaminal (40 patients), or interlaminar (8 patients), with one-year JOA score improvement in 74.3% for caudal, 77.7% for interlaminar, and 90% for transforaminal; the transforaminal route was significantly more effective than caudal and interlaminar at both 6 months and one-year, with no significant difference between caudal and interlaminar. Another study randomized 90 patients to caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal (30 patients in each group), followed patients for 12 months but presented only 6-month results, reporting that change in pain scores was statistically different at 1- and 6-month intervals.

### Dexamethasone prescribing for cancer pain between palliative care and radiation oncology [^7f7a25b6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dexamethasone is a commonly prescribed corticosteroid by both palliative care physicians and radiation oncologists for the treatment of metastatic cancer pain. However, clinical evidence for dexamethasone dose and efficacy is lacking, and prescribing between these different specialties may be influenced by other factors. This study investigates the dexamethasone prescriptions of palliative care physicians and radiation oncologists for cancer pain and their prescription rationales.

Methods

Palliative care physicians and radiation oncologists in British Columbia, Canada, were surveyed on their preferred dexamethasone prescription in response to 4 case vignettes of patients with metastatic cancer and asked to choose a rationale from a list of options which were then categorized as "habit-based", "results-based", or "evidence-based". Response frequencies between the specialties were compared with odds ratios.

Results

The total daily dose and duration of dexamethasone prescriptions were similar between the specialties. Palliative care physicians were significantly more likely than radiation oncologists to prescribe a single daily dose of dexamethasone rather than a divided dose (OR 3.3 [95% CI 2.0–5.5]). This significant difference persisted when separately analyzing results at different total daily doses. Both specialties were more likely to select habit-based rationales rather than evidence-based rationales, with no significant difference between specialties.

Conclusion

These findings show that dexamethasone prescriptions are habit-based and that prescribing habits are different between palliative care physicians and radiation oncologists. Interventions based on these findings could potentially prevent unequal patient care. Further qualitative investigations of physician perceptions are indicated to better understand habit-based corticosteroid prescribing patterns.

### High-dose steroids in high pain responders undergoing total knee arthroplasty: a randomised double-blind trial [^f774b0ce]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- Moderate-to-severe pain is common after knee arthroplasty; this limits early mobilisation and range of joint movements.
- A sizeable proportion of patients undergoing joint arthroplasty have known risk factors for severe pain; these typically have very poor recovery and functional outcomes.
- This trial found that a relatively high dose of i.v. dexamethasone, 1.0 mg kg⁻¹, improved analgesic and functional outcomes, and quality of recovery, after knee arthroplasty surgery.

Primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical procedure and is expected to increase in frequency. In spite of extensive research, pain is still a significant problem, both in the early and late recovery after TKA, which, combined with fatigue and muscle weakness, inhibits early mobilisation and recovery. Current multimodal opioid-sparing techniques, including the use of paracetamol, NSAIDs, or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors; local infiltration analgesia (LIA); and peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), still leave many patients with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. In addition, specific patient groups are at increased risk of excessive postoperative pain, such as pain catastrophisers and patients on preoperative opioid treatment.

In recent years, several studies have shown an additional analgesic benefit of perioperative glucocorticoids, often in doses (∼24 mg dexamethasone [DXM] or equivalents) beyond the conventional DXM 4–8 mg dose for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis. However, the potential additive effect of higher doses of glucocorticoids has not yet been investigated in TKA. Research into specific postoperative pain management strategies for risk groups (possible high pain responders [HPRs]) is limited, and with the ongoing opioid crisis in healthcare worldwide, it is especially important to investigate personalised opioid-sparing care in HPR patients.

Consequently, the aim of the present study was to perform a clinical trial of high-dose (HD) DXM 1 mg kg⁻¹ i.v. vs intermediate-dose (ID) DXM 0.3 mg kg⁻¹ i.v. administered preoperatively on postoperative pain and early recovery after TKA in patients predicted to be HPRs.

### Prophylactic dexamethasone for rebound pain after peripheral nerve block in adult surgical patients: systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f9bf662a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rebound pain occurs after the resolution of peripheral nerve block and hampers patient recovery in the postoperative period. We sought to synthesise available data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic dexamethasone for rebound pain in adult patients undergoing surgery with a peripheral nerve block.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, RCTs reporting rebound pain and use of dexamethasone in the context of a peripheral nerve block were searched in various databases and updated in May 2023. The primary outcome was the incidence of rebound pain; secondary outcomes included the severity and time to onset of rebound pain, patient satisfaction with pain control, sleep disturbance because of pain, and adverse effects of dexamethasone. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on the effect of route of administration (intravenous or perineural) on the incidence of rebound pain. Trial sequential analysis was performed to rule out the possibility of a false positive result.

Results

Seven RCTs comprising 574 patients were included in this review. The dexamethasone group was associated with a reduction in the incidence of rebound pain with an odds ratio of 0.16 (95% confidence interval 0.10–0.27, P = 0.00, I² = 0%) compared with the control group. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the adequate information size for the beneficial effect of dexamethasone. Subgroup analysis showed that both intravenous and perineural administration were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of rebound pain.

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that both intravenous and perineural dexamethasone reduce the incidence of rebound pain after a peripheral nerve block provided for postoperative analgesia.

### Effect of dexamethasone and ramosetron on the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in low-risk patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^217bd0cd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Single-dose dexamethasone is effective for the management of postoperative pain after various surgeries, including laparoscopic surgery. The possible mechanisms underlying the analgesic effect of single-dose dexamethasone include anti-inflammatory activity and the modulation of systemic physiological responses. Lee et al. reported that pain scores and rescue analgesic consumption were significantly lower in groups R and DR than in group C 1 h after thyroid surgery. However, in this study, the pain scores of the three groups were similar 0–1 h postoperatively (mean score, 2.6), and the percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesics 0–1 h postoperatively was significantly lower in groups R and DR than that in group C. These results may indicate that ramosetron and dexamethasone are effective in reducing severe pain immediately after surgery. The percentages of patients requiring rescue analgesics 1–6, 6–24, and 24–48 h postoperatively were similar among the groups, which may be attributed to the study including patients undergoing surgeries that cause less pain.

We monitored the patients for major adverse effects related to the administration of ramosetron and dexamethasone, such as headache, dizziness, and drowsiness, for 48 h postoperatively. Both drugs were tolerated well during the study period, and the addition of dexamethasone to ramosetron did not influence the incidence of adverse events. The incidence of these adverse effects (8%) was lower than that of PONV (17%). The incidence of side effects, such as headache, dizziness, and drowsiness, was lower than that reported in previous studies (25–39%). The prolonged use of steroids, such as dexamethasone, is associated with dangerous adverse effects, including an increased risk of wound infection and anastomotic leak. However, adverse effects, such as wound infection or anastomotic leaks, were not observed in any of the patients in this study. Thus, a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to increase the incidence of these adverse effects.

This study has a limitation. Our study included patients who had undergone several types of surgery. However, only patients with relatively short surgical times were studied to minimize the confounding effects of surgery.

### Intravenous dexamethasone transiently elevates blood glucose levels and reduces pain after TKA in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled study [^6950173f]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective perioperative blood glucose control is crucial for reducing postoperative complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who are undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of intravenous (IV) dexamethasone on blood glucose levels, insulin requirements, postoperative pain, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients with well-controlled type-2 DM.

Methods

A total of 83 Asian patients with well-controlled type-2 DM (defined as a preoperative glycated hemoglobin level of ≤ 7.0%) undergoing primary TKA were randomized to receive either IV dexamethasone or normal saline solution. Blood glucose and insulin requirements were monitored postoperatively up to day 5, and pain and PONV were assessed using a numeric rating scale.

Results

Compared with the control, IV dexamethasone transiently elevated blood glucose levels on the day of surgery and on postoperative day 1, with the levels returning to baseline by day 3. Insulin requirements were higher in the intervention group on postoperative day 1 (p = 0.004). While IV dexamethasone did not significantly reduce PONV, it effectively alleviated postoperative pain up to day 3.

Conclusions

In patients with DM who underwent TKA, IV dexamethasone administration transiently increased blood glucose on the day of surgery and on postoperative day 1 and elevated insulin requirements on postoperative day 1. Despite having no impact on PONV, IV dexamethasone provided clinical benefits by reducing early postoperative pain. These findings suggest the potential benefits of IV dexamethasone in enhancing perioperative management strategies for patients with DM who are undergoing TKA.

### Corticosteroids for pain of spinal origin: epidural and intraarticular administration [^6ef330fb]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Targeted interventional delivery of corticosteroids remains a mainstay of treatment for spinal pain syndromes because this approach has a wider therapeutic index than other approaches. The best evidence for analgesic efficacy is in subacute radicular syndromes associated with new-onset or recurrent lumbar radiculitis. Complications often relate to drug delivery technique as much as actions of the steroid itself and require careful consideration and vigilance by the administering physician. Considerable uncertainty persists concerning which patients with chronic pain are most likely to benefit from corticosteroid injections. Matching this treatment option with specific spinal pain syndromes remains a major challenge.

### PROSPECT guideline for elective caesarean section: updated systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^c2040c71]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The majority of the studies included in this systematic review were determined to be of high quality. The updated literature strengthens the previous PROSPECT recommendations for pain management in patients undergoing elective caesarean section and modifies it in certain aspects. The updated PROSPECT methodology further strengthens the recommendations, because it goes beyond assessment of the available evidence based solely on statistical analysis [8].

Of note, it is essential to highlight that this guideline focuses on elective caesarean section under neuraxial anaesthesia. Importantly, these recommendations should not be applied to other patient populations such as emergency or unplanned caesarean section or surgery performed under general anaesthesia.

The recommended strategies have sufficient procedure‐specific evidence and have a positive balance of clinical benefits and risk of side‐effects (Table 1). Basic analgesia after caesarean section should always consist of paracetamol and NSAIDs started intra‐operatively (after delivery) and continued postoperatively, unless there are contra‐indications. Of note, several studies demonstrated equally good pain control with NSAIDs compared with opioids. Regular administration of basic analgesics is important to limit the need for rescue opioid analgesia. Moreover, studies investigating an analgesic strategy to manage pain relief after caesarean section should not omit this basic strategy of analgesia so as to establish the additional value of an investigational approach. In addition to basic analgesics, i.v. dexamethasone demonstrated positive effects on pain scores and opioid consumption. In addition, i.v. dexamethasone provides anti‐emetic prophylaxis. Thus, i.v. dexamethasone is recommended. Caution is required in patients with glucose intolerance.

Table 1
Overall recommendations for pain management in patients undergoing elective caesarean section.

Intrathecal morphine at doses of 100 µg or lower is recommended. Doses lower than 100 µg result in adequate analgesia with a reduced incidence of side‐effects. Recently, Sharawi et al. confirmed the safety of intrathecal morphine when used in patients undergoing caesarean section [154]. Importantly, basic analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and NSAIDs) and i.v. dexamethasone should be used with intrathecal morphine. Of note, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK recommend intrathecal diamorphine as an alternative to intrathecal morphine [155]. Intrathecal diamorphine 300 µg is recommended. When spinal anaesthesia is not possible or when an epidural catheter is in situ, epidural morphine or diamorphine both in doses of 2–3 mg can be used.

### Preoperative dexamethasone for acute post-thoracotomy analgesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^f8042668]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The single administration of dexamethasone during the preoperative period does not reduce post-thoracotomy pain during the recovery period.

### Pain management after thoracotomy with dexamethasone and bupivacaine through a peripleural cather: a randomized controlled trial [^331b3f4d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thoracotomy and its extensive incision on a part of the body with sensitive skin and rich sensory nerves brings significant pain after surgery, which may have negative consequences during the postoperative period if pain control is inadequate. These consequences may include complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. In addition, chronic post-thoracotomy pain (CPTP) can be the result of poorly controlled acute pain following the surgery and persists for at least 2 months. Therefore, perioperative analgesia is necessary to reduce postoperative pain (POP), prevent complications, and improve quality of life after thoracotomy.

Previous studies showed that glucocorticoids can be used as postoperative analgesic agents due to their nerve-blocking and anti-inflammatory properties in different types of surgeries. In addition, a previous meta-analysis showed the beneficial role of intravenous dexamethasone in reducing POP and postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV). However, the right dosage, efficacy, and the best route of administering it are not clear in thoracotomy. A critical analysis of enhanced recovery after thoracic surgery (ERATS) protocols underscored the ambiguity within the field. Among the five protocols scrutinized, each employed distinct techniques for POP management, ranging from oral medication to intravenous, intercostal, paravertebral, and epidural anesthesia. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) are common approaches of POP management after thoracic surgery. Nevertheless, their implementation can be technically demanding and prone to considerable risks, such as pneumothorax, hematoma, dura puncture, infection, and nerve injury. However, analgesia in peripleural area, where the injury has happened and is rich in somatic pain sensation, represents a regional, multilevel intercostal analgesic approach employed for managing POP. This technique involves the placement of a catheter above the parietal pleura at the end of the surgery under general anesthesia or direct thoracoscopic visualization. Importantly, no discernible impact on mobility, visceral physiologic functions, or blood pressure was found in previous investigations. Peripleural analgesia is gaining popularity among alternate method of pain relief in thoracotomy, breast, and minimally invasive cardiothoracic surgery. Peripleural analgesia catheters enable a continuous administration of local anesthetic agents during the perioperative period to the exact intervention site. It is hypothesized that analgesia occurs by diffusion of local anesthetic into the parietal pleura, intercostal nerves, and intrathoracic sympathetic chain, thus providing adequate analgesia for unilateral thoracic and upper abdominal pain. Previous studies have investigated the effect of subpleural multilevel intercostal continuous infusion of ropivacaine after thoracoscopic lung resection. However, to date, no study has explored the effect of a bolus dose of dexamethasone via peripleural catheter on POP after thoracotomy. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of administering dexamethasone plus bupivacaine or bupivacaine plus placebo on POP, PONV, opioid consumption for pain control, and length of hospital stay by using a peripleural catheter before closing the chest wall in thoracotomy patients.

### Randomized trial of IV dexamethasone for acute migraine in the emergency department [^a3a053b7]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is not yet clear if corticosteroids are useful for the treatment of migraine. We determined the efficacy of 10 mg of IV dexamethasone as adjuvant therapy for patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with acute migraine.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Subjects were randomized to dexamethasone 10 mg IV or placebo. As primary treatment for their migraine, all subjects received IV metoclopramide. Our primary hypotheses were the following: a greater percentage of patients with migraine who received dexamethasone would 1) achieve a headache-free state in the ED and maintain it for 24 hours and 2) have no headache-related functional impairment after ED discharge when compared to placebo.

Results

A total of 656 patients were approached for participation and 205 were randomized. The persistent pain-free outcome was achieved in 25% of those randomized to dexamethasone and 19% of placebo (p = 0.34). No functional impairment after ED discharge occurred in 67% of those randomized to dexamethasone and 59% of placebo (p = 0.20). In the subgroup of subjects with migraine lasting longer than 72 hours, 38% of those randomized to dexamethasone were persistently pain-free vs 13% of placebo (p = 0.06). Side effect profiles were similar, with the exception of acute medication reactions, which occurred more commonly in the dexamethasone group.

Conclusion

A moderate dose of IV dexamethasone should not be administered routinely for the emergency department-based treatment of acute migraine, although it might be useful for patients with migraine lasting longer than 72 hours.

### The role of combined adjuvant therapeutic drugs in modulating opioid dosage and pain status in cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0c95a643]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of cancer-related pain primarily relies on opioid analgesics, yet their use is frequently complicated by adverse effects and inadequate pain relief at higher doses.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive medications in reducing opioid requirements and improving pain management in patients with cancer-related pain.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to June 2024, encompassing all relevant records. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies that compared the efficacy of combined adjuvant therapy with monotherapy using opioid analgesics for the management of cancer-related pain in adults and reported at least one pertinent outcome measure.

Results

This analysis included 13 studies (10 RCTs, n = 711; 3 retrospective studies, n = 314) evaluating adjunctive therapies including NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and corticosteroids. Combination therapy significantly reduced daily opioid consumption versus monotherapy ([MD] -18.84 mg; 95% CI -28.19 to -9.52; P < 0.0001), with significant reductions specifically for NSAIDs (MD -17.27; 95% CI -30.26 to -4.27; P = 0.009) and anticonvulsants (MD -28.02; 95% CI -47.42 to -8.62; P = 0.005). Adjunctive therapy also significantly improved pain scores with NSAIDs (MD -0.79; 95% CI -0.97 to -0.62; P < 0.00001), dexamethasone (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.23 to -0.63; P = 0.0004), and anticonvulsants (MD -0.23; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.03; P = 0.02). NSAIDs and antidepressants reduced dizziness (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.19–0.59; P = 0.0002), while anticonvulsants increased its risk (OR 3.55; 95% CI 1.98–6.39; P < 0.0001). NSAIDs were associated with lower drowsiness (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.13–0.57; P = 0.0005), whereas anticonvulsants and antidepressants increased drowsiness incidence (OR 3.49; 95% CI 2.02–6.01; P < 0.00001). No significant differences were observed in nausea/vomiting (OR 0.80; P = 0.19) or constipation (OR 0.73; P = 0.53). Meta-analysis of safety outcomes revealed no significant increase in the risk of serious adverse events with combination therapy compared to opioid monotherapy.

Discussion

The findings indicate that combined adjuvant therapy exhibits favorable efficacy and safety profiles in the management of cancer pain. Nevertheless, the selection of drug combinations requires an individualized approach. Future research should focus on further exploring optimized combination strategies to enhance the therapeutic effect.

Conclusion

The findings indicate that combined adjuvant therapy exhibits favorable efficacy and safety profiles in the management of cancer pain.

### The analgesic efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone for post-caesarean pain: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^a63d097d]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Analgesic efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone has not been well defined after caesarean delivery. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of peri-operative dexamethasone administration on postoperative pain after caesarean delivery.

Objectives

We investigated the impact of perioperative intravenous dexamethasone on postoperative pain after caesarean delivery. The two primary outcomes of interest were early (4 to 6h) resting pain scores and time to first rescue analgesia.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane central registers of controlled trials were searched to identify RCTs from inception to April 2021.

Eligibility Criteria

Prospective RCTs comparing the role of intravenous dexamethasone with non-active control were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included trials comparing various doses of dexamethasone without any control treatment arm, dexamethasone with other active drugs and trials comparing different routes of dexamethasone, for example, wound infiltration.

Results

Thirteen RCTs constituting of 988 parturients undergoing caesarean delivery were included. Patients receiving dexamethasone had lower pain scores at rest at 4 to 6h after surgery, mean difference -1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI), -1.85 to -0.73], P < 0.0001, with low quality of evidence (I2 = 94%). Moderate quality of evidence (I2 = 17%) suggested that the time to first rescue analgesia in the dexamethasone group was significantly longer, mean difference 2.64h (95% CI, 1.85 to 3.42), P < 0.0001. Trial sequential analysis for pain scores suggested the benefit of dexamethasone; however, the requisite information size (RIS) could not be reached, whereas RIS was adequate for time to rescue analgesia. Significant reduction in pain scores at all times and opioid consumption at 24h with dexamethasone were observed with sparse reporting on adverse effects.

Conclusion

Peri-operative intravenous dexamethasone was associated with a significant decrease in postoperative pain scores at rest and a longer time to first rescue analgesia, along with a small but statistically significantly reduced opioid consumption after caesarean delivery compared with nonactive control.

### Steroids for post-tonsillectomy pain reduction: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^dab64b05]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether meta-analysis supports the use of corticosteroids to reduce post-tonsillectomy pain for pediatric patients.

Methods

A systematic review of currently available randomized controlled trials using a single-dose, intravenous corticosteroid during pediatric tonsillectomy was performed. Visual analog pain scale (VAS) data was extracted with reviewers blinded to results. Meta-analysis was performed with weighted mean difference and random-effects model using Revman 4.2 software.

Results

Eight randomized trials were included in analysis of post-tonsillectomy pain. A statistically significant reduction in pain as measured by VAS on postoperative day 1 was noted (mean VAS difference = -0.97; CI 95% = -1.74,-0.19; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

A single, intraoperative dose of dexamethasone may reduce post-tonsillectomy pain on postoperative day 1, by a factor of 1 on a 10-point pain scale. As the side effects and cost of dexamethasone dose appear negligible, consideration of routine use seems reasonable.

### Single-dose oral dexamethasone decreases sore throat pain… [^80fdcbeb]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do oral corticosteroids relieve pain in patients with acute sore throat. Bottom Line Sore throats are rarely fatal anymore, but there is really no such thing as "just a sore throat. " Whereas antibiotics have no analgesic activity, a single low dose of a corticosteroid such as oral dexamethasone — 0. 6 mg per kg for children at least five years of age and up to 10 mg for adults — is effective in decreasing pain in the first 24 hours. Synopsis To determine whether an oral corticosteroid aids in symptom resolution, these researchers searched four databases, including Cochrane Central, trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved studies, and identified 10 studies with a total of 1, 426 patients five years or older.

Two reviewers independently selected the studies for inclusion and abstracted the data, selecting randomized controlled trials that compared one or two daily doses of corticosteroid with standard treatment or placebo in patients who presented to an emergency department or primary care office with clinical sore throat. Five studies evaluated oral dexamethasone, and three studies evaluated a single intramuscular dose of dexamethasone, in addition to antibiotic treatment and analgesic treatment. Onset of pain relief was 4. 8 hours faster with the corticosteroid, with more than twice as many patients reporting complete resolution at 24 hours. There was no demonstrated difference in days missed from school or work, and no difference in adverse effect rates between groups.

### Preoperative dexamethasone for acute post-thoracotomy analgesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^66451c58]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

However, dexamethasone showed no analgesic effects in the present study. These results may be explained by the doses of dexamethasone. We used a relatively small dose of the drug (0.1 mg/kg) because corticosteroids may have various side effects, such as weight gain, muscle weakness, insomnia, and infection. A recent meta-analysis reported that low-dose dexamethasone (≤ 0.1 mg/kg) does not reduce postoperative pain, although perioperative high-dose dexamethasone (> 0.1 mg/kg) confers this effect. Moreover, the incidences of referred pain and PONV in this study were not different in the two groups. As mentioned earlier, TEA itself does not reduce referred pain, if preemptive dexamethasone is effective, postoperative referred pain should be reduce. With respect to PONV prevention, there is no need for further mentioning the effects of dexamethasone. Thus, we believe that the effect of a single, relatively small dose of dexamethasone is insufficient in treating thoracotomy pain. Another reason for the results may be explained that the "single" administration of dexamethasone in the preoperative period. Senard et al. reported that the combination of TEA and parenteral cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (NSAID) reduces post-thoracotomy pain. We believe that dexamethasone and NSAIDs have similar mechanisms for treating post-thoracotomy pain by inhibiting COX. However, the main results reported by Senard and those of the present study are different. In Senard's study, patients received parenteral COX-2 from the evening before surgery until postoperative 48 h. Craig et al. reported that the inflammatory response after a thoracotomy incision peaked at approximately 48 h after surgery. Therefore, a preemptive single administration of dexamethasone may be insufficient in controlling post-thoracotomy pain. Lastly, in the present study, the effect of dexamethasone might be masked by the highly potent TEA regimen. This theory may explain the results of QoR-40. The QoR-40 scores did not differ between the two groups, and there was no difference between preoperative and postoperative periods either. This suggests that pain management for thoracotomy in the present study may be enough for the TEA itself.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^e1d87122]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Comparison of Demographic Characteristics, Primary, and Secondary Outcomes a

Figure 2A shows the unadjusted pain scores grouped by the treatment arm and stratified by the postoperative day. Univariate models showed superior outcomes for pain score (average pain score, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.7‐4.3) for the prednisolone group compared to the dexamethasone group (average pain score, 4.3; 95% CI, 4.0‐4.6). However, adjustment for the covariates and random effects mitigated the differences. Fitted linear mixed‐effects models (Table 2) demonstrated that the postrandomization pain scores were not different between study arms (b = −0.37; 95% CI, −1.32 to 0.58; P = 0.45). Additional associations were identified for the type of surgery (β = −1.36; 95% CI, −2.10 to −0.63, P < .001) and postoperative day (β = −0.32; 95% CI, −0.41 to −0.23; P < .001). These coefficients demonstrate that pain scores were lower in children who underwent the intracapsular technique and decreased over time in all children. Given the impact of surgical technique, a subgroup analysis related to children who underwent extracapsular tonsillectomy also did not demonstrate the difference in pain scores between the trial arms (Table 3, b = 0.24; 95% CI, −0.33 to 0.81; P = 0.41). The adjusted pain scores are shown in Figure 2B. Other secondary outcomes — return to regular diet (β = −0.10; 95% CI, −0.89 to 0.68; P = 0.80) and activity (β = −0.46; 95% CI, −0.45 to 1.38; P = 0.32) were also unaffected by the type of steroid administered. Lastly, there were no statistically significant differences in the number of ED visits (3 in dexamethasone vs 2 in prednisolone, χ 2 = 0.0, P = 0.68) or phone calls made to the office (12 in dexamethasone vs 9 in the prednisolone group, χ 2 = 1.4, P = 0.53). Pain management and reduced oral intake were the predominant concerns in both groups, with no significant between‐group differences. No other adverse events were reported in the trial arms.

### Effect of dexamethasone as an analgesic adjuvant to multimodal pain treatment after total knee arthroplasty: randomised clinical trial [^814bb096]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Total knee arthroplasty is a common procedure. Worldwide, more than 1 000 000 procedures are performed annually, and with ageing populations this number is expected to increase markedly. The procedure is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Multimodal analgesic treatment is recommended for management of pain after total joint arthroplasty. Dexamethasone is often used as part of this treatment and for treatment of nausea after surgery. The evidence for the adjuvant analgesic effects of dexamethasone after total knee arthroplasty is of very low certainty, however, as the literature is dominated by small underpowered trials and therefore with risks of bias and random errors. The potential analgesic effects of glucocorticoids as an adjuvant are probably due to their anti-inflammatory properties, including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, reduction of prostaglandin synthesis, and with possible lowering of the excitability of nerve cells.

We therefore conducted the DEXamethasone twice for pain treatment after Total Knee Arthroplasty (DEX-2-TKA) trial to investigate the potential beneficial and harmful effects of one and two doses of intravenous dexamethasone (24 mg) as an adjuvant treatment to a standard non-opioid analgesic regimen in adults after primary total knee arthroplasty. The dose of dexamethasone 24 mg corresponded to that of previous studies in total knee arthroplasty using a single perioperative dose of methylprednisolone 125 mg. This trial was supported by a review calling for large trials with higher doses of dexamethasone than used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, which might improve the treatment of pain.

Our hypothesis was that 24 mg intravenous dexamethasone as an adjuvant to multimodal pain treatment would reduce postoperative opioid consumption and pain, and that two doses would be better than one.

Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) perioperative dexamethasone — efficacy and dosing heterogeneity. Intravenous dexamethasone administered in the perioperative period reduces postoperative pain, opioid consumption and nausea after primary TJA especially when multiple doses are given, but there is significant heterogeneity in number of doses, dosage, and frequency; in this guideline, perioperative intravenous dexamethasone doses ranged from 4 mg to 20 mg, and further research is needed to define optimal dose, dosing schedule, timing, duration, and the potential utility of single or multiple doses of oral steroids after discharge for same-day surgery patients.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^de5bf770]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are widely used for postoperative pain management, and their use specifically in AT has been studied for more than 50 years. Any surgical procedure, including AT, leads to mechanical tissue damage and distortion of nerve terminals, with a subsequent tissue inflammatory response that includes bradykinin release and nociceptive pain receptor activation. Corticosteroid effects are primarily anti‐inflammatory. They suppress bradykinin release, reduce inflammatory mediators, and inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which reduces prostaglandin production. Currently recommended regimens for postoperative AT pain control include the use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen targeting only the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, thus addressing only a portion of the inflammatory response.

Compared to NSAIDS, glucocorticoids exhibit superior anti‐inflammatory efficacy. A wide array of postoperative corticosteroid regimens have been studied in both adults and children undergoing AT, with benefits seen in children given three postoperative doses of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg)or a 7‐day course of prednisolone (0.25 mg/kg/day). The postoperative administration of three doses of 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone was shown to decrease postoperative parental phone calls by 9% and the risk of postoperative AT hemorrhage by 7% in a retrospective review of 1200 children. At a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day, a 7‐day course of prednisolone showed no significant benefits on postoperative day 1. However, the regimen was associated with decreased pain scores on day 7, along with improvement in diet, activity, reepithelialization on endoscopic examination, fever, and sleep disturbance.

### Preoperative dexamethasone for acute post-thoracotomy analgesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^607a5464]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

In our knowledge, to date, no study has reported the effect of the combination of epidural analgesia and IV steroids on post-thoracotomy pain. The pain relief properties of steroids are well established in metastatic bone, neuropathic, and visceral pain. Glucocorticoids confer anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and reduce tissue edema by modulating vascular permeability. Moreover, steroids reduce the spontaneous discharge of injured nerves. Dexamethasone is the most widely used glucocorticoid for the management of pain because it has less mineralocorticoid effects, is relatively more potent, and has a longer half-life than do other corticosteroids. Some studies have suggested that the single use of dexamethasone effectively alleviates postoperative pain as an adjuvant treatment option. Feroci et al. reported that dexamethasone reduces the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and post-thyroidectomy pain. Fukami et al. also reported that preoperative dexamethasone reduces the incidence of PONV, fatigue, and pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Similar results have been reported in other surgeries, such as orofacial, urethral, and orthopedic surgeries.

### Pain management after thoracotomy with dexamethasone and bupivacaine through a peripleural cather: a randomized controlled trial [^04c45c35]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Local dexamethasone administration through a peripleural catheter can significantly reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and length of hospital stay after thoracotomy. These findings highlight the potential benefits of utilizing dexamethasone as an effective and safe additive to current postoperative pain management strategies, such as bupivacaine. However, it did not show an anti-emetic effect in this group.

Treatment of pain: the general principles

The treatment of pain essentially involves a sequential approach: pain assessment, pain measurement, and pain management. The major goals of pain assessment are to understand the patient's experience, the underlying holistic factors, and pathophysiology contributing to the pain, and to obviate the sequelae arising from nontreatment. Specifically, pain assessment of the child and adolescent with SCD appears complex and challenging. The limitations of current pain assessment tools have been highlighted in a report, underscoring the need for their improvement.

The goals of measuring pain include determination of the presence, intensity, duration, and location of pain, as well as treatment efficacy. Pain measurement in children is more complicated than in adults, and involves the use of tools like "FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability) Scale", the "Faces Scale", and the "Visual Analog Scale". Finally, pain management comprises pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods. The WHO's three-step analgesic ladder provides the basic concept for the pharmacologic management of pain. The choice of analgesic therapy is determined by the severity, site, and type of pain. In mild pain, step 1 analgesics (non-opioid ± adjuvants) are recommended; in moderate pain, step 2 analgesics (weak opioid ± non-opioid ± adjuvants) should be used; while in severe pain, step 3 analgesics (strong opioid ± non-opioid ± adjuvants) are recommended. Non-opioids include paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID); weak opioids consist of codeine and tramadol, while morphine and fentanyl are examples of strong opioids. Adjuvants are used depending on the type of pain, and comprise the following: antidepressants such as amitriptyline (for neuropathic pain); anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and gabapentin (for neuropathic pain); antispasmodics like hyoscine butylbromide (for abdominal or renal colic); anxiolytics/muscle relaxants like diazepam (for anxiety-related pain); and corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisolone (for bone pain, neuropathic pain, raised intracranial pressure-induced headache, and edema/ inflammation-related pain). Nonpharmacologic methods are meant to be complimentary to pharmacologic methods, and include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, warm or cold compression, and acupuncture. Others consist of emotional support, cognitive methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, spiritual support, distraction methods, deep breathing, and music therapy.

Mechanism of Action of Corticosteroid Injections

Of the pharmacologic treatments available for lower back pain, corticosteroids are commonly recommended to counter inflammatory insults. Corticosteroids are a group of molecules resembling the hormone cortisol that have anti-inflammatory effects, and they can be administered in multiple ways, most commonly orally or through injection. Common corticosteroids used clinically consist of prednisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone, to name a few. Each corticosteroid has different potencies and action duration that should be considered for each patient, depending on the severity of the pathology. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and compression of affected nerves related to lower back pain. At the molecular level, corticosteroids bind to receptors expressed in almost all cell types that act as transcription factors that modulate gene expression, downregulate inflammatory genes, and upregulate anti-inflammatory genes. Some limitations and common adverse events to the use of corticosteroids are hyperglycemia and immune system depression, which would prevent diabetic patients from using these medications and also immunocompromised patients whom would be at an increased risk of infection.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^2bc93b31]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Adenotonsillectomy (AT) remains the most common pediatric ambulatory surgical procedure in the United States. In 2019, more than 460,000 children younger than 17 underwent AT in hospital‐owned facilities. This procedure is generally well‐tolerated; most children are discharged home on the same day. Unanticipated postoperative emergency department (ED) visits range from 6% to 11% and are due to postoperative pain, nausea, emesis, and dehydration. Poorly controlled pain may decrease oral intake, leading to dehydration, and pain management is understandably a significant parental concern. The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery clinical practice guidelines support using intraoperative intravenous dexamethasone and postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen for improved recovery. These guidelines also include perioperative caregiver pain counseling, further emphasizing the importance of adequate pain management.

Post‐AT pain lasts a median of 9 days, peaks between 3 and 5 days following surgery, and is associated with increased difficulty eating and sleeping. Most unplanned ED visits for uncontrolled pain occur on postoperative day 4. With dexamethasone already recommended for intraoperative use, this postoperative pain peak supports the potential utility of additional corticosteroids in the management of post‐AT pain. Postoperative steroids improve pain, diet, activity, and reepithelialization. They also decrease nausea and vomitingand phone calls for pain‐related concerns. Notably, a previous study from our institution showed that a single dose of dexamethasone administered on postoperative day 3 improved pain and decreased analgesic use, as well as phone calls, compared to children who received only analgesics.

The rationale for comparing prednisolone and dexamethasone lies in their similar pharmacological properties and potential clinical benefits, while having different durations of action and hence dosing requirements. Dexamethasone has a longer biological half‐life (36‐72 hours), which could provide extended anti‐inflammatory effects with a single dose than prednisolone (12‐36 hours) that needs additional doses for physiological comparability. However, prednisolone is more widely available in liquid form, improving compliance in children. Both steroids, despite having similar anti‐inflammatory potency, could have different effects in managing post‐AT pain due to their pharmacokinetics.

### Role of neuraxial steroids in interventional pain management [^cea7263c]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical introduction of cortisone in 1949 revolutionized medical care of patients with a host of diseases. Soon after that, the first use of steroids in epidural injections was described in 1952 and 1953. A variety of corticosteroid agents (hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone) have been applied neuraxially to treat spinal pain and other types of painful conditions. The utilization of neuraxial steroids had its empirical beginning in the 1950s and 60's. When steroid administration seemingly was effective for management of low back pain and sciatica, the concept was adapted for other types of neural blockade, including facet joint injections. It is postulated that corticosteroids reduce inflammation by inhibiting either the synthesis or release of a number of pro-inflammatory substances and by causing a reversible local anesthetic effect. Multiple complications of corticosteroid administration are two-fold: those resulting from withdrawal of steroids and those resulting from continued use of large doses. These include neural toxicity, separation of pituitary-adrenal axis, weight gain, osteoporosis, as well as many other complications. However, a review of the literature on epidural steroids or other types of neuraxial blockade mentions very few complications that can be directly attributed either to the chemistry or the pharmacology of the steroids, except for reports of adrenal suppression. This review describes various aspects of neuraxial steroids including historical concepts, mechanism of action, pharmacological aspects, side effects, complications and their role in treatment.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^6daa3116]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Therapeutic lumbar epidural interventions — steroid dosing, endocrine effects, and repeat intervals are detailed as follows: Dosing limits have been advocated of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid, 210 mg per year in an average person, and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid. In patients receiving corticosteroids for spinal stenosis, 32 patients (20.3%) experienced cortisol reduction at 3 weeks of greater than 50% compared with 10 patients (6.7%) treated with lidocaine only, and those treated with methylprednisolone or triamcinolone had an average 3-week cortisol reduction of 41% and 41.6% from baseline respectively. Hooten et al showed triamcinolone concentrations almost 22 days. In a dose dependent methylprednisolone evaluation, Eighty-six percent of patients who received 80 mg had laboratory confirmed HPA axis suppression one week post injection compared to 53% of those receiving 40 mg, and 20% had continued suppression at 4 weeks post injection. Frequency may be based on injectate type, with potential repeat after a 2 week waiting period, for dexamethasone and betamethasone of 2 to 4 weeks and for methylprednisolone and triamcinolone 4 weeks and 4 to 6 weeks based on the dosage. Randomized controlled trials included over 12,000 patients using local anesthetic alone or steroids with a low dose base test injection ranging from 3 mg to 6 mg and reported no major complications.

### Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^edf53aca]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain flare occurs after palliative radiotherapy, and dexamethasone has shown potential for prevention of such flare. We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1–4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0–10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0–10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248585, and is completed.

Findings

Between May 30, 2011, and Dec 11, 2014, 298 patients were enrolled. 39 (26%) of 148 patients randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and 53 (35%) of 150 patients in the placebo group had a pain flare (difference 8·9%, lower 95% confidence bound 0·0, one-sided p = 0·05). Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2.

Interpretation

Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.
