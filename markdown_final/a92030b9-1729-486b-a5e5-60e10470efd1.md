## Question

best antibiotic for lower extremity cellulitis in patient with lymphedema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is best for lower extremity cellulitis in a patient with lymphedema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the presentation as nonpurulent versus purulent and assess severity. Then, I should verify lymphedema-specific risk considerations, treatment setting, and empiric antibiotic choices. Next, I will review treatment duration, monitoring and response assessment, and recurrence prevention, including compression and prophylaxis. Finally, I should double-check mimics and diagnostic stewardship to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment, aligning with IDSA and related guidance throughout [^113PjKu3] [^114ZhUEW].

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype because purulence drives MRSA coverage decisions, and severity guides site-of-care and breadth of therapy. Nonpurulent cellulitis without abscess is usually due to β-hemolytic streptococci with MSSA less common, whereas purulent infections or clear abscesses raise the likelihood of S. aureus, including community-acquired MRSA, pending culture data if obtained, and systemic toxicity criteria such as fever greater than 38.5 °C, tachycardia, leukocytosis, or hemodynamic instability point toward broader or inpatient therapy, so I need to check these at the bedside before committing to a narrow oral regimen [^116aZEV3] [^114zdKRg] [^112wHZ8g].

> Now, I need to evaluate how lymphedema modifies risk and course; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that it mandates broader initial spectrum. Lymphedema is among the strongest risk factors for cellulitis and for recurrence, with very high odds ratios reported in observational datasets, and pathophysiologically chronic edema impairs lymphatic immune trafficking, which can slow response and increase recurrence risk, but wait, I should verify that most initial episodes remain streptococcal-predominant and thus do not require empiric MRSA coverage unless other risk factors are present; I should also inspect for interdigital entry lesions like tinea pedis or fissures that serve as portals and are common with lymphedema [^111g3jp5] [^116YuhoE] [^11516tJg] [^112hv8YA] [^111ZKv3w].

> Next, I will determine the treatment setting; I need to ensure the patient can tolerate oral therapy, has no systemic instability, and has reliable follow-up for outpatient management. If there is systemic toxicity, rapidly progressive infection, inability to take oral medications, or significant comorbidity burden, especially common in advanced lymphedema, I should consider hospitalization and parenteral therapy while reassessing for complications or alternative diagnoses [^113PjKu3] [^114eeoYo].

> For nonpurulent cellulitis, let me think about the narrowest effective regimen first; initial empiric therapy should target streptococci with a β-lactam such as cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours or amoxicillin 500 mg orally every 8 hours, and cefazolin intravenously is reasonable if parenteral therapy is needed, and I should confirm that routine empiric MRSA coverage is not recommended in typical nonpurulent cases unless specific risks are present, which aligns with IDSA and observational data showing MRSA is an uncommon cause of typical nonpurulent cellulitis [^116aZEV3] [^114ZhUEW] [^112hv8YA].

> Hold on, I should verify MRSA risk triggers before adding coverage; if there is penetrating trauma, prior MRSA infection or colonization, injection drug use, concurrent purulence, or sepsis syndrome, or if there is failure after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate β-lactam therapy, then I should expand to agents active against both streptococci and MRSA, such as clindamycin monotherapy, or TMP-SMX plus amoxicillin to ensure streptococcal coverage, with linezolid reserved when intolerance or resistance limits options, and in severe hospitalized cases vancomycin-based regimens are appropriate pending de-escalation [^111zAoE9] [^115M76PW] [^1166kUD4] [^113PjKu3].

> For purulent cellulitis or abscess, wait, let me confirm that incision and drainage is the cornerstone when fluctuant collections exceed small sizes; empiric therapy should prioritize MRSA-active agents such as TMP-SMX, doxycycline, or clindamycin, adding a β-lactam if streptococcal coverage is also required, and I should culture purulent material when feasible to narrow therapy afterward [^114zdKRg] [^11689GoD] [^114GHCWS].

> I need to check treatment duration and avoid overtreatment; uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis responding clinically can be treated for 5 to 6 days, but in lymphedema I should reconsider and often extend to 7 to 14 days given impaired lymphatic clearance and higher failure risk, tailoring to clinical response rather than a fixed end date, and documenting objective improvement such as reduction in erythema margins and tenderness [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe] [^114LP8SG].

> I will now examine the early response at 48 to 72 hours; if there is no improvement, I should double-check for occult abscess requiring drainage, reconsider MRSA coverage if not provided, and reassess for mimics such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, gout, or deep vein thrombosis, which are frequent causes of apparent nonresponse, and I should remember that early nonresponse can reflect nonpharmacologic factors and that broadening antibiotics too quickly may be premature without a new target identified [^111ZKv3w] [^113CPR3W] [^115fP7Gu].

> But wait, prevention is critical in lymphedema; I need to ensure a comprehensive recurrence-prevention plan starts during acute care because recurrence within several years is common. I should initiate daily graduated compression therapy once acute pain tolerates it, as this reduces recurrence substantially, add strict limb elevation during acute care, and optimize skin care with emollients and tinea pedis treatment, alongside referral for lymphedema therapy or advanced pneumatic compression when appropriate and feasible [^112bYhNj] [^117WMmEy] [^115fTU2J] [^1173cgTX].

> Next, I should review antibiotic prophylaxis candidacy; if episodes recur two or more times per year despite optimal edema control and skin care, I should consider low-dose penicillin prophylaxis such as penicillin V twice daily or monthly benzathine penicillin G, which reduces recurrence risk in randomized data, while periodically reassessing the need given antimicrobial stewardship principles and patient preference [^1139Z69g] [^116LAGsJ].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic stewardship to reduce misdiagnosis and overtreatment; cellulitis is frequently misdiagnosed with a substantial proportion later reclassified as pseudocellulitis, so I need to re-examine morphology, distribution, chronicity, and bilateral involvement patterns, minimize routine blood or skin cultures in typical cases, and use point-of-care ultrasound to detect occult abscess when the exam is equivocal to avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy or admission [^111Gmbbk] [^112Y49h4] [^11689GoD].

> Let me summarize and make sure I have not overextended spectrum due to lymphedema alone; for nonpurulent lower extremity cellulitis in a patient with lymphedema who is stable for outpatient therapy, I would start cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days with close follow-up and early reassessment, consider inpatient cefazolin every 8 hours for 7 to 14 days if parenteral therapy is needed, add MRSA-active therapy only if specific risk factors are present or if there is no improvement by 48 to 72 hours, and concurrently initiate compression, elevation, and meticulous skin care with referral to a lymphedema clinic, and if recurrences persist despite optimized edema management, consider penicillin prophylaxis with shared decision-making and stewardship in mind [^116aZEV3] [^111gsSaf] [^114LP8SG] [^112bYhNj] [^1139Z69g].

---

For lower extremity cellulitis in lymphedema, **empiric therapy should target β-hemolytic streptococci** with a first-line β-lactam (cephalexin or amoxicillin) for 5–6 days, extending to 7–10 days if slow response [^111gsSaf] [^114eeoYo]. Add **MRSA coverage** if risk factors are present (e.g. prior MRSA, purulence, severe infection) using clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX plus a β-lactam [^111zAoE9] [^114ZhUEW]. For severe or systemic illness, use IV cefazolin or ceftriaxone; add vancomycin if MRSA is suspected. Address underlying lymphedema with compression and skin care to reduce recurrence [^112bYhNj] [^1128Axfm].

---

## Pathogens and empiric coverage

The key pathogens for empiric coverage are **β-hemolytic streptococci** — the most common cause of nonpurulent cellulitis and therefore essential to cover empirically [^1125vnm1] [^116aZEV3] — and **Staphylococcus aureus**, which is less common in nonpurulent cellulitis; reserve MRSA coverage for patients with risk factors [^111zAoE9] [^114ZhUEW].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

First-line antibiotic therapy is **oral β-lactams** (cephalexin or amoxicillin) for nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk [^1125vnm1] [^116aZEV3]. Use **IV β-lactams** such as cefazolin or ceftriaxone for severe infection or when systemic signs are present.

---

## MRSA coverage

- **Indications**: Prior MRSA, purulence, severe infection, or failure of β-lactams [^111zAoE9] [^114ZhUEW].
- **Oral options**: Clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX plus a β-lactam [^114ZhUEW] [^115M76PW].
- **IV options**: Vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin for severe cases [^113PjKu3] [^114kNGcE].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **standard duration** is 5–6 days for nonpurulent cellulitis with close follow-up [^111gsSaf], with an **extended duration** of 7–10 days if the response is slow or the infection is severe.

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures include **compression therapy** — which reduces recurrence in chronic edema/lymphedema [^112bYhNj] — and **skin care**, such as treating tinea pedis, using emollients, and maintaining hygiene [^1128Axfm].

---

## Summary table: antibiotic recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line therapy** | **MRSA coverage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk | Cephalexin or amoxicillin | Not required | 5–6 days |
| Nonpurulent cellulitis with MRSA risk | Clindamycin or doxycycline + β-lactam | Required | 7–10 days |
| Severe infection or systemic signs | IV cefazolin or ceftriaxone | Add vancomycin if MRSA suspected | 7–10 days |

---

Empiric therapy should prioritize **β-hemolytic streptococci** with β-lactams, adding MRSA coverage only when indicated, and integrating compression and skin care to prevent recurrence.

### Compression therapy to prevent recurrent cellulitis of the leg [^112bYhNj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chronic edema of the leg is a risk factor for cellulitis. Daily use of compression garments on the leg has been recommended to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis, but there is limited evidence from trials regarding its effectiveness.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, randomized, nonblinded trial, we assigned participants with chronic edema of the leg and recurrent cellulitis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive leg compression therapy plus education on cellulitis prevention (compression group) or education alone (control group). Follow-up occurred every 6 months for up to 3 years or until 45 episodes of cellulitis had occurred in the trial. The primary outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis. Participants in the control group who had an episode of cellulitis crossed over to the compression group. Secondary outcomes included cellulitis-related hospital admission and quality-of-life assessments.

- **Results**: A total of 183 patients were screened, and 84 were enrolled; 41 participants were assigned to the compression group, and 43 to the control group. At the time of a planned interim analysis, when 23 episodes of cellulitis had occurred, 6 participants (15%) in the compression group and 17 (40%) in the control group had had an episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.59; P = 0.002; relative risk [post hoc analysis], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.02), and the trial was stopped for efficacy. A total of 3 participants (7%) in the compression group and 6 (14%) in the control group were hospitalized for cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.77; P = 0.006).

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection primarily of the dermal lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic impacts with fever and an elevated white blood cell count. Outpatient therapy should be recommended for patients who can adhere to the treatment and do not exhibit general signs of inflammation or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with a previous attack of cellulitis, especially involving the legs, may experience recurrences. The infection usually occurs in the same area as the previous episode. Factors such as edema, especially lymphedema, venous insufficiency, prior trauma (including surgery) to the area, and tinea pedis can increase the frequency of these recurrences. Addressing these factors may decrease the rate of recurrence.

- **Pathogens**: The pathogens involved are streptococci and S. aureus. Cellulitis associated with abscesses is usually caused by S. aureus. In contrast, typical (non-purulent) cellulitis is most commonly caused by both streptococcal species and S. aureus. MRSA is an uncommon cause of typical cellulitis. In neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, Gram-negative bacteria should be considered.

- **Treatment**: Antibiotic therapy is recommended for 5 days, with the option to extend therapy up to 7–10 days if symptoms do not resolve at 5 days. Incision and drainage are required in cases of purulent cellulitis.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^1128Axfm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The novel findings from this publication are that one-third of patients with chronic oedema are likely to develop cellulitis at some point. The worse the oedema, the more likely cellulitis is to occur; the better the oedema, the less likely cellulitis is to occur. The strengths of this publication are the large number of patients included for study and the international collaboration involving nine countries, indicating that chronic oedema predisposing to cellulitis is a global healthcare burden, at least in these countries. By targeting healthcare professionals with an interest in lymphoedema to identify patients, numbers may have been falsely elevated and more severe cases included compared with the population at large. However, this does not undermine the value of the results. Unfortunately, data on recurrent cellulitis were not included, and this is likely to be a common occurrence. As shown previously, cellulitis can be self-perpetuating, with past episodes making future episodes more likely. While prophylactic penicillin has been shown to be of value in preventing cellulitis, this study demonstrates the importance of controlling chronic oedema in preventing cellulitis, a finding recently confirmed by the use of compression garments to prevent cellulitis.

So often in healthcare, patients are treated for the acute episode of cellulitis and discharged without sufficient consideration being given to treatment of the risk factors, such as chronic oedema, skin disease, and wounds. Dermatologists are well placed to manage such conditions and therefore should be more involved in care strategies.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by the spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, characterized by redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people experience more than one episode of cellulitis within three years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of these conditions? We searched databases including Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important sources up to May 2007. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics and the comparative effects of different antibiotics.

### Lymphoscintigraphy is frequently recommended but seldom used in a "real world setting" [^115SYhAx]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Cellulitis was three-fold lower in the LSG+ group, whereas a history of deep venous thrombosis was two-fold lower. Diuretics were prescribed twice as frequently in the LSG- group, as were wound dressings. Use of LSG for diagnosis varied with the etiology of LED. LSG was most frequently utilized among patients with melanoma-LED (9.5%) and patients with breast cancer-LED (6.7%), in contrast to patients with advanced venous disease-related LED (1.1%; P < 0.05 for both comparisons).

To identify the prevalence of other alternative imaging studies for diagnosing LED, we assessed the proportion of tests performed within 1 year of the index date for the diagnosis of LED as well as 1 year after this date. Given the limitations of coding, one is unable to state that the tests were employed specifically for the diagnosis of LED. The most frequently performed study was duplex ultrasound, which was carried out in 50% of all patients. The frequency of computed tomography (CT) scans of the lower extremity was comparable to that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the lower extremity (4.1% and 4.4%, respectively), whereas these imaging studies were less frequently used in the upper extremity, around 1%. Lymphangiography was employed as a diagnostic study overall in only 17 patients (0.03%), of which nine patients had breast cancer-related LED (BCRL). Duplex scan was used in 26% of patients with BCRL.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^117EEUMV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Imaging**: In a study comparing cellulitis with lymphoedema using computed tomography (CT) scanning, Shin et al. found specific features that were more frequently associated with cellulitis. These features included fluid collection (P = 0.009), fascial enhancement (P = 0.043), inguinal lymph node enlargement at the affected side (P < 0.001), and inguinal lymph node medullary fat obliteration (P < 0.001).

Rabuka et al. examined ultrasound imaging in patients with a presentation suggestive of cellulitis, with 72 patients (80%) diagnosed with cellulitis after having a negative duplex scan.

### Longitudinal assessment of health-related quality of life and clinical outcomes with at home advanced pneumatic compression treatment of lower extremity lymphedema [^111e1cPm]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

- **Reduction in cellulitis events**: In the year preceding enrollment, 21 participants had a history of medical encounters for cellulitis. Seven events in six patients were recorded during the 52-week trial, representing a reduction from 21.4% to 6.1% in cellulitis events (P < 0.0011).

- **Reduction in skin abnormalities**: Although skin abnormalities in the lymphedematous limb often focus on individual patients, the number of patients with recorded skin assessments decreased substantially over time. This resulted in wide 95% confidence intervals and was not amenable to accurate statistical evaluation. Interesting observations are noted with the baseline and week 52 percentages. Hyperpigmentation/discoloration decreased from 75.4% to 40%. Ulceration/blisters decreased from 20.3% to 14.1%. Papilloma decreased from 5.8% to 2.4%. Finally, lymphorrhea decreased from 8% to 1.2%.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^11516tJg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, also known as erysipelas, is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and therefore falls within the domain of dermatologists. Cellulitis, which can often be recurrent, is among the top 10 reasons for admission to the hospital, with patients receiving treatment from many specialties including emergency care, general practitioners, general medicine, surgery, tissue viability, and dermatology.

In this issue of the British Journal of Dermatology, Burian et al. examine the prevalence of cellulitis in patients with chronic oedema. Chronic oedema is an easily identified clinical sign and leads to the same pathophysiological effects and appearances as lymphoedema, which is not so easily distinguished. Tissue fluid is predominantly drained by the lymphatic system and not by venous reabsorption as was previously thought. This means that all chronic oedema, i.e. subcutaneous oedema persisting for at least 3 months, is caused either by an absolute reduction in lymph transport, as in lymphoedema, or by lymph drainage being overwhelmed by a fluid (lymph) load, such as that which occurs with higher venous pressures from heart failure or venous disease.

Therefore, chronic oedema always represents lymph drainage failure. As it is easy to identify and has the same physiological effects, it can be considered a surrogate for lymphoedema. As lymph carries antigens related to infection as well as lymphocytes for an appropriate immune response, disturbed lymph drainage — whether owing to fluid load or lymph vessel dysfunction — results in immunodeficiency as a consequence of the disturbed immune cell dynamics.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113HJYLn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

All included studies were described in a narrative synthesis. To evaluate the methodological quality, all studies were assessed by two reviewers (M.P. and R.K. A.) using signaling questions in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (S. I.L. or E.B.-T.). If the information was not clearly provided in the study, the reviewers assessed the signaling question as 'unclear'.

- **Evidence synthesis and risk of bias assessment**: For each domain, studies were judged as 'low risk' if all signaling questions were answered 'yes', 'high risk' if the answer to at least one signaling question was 'no', or 'unclear' in all other cases.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings and BIOSIS Previews.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions, and mortality.

- **Main results**: We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70.

Regarding medical management for surgical site infection, more specifically concerning antibiotic therapy indications, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of systemic antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with incision and drainage in patients with SSIs associated with a significant systemic response, such as:

- **Erythema and induration**: Extending more than 5 cm from the wound edge.
- **Fever**: Greater than 38.5 °C.
- **Heart rate (HR)**: Over 110 bpm.
- **White blood cell count (WBC)**: Exceeding 12,000 cells/mcL.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^115M76PW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

The IDSA 2011 guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of cellulitis, particularly regarding antibiotic therapy with MRSA coverage. If coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-acquired MRSA is desired, the following regimens are recommended:

- **Clindamycin alone**: Effective for covering both β-hemolytic streptococci and MRSA.
- **TMP/SMX**: Can be used to ensure adequate MRSA coverage.
- **A tetracycline in combination with a β-lactam, such as amoxicillin**: This combination provides broader coverage.
- **Linezolid alone**: An option for monotherapy with activity against MRSA.

### Predictors for readmission due to cellulitis among Japanese patients [^115STLyQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the skin. Some patients are hospitalized multiple times; lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral circulatory disturbance, and deep vein thrombosis are said to be risk factors for multiple admissions. Conversely, in Japan, elderly women and undernourished elderly have been reported to be at risk of multiple hospitalizations, suggesting a different patient background from that reported overseas.

We investigated the characteristics of readmission cases for patients hospitalized for cellulitis in Japan. We retrospectively examined cases of cellulitis and erysipelas admitted between April 1, 2005, and March 31, 2018. Patients with cellulitis or erysipelas at multiple sites and those with osteomyelitis, pressure ulcer infection, and necrotizing fasciitis were excluded. In terms of recurrence, only hospitalizations for recurrence at the same site were considered.

Patients with multiple hospitalizations had significantly lower blood albumin levels than those hospitalized only once. Furthermore, the rates of lymphedema, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in patients hospitalized multiple times. Other laboratory and clinical factors were not statistically significant. Therefore, hypoalbuminemia with or without liver dysfunction, lymphedema, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were suggested as risk factors for cellulitis recurrence. However, chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral circulatory disturbance, and deep vein thrombosis did not seem to be risk factors in Japanese cases.

Regarding medical management for necrotizing fasciitis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend initiating broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment (such as vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin/tazobactam or a carbapenem, or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole) in patients with suspected or documented necrotizing fasciitis. This includes coverage for aerobes, anaerobes, group A streptococci, and MRSA.

### Lower limb cellulitis: Low diagnostic accuracy and underdiagnosis of risk factors [^113CPR3W]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and recognition of predisposing factors have been shown to be challenging in lower limb cellulitis (LLC). Assessment of 1,746 consecutive patients with cellulitis presenting to a UK university hospital indicated increasing overdiagnosis, with only 31.9% of patients referred during the period 2015–2018 having the diagnosis of LLC confirmed. Recognition of at least one predisposing factor increased from 61% to 89% following the introduction of more specific screening questions. This identified a need for better primary care dermatology education and highlighted the benefit of a proforma with specific screening questions for reversible predisposing factors for LLC.

### The contralateral rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap for treatment of lower extremity lymphedema [^116aFcnv]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is common after inguinal lymphadenectomy or the resection of groin tumors. Animal studies have demonstrated success using the rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (RAM) flap as a treatment for lymphedema. In this study, four patients with acquired lower extremity lymphedema were treated with a contralateral RAM flap, with an inferior cutaneous pedicle left intact to facilitate lymphatic drainage into the unaffected groin.

One patient also underwent lymphaticovenous anastomoses during the flap transfer. Notably, all flaps survived without postoperative complications. With a mean follow-up of 31 months, the mean reduction in limb circumference from the preoperative excess was 81% at the thigh, 70% at the calf, and 71% at the ankle. Importantly, none of the patients with a history of cellulitis had further incidences of groin cellulitis.

Two patients required future flap debulking. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed in one patient and demonstrated reconstitution of lymphatic flow from the affected leg through the flap. According to this preliminary study, the transfer of a contralateral RAM flap to the groin of a lymphedematous leg improves lymphedema and decreases the incidence of cellulitis.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: Part II. Conditions that simulate lower limb cellulitis [^111ZKv3w]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Several common conditions can mimic cellulitis, creating a potential for misdiagnosis and incorrect management. The most common disorders mistaken for lower limb cellulitis include venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, irritant dermatitis, and lymphedema. The dermatologist is often consulted when a patient has failed to respond to therapy, and thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis is essential. This article focuses on entities that can mimic cellulitis, with an emphasis on elements of the history and physical examination that can help to distinguish between lower limb cellulitis and its simulators.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^111g3jp5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery, Venous, and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The relationship between the cause of secondary LED and the incidence of cellulitis is significant. Edema has long been recognized as a major risk factor for the development of cellulitis. In a study conducted between 1995 and 1996 at seven centers in France, Dupuy and colleagues identified several independent risk factors for cellulitis. LED displayed the highest odds ratio at 71.2, followed by disruption of the cutaneous barrier (23.8), venous insufficiency (2.9), and obesity (2.0).

Vignes and colleagues conducted a retrospective study involving nearly 2000 patients with LED who were referred to a specialized lymphedema clinic. The most common cause of LED, BCRL (58%), was associated with a nearly 40% occurrence of cellulitis, whereas primary lower limb LED demonstrated a comparable occurrence of cellulitis. Secondary lower limb LED had a lower occurrence of cellulitis at 31% (P < 0.02). It is important to note that Vignes excluded patients with venous disease, significantly differentiating their findings from our patient population.

Although LED is a recognized risk factor for cellulitis, there is a lack of studies demonstrating how the etiology of secondary LED might influence the incidence of cellulitis. One advantage of a large healthcare claims database is the breadth of the population at risk for a disease or its complications; in this instance, 86,000 patients with LED. The study clearly shows that patients with PLED are at greater risk for cellulitis compared to those with BCRL or GCRL. A comparison of morbid risk factors for these groups indicates that PLED is associated with a greater proportion of two important factors that can exacerbate edema.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, especially in immunocompromised patients, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend considering a wide differential diagnosis. Potential causes include drug eruption, cutaneous infiltration with underlying malignancy, chemotherapy- or radiation-induced reactions, Sweet syndrome, erythema multiforme, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) among allogeneic transplant recipients. It is important to include bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic agents in the differential diagnosis for infections of skin lesions.

### Narrative review: diseases that masquerade as infectious cellulitis [^113JQWLj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

For cellulitis that does not respond to conventional antimicrobial treatment, clinicians should consider several noninfectious disorders that might masquerade as infectious cellulitis. Diseases that commonly masquerade as this condition include thrombophlebitis, contact dermatitis, insect stings, drug reactions, eosinophilic cellulitis (the Wells syndrome), gouty arthritis, carcinoma erysipelatoides, familial Mediterranean fever, and foreign-body reactions. Diseases that uncommonly masquerade as infectious cellulitis include urticaria, lymphedema, lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, leukemia, Paget's disease, and panniculitis. Clinicians should conduct an initial diagnostic work-up directed by the findings from a detailed history and complete physical examination. In many cases, a skin biopsy is the only tool that helps identify the correct diagnosis. Special tests may also be needed.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1113ge9o]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

We found that people with experience of having cellulitis held diverse beliefs about causation, some of which would not have been uncovered by survey methods alone, such as the view that cellulitis could be caused by 'unhygienic' environments. Interviewees expressed surprise that they had not been informed of the risk of recurrent cellulitis or potential strategies to prevent recurrence. Only 31% of survey respondents said they were aware of possible strategies to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis.

Quantitative and qualitative findings suggest a general willingness to adopt non-antibiotic cellulitis prevention interventions, with a preference for enhanced foot hygiene and lifestyle changes over other interventions, as they are perceived as familiar and easy to fit into established routines. There were more mixed views about compression and long-term oral antibiotics.

In the recent James Lind Alliance PSP on cellulitis, one of the research priorities identified related to which patients are most likely to benefit from low-dose antibiotics to prevent recurrent cellulitis. Our data suggest that people who have had only a single episode of cellulitis are less likely to be willing to take long-term, low-dose antibiotics than those who have experienced multiple episodes. This is despite randomized controlled trial (RCT) findings suggesting that patients may benefit from 6 months of low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis following their first episode in order to prevent future recurrence in the longer term.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas: Prevention [^116LAGsJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, presenting with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected individuals experience systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis characterized by marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and face. In adults, the most common pathogens are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Both cellulitis and erysipelas can lead to local necrosis and abscess formation. Approximately one-quarter of those affected experience more than one episode of cellulitis within three years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic overview to answer the clinical question: What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2015. Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview.

- **Results**: At this update, searching electronic databases retrieved 323 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 184 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 170 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for one PICO combination.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic overview, we categorized the efficacy of two interventions based on information about effectiveness and safety.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common, and predisposing conditions should be assessed and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

Regarding the medical management for cellulitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the administration of any of the following agents for MRSA coverage in hospitalized patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — such as deeper soft tissue infections, surgical/traumatic wound infections, major abscesses, cellulitis, or infected ulcers and burns — pending culture results, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics:

- **IV vancomycin**: Administer as directed.
- **IV or PO linezolid 600 mg BID**: Administer twice daily.
- **IV daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose once daily**: Administer as a single daily dose.
- **IV telavancin 10 mg/kg/dose once daily**: Administer as a single daily dose.
- **IV or PO clindamycin 600 mg TID**: Administer three times daily.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis from abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear scenarios. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, while the treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: A systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics, which can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019.

- **Outcomes of interest**: The clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic types, administration routes, treatment durations, or doses. LLC may be overtreated, and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

- **TMP/SMX**: Effective for a broad range of bacterial infections.
- **Doxycycline or minocycline**: Tetracycline antibiotics suitable for MRSA treatment.
- **Linezolid**: An option for more severe cases requiring an alternative approach.

### Liposuction for advanced lymphedema in a multidisciplinary team setting in Australia: 5-year follow-up [^114jUxtS]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

After surgery, patients were given intravenous antibiotics for two days and then oral antibiotics for a further two weeks, as several of these patients had experienced potentially life-threatening cellulitis in the affected limb preoperatively. For arms, compression garments were changed after two days, and every two days thereafter until the patient was comfortable returning to the usual daily alternate wash-and-wear regimen. For legs, the wraps were exchanged for compression garments within the next week with a preoperatively measured Jobst Elvarex Class 3 one-legged pant style. If patients with arm lymphedema could manage the garment change by themselves on day four postoperatively, they were discharged with skincare and hygiene instructions.

Interstate or international patients (37%) and most patients treated for lower limb lymphedema were transferred to a rehabilitation hospital for a further five to seven days to ensure independent management ability before returning home. Garments typically were replaced every three to six months for the first year, and then every six months once limb volume reduction was stable and equivalent to the unaffected limb. Two sets of garments were always supplied so one could be washed while the other was used. After 24 months, patients either continued to attend the outpatient clinic for ongoing follow-up every six months or were transferred to their local lymphedema therapist with support and advice concerning garments from the ALERT team. At the time of this study, there was a dropout of available postoperative data beyond 24 months because of transfe.

### Elective amputation of the toes in severe lymphedema of the lower leg: rationale and indications [^113ERRSe]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Entry lesions at the toes' interdigital spaces, in the setting of chronic lymphedema, are strongly associated with repetitive infective episodes, which cause significant morbidity. A prospective study was designed to evaluate the outcome in two groups of patients affected by end-stage III lymphedema of the lower extremity. These groups were treated with the Charles procedure, with or without simultaneous amputation of the toes.

At a mean follow-up of 3 years, 20% of the patients receiving elective toe amputation experienced a recurrence of infection, and none required more proximal amputations. Among the patients not desiring elective toe amputation, 83% suffered multiple attacks of cellulitis, and in 88% the toes were eventually amputated. The difference in the number of infective episodes between the two groups was highly significant. No cases of re-lymphedema were registered. Elective toe amputation in combination with the Charles procedure reduces re-cellulitis and long-term morbidity in stage III lymphedema of the lower leg.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^115eYSAo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The limitations of this paper are largely related to the source of the data. This study is based on health care claims data, which relies on clinicians and coders to accurately input diagnosis and treatment codes. Additionally, the clinical severity of these disease states cannot be determined. Since the demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and other comorbidities, were not propensity-matched, this may influence the results.

Additionally, when calculating the cost of hospitalized episodes, this cost was derived from hospitalizations during which the principal discharge diagnosis was coded to be cellulitis. As this is the primary discharge diagnosis, the majority of the cost of the hospitalization is likely the result of the cost of the cellulitis; however, it is not possible to determine if all reimbursed amounts were for cellulitis-related services. As such, some of this cost may reflect the cost for other conditions.

### Costs and consequences associated with misdiagnosed lower extremity cellulitis [^113Hxubb]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammatory dermatoses of the lower extremity are frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis, also known as "pseudocellulitis", leading to unnecessary antibiotic treatments or hospitalizations. The costs and complications arising from such misdiagnoses are not well-documented.

The objective of this study is to characterize the national health care burden of misdiagnosed cellulitis in patients admitted for treatment of lower extremity cellulitis.

This cross-sectional study was conducted with patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis between June 2010 and December 2012. Patients discharged with a diagnosis of cellulitis were classified as having cellulitis. Those who received an alternative diagnosis during their hospital stay, at discharge, or within 30 days of discharge were categorized as having pseudocellulitis. A literature review was conducted to calculate large-scale costs and complication rates. National cost figures were sourced from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for the year 2010, to estimate hospitalization costs per year attributed to misdiagnosed lower extremity pseudocellulitis.

The exposed group consists of patients presenting to and admitted from the ED with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patient characteristics, hospital course, and complications during and after hospitalization were reviewed for each patient to estimate annual costs.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^115JhH9o]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

This analysis of a large healthcare claims database of approximately 86,000 patients with lymphedema (LED) showed a clear increase in the incidence of cellulitis in patients with phlebolymphedema (PLED) over LED associated with cancer treatment. As previously demonstrated, patients with a previous episode of cellulitis are at a greater risk of developing a recurrence. Furthermore, patients with PLED, in comparison to patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) or general cancer-related lymphedema (GCRL), had a higher rate of cellulitis episodes requiring hospitalization. This contributes to a greater cost for PLED.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful, and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell, and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123,644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one-third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis, lymphoedema, obesity, diabetes, and skin disorders that cause breaks in the skin, such as fungal foot disease, dry skin, or insect bites.

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side-effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by the use of emollients for the prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments.

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dry skin.

### Misdiagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Gmbbk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis with several mimics and no gold standard diagnostic criteria. Misdiagnosis is common. This review aims to quantify the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings based on a second clinical assessment and describe the proportion and types of alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: Electronic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL) using MeSH and other subject terms identified 887 randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and cohort studies. Included articles assessed the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings through a second clinical assessment up to 14 days post initial diagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis. Studies on infants and patients with (peri-)orbital, purulent, and severe or complex cellulitis were excluded. Screening and data extraction were conducted independently in pairs. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified risk of bias tool from Hoy et al. Meta-analyses were undertaken where ≥ 3 studies reported the same outcome.

- **Results**: Nine studies conducted in the United States, UK, and Canada, including a total of 1600 participants, were eligible for inclusion. Six studies were conducted in the inpatient setting; three were in outpatient clinics. All nine included studies provided estimates of the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis, with a range from 19% to 83%. The mean proportion misdiagnosed was 41% (95% CI 28% to 56% for random effects model). Heterogeneity between studies was very high both statistically (I² 96%, p-value for heterogeneity).

### Cellulitis risk factors for patients with primary or secondary lymphedema [^116YuhoE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Limb lymphedema is a chronic disease with primary and secondary forms, with the latter occurring essentially after cancer treatment. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the cellulitis frequency and its associated risk factors for patients with primary or secondary limb lymphedema.

- **Methods**: Information from all 1991 patients referred to a specialized lymphedema center from January to June 2018 was collected, including previous cellulitis episodes and the clinical and lymphedema characteristics.

- **Results**: Of the 1846 patients whose information could be analyzed, 695 (37.6%) had experienced one or more cellulitis episodes, and 23.3% had recurrent cellulitis. Cellulitis occurred in 39.5%, 30.5%, and 38.6% of the patients with secondary upper limb, secondary lower limb, and primary lower limb lymphedema, respectively (P = 0.02). The corresponding duration of lymphedema was 106.5, 97, and 243.1 months. For secondary upper limb lymphedema, a long interval from lymphedema onset to the first consultation at our specialized center, younger age at lymphedema onset, and the use of radiotherapy were independently associated with cellulitis. However, axillary lymph node excision, chemotherapy use, and segmentation of the upper limb lymphedema were not associated with cellulitis. A longer interval from lymphedema onset to the first consultation and lymph node excision were associated with cellulitis in those with lower limb secondary lymphedema, but higher body mass index and younger age at lymphedema onset were not. For primary lower limb lymphedema, management of associated risk factors is implied.

### The role of biologic treatment in special scenarios in hidradenitis suppurativa: Facial and nape phenotype, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, and lymphedema [^115Viqtk]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the hair follicle, which typically affects the axilla, inguinal, submammary, and perianal areas. Atypical HS, such as facial HS, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS), nape HS, and HS lymphedema, has also been described. There is scarce evidence about the treatment of atypical HS. This study describes the efficacy of biologic drugs and adjuvant therapeutic interventions used in patients with atypical HS who had an inadequate response to systemic antibiotics.

A prospective case series study of patients with atypical HS (facial HS, DCS, nape HS, and HS lymphedema) was conducted in an HS Clinic setting. Disease activity indexes, sociodemographic, clinical, and safety variables were collected. Two patients met criteria for facial HS, three met criteria for DCS/nape HS, and three patients met criteria for HS lymphedema.

- **Facial hidradenitis suppurativa**: Patients with facial HS achieved rapid improvement without requiring other therapies.
- **Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, nape hidradenitis suppurativa, and HS lymphedema**: These patients showed a variable response, with a decrease in activity indexes and requiring adjuvant treatments.

Biologic drugs are useful in the management of special HS locations. In the case of facial HS, biologic therapy seems to be quite effective as monotherapy. In the cases of DCS, HS lymphedema, and nape HS, treatment combination or intensification may be needed.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically important.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^113v9wam]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

When patients with a history of prior cellulitis by LED etiology were compared, patients with PLED ($5691; 95% CI, $4564-$7131) have a higher cost of cellulitis-related health care expenditure per patient per year than those with BCRL ($1958; 95% CI, $1102-$3489) or GCRL ($3055; 95% CI, $1196-$6192).

- **The influence of venous ulcers**: To determine the influence of VLUs on the incidence of cellulitis and the costs of treating cellulitis in patients with and without VLUs, we divided the PLED group into those with lymphedema and VLUs [VLU+] 4855 (58%) vs. those with lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency and no VLUs [VLU−] 3551 (42%). The overall rate of cellulitis per 100 patient years (PYs) among the VLU+ patients was higher than those without VLUs at 48.0/100 PYs (95% CI, 46.7–49.3) vs. 43.5/100 PYs (95% CI, 41.8–45.2). No difference in the rate of cellulitis was observed between the two groups for the patients with a prior history of cellulitis or for those without a history of prior cellulitis. When the cellulitis-related health care expenditures between the two groups were examined, there was no significant difference in the cost of cellulitis per patient per year between the two groups.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: Part I. Lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, often residing in the interdigital toe spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization. It is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. Despite its prevalence, cellulitis can present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination, as it lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. The clinical presentation typically includes acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain. However, diagnosis can be difficult due to infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans.

Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Appropriate targeted coverage for these pathogens with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is typically sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^117EPjNH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissues that recurs in approximately one-third of cases. The only proven strategy to reduce the risk of recurrence is the use of long-term, low-dose antibiotics. Given concerns about antibiotic resistance and the pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing, other prevention strategies are needed.

- **Objectives**: To explore patients' views about cellulitis and different ways of preventing recurrent episodes.

- **Methods**: Adults aged ≥ 18 years with a history of a first episode or recurrent cellulitis were invited through primary care, hospitals, and advertising to complete a survey, take part in an interview, or both.

- **Results**: Thirty interviews were conducted between August 2016 and July 2017. Two hundred and forty surveys were completed (response rate 17%). Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data showed that people who have had cellulitis have wide-ranging beliefs about what can cause cellulitis and are often unaware of the risk of recurrence or potential strategies to prevent recurrence. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercise, and losing weight were more popular potential strategies than the use of compression stockings or long-term antibiotics. Participants expressed caution about long-term oral antibiotics, particularly those who had experienced only one episode of cellulitis.

- **Conclusions**: People who have had cellulitis are keen to know about possible ways to prevent further episodes. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercise, and losing weight were generally viewed more favorably than compression stockings or long-term antibiotic use.

### Assessment of quality of life changes in patients with lower extremity lymphedema using an advanced pneumatic compression device at home [^1173cgTX]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). High credibility.

Lymphedema is associated with significant morbidity and healthcare resource usage. Conventional therapy efficacy has been limited, with poor surgical salvage options. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the use of advanced pneumatic compression devices (APCDs) improves clinical outcomes; however, limited evidence regarding their role in healthcare cost mitigation or health-related quality of life (QOL) is available.

The present postmarket, multicenter, single-arm, observational clinical trial conducted in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System evaluated patients with a diagnosis of primary or secondary edema of unilateral or bilateral lower extremities treated with the Flexitouch APCD (Tactile Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) from February 2016 to March 2019. The patients were assessed at baseline and 12, 24, and 52 weeks from enrollment by limb circumference, QOL assessments (Short Form-36 and Lymphedema Quality of Life), device compliance, cellulitis episodes, and lymphedema-related healthcare use since the previous visit. The primary endpoints of interest were the QOL at baseline compared with at 12 weeks, and unscheduled lymphedema-related clinic visits, and hospital admissions at 52 weeks. The secondary endpoints included the change in limb girth and QOL at 52 weeks compared with baseline.

A total of 178 patients with lower extremity lymphedema were prospectively enrolled. The present study reports the interim data for the first 74 subjects to complete 52 weeks of APCD treatment. The cohort was predominately male (94.6%), elderly (mean age).

### Efficacy of vascularized submental lymph node transfer with decongestive therapy and antibiotics for early-stage lower limb filarial lymphedema [^1118SaSB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Filarial lymphedema (FLE) is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema, with endemic prevalence in developing countries. Traditionally, FLE has been managed with antibiotics and decongestive therapy (DCT) in the early stages or excisional surgery at later stages. The results of vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) in post-oncologic lymphedema have been encouraging, and VLNT is a widely accepted surgical treatment. The authors suggest that combined treatment with antibiotics, DCT, and vascularized submental lymph node (VSLN) transfer could lead to both objective and subjective improvement of early-stage lower limb FLE.

- **Methods**: Between January 2019 and January 2020, patients with early-stage lower-limb FLE who underwent VLNT were retrospectively reviewed. VLNT was harvested from the submental region in all patients. Outcomes were assessed using volume improvement, frequency of cellulitis, and lymphoscintigraphy, along with a subjective scoring questionnaire.

- **Results**: Three men and one woman with an average age of 27 years (range, 25 to 29 years) were included. Two patients presented bilateral lymphedema. One patient was lost at 3-month follow-up and was not included in the analysis. Patients showed an initial decrease in circumferential measurements after antibiotics and DCT of 2074 ± 471 cc (39% ± 9%). At a mean follow-up of 12.3 ± 6.2 months, further improvement of limb volume of 2389 ± 576 cc (45% ± 10%) was achieved following VSLN transfer. Lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated dye uptake by the VLNT with reduced dermal backflow, and none of the patients experienced episodic recurrence.

### Lymphatic abnormalities demonstrated by lymphoscintigraphy after lower limb cellulitis [^114uq9J9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause for admission to the hospital, and repeated episodes are thought to damage the lymphatic system. Lymphoedema is recognized as a condition predisposing individuals to cellulitis, but there are no data to suggest its prevalence among a population presenting to the hospital with acute cellulitis.

- **Objectives**: To ascertain whether lymphatic abnormalities represent a common problem in patients with lower limb cellulitis.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted with cellulitis of the lower limb were invited to undergo clinical examination and lymphoscintigraphy.

- **Results**: Thirty patients agreed to participate in the study. Fifteen underwent lymphoscintigraphy. Thirteen had abnormal scans indicating impaired lymph drainage, with seven patients presenting clinical lymphoedema.

- **Conclusions**: Lymphatic abnormalities represent an important but unrecognized problem in patients with leg cellulitis.

### Predictors for readmission due to cellulitis among Japanese patients [^112hZXet]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the skin. Some patients experience multiple hospitalizations due to factors such as lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral circulatory disturbances, and deep vein thrombosis, which are considered risk factors for repeated admissions. In Japan, elderly women and undernourished elderly individuals have been reported as having increased risk for multiple hospitalizations, suggesting a different patient demographic compared to international data.

We conducted an investigation into the characteristics of readmission cases for patients admitted for cellulitis in Japan. A retrospective analysis was performed on cases of cellulitis and erysipelas admitted between April 1, 2005, and March 31, 2018. Exclusions were made for patients with cellulitis or erysipelas at multiple sites and those with osteomyelitis, pressure ulcer infection, and necrotizing fasciitis. In our study, only hospitalizations for recurrence at the same site were considered.

- **Blood albumin levels**: Patients with multiple hospitalizations had significantly lower blood albumin levels than those hospitalized only once. This suggests that hypoalbuminemia, with or without liver dysfunction, may be a risk factor for cellulitis recurrence.

- **Lymphedema, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia**: The rates of these conditions were significantly higher in patients with multiple hospitalizations.

Other laboratory and clinical factors did not achieve statistical significance. Notably, chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral circulatory disturbances, and deep vein thrombosis did not appear to be risk factors in the Japanese cases studied.

### Severe lower limb cellulitis is best diagnosed by dermatologists and managed with shared care between primary and secondary care [^111mRUhZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is responsible for over 400,000 bed days per year in the English National Health Service (NHS) at the cost of £96 million.

- **Objectives**: An audit following the transfer of care for lower limb cellulitis managed in secondary care from general physicians to dermatologists.

- **Methods**: A review of patient details and work diaries from the first 40 months of implementation of the new model of care was conducted.

- **Results**: Of 635 patients referred with lower limb cellulitis, 33% had other diagnoses that did not require admission. Four hundred and seven of 425 patients with cellulitis were managed entirely as outpatients, many at home. Twenty-eight percent of patients with cellulitis had an underlying skin disease identified and treated, which likely reduced the risk of cellulitis, leg ulceration, and lymphoedema. Only 18 of 635 patients referred with lower limb cellulitis required hospital admission for conventional treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This new way of managing suspected lower limb cellulitis offered substantial savings for the NHS and benefits of early and accurate diagnosis with correct home treatment for patients.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113im5Mo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, with additional reference to the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (record CRD42017080466, November 2017).

- **Objectives**: The primary objective for this review was to identify and describe diagnostic criteria and tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. The secondary objective was to assess the quality of the studies where diagnostic criteria or tools were developed.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies including patients with lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas in primary and secondary care, which used diagnostic criteria or tools for diagnosis, were included.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The following inclusion criteria were applied: any study type that used diagnostic criteria or tools, in any language, involving patients of any age, sex, or ethnicity, who had lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The following articles were excluded: animal studies, laboratory in vitro studies, literature and systematic review articles, expert opinions, conference abstracts, articles that included only patients with non-lower-limb cellulitis, articles where the site of cellulitis or erysipelas was not clear, articles where data from lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas could not be separated, articles that used tools to determine etiology, and case series with fewer than 20 patients.

### Comparison of initial antibiotic choice and treatment of cellulitis in the pre- and post-community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus eras [^112nP8ax]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment success of cellulitis in the age of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA) involves comparing the initial antibiotic choice and treatment success in the pre- and post-CAMRSA eras.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study is to determine antibiotic prescribing patterns and treatment failure rates for cellulitis in the pre- and post-CAMRSA eras.

- **Methods**: We performed an electronic chart review of patients seen in our emergency department with cellulitis in 2000 and 2005. Inclusion criteria included age 18 years or more and receipt of a single oral antibiotic for cellulitis. Exclusion criteria were incision and drainage, surgery, or admission on the initial visit. Treatment failure was defined as a repeat visit in the subsequent 30 days, along with a change in antibiotics, admission to the hospital, incision and drainage of abscess, or surgical intervention. Antibiotic-prescribing practices and treatment failure rates were then compared in the pre- and post-CAMRSA eras.

- **Results**: There was a significant decrease in beta-lactam antibiotics and an increase in CAMRSA-effective antibiotics prescribed in 2005 versus 2000. The difference in treatment failure rates of the beta-lactams and CAMRSA antibiotics was statistically insignificant. There has not been an increase in failure rates of the beta-lactam antibiotics for simple cellulitis since the emergence of CAMRSA.

- **Conclusion**: Our study demonstrates that prescribing practices for simple cellulitis have changed since the emergence of CAMRSA. This may not be appropriate because beta-lactam antibiotics remain effective for simple cellulitis despite the emergence of CAMRSA.
