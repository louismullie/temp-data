## Question

silvery plaques on knees and scalp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about silvery plaques on the knees and scalp. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the morphologic pattern and anatomic distribution. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and actively exclude mimics. Next, I will assess severity and functional impact to guide therapy. After that, I need to screen for psoriatic arthritis and other comorbidities. Finally, I will outline a staged management plan and summarize the most likely diagnosis with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the morphologic pattern and distribution. Silvery-white, micaceous scale on well-demarcated erythematous plaques at extensor surfaces (knees) and the scalp is classic for plaque psoriasis, with the knees being a predilection site and the scalp commonly involved early in disease. This pattern is repeatedly described in guidelines and epidemiologic cohorts, and the Auspitz sign (punctate bleeding after scale removal) further supports the diagnosis, though I should be careful not to overstate it without examination [^1162nYVb] [^1178mnT9] [^114mi2bS] [^116UGG3A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the differential and exclude mimics. Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp can look similar but tends to be more diffuse, greasy, and less sharply demarcated, whereas psoriasis on the scalp is often asymmetric with thicker, silvery scale and can show pityriasis amiantacea; tinea corporis/capitis can mimic plaques but usually shows an advancing border and central clearing, and KOH or culture helps; discoid lupus and other interface dermatitides differ histologically; hypertrophic lichen planus and verrucous psoriasis can both favor elbows/knees, but histology distinguishes them; I should confirm with bedside tests and, if atypical or refractory, a biopsy to avoid misclassification [^115YnLF4] [^115Gwors] [^112r2bNM] [^112AbTfS].

> Wait, let me verify severity and quality-of-life impact because this drives treatment choice. I should estimate body surface area (BSA) and consider special sites. Even when BSA is under 3–5%, involvement of scalp, face, hands, feet, or genitalia can be functionally severe and warrant escalation beyond topicals. The "rule of 10s" (BSA > 10%, PASI > 10, or DLQI > 10) is a pragmatic threshold for systemic therapy, and I need to ask about pruritus, pain, sleep disturbance, and social burden to contextualize severity [^1162nYVb] [^116mEgB4] [^1178rDwb].

> I will now examine the possibility of psoriatic arthritis because musculoskeletal disease changes management. I should screen with the PEST tool and ask about swollen joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, and morning stiffness; if positive or if there are suggestive findings, I should refer to rheumatology, as early PsA identification improves outcomes and may shift therapy toward agents effective for both skin and joints [^115Tmxk7] [^116wHw78] [^117Ag4qy].

> Next, I should review comorbidities and systemic implications. Psoriasis carries increased risks of cardiometabolic disease, obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, and IBD. I need to check blood pressure, BMI, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and lipids, and consider IBD screening if symptomatic. This systemic framing supports earlier systemic therapy in moderate-to-severe disease to mitigate both cutaneous and extracutaneous inflammation [^1178mnT9] [^1162nYVb] [^116SSKXZ].

> Let me think about first-line therapy for limited disease. For localized plaques, especially on the scalp, I should confirm that topical corticosteroids are appropriate and counsel on adherence. Class I–VII steroids can be used for up to about 4 weeks with maintenance strategies, and scalp-friendly vehicles (foam, solution, shampoo) improve use. Vitamin D analogs, often combined with steroids, enhance efficacy and reduce steroid exposure. I should double-check fingertip-unit dosing to avoid under-treatment and remind myself that scalp barrier is relatively permissive, so penetration is not the main barrier to response [^116MeTyH] [^115W9mBS] [^115YnLF4].

> But wait, what if disease is moderate-to-severe or refractory to optimized topicals? I should confirm candidacy for phototherapy or systemic therapy. NB-UVB is guideline-supported and effective for plaque psoriasis, and for systemic therapy, methotrexate, acitretin, or biologics targeting TNF-α, IL-17, or IL-23 are options. IL-23 inhibitors are often favored first-line for moderate-to-severe plaque due to efficacy and safety, and TNF-α inhibitors are particularly relevant when PsA is present. I need to ensure baseline labs and infection screening are completed before biologics [^115vRqy6] [^111YYg83] [^113mDZ2V] [^113eyvAk].

> I should confirm special considerations for scalp disease because it is common and often undertreated. Scalp psoriasis frequently requires dedicated vehicles and may need higher-potency steroids initially; I need to check for Koebnerization from scratching and counsel on gentle mechanical scale removal; if topical therapy fails or is impractical, excimer laser or systemic therapy can be justified even with low BSA due to disproportionate burden [^115YnLF4] [^116SXSSX] [^1178rDwb].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis. The most likely diagnosis is chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) given the classic morphology of silvery scale on well-demarcated plaques and the predilection for knees and scalp. This is supported by multiple guidelines and epidemiologic data, and the next steps are to confirm severity, screen for PsA, assess comorbidities, and initiate a stepwise regimen beginning with optimized topicals and escalating to phototherapy or systemic therapy as indicated by BSA, special-site involvement, or refractoriness [^1162nYVb] [^1178mnT9] [^114mi2bS].

---

Silvery plaques on the knees and scalp are most consistent with **plaque psoriasis** (psoriasis vulgaris) [^1162nYVb], characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scale and a predilection for extensor surfaces and the scalp [^1178mnT9]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by Auspitz sign and family history; biopsy is reserved for atypical cases [^115cH6tJ]. Management is **stepwise**: topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs for mild disease [^116MeTyH]; phototherapy or systemic agents (methotrexate, acitretin, or biologics) for moderate-to-severe disease [^116mEgB4] [^111YYg83] [^115vRqy6] [^1158nXAy]. Screen for psoriatic arthritis and comorbidities (cardiovascular, metabolic, IBD) [^116wHw78] [^116YJr3q] and provide patient education on triggers and adherence [^116SXSSX].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

- **Morphology**: Well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery-white scale; Auspitz sign (punctate bleeding after scale removal) may be present [^116UGG3A].

- **Distribution**: Commonly involves extensor surfaces (elbows, knees) and scalp; may also affect trunk, nails, and intertriginous areas [^1162nYVb].

- **Symptoms**: Pruritus, burning, or pain; significant psychosocial impact, especially with scalp involvement [^115YnLF4].

- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; biopsy shows acanthosis, parakeratosis, and Munro microabscesses if needed [^115cH6tJ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| Seborrheic dermatitis | Greasy, yellowish scale; scalp and face | Less well-demarcated; milder inflammation [^notfound] |
| Tinea corporis | Annular plaques with central clearing | KOH prep positive for hyphae [^115Gwors] |
| Lichen planus | Violaceous, flat-topped papules | Wickham striae; biopsy [^1157TjEs] |
| Lupus erythematosus | Erythematous plaques with scarring | Positive ANA; biopsy [^112r2bNM] |
| Eczema | Ill-defined, pruritic plaques | History of atopy; biopsy [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Psoriasis is **immune-mediated**, driven by T cells and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23) that cause keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation [^1127j3uV]. Genetic predisposition and environmental triggers (infection, stress, trauma, medications) contribute to flares [^1143ZaYp].

---

## Management strategies

### Topical therapies (first-line for mild disease)

- **Corticosteroids**: High-potency agents (e.g. clobetasol) for scalp and knees; limit duration to avoid atrophy [^116MeTyH].

- **Vitamin D analogs**: Calcipotriol or calcitriol; often combined with corticosteroids [^115YnLF4].

- **Keratolytics**: Salicylic acid or urea to reduce scale and enhance penetration [^notfound].

---

### Phototherapy

Phototherapy options include **narrowband UVB**, effective for scalp and extensor plaques [^notfound], and **excimer laser**, useful for localized, recalcitrant lesions [^115YnLF4].

---

### Systemic therapies (moderate-to-severe disease)

- **Methotrexate**: Effective and cost-efficient; monitor liver function and CBC [^notfound].

- **Acitretin**: Useful for hyperkeratotic or pustular disease; teratogenic [^1158nXAy].

- **Biologics**: TNF-α inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept), IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab), IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab, risankizumab); highly effective for scalp and extensor disease [^113mDZ2V] [^111YYg83].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

- **Triggers**: Avoid stress, trauma, infections, alcohol, and smoking [^notfound].

- **Adherence**: Emphasize consistent topical use and follow-up [^116SXSSX].

- **Support**: Provide resources and counseling for psychosocial impact [^11511zCx].

---

## Potential complications and comorbidities

- **Psoriatic arthritis**: Occurs in 20–30% of patients; screen regularly [^117NSsA4].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease [^1143ZaYp].

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and NAFLD [^1178mnT9].

- **Psychiatric comorbidities**: Depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life [^113iof2h].

---

Silvery plaques on the knees and scalp are most consistent with **plaque psoriasis**; management is stepwise, and patients should be screened for psoriatic arthritis and comorbidities.

### Anti-IL 23 biologics for the treatment of plaque psoriasis [^111YYg83]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can drastically affect a patient's quality-of-life and is associated with multiple comorbid conditions. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, commonly presenting as sharply demarcated, erythematous plaques with overlying silvery scale on the trunk, extensor surfaces, limbs, and scalp. Although initially limited to oral therapies, the choices in systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis have evolved with biologic immunotherapies being the main focus.

Areas Covered

In this review, we describe the IL-23/Th17 axis and IL-23 inhibitors as targets for a growing family of biologics. This family includes the FDA-approved medications ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab. We will review the safety and efficacy of these medications throughout various Phase 1,2, and 3, trials for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. A literature search of PubMed was utilized for the following terms: 'psoriasis and IL-23', 'ustekinumab', 'guselkumab', 'tildrakizumab', and 'risankizumab'. We also searched for clinical trials involving IL-23 inhibitors registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Expert Opinion

Anti-IL 23 therapy, especially anti-p19 monoclonal antibodies, should be considered first-line therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis due to their efficacy and relative safety. More research is required to expand the scope of anti-p19 therapy to pediatric populations and additional indications such as psoriatic arthritis.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis associated with psoriasis vulgaris: coincidental occurrence or causal association? Case report [^111yeMLF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old male, a heavy smoker, was admitted to our department, because of fever (38.4°C), weakness, arthralgias, non-pitting edema of the lower extremities and chest discomfort for the previous two weeks. The arthralgias were partially responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient also reported skin eruptions on his elbows and lower extremities that had appeared six months previously. His past medical history was unremarkable.

On physical examination, sharply demarcated erythematous plaques covered by silvery white scales were observed on the right elbow and the lower extremities below the knees (figure 1). The patient's ankles were painful and edematous. On palpation, firm and painless subcutaneous nodules could be found on the occipital part of the scalp. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Basic laboratory tests were normal except for an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (57 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (45.2 mg/l). Further investigations, which included serum complement analysis, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies, immunoglobulin levels, and serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C and human immunodeficiency virus, disclosed no apparent pathologies. PPD skin test was negative. Neither arterial blood gases nor pulmonary function tests showed significant abnormalities. Radiographic examination, using x-ray and high resolution computed tomography of the chest, revealed bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy with small nodules along the bronchovascular bundles. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. BAL fluid analysis revealed lymphocytosis (35%) with an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio (4.2). Microbiological and cytological examinations were negative. Transbronchial lung biopsies were non-diagnostic.

A labial biopsy and biopsies from the cutaneous lesions were also obtained. The labial biopsy demonstrated the presence of small epithelioid (sarcoid form) granulomas (figure 2), while the skin biopsies were typical of psoriasis (figure 3). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples with periodic acid-Schiff staining was negative. We concluded that the patient suffered from two separate clinical entities: pulmonary sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris.

The articular manifestations responded partially to NSAIDs. Consequently, a short course of 30 mg prednisone daily and topical therapy to manage the psoriatic lesions were applied. This resulted in a significant clinical improvement. Three months after his discharge the patient remains asymptomatic.

### A photodistributed rash in a patient on apixaban [^112r2bNM]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case vignette

A 63-year-old female with recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation presented with a 1 month history of pruritic rash. Apixaban was started 6 weeks prior to presentation after cardiac ablation. She was using triamcinolone ointment without improvement. Exam showed photodistributed erythematous coalescing scaly papules on the vertex scalp, shoulders, and upper arms, with sharp demarcation along shirt line (Fig 1). Shave biopsy showed interface dermatitis, dermal mucin, and superficial dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figs 2 and 3). Lab testing was notable for anti-histone antibody 3.7U (strong positive), elevated liver enzymes, normal complete blood count, and negative anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-SSA, and SSB antibodies.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's skin condition?
A. Psoriasis
B. Discoid lupus erythematosus
C. Dermatomyositis
D. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)

Answers:
A. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis typically presents with well-defined erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales, commonly involving extensor surfaces like elbows and knees. It typically exhibits parakeratosis, acanthosis, and Munro microabscesses.
B. Discoid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Discoid lupus erythematosus presents with discoid lesions, often with adherent scales, and can cause scarring. It typically lacks the widespread photodistribution and histology findings including superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.
C. Dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Dermatomyositis can have a similar photodistribution and erythematous papules, but it is often associated with proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash, and Gottron's papules. Histopathologic findings however can include interface dermatitis and dermal mucin deposition.
D. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin – Incorrect. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin can present photodistributed papular rash with histology showing dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. However, dermal mucin and interface dermatitis along with a strong anti-histone antibody positivity make another diagnosis more likely.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) – Correct. SCLE typically presents with photodistributed erythematous scaly papules and specific histopathologic features including interface dermatitis, mucin deposition, and superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.

### A case for histologic verification of the diagnosis of atypical psoriasis before systemic therapy [^114QYoKq]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

The 52-year-old white man presented initially to an outside dermatologist 4 years prior with dermatitis involving the trunk and waistline and later the extremities. Per the clinical features, an eczematous process was suspected initially. Later, based on the clinical presentation, psoriasis was diagnosed at an outside facility. The localization and clinical characteristics of the disease never completely fit the classic, more frequent types of plaque, inverse, or guttate psoriasis. During the course of the disease, the patient tried clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment to the body and mometasone furoate 0.1% cream twice a day to the face and intertriginous areas. Per the patient's report, there was only limited transient response. The morphology and distribution of the areas remained unchanged. Slowly, new plaques appeared, and no areas showed complete resolution. After 4 years of futile topical therapy, the patient was recommended TNF-α inhibitor treatment. The diagnosis was never confirmed by biopsy. Routine laboratory testing before initiation of TNF-α inhibitor treatment was within normal limits. During adalimumab treatment, the patient noted no improvement in any of the affected areas. Paradoxically, at approximately week 4 of treatment, thickening of the previously present plaques was noted. At this time the patient also noted a large mass on the left side of the scalp. Oral antibiotics were prescribed at the outside facility, and a skin biopsy of the left scalp mass was obtained. The biopsy found an atypical, epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate consistent with T-cell lymphoma. Adalimumab was discontinued 6 weeks after initiation of treatment, and the patient was referred to us for hematology/oncology and dermato-oncology evaluation and care.

On physical examination, the patient presented with multiple salmon-colored, scaly, geographic plaques scattered on the trunk and extremities. There were multiple round, red nodules and tumors on the trunk, scalp, and neck (Fig 1, A). The left scalp tumor was ulcerated with cloudy white exudate. The total modified severity weighted assessment tool score (mSWAT) was 59, and 35% of the total body surface area was affected.

### The burden of psoriasis: a call for awareness [^11511zCx]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Every August the USA National Psoriasis Foundation (NPS), launches the National Psoriasis Month to spread the knowledge about the etiopathology of psoriasis, to inform about available treatments, and to support and unite those affected. As psoriasis is often mistakenly perceived as infectious and patients can be victims of social stigmatisation, it is pivotal to promote awareness of what psoriasis is and is not and to fight the discrimination suffered by people living with it.

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease possibly resulting from a defect in proliferation and differentiation of skin cells associated with inflammatory cell infiltration. This process causes skin cells to accumulate and form plaques that itch, burn, and sting. These plaques appear on any part of the body, but are most often found on the elbows, knees, and scalp. Psoriasis scaly patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas, including the entire body. In addition, according to the NPS there are at least five types of psoriasis. Including the most common form with plaques, psoriasis also occurs in guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic forms. Of note, psoriasis is not limited to the skin, but can produce systemic effects and can be associated with psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes, as reported by WHO in the Global Report on Psoriasis, in 2016.

### Joint pain with violaceous papules and plaques [^112JBW9e]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 39-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of new-onset bilateral leg pain, arthralgias, and difficulty arising from bed. She reported a 2-day history of a pruritic rash on her right knee, right flank, posterior neck, and anterior scalp, along with a 3-day history of throat pain and fevers (daily maximum temperature, 39.4°C). Laboratory values included white blood cell count, 11.1 (normal range [NR], 4–11) with 90% polymorphonuclear neutrophils (NR, 40–80%); platelets, 469 (NR, 150–450); ferritin 3,662 (NR, 12–300); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 115 (NR, 0–29); C-reactive protein, 225 (≤ 10); aspartate aminotransferase, 91 (NR, 10–40); alanine aminotransferase, 67 (NR, 7–56); negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor. Physical examination found excoriated, linear, and ill-defined violaceous papules and plaques (Fig 1). Biopsy of the flank revealed interface dermatitis (Figs 2 and 3).

### Post-implantation erythema in 3 patients and a review of reticular telangiectatic erythema [^116Jxyfy]. Contact Dermatitis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The appearance of erythematous, blanchable patches or plaques overlying an implant suggests possible reticular telangiectatic erythema (RTE). RTE is a benign reactive cutaneous manifestation that can present following the implantation of a cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator or intrathecal infusion pump in an otherwise asymptomatic, non-infectious patient.

Objective

To demonstrate the variety in clinical presentation of patients presenting with RTE or similar patch test-negative post-implantation erythema.

Patients/Materials/Methods

After institutional board approval had been obtained, patient information was obtained from electronic medical record files, which included surgical reports, pathology reports, and notes from outpatient encounters.

Results

We report post-implantation erythema following insertion of an elbow prosthesis, a knee prosthesis, and a spinal cord stimulator, which have not previously been cited as aetiologies of RTE.

Conclusion

Owing to the delayed onset and variable recovery, RTE remains a diagnostic challenge. RTE should be included in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with erythema over the site of a previously implanted device.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^115YnLF4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

PubMed literature searches were conducted with the following terms: psoriasis and face/facial, psoriasis and palmoplantar, psoriasis and intertriginous or inverse, psoriasis and genital, psoriasis and scalp, and psoriasis and nail. Abstracts from English‐language articles in the last 10 years were screened for relevance.

2.1 Scalp

Scalp involvement occurs in 45–56% of individuals with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). It is typically among the first affected areas of the body, with the frequency of lesion formation increasing with disease duration. The diagnosis of scalp psoriasis can be delayed due to overlapping features with other papulosquamous disorders of the scalp, particularly seborrheic dermatitis (Treadwell, 2011). Psoriasis lesions on the scalp are usually asymmetrical and sharply demarcated, and exhibit silvery‐white scaling.

The symptoms of scalp psoriasis can result in decreased QoL by causing pain, itching, bleeding, feelings of embarrassment, and restricting clothing choices (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014). QoL is more adversely affected in women than men, and individuals younger than 40 years are more adversely affected compared with patients 60 years or older (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014).

Common treatment options for patients with scalp psoriasis include topical agents such as vitamin D analogs, corticosteroids, and coal tar. However, these agents are challenging to use on the scalp because hair makes application burdensome, and many patients find them cosmetically unacceptable (Menter et al. 2011). These issues can lead to nonadherence and dissatisfaction with treatment options.

In a recent systematic review of topical therapies for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy, and corticosteroid monotherapy were found to be more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy (Schlager et al. 2016). However, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be acceptable for short‐term therapy due to the slim efficacy benefit of vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy over steroid therapy alone. Targeted phototherapy with an excimer laser can provide an effective alternative to topical therapy when used with a blower device that displaces hair (Menter et al. 2010).

### Psoriasis vulgaris with fibrokeratoma from pityriasis amiantacea [^116gfeQ3]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old Japanese man with a 35-year history of severe PsV presented to our hospital. He had been treated with a topical steroid and phototherapy but had discontinued all treatments 1 year prior to presenting to our hospital.

On physical examination, he was found to have well-circumscribed erythematous patches and plaques with silvery-white scales on the entire body. Joint pain was present, but it was limited to the hands and right knee. Moreover, he presented with sticky, silvery scales adhering to the scalp and agglutinating the hair shafts (Fig 1, A). We diagnosed this characteristic clinical feature as pityriasis amiantacea associated with PsV. When we removed the scales gently using olive oil, surprisingly, about 50 horns each 1 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length were found scattered on the PsV lesions (Fig 1, B). These horns were distinctively keratinized at the top and showed marked surface telangiectasia under dermoscopy.

Fig 1
A, Sticky, silvery scales adhering to the scalp and agglutinating the shafts of the hairs. B, Distinctive horns that were keratinized at the top were present on the scalp. C, Hyperkeratosis, dermal fibrosis, and dilated vessels in the papillary dermis. (C, Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnifications: upper, ×10; lower, ×200.)

A biopsy specimen revealed hyperkeratosis, dermal fibrosis, and dilated vessels in the papillary dermis (Fig 1, C). We diagnosed these horns as fibrokeratomas.

The scalp PsV lesions were treated with topical corticosteroid, and the keratotic horns were removed by the patient with scissors. Although a few PsV plaques appeared temporarily, there has been no recurrence of pityriasis amiantacea or fibrokeratomas in the last 2 years.

### Extensor plaques with associated arthritis and neuropathy [^1135pM1x]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 68-year-old man with family history of psoriasis presented with a 1.5-year history of neuropathic pain in his feet associated with sudden appearance of peripheral edema (Fig 1). After having an unremarkable electromyogram, he was referred to the rheumatology department for initiation of adalimumab for polyarthralgias and erythematous plaques on extensor surfaces. Physical examination found a painless erythematous and edematous left ear (Fig 2); oval erythematous plaques on extensor elbows, knees, and trunk (Fig 3); pitting edema bilaterally to mid shins; decreased sensation to light touch on bilateral plantar feet; and tender small joints in his hands. Autoimmune, vascular, cardiac, and imaging studies were unrevealing.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Psoriasis
B. Relapsing polychondritis
C. Hansen disease (HD)
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Granuloma annulare (GA)

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^111W36Ts]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

ICI-psoriasis

Psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis is a fairly common specific D-irAE, although the true incidence has likely been undercaptured; psoriasis is not a diagnosis found in the common terminology criteria for adverse event reporting guidelines used in clinical trials and by oncologists. Patients with a history of prior psoriasis develop flares of disease earlier than those who develop de novo disease after initiating ICI therapy; patients may also have a history of psoriatic arthritis or develop concomitant psoriatic arthritis.

ICI-psoriasis may present with or without significant itch and may be associated with inflammatory joint symptoms. It can be further classified into six more common subtypes based on typical morphology: (1) plaque (psoriasis vulgaris), characterized by well-demarcated red or pink plaques with silvery/micaceous scale that favor extensor surfaces, scalp, scars, umbilicus, and gluteal cleft; (2) inverse, which presents as pink patches in inguinal, axillary, inframammary and gluteal folds, and may cause scaling and plaques on the genitalia; (3) guttate, which presents as diffuse pink or red papules (2–5 mm) with silvery scale, generally on the trunk or extremities; (4) palmoplantar, characterized by erythematous, scaling plaques over the palms and/or soles or significant hyperkeratosis with or without erythema; (5) pustular, which are patches and plaques of erythema with numerous pustules in areas forming lakes of pus; it may present with pustules limited to plaques, in an annular pattern or with sterile pustules and papules on the palms or soles; (6) erythrodermic, which consists of diffuse erythema and scaling over 80% body surface area, with active or prior plaques in classic locations, consistent nail findings and sparing of face. Patients may present with more than one subtype(online supplemental table S9).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film from two to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition.

Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.

Follicular mucinosis is a rare chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology, presenting as mucin deposits around the follicles and sebaceous glands. It can progress to alopecia of the scalp and other hairy areas. Follicular mucinosis may be a benign primary idiopathic disorder or secondary to malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. It can present with shiny papules or sharply marginated infiltrated erythematous scaling plaques, with follicular accentuation on the scalp, neck, trunk and limbs. There are many local and systemic treatments. This paper discusses the case of an adult with an uncommon acneiform follicular mucinosis controlled with systemic corticosteroids.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis associated with psoriasis vulgaris: coincidental occurrence or causal association? Case report [^1139EqSk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sarcoidosis is predominantly seen in young and middle-aged patients and may involve multiple organs. Although the cause of sarcoidosis remains uncertain, much is known about the immunology of this disease. The immunological hallmark is an accumulation of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes at the sites of inflammation. Interaction between the CD4+ cells and alveolar macrophages leads to a Th1-skewed cytokine profile that orchestrates the ensuing granulomatous inflammatory process.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is commonly established on the basis of compatible clinical and/or radiological features, supported by the histological findings of noncaseating granulomas and the exclusion of other diseases with a similar clinical or histological picture. The recommended diagnostic procedure is fiber-optic bronchoscopy combined with various biopsy techniques (endobronchial biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, transbronchial needle aspiration and biopsy) as well as BAL. Studies of the lymphocyte subpopulations in the BAL fluid may be diagnostically important. A CD4+/CD8+ ratio of > 3.5 in a patient with a typical clinical and radiological picture is very specific for sarcoidosis and may obviate the need for further invasive diagnostic procedures. If bronchoscopy fails to confirm the diagnosis, labial biopsy is a fairly useful method for providing histological confirmation of the disease. In the case presented here, the compatible radiographic findings, the results of BAL fluid analysis and the characteristic histological findings from the lip biopsy were considered sufficient to support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous, sharply demarcated papules and rounded plaques, covered by silvery micaceous scales which most commonly appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, umbilicus and lumbar area. Skin biopsy may show a variable histological picture but is usually diagnostic in early lesions or at the advancing edge of a well-established plaque. The characteristic histological features in psoriasis include proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and hyperkeratosis as well as infiltration of immunocytes along with angiogenesis, and subsequent typical thickening and scaling of the erythematous skin. More specifically, the epidermis in psoriatic skin is characterized by dramatic pathological alterations, such as profound acanthosis with elongation of epidermal rete ridges. Likewise, neutrophils migrate through the epidermis and form Munro microabscesses beneath the stratum corneum; this is one of the most salient features of the disease. The findings from skin lesions in our patient were identical to those mentioned above.

Although additional data are necessary to determine the role of agents targeting IL‐17 for routine management of psoriasis in other areas and nonplaque subsets, they may offer improved care and outcomes for patients whose needs are not met by available therapies. Raising the awareness of psoriasis on the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails is critical for comprehensive assessment of psoriasis. Currently, more targeted systemic therapies are available for psoriasis than in the past, and use of drugs discussed in this manuscript is important for improving clinical outcomes of all patients, regardless of affected body region. We recommend addressing the current gap in comprehensive psoriasis management through the development of better measurement tools that include all psoriasis phenotypes and incorporate the patient perspective as patient‐reported outcomes, so that clinical trials can be conducted using these new psoriasis indices.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which affects approximately 3% of the general population in the USA. The most common form of the disease, plaque psoriasis, is characterized by the development of chronic erythematous plaques covered with silvery white scales, which most commonly appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, umbilicus, and lumbar regions. Psoriasis has been associated with a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life, due to the disfiguring effect of the skin lesions and, for some, the functional impairment resulting from joint pain. Additionally, individuals with psoriasis are more susceptible to specific debilitating comorbidities, including cardiometabolic dysfunction, fatigue, and depression.

The treatment strategy for psoriasis depends on a variety of factors (e.g. the medical history, tolerability of therapies and potential for side effects, and disease severity). Regarding disease severity, there is no commonly accepted definition of mild versus moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Moreover, a patient may have mild disease on the basis of body surface area (BSA) involvement, but localization of lesions in vulnerable areas (e.g. the face, feet, hands, and/or genitals) may warrant systemic therapy. Some guidelines provide specific criteria to help evaluate the severity of a patient's psoriasis, but all recognize the importance of assessing both the physical and psychosocial burden when considering the best treatment approach.

The US National Psoriasis Foundation recommends that patients with BSA involvement < 5% should be considered candidates for topical therapy, whereas those with BSA ≥ 5% should be considered candidates for systemic therapy alone or in combination with phototherapy. A "rule of tens" has also been proposed, whereby BSA > 10%, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) > 10, or Dermatology Life-Quality Index (DLQI) > 10 identify patients with severe disease. More recently, a European consensus meeting defined mild psoriasis as BSA ≤ 10%, PASI ≤ 10, and DLQI ≤ 10; and moderate-to-severe psoriasis warranting systemic therapy as BSA or PASI > 10 and DLQI > 10. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines present a treatment decision tree based on the presence or absence of psoriatic arthritis and categorization of psoriasis as "limited" or "extensive" disease, but specific definitions of these terms are not provided.

### Diffuse rash with silvery scales and anasarca [^115fJAPa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:
A. EP – Correct. In patients with pre-existing psoriasis who present with widespread erythroderma and scaling > 80% of body surface area, EP should be considered. Histology shows hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, or inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis that may penetrate the stratum corneum (Munro's abscesses). In patients with darker skin, erythroderma may be difficult to identify. Fig 1, Fig 2
B. Chronic plaque psoriasis – Incorrect. Chronic plaque psoriasis presents with erythematous, round, desquamated plaques with sharply defined borders most commonly on the face, scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. While the patient has a history of plaque psoriasis, the widespread nature of this episode along with hair loss and anasarca makes EP the more appropriate diagnosis.
C. Guttate psoriasis – Incorrect. Guttate psoriasis presents as eruptions of small drop-like lesions, mainly on the trunk, and is most common in children/young adults with a family history of psoriasis. Lesions are typically preceded by a streptococcal throat infection and can be similar in appearance to pityriasis rosacea.
D. Sézary syndrome – Incorrect. Sézary syndrome causes erythroderma due to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Symptoms additionally can show lymphadenopathy with an elevated CD4-CD8 ratio due to malignant proliferation. Skin biopsy shows T cells infiltrating the epidermis (Pautrier's microabscesses).
E. Toxic epidermal necrolysis – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is characterized by "intense" erythema with full epidermal skin separation > 30% of body surface area, typically with involvement of mucosal surfaces or hemorrhagic crusting of the lips. There may be a drug-trigger preceding onset, commonly with initiation of antibiotics. Skin biopsy shows perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, possibly eosinophils, and full epidermal separation.

### Papular sarcoidosis of the knees: a clue for the diagnosis of erythema nodosum-associated sarcoidosis [^1111FZeQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years we have systematically explored the skin whenever sarcoidosis was suggested and we have observed with increasing frequency the presence of granulomatous cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis involving the knees.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the specific cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis involving the knees.

Methods

A total of 18 patients with biopsy-proven specific cutaneous sarcoidosis predominantly involving the knees were included in the study. Biopsy specimens were evaluated under polarized light.

Results

Of these cases, 4 corresponded to scar-sarcoidosis, 1 to plaque-type sarcoidosis, and 13 were an admixture of papules and minute scars frequently associated with erythema nodosum (papular sarcoidosis of the knees). Foreign particles were observed in 10 of 13 patients with papular sarcoidosis.

Conclusion

Papular sarcoidosis of the knees can be considered a frequent form of cutaneous sarcoidosis, mainly observed in acute forms of the disease, and frequently associated with erythema nodosum.

Plaque psoriasis — prevalence and clinical features — Plaque psoriasis is the most common form, affecting approximately 80% to 90% of patients. Plaque psoriasis manifests as well-defined, sharply demarcated, erythematous plaques varying in size from 1 cm to several centimeters. The plaques are irregular, round to oval in shape, and most often located on the scalp, trunk, buttocks, and limbs, with a predilection for extensor surfaces such as the elbows and knees. Painful fissuring within plaques can occur when lesions are present over joint lines or on the palms and soles.

Pediatric psoriasis — definitions and pathophysiology: Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that classically presents with well-demarcated, pink plaques with silvery scale, and although commonly involving the scalp, elbows, knees, and presacral region in adolescents and adults, any area of skin may be involved, including the palms and soles. Children with psoriasis can present with unique distribution patterns, including isolated facial or genital involvement, particularly in infancy. Psoriasis has many cutaneous forms, including plaque (psoriasis vulgaris), guttate, palmoplantar, inverse, and pustular. It is described as an inflammatory, immune-mediated condition stemming from inappropriate activation of cutaneous T cells and dendritic cells with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor α, leading to keratinocyte hyperproliferation, the influx of neutrophils, and further propagation of inflammation; this inflammation is also thought to contribute to systemic disease associations, including metabolic syndrome and arthritis.

### Scalp psoriasis: an overview of the disease and available therapies [^111yr1Xn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The scalp is one of the regions of the body most commonly affected by psoriatic lesions. While the head represents only 10 percent of the body's surface area, the consequences of scalp psoriasis are disproportionate to the area, as it can be seriously debilitating and presents social and emotional distress to the affected individual. Scalp lesions are often well-demarcated and may have thick gray or white scale; patients with scalp psoriasis frequently complain of pruritus and shedding of scale. Current treatment modalities — including phototherapy, topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogues and conventional systemic therapies — have produced unsatisfactory results for patients with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis due to difficulties in administration to the disease site, poor compliance, toxicity and inadequate long-term efficacy. The emergence of biologic therapies as an effective modality for the treatment of plaque psoriasis may provide another option for patients suffering from plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

A 16-year-old Indian boy presented with an 8-year history of an asymptomatic, slowly progressive skin lesion over the left knee. Examination showed a single, well-defined erythematous scaly plaque with crusting, and areas of atrophy and scarring (Figure 1A). the general examination was normal. The patient's past medical history and family history were not significant. A tuberculin skin test was strongly positive (Figure 2). Incisional biopsy revealed multiple well-formed epithelioid granulomas with or without giant cells surrounded by lymphocytic infiltrates in the dermis (Figure 3). Ziehl-Neelson staining of the tissue section, mycobacterial culture of a tissue specimen, and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Based on the clinicopathologic findings, a diagnosis of lupus vulgaris was made. The patient was treated with antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 6 months. At the end of treatment, the lesion had healed well, leaving an atrophic, wrinkled scar (Figure 1B).

Lupus vulgaris is a chronic, progressive paucibacillary form of cutaneous tuberculosis. Criteria for diagnosis are variable. Tuberculin skin testing is usually positive. Analysis of a biopsy specimen should include histopathology, tissue smear, bacteriologic cultures, and polymerase chain reaction, but may be negative, as in this case of paucibacillary disease reminiscent of tuberculoid leprosy. Assessment for pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis should be done. Complications may occur, including secondary bacterial infections, mutilation, destruction, scarring, and joint contractures. Cutaneous tuberculosis generally responds well to antituberculous treatment.

Case presentation

Clinical and radiological investigation

The patient was a female who was diagnosed with JDMS at age 3 years. The patient had been treated with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate, but had persistent disease activity and developed multiple calcinoses and joint contractures, although without dactylitis or arthritis. At age 9 years, the patient moved from Central America to the United States to obtain further medical care. Her JDMS proved highly resistant to therapy, with new calcifications appearing even after therapy with pulsed corticosteroids, high-dose oral prednisone, methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and rituximab. Additional medications had included probenecid, diltiazem, colchicine, and atovaquone. At age 14, shortly after completing a course of cyclophosphamide and a trip to Central America, she presented with atraumatic fusiform swelling and tenderness of the right fourth finger and left fifth toe (Figure 1 A and B). Skin examination revealed white, scaling, erythematous plaques on the knuckles (Figure 1 A), frontal and occipital scalp, and bilateral dorsal forearms (Figure 1 C). A scalp biopsy showed psoriasiform dermatitis (Figure 1 D), supporting the clinical diagnosis of psoriasis.

Representative skin findings, here an annular plaque from right forearm characterized by erythema and overlying silvery scale, consistent with psoriasis. D. Scalp biopsy showing psoriasiform dermatitis, characterized by hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and neutrophils within the stratum corneum and spinous layer (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification, 400×).

Due to the concern over possible infectious dactylitis, including tuberculous, the patient underwent an unusually comprehensive evaluation. Chest radiograph, purified protein derivative test, sputum acid fast stain, and sputum mycobacterium culture were negative. Radiographs of the right hand and left foot showed soft tissue swelling of the right fourth digit and left fifth toe, without erosions or periosteal reaction (Figure 2 A-C). Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the left fifth toe revealed swelling and contrast enhancement at the flexor tendon insertion with associated bone marrow edema, consistent with enthesitis, in the absence of either synovitis or tenosynovitis (Figure 3).

IBD and psoriasis

Epidemiology

IBD and psoriasis are both chronic relapsing disabling IMIDs showing a wide spectrum of manifestations among affected individuals.

The phenotypes of IBD traditionally involve UC, characterized by mucosal colonic inflammation continuously and with different extensions from the rectum, and CD, which causes transmural inflammation discontinuously and theoretically affects any part of the gastrointestinal tract, even if terminal ileum and colon are the most frequent involved sites.

On the other hand, psoriasis is a chronic papulosquamous skin disease involving several phenotypes, with chronic plaque or psoriasis vulgaris being its most common form (90% of all cases). Psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques covered by silvery lamellar scales, anatomically symmetric and mainly localized in extensor sides of the knees and elbows, in the lumbosacral region, and in the scalp. Furthermore, psoriasis consists of other less common forms including guttate (2% of all cases), erythrodermic (2%–3%), and pustular psoriasis. Erythrodermic is a severe form of psoriasis and may be potentially life-threateningsince it impairs the thermoregulatory capacity of the skin; any form of psoriasis, during a flare, may become erythrodermic. Other forms of psoriasis are "inverse or flexural" (involving skin folds and intertriginous areas), palmoplantar, sebopsoriasis, and nail psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that is associated with joint, psychiatric, and cardiovascular comorbidities. Diagnosis of plaque psoriasis is dependent primarily on characteristic physical findings and history. Given the varied clinical presentations of psoriasis and its mimicry to other papulosquamous skin diseases, it may be difficult for nondermatologists to diagnose psoriasis. Currently, no diagnostic criteria for plaque psoriasis have been validated in clinical studies. In this paper, we provide diagnostic guidelines for the nondermatologist to aid them in recognizing psoriasis.

Ten days following her ED visit, she developed redness of both her eyes which was associated with grittiness, blurring of vision and photophobia. She was seen by an ophthalmologist who diagnosed her with bilateral acute anterior uveitis and referred the patient to a rheumatologist for possible seronegative arthritis given her polyarthritis.

At her private rheumatologist review a week later, the patient was noted to have a psoriasiform rash over her upper limbs, hairline and scalp with florid synovitis in both ankles and knees. A diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy was made, and the patient was given oral methotrexate 10 mg weekly and prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, to which she had a good clinical response. Prednisolone was subsequently tapered off over a 2-week period.

She returned to the rheumatology clinic a month later with new-onset deep-seated pain over the lower thoracic spine with radiation to both T8 dermatomes, as well as a right hypochondrial ache and fullness, which persisted throughout the day, disturbed her sleep and failed to respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She was noted to have tender hepatomegaly without any stigmata of chronic liver disease, as well as point tenderness over the T10 and T12 vertebral bodies. An abdominal CT scan demonstrated multiple hypodense lesions in the liver with no enhancement in the resting phase. Lung cuts captured bilateral lymphadenopathy. Methotrexate was stopped immediately.

The patient was referred to our hospital for further management and evaluation due to suspicions of a diagnosis of metastatic cancer of unknown origin. After admission, she was initially referred to the palliative medicine service for symptom control and consideration of hospice care. As her diagnostic liver biopsy demonstrated non-caseating granulomata, however, decision was made for further evaluation of her lesions and clinical presentation. A rheumatology consultation was sought in view of a possible diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and this subsequently led to further investigations and additional clinical history and physical findings as outlined below.

Past medical history

The patient had no significant past medical and surgical history of note. She denies any personal history of tuberculosis and malignancies in the past. She also denies having had recurrent infections in the past.

Social history

The patient is married and has a son. She is working as a case manager at a children's home. She has no previous smoking habits and is teetotal. With regards to her sexual history, the patient had only one sexual partner.

Case report

A 32-year-old woman with a 25-year history of chronic plaque psoriasis presented with a vesiculopustular rash. Her psoriasis had been well-controlled with topical treatment and phototherapy. At her last clinic visit 2 months before presentation, psoriasis was limited to < 5% total body surface area, primarily involving the extensor surfaces of the extremities (including elbows and knees). Three days before presentation, she developed fever and a sore throat. The following day, she developed scattered vesicles on the extensor aspects of the extremities. The fever and sore throat resolved 2 days after onset; however, the rash continued to develop. She presented with mildly erythematous, minimally scaly papules and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs (Fig 1). Within these plaques, scattered 3- to 5-mm vesicles, few pustules, and crusted erosions were observed. A few erythematous papules were visualized on the palms and fingertips. No oral lesions were observed. She complained of early pruritus and subsequent burning pain. Sick contacts included her daughter, who developed fever on the same day as the patient, a rash 1 week later, and who was subsequently diagnosed with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD).

Differential diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) — additional mimickers include psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, and mycoses fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Psoriasis plaques typically have dry, thin, silvery-white, or micaceous scale and show Auspitz sign with tiny punctate bleeding after scale removal. Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with genetic predisposition for gluten sensitivity, symmetrically grouped papules and vesicles, and direct immunofluorescence showing granular IgA at dermal papillae. Mycoses fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma presents with patches with a thin, wrinkled quality, is often on the lower trunk and buttocks, and requires cutaneous biopsy for confirmation.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Scalp psoriasis — treatment challenges and formulation considerations are outlined for topical therapy. Psoriasis frequently manifests initially on the scalp, and the presence of hair makes the use of ointments and cream-based products particularly difficult and messy; the recent availability of shampoo, gel, solution, oil, foam, and other formulations has allowed for easier to use and more acceptable scalp therapies. Scalp psoriasis remains one of the most frustrating, difficult to manage, and resistant forms of the disease, and this is not easily explained by poor penetration because the normal scalp has a weak barrier function compared with normal-appearing skin. Koebnerization of the scalp from repetitive scratching frequently leads to unilateral fixed, well-circumscribed hypertrophic plaques, causing further difficulties in control with resistance to therapy aggravated by poor adherence related to time restraints, frustration, and lack of clinical response.

### Psoriasiform pemphigus foliaceus in an African American female: an important clinical manifestation [^113NyPTP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old African-American woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a pruritic eruption of 3 years' duration. On clinical examination, the patient had well-demarcated, pink, atrophic plaques and superficial erosions over the inframammary folds and mid-chest. She also had well-demarcated, hyperpigmented, hyperkeratotic scaly plaques over the abdomen, suprapubic region, elbows, knees, and back with sporadic small superficial blisters. A punch biopsy of the right abdomen was performed and revealed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, focal parakeratosis, and acantholysis throughout the superficial spinous and granular layers. Only a sparse inflammatory infiltrate was present in the underlying dermis. Clinical and histological findings supported the diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus (PF), but psoriasis was included in the differential diagnosis due to the presence of discrete plaques with an erythematous border. We hypothesize that patients with psoriasiform presentations of PF may be misdiagnosed with plaque psoriasis. It is important to distinguish between PF and psoriasis as there is evidence that ultraviolet light, a common treatment for psoriasis, may exacerbate PF. We document and highlight this atypical psoriasiform presentation of PF in a patient with skin of color to raise awareness and improve diagnosis and outcomes. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(4):471–473. </em>.

### What is new in cutaneous T cell lymphoma? [^115Z4Bgu]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignancy caused by the accumulation of neoplastic lymphocytes in the skin. CTCL is considered a rare disease with an incidence of 0.96 per 100,000. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) defines CTCL subtypes according to organ involvement, histopathological characteristics, and prognosis. The main subtypes mycosis fungoides (MF), Sézary syndrome (SS), and CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) account for 75–80% of all cases. The clinical presentation of CTCL is heterogeneous (Fig. 1). MF ranges from isolated lesions, classified as patches, plaques, or tumors, to systemic manifestation with blood involvement. The most aggressive variant SS has a leukemic presentation with Sézary cells in the blood and lymph nodes. In SS, the whole skin is usually involved, which presents clinically as a generalized erythroderma.

Clinical presentation in CTCL. A Indurated, erythematous alopecia plaques on the scalp of a patient with Sézary syndrome, B erythematous patches with alopecia on the scapula in a patient with mycosis fungoides, C erythroderma with fine scaling in a patient with Sézary syndrome

Variability of clinical presentation and diagnostic uncertainty of these rare diseases often lead to a delayed diagnosis of CTCL. The diagnosis of CTCL is based on the integration of clinical presentations, histology, and molecular analysis. Our understanding of the pathogenesis and prognosis of CTCL, as well as treatment options, is constantly evolving. This review will focus on recent updates in diagnosis and prognosis, pathogenesis and translational research, and established and novel treatment options.

### Cutaneous macroglobulinosis with waldenströM macroglobulinemia [^112koSD6]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma associated with monoclonal IgM gammopathy. It represents approximately 2% of all hematologic malignancies. It is more common in men, with a median age of 60 to 70 years. The disease is characterized by an indolent course in most patients, with a median survival of about 5 years. IgM paraprotein can cause various symptoms resulting from systemic amyloidosis, paraprotein depositions in the organs, cryoglobulinemia, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperviscosity syndrome.

Tichenor et al first described cutaneous macroglobulinosis in 1978 as macroglobulinemia cutis. Most reported presentations are skin-colored and pink papules, sometimes with central crust, on the knees, buttocks, and extensor aspects of the extremities. Uncommon clinical presentations of nodules, plaques, or ulcerated lesions along with involvement of the trunk, face, neck, and scalp were occasionally reported.

Patients can develop CM before, concurrent with, or — as in our reported case — after diagnosis of the underlying lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Hence, CM can predict a latent plasma cell dyscrasia before any other clinical or pathologic evidence.

Nine previous case reports exist of CM that developed in patients after WM was diagnosed (Table I). Of these 9 cases, only one female case was reported, and this makes our case the second reported female case of CM in a patient with a history of WM. Our case had peripheral neuropathy, which is also a rare association with CM. The development of neuropathy is thought to be related to the accumulation of IgM in myelin sheaths. A unique clinical finding in our case is the involvement of the eyelids, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in any case of CM.

### Verrucous psoriasis: a distinctive clinicopathologic variant of psoriasis [^112AbTfS]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is capable of presenting in a variety of clinical and pathologic guises including a rarely described variant variably termed hypertrophic or verrucous psoriasis. Herein, we describe the clinical and pathologic attributes of a large series of patients with this unusual variant of psoriasis and distinguish it from other entities in the differential diagnosis. The histopathologic features and clinical and demographic attributes of a series of 12 cases from 12 patients were reviewed by a single dermatopathologist (MM). The 12 patients consisted of 7 males and 5 females with an average age of 61.8 years (males 38–93 years, females 41–71 years). Eight of the patients were Caucasian, 3 Hispanic and 1 African-American. Six of the lesions were located on the knees, 4 involved the elbows, and 2 were seen on the dorsum of the hands (metacarpal-phalangeal joint). The clinical appearance of the lesions consisted of flesh-toned to white mammillated plaques (8 cases) and coalesced papules (4 cases). Each of the biopsies showed regular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and either spongiform neutrophilic or Munro micro-abscesses. In addition, each showed papillomatosis with bowing of the peripheral rete ridges toward the center of the lesion (buttressing). At high power, epidermal neutrophils were seen in particular surmounting the tips of the suprapapillary plates with accompanying serum. Hypergranulosis and koilocytic change were not observed in any of the lesions. Human papilloma virus (HPV) immunostaining and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) special staining for fungi were negative. Verrucous psoriasis is a distinctive variant of psoriasis with overlapping clinical and pathologic features that might prompt consideration of verruca vulgaris. The presence of epidermal papillomatosis and epidermal buttressing seen in these lesions is reminiscent of the histologic features of verruca vulgaris. Similarly, the presence of coalesced papules might prompt clinical consideration of verruca vulgaris as well. It is likely that this under recognized clinicopathologic entity represents a patterned response of the epithelium to repeated trauma/irritation typical of the anatomic locations that were encountered in this series. Recognition of this entity should preempt confusion with verruca vulgaris or other entities capable of producing wart-like epidermal changes.

### Erythema multiforme after initiation of anti interleukin-12 / 23 (ustekinumab) treatment for plaque psoriasis [^113KfZrm]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of indurated erythematous plaques covered by silvery desquamative scales, usually involving knees, elbows, trunk and scalp. Therapeutic options include topical treatments, phototherapy, traditional systemic agents and novel biologic agents. The biologic drug ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We report a case of a patient treated with ustekinumab for chronic plaque psoriasis who went on to have erythema multiforme (EM). EM has been reported in connection with tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors, including etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. To our knowledge, this is the first case in medical literature reporting EM occurring subsequently to ustekinumab treatment for psoriasis.

### Cutaneous features of adams-oliver syndrome: diagnosis, differentiation, and management [^111q1CoX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4.1 Aplasia Cutis Congenita

The most characteristic cutaneous manifestation of AOS is ACC, a rare congenital defect marked by the absence of the epidermis, dermis, and occasionally subcutaneous tissue (Figure 1). A review of 75 reports in the literature (Tables S1 and S2), included based on the authors' report of AOS, demonstrated the presence of ACC in 92% of patients, a prevalence slightly higher than the previously reported range of 75%–85%.

FIGURE 1
Two discrete circular patches of alopecia in a 2‐year‐old female with Adams‐Oliver syndrome.

In AOS, ACC most commonly affects the vertex of the scalp but has also been reported over the parietooccipital, frontotemporal, midline, and fontanelle regions. Less frequently, ACC involves extracephalic sites such as the trunk, knees, and palms. At birth, ACC appears as a well‐demarcated area of absent skin, circular or irregular, with a membranous, erythematous, or ulcerated surface. Lesion sizes vary significantly, from small areas under 1 cm to extensive defects covering the entire scalp. Nearly half of the reviewed AOS cases (46%) exhibited calvarial defects, many complicated by ulceration, hemorrhage, and dilated scalp veins, increasing the risk of secondary infections and long‐term morbidity. However, this high prevalence may reflect reporting bias, as more severe or dramatic cases are more likely to be published.

Case report

Case 1

A 50-year-old man with a diagnosis of psoriasis from his 2 previous dermatologists presented to our clinic for a third opinion. His treatment history included topical steroids, secukinumab (Cosentyx), tildrakizumab (Ilumya/Ilumetri), and, most recently, ixekizumab (Taltz). On initial examination, his palms and soles were diffusely red and hyperkeratotic with deep fissures of the fingertips and irregular pitting of his fingernails. The patient reported previous involvement of his scalp and glans penis. Because he was only 4 weeks into ixekizumab therapy when he presented to us, he agreed to a full 3-month trial while adding oral methotrexate 15 mg/wk.

At his 2-month follow-up, the patient reported a new, itchy, red rash involving his suprapubic skin and flanks. Two shave biopsies from his suprapubic skin and back showed spongiosis with abundant eosinophils. The working diagnosis was an IL-17-induced eczematous dermatitis versus superimposed ACD. The patient declined patch testing and elected to be treated with intramuscular triamcinolone 80 mg while increasing methotrexate to 20 mg/wk.

At his 3-month follow-up, the patient reported that his rash was worsening, spreading now to his scalp and hands. Ixekizumab and methotrexate were discontinued, and dupilumab was initiated. Three months into treatment, patient was at least 90% improved with some residual skin thickening of his palms and peeling of his fingertips without a relapse of his psoriasis. Nine months after starting dupilumab, the patient in whom classic psoriasiform plaques had developed on the scalp, face, elbows, knees, thighs, intergluteal cleft, and glans penis, affecting approximately 5% of his body surface area (Fig 1). A shave biopsy was performed on his left flank, which demonstrated changes consistent with psoriasis.

### A nonhealing scalp ulceration in a patient with a history of herpes zoster infection [^111DVhMF]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 63-year-old male smoker presented with a nonhealing, enlarging wound on his right parietal scalp and an associated 2-month history of pruritus and "needle-like" pains. Medical history was significant for a herpes zoster eruption in the same area 7 months prior, treated with acyclovir. Examination found right-sided facial asymmetry with alopecia of the eyebrow, a sharply demarcated scalp ulceration with exposed periosteum, an angulated erosion at the anterior border of the ulcer, and another angulated erosion over the right medial eyebrow (Figs 1 and 2). Laboratory values showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The patient's vital signs and the remainder of systemic examination were unremarkable.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Recurrent herpes zoster infection
B. Basal cell carcinoma
C. Temporal arteritis
D. Pyoderma gangrenosum
E. Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS)

Answers:
A. Recurrent herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. Recurrent infection with herpes zoster is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals and does not produce the ulcerations and disfigurement seen in this patient.
B. Basal cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although basal cell carcinoma is common on the head and neck and may present as an ulcerative plaque if untreated, the clinically sharp, angulated margins make this diagnosis unlikely.
C. Temporal arteritis – Incorrect. Temporal arteritis is a systemic vasculitis that commonly presents with headache and jaw claudication, not seen in this patient. Additionally, cutaneous manifestations are rare.
D. Pyoderma gangrenosum – Incorrect. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis that initially presents as a papule and rapidly develops into an ulcer with overhanging violaceous borders. It most commonly affects the trunk or lower extremities and is regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion.
E. TTS – Correct. This patient presents with altered sensation and self-induced trauma after trigeminal nerve injury from a previous varicella zoster infection. TTS can result from trigeminal nerve or brainstem nuclei damage, most commonly from iatrogenic causes, but other causes include herpes infection, stroke, or trauma. Nerve injury results in paresthesia, prompting patients to reflexively scratch the affected area and cause self-induced ulcerations. The patient's history of a prior herpes zoster infection in the same dermatomal distribution as the presenting ulcerations along with neuropathic pain is consistent with TTS. TTS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and laboratory tests and biopsies are often ordered to differentiate it from other dermatologic diseases.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^113t7izH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 3% (7.4 million) of the adult population in the United States (Rachakonda, Schupp, & Armstrong, 2014). The pathogenesis of psoriasis is characterized by increased production of inflammatory cytokines that cause hyperkeratosis (Lowes, Suárez‐Fariñas, & Krueger, 2014). Briefly, interleukin (IL)‐23 and IL‐12 are produced by myeloid dendritic cells, and these cytokines activate naïve T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells, which then produce cytokines responsible for the development of psoriatic plaques such as IL‐17, IL‐22, tumor necrosis factor‐α, and interferon‐γ (Lowes et al. 2014). Cutaneous lesions most commonly develop on the elbows, knees, scalp, umbilicus, and lumbar regions, and are typically characterized by erythematous plaques covered with silvery‐white scales, termed chronic plaque psoriasis (Schön & Boehncke, 2005). Less frequently, psoriasis can occur on the nails (23–27%), face (49%), palms and soles (12–16%), or intertriginous regions (21–30%), and management of psoriasis in these areas can be challenging (Canpolat, Cemil, Eskioğlu, & Akis, 2008; Merola, Li, Li, Cho, & Qureshi, 2016).

### Hemorrhagic herpes zoster with contralateral multidermatomal distribution associated with rivaroxaban: an unusual presentation [^114qh8k1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 90-year-old man presented with painful purpuric and bullous lesions of the left occipital, parietal, and temporal scalp (Fig 1), as well as non-hemorrhagic painful vesicles of the left neck (Fig 2) and mixed hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic vesicles of the right knee (Fig 3), all of 5 days duration.

Fig 1
Purpuric herpes zoster lesions were visible on the left occipital, parietal, and temporal scalp along the C2 and V3 dermatomes.

Fig 2
Herpes zoster lesions were visible in the C3 dermatome on the left lower aspect of the neck.

Fig 3
Purpuric and typical vesicular herpes zoster lesions were visible in the L3 dermatome on the medial aspect of the right knee.

Recent history was significant for excision with clear margins of an atypical fibroxanthoma of the vertex of the scalp 6 months prior to the onset of the eruption, followed by adjunctive radiation, which was completed 2 months prior to the onset of the eruption. Radiation of a total dose of 60 Gy was completed on July 9, with zoster developing on September 7.

Medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, which developed after the atypical fibroxanthoma excision, necessitating the initiation of rivaroxaban for anticoagulation. The patient denied any recent history of fever, chills, abdominal pain, neurologic deficits, recent weight loss, and cough. His only medications were rivaroxaban and bimatoprost ophthalmic drops. Complete blood counts, hepatic profile, and electrolytes were within normal limits.

With the classic features of dermatomal pain and vesicles of recent onset, a clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster was made. Due to the atypical nature of the eruption, with the purpuric and nodular appearance of the scalp lesions and the presence of the lesions in multiple distant dermatomes, confirmatory biopsies of the scalp, neck, and knee lesions were performed.

He commenced valacyclovir 1 g 3 times per day for 7 days, gabapentin, and prednisone 40 mg daily on September 10, beginning a 12-day taper on September 14, which was completed on the September 26. The gabapentin was discontinued after one dose of 300 mg due to sedation, but the patient remained on valacyclovir and prednisone. The anticoagulant was not held during treatment. Seven days after clinic visit he was pain-free and most of the bullae had crusted over. The patient was totally healed by September 22, 17 days from onset of eruption and 12 days from initial clinic visit.

Patients are often diagnosed according to the presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other tumors in the brain and spinal cord. In children, NF2 can present early with ocular findings and cutaneous tumors. We report here a 9-year-old girl who presented with multiple pigmented, slightly tender plaques on her scalp, face, and back that were revealed by histopathology to be plexiform schwannomas. We suspected NF2 and sent the patient's blood for genetic testing, which confirmed our diagnosis.

### Psoriasis epidemiology screening tool (PEST): a report from the GRAPPA 2009 annual meeting [^115Tmxk7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool for psoriatic arthritis (PEST)" for psoriasis.

The Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) is a clinical calculator used to screen for psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis, a condition that features red patches of skin topped with silvery scales. The PEST calculator is designed to identify patients who may have psoriatic arthritis but have not yet been diagnosed, allowing for earlier intervention and treatment.

The PEST calculator is applicable to patients with psoriasis, particularly those with a long history of the disease, as the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis increases over time. The clinical utility of this calculator is to facilitate early detection of psoriatic arthritis, which can help prevent or slow down joint damage and disability.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the PEST calculator. However, it should be noted that a positive PEST score does not confirm a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, but rather indicates a need for further evaluation by a rheumatologist.

The Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) for psoriatic arthritis is a screening tool that evaluates the likelihood of a patient meeting the criteria for psoriatic arthritis based on their responses to five specific questions. Each response is quantitatively assessed, contributing to a composite score used to interpret the results.

The tool incorporates the following five questions:

1. Have you ever had a swollen joint or joints?
2. Has a doctor ever told you that you have arthritis?
3. Do your fingernails or toenails have holes or pits?
4. Have you had pain in your heel?
5. Have you had a finger or toe that was completely swollen and painful for no apparent reason?

Each question requires a "Yes" or "No" response. "Yes" corresponds to a score of 1, while "No" corresponds to a score of 0. Below is the scoring schema for each response to the questions:

| **Question** | **Yes** | **No** |
|-|-|-|
| Have you ever had a swollen joint or joints? | 1 | 0 |
| Has a doctor ever told you that you have arthritis? | 1 | 0 |
| Do your fingernails or toenails have holes or pits? | 1 | 0 |
| Have you had pain in your heel? | 1 | 0 |
| Have you had a finger or toe that was completely swollen and painful for no apparent reason? | 1 | 0 |

The total score is calculated by summing the individual scores from each of the five questions. The total score can range from 0 to 5. Based on the total score, the interpretation is provided as follows:

- If the total score is 3 or more, this suggests the person meets the criteria for psoriatic arthritis.
- If the total score is less than 3, it indicates that the criteria for psoriatic arthritis are not met.

### Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: immunological aspects and therapeutic guidelines [^114LDHei]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects 1–3% of the European population. Chronic plaque psoriasis, the commonest form of the condition - affecting the majority of patients - usually manifests as red, heavily scaled plaques on elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but any skin surface may be affected. Psoriasis is associated with an inflammatory sero-negative arthritis, namely "psoriatic arthritis", in approximately 15%of patients with psoriasis and occurs more commonly in people with inflammatory bowel disease such as patients with Crohn's disease. Several studies have demonstrated the role of genetic predisposition, innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. There is considerable evidence that innate immunity and specifically a dysregulation of the innate immune response is central to the development of psoriasis. The role of TNFalpha is particularly intriguing. The evidence includes further observations that a variety of anti-TNF approaches such as monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins of soluble TNF receptors are effective therapies both in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this review, in addition to pathogenetic aspects, some preliminary guidelines for the use of anti-TNFalpha therapy in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis will be discussed.

### Clinical characteristics, symptoms and burden of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in adults [^112p2FvU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is debate as to whether psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) belong to the same disease spectrum.

Objectives

To describe and compare disease characteristics, lifestyle factors and disease burden in adult patients with psoriasis and AD.

Methods

We linked registry data with clinical and patient-reported outcomes from the Danish Skin Cohort, containing 3348 and 3834 adults with dermatologist-verified psoriasis or AD respectively, and 2946 adults from the general population.

Results

The participants were predominantly women and middle-aged. Patients with psoriasis mostly reported disease onset throughout adulthood, but with a distinct early incidence peak in those with a positive family history or severe disease. AD predominantly began in childhood, with only a very discrete incidence peak in adulthood. Scalp, extremity, chest and abdomen involvement was common to both diseases. Scalp/hairline, elbows, nails, intergluteal cleft, umbilicus, knees and legs were most frequently affected in patients with psoriasis. In AD, periocular, neck, antecubital fossae, back of the hands, interdigital areas and popliteal fossae were commonly affected. Patients with psoriasis (but not AD) were generally more overweight, obese and physically inactive, and had a positive smoking history, compared with the general population. Patients with both diseases experienced more frequent flares with increasing disease severity. Patients generally displayed uncontrolled disease despite being on systemic therapies. Itch and skin pain were much more severe in patients with AD, whereas joint pain was more common in patients with psoriasis.

Conclusions

We identified important similarities and differences in the clinical characteristics of adults with psoriasis and AD; these should help clinicians to prioritize and improve patient management. What's already known about this topic? Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in adults are increasingly being compared, and there is discussion as to whether they are part of the same disease spectrum. What does this study add? In this comparative study, patient-reported disease burden was markedly higher in atopic dermatitis than in psoriasis, whereas lifestyle-associated cardiometabolic risk factors were more frequent in psoriasis. In both disease groups, the condition in the majority of patients was uncontrolled even while they were on systemic therapy. The contrasting presentations highlight that these diseases are two distinct and different entities rather than belonging to the same spectrum.

Cutis verticis gyrata is a descriptive term for a condition of the scalp consisting of deep grooves and convolutions that resemble the surface of the brain. We present a case of a 22-year-old man who presented with pain and swelling of both knees and hands. Enlarged wrists, ankles and feet were also noted, along with facial seborrhoea, thickening of the skin and deformity of the fingers. Physical examination of the scalp showed a cerebriform appearance with accentuating folds and deep furrows (cutis verticis gyrata), thickening in the face, frontal and parietal regions. Bone enlargement of the hands, knees, ankles and feet was also found. Secondary causes of pachydermoperiostosis were negative.

### Split fingernails, underdeveloped thumbnails, and triangular lunulae [^1157TjEs]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of split nails. His medical history was notable for bilateral elbow surgeries. On physical examination, it was noted that the patient had split nails of his index fingernails and underdevelopment of his thumbnails (Fig 1). All his fingernails, except for the thumbnails, had triangular lunulae.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Darier disease
B. Lichen planus (LP)
C. Nail-patella syndrome (NPS)
D. Pachyonychia congenita
E. Psoriasis

Answers:
A. Darier disease – Incorrect. Darier disease primarily affects keratinization, leading to hyperkeratotic and warty plaques in a seborrheic distribution. It also manifests with nail changes, including longitudinal red and white streaks, as well as distinct V-shaped notching of the distal nail plate, which may mimic the splitting and cracking seen in the nails of patients with NPS.
B. LP – Incorrect. LP is characterized by violaceous, pruritic papules, and plaques with Wickham striae. LP of the nail classically causes trachyonychia and dorsal pterygium.
C. NPS – Correct. NPS, also known as hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia or Fong disease, typically presents with abnormalities in the nails and the bones of knees, elbows, and pelvis. Nails may be absent, underdeveloped, split, or ridged with pathognomonic triangular lunulae. Bony abnormalities include absent or hypoplastic patellae, radial head dysplasia, and iliac bone exostoses.
D. Pachyonychia congenita – Incorrect. Pachyonychia congenita presents with oral leukokeratosis, palmoplantar keratoderma, and thickened nails with subungual hyperkeratosis. In contrast, NPS is marked by dystrophic nails, triangular lunulae, and skeletal deformities.
E. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis is a skin condition that characteristically presents with well-circumscribed, erythematous, and scaly plaques. Psoriasis can affect nails with varying presentations, including irregular pitting, oil drop spots, and onycholysis. Psoriasis affecting the nail does not present with triangular lunulae.

### Management of psoriasis as a systemic disease: what is the evidence? [^1178mnT9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is an immune‐mediated, chronic inflammatory condition affecting approximately 3% of adults and 0.1% of children and adolescents in the U.S. A. 1, 2 It is characterized by well‐demarcated, erythematous plaques covered by silvery‐white scales, typically occurring in a symmetrical distribution involving the elbows, knees, trunk and scalp. 3 Psoriasis onset is triggered when genetic and/or environmental factors activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, resulting in the production of numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, interferon (IFN)‐γ, interleukin (IL)‐17, IL‐22, IL‐23 and IL‐1β. 4 Many of these cytokines stimulate keratinocyte hyperproliferation, which perpetuates a cycle of chronic inflammation. 5

In moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis, elevated levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines are found not only in skin lesions, but also in the blood. 6, 7, 8, 9 Systemic elevations in these cytokines promote chronic subclinical inflammation (asymptomatic inflammation that can cause tissue damage over time) associated with comorbidities that disproportionately affect patients with psoriasis, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Table 1). 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Table 1
Comorbidities associated with psoriasis

It is hypothesized that early systemic treatment targeting proinflammatory cytokines associated with psoriasis pathogenesis will not only improve cutaneous symptoms but also reduce systemic inflammation, hence improving long‐term outcomes through mitigation of comorbidity progression. 15 This review explores the pathophysiological relationship between psoriasis and its common comorbidities, and discusses the need for new treatment paradigms that include strategies to reduce the effects of systemic inflammation in moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis.

### Image-based artificial intelligence in psoriasis assessment: the beginning of a new diagnostic era? [^113iof2h]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science concerned with replicating human cognitive functions and analyzing large amounts of data. As a field with primarily visual diagnoses and a large patient base, dermatology has recently experienced one of the most rapid developments in medical AI applications, particularly in the area of computer-guided image classification. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for melanoma detection has provided groundbreaking work, as algorithms have shown great potential to improve human accuracy in the dignity assessment of melanocytic lesions. For example, in a study by Haenssle et al. comparing the diagnostic performance of 58 international dermatologists with a CNN in melanoma detection using dermoscopic images, most dermatologists were outperformed by the algorithm. In a real-world setting, the combination of human and artificial intelligence, or augmented intelligence, has been shown to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of melanocytic lesions by integrating CNN classification into clinical decision making. Naturally, these advancements in the early recognition of skin cancer have spurred research into CNN applications for other dermatoses, such as psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a common chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 2–3% of the general population worldwide. Onset can occur at any age and the disease is not yet curable. Clinical presentation is variable and may include palmo-plantar, scalp, intertriginous, and nail involvement. Plaque psoriasis most commonly presents with sharply demarcated, silvery, erythrosquamous plaques on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees and the lumbosacral region (Fig. 1 A). Other less common subtypes, such as erythrodermic (Fig. 1 B) or guttate psoriasis (Fig. 1 C), as well as genetically and phenotypically distinct pustular psoriasis (Fig. 1 D), add to the diagnostic complexity. Since psoriasis is typically diagnosed visually and is easily photographed by healthcare providers and patients, the resulting image repositories lend themselves to analysis by AI. In addition to cutaneous manifestations, patients are susceptible to multiple comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthritis and cardiometabolic syndrome, and most patients experience a decrease in quality of life, with an associated higher risk of developing depression.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis
B. Erythrasma
C. Tinea corporis and cruris
D. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV)
E. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK)

Answers:
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis – Incorrect. This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by episodic/seasonal circinate, erythematous plaques with scaling, and centrifugal peeling. It predominantly involves palms and soles and may extend up the extremities. It rarely involves the trunk and face. Blisters occasionally occur in the center of new plaques.
B. Erythrasma – Incorrect. Erythrasma is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum overgrowth in the stratum corneum. Well-defined scaly plaques involve intertriginous sites of the trunk and toes. Coral red fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is classic and was negative in this patient's case.
C. Tinea corporis and cruris – Incorrect. Tinea corporis and cruris are dermatophyte infections of the trunk, extremities, and groin, respectively. Classic lesions have advancing, scaly border and central clearing. Hyphae are seen on histopathology and potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH prep).
D. EKV – Correct. EKV, an autosomal dominant disorder, presents with transient erythematous patches and stable hyperkeratosis. Individual erythematous lesions persist for minutes to hours, although they may last for days. Simultaneously or over time hyperkeratosis evolves. Sharply demarcated, yellow-brown to pink-brown plaques with figurate borders progressively develop on the limbs, buttocks, and trunk in nearly symmetrical distribution. Histopathology shows orthokeratosis, basket-weave hyperkeratosis, moderate-to-severe acanthosis with prominent granular layer, papillomatosis, and dilated elongated capillaries with minimal perivascular inflammation in the papillary dermis.
E. PSEK – Incorrect. PSEK begins during infancy or early childhood with fixed, sharply demarcated polycyclic hyperkeratotic plaques on erythematous base with fine scale or a rough, verrucous surface. They are symmetrically distributed on extremities, buttocks, face, and occasionally the trunk. Transient erythema and relative sparing of the face differentiate EKV from PSEK.

### Concurrent superficial epidermolytic ichthyosis and generalized pustular psoriasis-report of a case, review of the literature, and a proposed pathophysiologic link [^117W826t]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Examination revealed numerous pinpoint pustules occurring on a background of erythema. In some areas, these coalesced into lakes of pus and were arranged in an annular configuration (Fig 1). There were numerous collarettes of scale noted. Examination of the scalp, nails and mucous membranes was normal. There was mild generalized xerosis, ill-defined hyperkeratotic plaques involving the knees and ichthyosiform scaling involving the lower legs (Fig 2).

Fig 1
Ill-defined and annular erythematous plaques with overlying pustules, lakes of pus, and crusting on the inner arms.

Fig 2
Hyperkeratotic plaques on the knees and ichthyosiform scaling on the legs.

A biopsy of the right forearm revealed a subcorneal pustule occurring in association with an acanthotic hyperorthokeratotic epidermis with a prominent granular layer containing large, irregularly shaped keratohyaline granules. These background changes were suggestive of an underlying disorder of keratinization, namely a keratinopathic ichthyosis. Direct immunofluorescence showed no significant uptake for IgG, IgA, IgM, or fibrin with non-specific and focal granular uptake of C3 in the basement membrane (Fig 3). Tissue stains and culture for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi were negative. The recurrent nature of the pustulation, lack of an implicated drug, nonspecific direct immunofluorescence findings and negative cultures favoured a diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis occurring in association with a keratinopathic ichthyosis. Specific keratinopathic ichthyoses considered in the differential diagnosis included SEI, epidermolytic ichthyosis and annular epidermolytic ichthyosis. The mild nature of the ichthyosis, and absence of keratoderma and psoriasiform scaling of the recurrent annular erythematous plaques favored a diagnosis of SEI. Genetic testing on a blood sample identified a pathogenic variant of the KRT2 gene, specifically c.1459G > A (p. Glu487Lys), confirming a diagnosis of superficial epidermolytic ichthyosis. Mutations in pustular psoriasis-associated genes IL36RN and CARD14 were not identified. Treatment with acitretin 25 mg daily resulted in the resolution of the pustular episodes within 1 week and significant improvement in the patient's ichthyosis at 1 month.

### Sweet syndrome in a patient with rectal adenocarcinoma and HIV following neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^115Q2ewt]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A man in his 40s with well-controlled HIV on antiretroviral therapy presented to the emergency department and was admitted for a 2-day history of fever, tender, erythematous plaques and pustules, and joint swelling. Seven months prior, he had been diagnosed with Stage IIIA rectal adenocarcinoma. He completed the last of 8 cycles of neoadjuvant capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy 9 days prior to admission. He never received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.

Physical exam revealed edematous dermal pink-to-red nodules studded with pustules located symmetrically on the scalp, posterior neck, and upper shoulders and back (Fig 1). Erythema, swelling, and decreased range of motion were noted most prominently in the right wrist, ankle, and knee.

Fig 1
Sweet syndrome. Pink, red plaques, and nodules on the posterior neck and scalp (A and B) and shoulders (C) with pustules on the upper arms (D) in a patient with Sweet syndrome.

The medicine team was initially concerned for septic arthritis. Blood cultures were drawn (resulted negative), and he was started on intravenous vancomycin. Initial labs revealed an elevated C-reactive protein to 135.2 (normal < 3.1 mg/dL) and a hemoglobin of 10.9 (normal 13.3–17.7 g/dL). Rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-nuclear antibodies, and uric acid levels were normal. An arthrocentesis of the right wrist did not result in any synovial fluid. Ertapenem was added due to no improvement. Infectious disease and rheumatology were then consulted with concern for an atypical infection or an adverse reaction to vancomycin. Antibiotics were switched to daptomycin and ceftriaxone and an arthrocentesis of the right knee was performed (bland fluid, negative culture, no crystals). X-ray of the bilateral hands/wrist and feet/ankles did not show signs of erosive changes. Despite antibiotics, the patient had persistent fevers, new erythematous plaques and pustules on his arms, and a rising C-reactive protein to 158.

### The biological basis of disease recurrence in psoriasis: a historical perspective and current models [^116UjoLV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Plaque‐type psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by thickened red plaques and silvery lamellar scales predominantly on the scalp, trunk and extensor surfaces. The prevalence is about 2–3% in Western countries. An increased understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying plaque formation has driven recent advances in psoriasis treatment. However, an intriguing characteristic of psoriasis is the tendency of lesions to recur in the same anatomical locations after therapy is discontinued following plaque resolution.

Available evidence supports the concept of a local immunological 'memory' in resolved sites after disappearance of visible inflammation. This review provides a historical narrative of the immunopathology of psoriasis lesion recurrence, including insights from emerging data on the molecular and cellular basis of disease memory in resolved psoriatic plaques.
