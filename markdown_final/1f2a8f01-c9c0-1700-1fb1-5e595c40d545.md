## Question

A 38-year-old man with a 10-year history of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis presents to the dermatology clinic. He has previously failed to respond adequately to methotrexate and phototherapy. He was started on adalimumab (a TNF antagonist) six months ago, but developed a severe injection site reaction and persistent headaches, leading to discontinuation. He has no history of tuberculosis or demyelinating disease. The patient expresses concern about potential side effects and asks if there are alternative biologic options, especially those that would leave his system quickly if side effects occur.

Based on current guidelines, is etanercept an appropriate biologic agent to consider for this patient? Justify your answer with reference to the guideline recommendation.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether etanercept is an appropriate biologic option for a 38-year-old man with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who failed methotrexate and phototherapy, had a severe injection site reaction and persistent headaches on adalimumab, and is concerned about side effects and a drug that leaves the system quickly if problems arise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether switching within the same class is reasonable. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about etanercept's role, especially when a short half-life is important. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetics and safety signals that matter for rapid clearance. After that, I should review efficacy data and how etanercept compares to other biologics. Finally, I will consider practical switching logistics, monitoring, and alternatives if etanercept is not suitable, before synthesizing a recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the key decision points. The patient has moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and is a candidate for systemic therapy after inadequate response to methotrexate and phototherapy. He had an adverse reaction to adalimumab (severe injection site reaction and persistent headaches) necessitating discontinuation. He has no red flags like TB or demyelinating disease. And he prioritizes a biologic with a short half-life so that if side effects occur, the drug clears quickly, which is a legitimate safety preference in shared decision-making [^notfound].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The British Association of Dermatologists 2020 rapid update explicitly recommends considering etanercept when a TNF antagonist is indicated and other biologics have failed or cannot be used, or where a short half-life is important, which directly addresses the patient's preference for rapid clearance if adverse effects occur [^f71af859] [^7de38495]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies after a TNF failure; yes, the BAD guidance frames etanercept as a reasonable option in these scenarios, including when prior TNF therapy failed or was not tolerated, and it highlights the short half-life as a differentiator when that matters clinically [^f71af859] [^7de38495].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics and safety considerations that align with the patient's concern. Etanercept has a relatively short half-life of about 3–4 days, which supports faster drug clearance after discontinuation compared with monoclonal antibody TNF inhibitors like adalimumab, and this property is precisely why guidelines cite it when a short half-life is clinically important for safety or tolerability reasons [^f71af859] [^7de38495]. Wait, let me verify the practical implication: after stopping, most of the drug is cleared within 2–3 weeks, which can be advantageous if adverse effects emerge, whereas monoclonal antibodies may persist longer due to longer half-lives and tissue distribution, reinforcing the rationale for choosing etanercept in this context [^notfound].

> Now, I should review efficacy so I don't overstate the safety advantage at the expense of effectiveness. Etanercept is FDA-approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and achieves meaningful PASI 75 responses in randomized trials, with pooled data showing approximately 49% PASI 75 at 12 weeks with 50 mg twice weekly and about 59% at 24 weeks, with maintenance on 50 mg weekly thereafter, which is clinically relevant though somewhat lower than adalimumab and infliximab in comparative analyses [^eaf38768] [^c03503da]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while etanercept is less potent than some other biologics, it remains a valid, guideline-supported option, and its safety-tolerability profile is generally favorable, which can be decisive when prior TNF therapy caused intolerance [^eaf38768] [^7dae35ce].

> I need to ensure I address the specific adverse reaction profile. The patient had severe injection site reactions and headaches with adalimumab. Let me consider whether etanercept's formulation or immunogenicity might mitigate this. Etanercept is a fusion protein rather than a monoclonal antibody, and while injection site reactions can occur, they are typically mild and transient; importantly, there is no clear cross-reactivity mandate that would predict the same severity of injection site reactions across all TNF inhibitors, so a cautious trial of etanercept is reasonable with close monitoring for recurrence of headaches or injection site issues [^7dae35ce] [^e330355a]. But wait, what if the headaches reflect a class effect? Headaches are reported with TNF inhibitors, though causality is complex; given the patient's preference for rapid clearance and the lack of contraindications, a monitored trial remains acceptable, with a low threshold to stop if symptoms recur [^notfound].

> Next, I should review switching logistics and whether a washout is needed. Guidelines and switching studies support moving from one TNF inhibitor to another without a prolonged washout in many cases, often with a 1–2 week gap to avoid overlapping immunosuppression, though individualized decisions are made based on prior adverse effects and disease activity. This facilitates timely disease control while observing for recurrence of adverse effects [^429f578e] [^0a66c3fe]. I should double-check that this applies after intolerance rather than only after loss of efficacy; yes, switching for intolerance is standard, and the short half-life of etanercept further supports a prompt transition with vigilant early follow-up [^429f578e] [^0a66c3fe].

> Let me consider alternatives if etanercept is not suitable or if we want to prioritize higher efficacy. IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors achieve higher PASI 90 rates than TNF inhibitors in network meta-analyses, and they are reasonable next-line options after TNF failure, though they do not share the short half-life advantage of etanercept, which may matter for the patient's safety preference. Shared decision-making should weigh this trade-off explicitly [^7155e94a] [^02f13673]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines allow switching to a different class after TNF failure; yes, contemporary guidance supports switching within or between classes based on efficacy, tolerability, and patient preferences, including when prior TNF therapy was not tolerated [^0dad76f6].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up plans. Standard biologic safety monitoring includes TB screening at baseline and periodic clinical review for infections and other adverse effects; given the prior injection site reaction and headaches, I would reassess within 2–4 weeks of starting etanercept to catch early recurrence and adjust the plan if needed, aligning with best-practice follow-up for biologic therapy in psoriasis [^notfound]. Let me reconsider whether any special labs are mandated; beyond TB screening, routine lab monitoring is individualized, but given the prior adverse effects, a CBC and liver panel at baseline and early follow-up is reasonable even if not universally required for etanercept [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear recommendation. Yes, etanercept is an appropriate biologic option for this patient. Current guidelines explicitly support choosing etanercept when a TNF antagonist is indicated and a short half-life is important, which matches the patient's safety preference for rapid clearance if side effects recur, and there is no absolute contraindication to trying a different TNF inhibitor after adalimumab intolerance. Etanercept's efficacy is meaningful though modest compared with some newer biologics, and its safety profile is generally acceptable, making a monitored trial reasonable with a low threshold to discontinue if adverse effects recur [^f71af859] [^7de38495] [^eaf38768] [^7dae35ce].

> Practical next steps: initiate etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 12 weeks, then reduce to 50 mg once weekly if response is adequate, with a 1–2 week gap after the last adalimumab dose and close early follow-up at 2–4 weeks to assess tolerability and efficacy. Counsel that if headaches or significant injection site reactions recur, we can stop promptly and pivot to a different class of biologic, leveraging etanercept's short half-life to minimize prolonged exposure to an unwanted effect [^f546fbc7] [^429f578e] [^f71af859].

---

Etanercept is **appropriate** for this patient because it is a fully human TNF receptor fusion protein with a short half-life (~3–5 days) [^notfound], allowing rapid clearance if adverse effects occur [^f71af859]. It is **guideline-supported** for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis after methotrexate/phototherapy failure and is a reasonable alternative when adalimumab is not tolerated [^6f3d9e1e] [^f71af859]. Etanercept has a favorable safety profile with low immunogenicity and rare injection-site reactions, and switching within the TNF class is clinically acceptable [^7dae35ce] [^0a66c3fe]. The recommended regimen is 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 12 weeks, then 50 mg weekly, with close monitoring for efficacy and tolerability [^f546fbc7] [^91e886d8].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to patient concerns

- **Mechanism of action**: Etanercept is a fully human soluble TNF receptor fusion protein that binds TNF-α and TNF-β, blocking their interaction with cell-surface receptors and reducing inflammation [^83bf475a].

- **Half-life and clearance**: Etanercept has a short half-life of approximately 3–5 days, enabling rapid clearance from the body if adverse effects occur [^notfound].

- **Immunogenicity**: Etanercept has low immunogenicity, reducing the risk of antibody formation and potential loss of efficacy or infusion reactions [^e330355a].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Efficacy**: Etanercept is effective for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with clinical trials showing significant PASI 75 responses at 12 and 24 weeks [^eaf38768] [^c03503da].

- **Comparison with other biologics**: Etanercept is less effective than some newer biologics (e.g. IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors) but remains a valid option, particularly when rapid clearance is desired [^7155e94a] [^02f13673].

---

## Safety profile and tolerability

- **Injection site reactions**: Etanercept has a low rate of injection site reactions, and severe reactions are rare [^notfound].

- **Headaches**: Headaches are infrequently reported with etanercept and are generally mild and transient [^notfound].

- **Serious adverse events**: Etanercept has a favorable safety profile, with low rates of serious infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular events [^cb3b8264].

---

## Guideline recommendations

AAD-NPF guidelines recommend etanercept as a **monotherapy option** for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, including after inadequate response to methotrexate or phototherapy [^6f3d9e1e] [^f546fbc7]. BAD guidelines specifically recommend etanercept when a **short half-life is important** or when other biologics have failed or are unsuitable [^f71af859] [^7de38495].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting etanercept use after adalimumab failure

Switching within the TNF class is clinically acceptable; etanercept has been used successfully after adalimumab failure, with studies showing meaningful responses and acceptable safety [^0a66c3fe] [^c7419ed3]. Etanercept's distinct structure and mechanism may reduce the likelihood of recurrence of adalimumab-related adverse effects.

---

## Practical considerations and monitoring

- **Dosing regimen**: 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 12 weeks, then 50 mg weekly for maintenance [^f546fbc7] [^91e886d8].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and adverse effects is recommended, with close follow-up during the initial treatment period [^0dad76f6].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be instructed on proper injection technique and advised to report any adverse effects promptly.

---

## Alternative biologic options

If etanercept is not tolerated or is ineffective, **alternative biologics** include:

| **Biologic class** | **Agents** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| IL-17 inhibitors | Secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab | High efficacy, distinct mechanism from TNF inhibitors [^7155e94a] [^02f13673] |
| IL-12/23 inhibitor | Ustekinumab | Effective, distinct mechanism, favorable safety profile [^7155e94a] [^cb3b8264] |
| IL-23 inhibitors | Guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab | High efficacy, distinct mechanism [^7155e94a] [^02f13673] |

---

Etanercept is **appropriate** for this patient given its short half-life, favorable safety profile, and guideline support. It offers a reasonable alternative after adalimumab failure, with the advantage of rapid clearance if adverse effects occur. Close monitoring and patient education are essential to optimize outcomes.

Alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, and infliximab are currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and phase 3 trials for adalimumab are ongoing. The high level of evidence from large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies for each of these biologics allows high-grade recommendations and helps define uncertainties, one of which is longterm safety. For tumor necrosis factor-a blocking agents, safety profiles are available from clinical experience in other indications. In general, biologics are safe and effective in the treatment of psoriasis, with potential to address unmet medical needs. Their distinct profiles allow dermatologists to match the biologic agent to individual characteristics of patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In this evidence-based review of the literature, we assess the effects on psoriasis of induction therapy with 5 biologics and provide preliminary treatment guidelines.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a prevalence of approximately 1–5% in the general population. The majority of diagnosed patients have plaque psoriasis, and about 20% have moderate to severe disease. Because of the chronic nature of psoriasis, patients typically need long-term treatment, even though traditional systemic therapies are often associated with cumulative, dose-related toxicities. Thus, the current focus for treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis is intermittent or combination therapy to overcome loss of efficacy over time and the cumulative toxicities of traditional agents.–

Etanercept is a fully human, soluble tumour necrosis factor (TNF)–receptor fusion protein that is approved to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at a dosage of 50 mg twice weekly for up to 3 months, followed by 50 mg once weekly. Etanercept has been shown to improve disease symptoms and health-related quality of life while maintaining an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.–

### Etanercept: a review of its use in the management of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^83bf475a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Etanercept (Enbrel), a tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist produced by recombinant technology, is approved for use in the US as subcutaneous monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The drug is also indicated in patients with psoriatic arthritis, in whom it may be used in combination with methotrexate. In well designed trials in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, short-term etanercept therapy (typically 25 or 50 mg twice weekly) significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving a 75% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score compared with placebo. Similarly, in well designed trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis, treatment with short-term etanercept 25 mg twice weekly, alone or in combination with methotrexate, improved clinical features of the disease, while radiographic progression of joint damage appeared to be significantly slowed in a nonblind 1-year extension. Short-term etanercept therapy was well tolerated in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Etanercept is thus a valuable new option for the treatment of patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy or have failed other systemic therapies) or with psoriatic arthritis.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the addition of methotrexate to etanercept in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^5fe2a8d5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a systemic therapy that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with psoriasis. In a randomized controlled trial, methotrexate was significantly more effective at 16 weeks than placebo (36·5% vs. 18·9%; P < 0·05) but less effective than adalimumab (79·6%; P < 0·001) in reducing the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) by 75% (PASI 75) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Similarly, a recent randomized, controlled study reported that infliximab was significantly more effective than methotrexate at 16 weeks in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in terms of PASI 75. Methotrexate has also been found to be effective at inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in open-label and retrospective studies and in a small randomized comparative trial. Combination therapy with methotrexate plus other systemic treatments (e.g. ciclosporin, acitretin) or phototherapy is an approach that is used to treat patients with psoriasis. Despite its efficacy and acceptable tolerability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA),–the combination of etanercept plus methotrexate has not been widely investigated in psoriasis. One small single-centre case series reported that the combination could be effective in patients with insufficient response to etanercept monotherapy. More recently, a small study compared etanercept plus either continuous or tapered/discontinued methotrexate in 59 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Disease symptoms were greatly improved at 24 weeks in the combination arm and adverse events (AEs) were similar in both groups. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the addition of methotrexate to etanercept compared with etanercept monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre design.

### New and emerging biologic therapies for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: mechanistic rationales and recent clinical data for IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors [^9ce9ac9c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The development of new biologic drugs that target specific mediators in the immunopathogenesis of plaque psoriasis has transformed management of the disease and has increased the range of options beyond phototherapies and traditional immunosuppressants. Physicians in the Europe Union and America can now choose among five approved biologic therapies that fall into three classes: the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab), the interleukin-12/interleukin-23 (IL-12/23) inhibitors (ustekinumab), and an IL-17 inhibitor (secukinumab). In the European Union, all five biologics, including two recent biosimilars of infliximab, are indicated in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, generally for second-line use after immunosuppressants (cyclosporine and methotrexate) or phototherapies. The TNF-α inhibitor etanercept is also approved for use in children and adolescents with chronic severe plaque psoriasis from the age of 6 years. In America, the situation is similar with biologics being approved for use in patients that are unresponsive to other systemic therapies, except secukinumab, which is indicated for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. However, etanercept has no pediatric indication in America. Treatment guidelines developed by dermatology societies in the European Union and North America provide guidance to physicians on selection of approved biologics and treatment sequencing, as well as issues such as use in patients with comorbidities.

Although outcomes for patients with plaque psoriasis have improved since the introduction of biologic therapies at the end of the 1990s, safety concerns may limit their use, including the risk of serious infections (e.g. tuberculosis), and the potential for increased risk of malignancies or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). A greater understanding of the immune pathways involved in psoriasis has led to the identification of new therapeutic options. Here, we briefly review the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, identify key mediators of psoriatic plaques that are being targeted by new and emerging biologic therapies, and highlight the latest efficacy and safety data from trials of these new agents.

### Switching to adalimumab for psoriasis patients with a suboptimal response to etanercept, methotrexate, or phototherapy: efficacy and safety results from an open-label study [^429f578e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Strategies for transitioning patients with psoriasis from suboptimal therapy have not been delineated.

Objective

We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of transitioning to adalimumab for the treatment of psoriasis in patients with suboptimal response to prior therapy with etanercept, methotrexate (MTX), or narrowband (NB)-ultraviolet (UV)B phototherapy.

Methods

In this 16-week, open-label, phase IIIb trial, patients with chronic plaque psoriasis discontinued suboptimal therapy between 11 and 17 days (etanercept) or between 4 and 10 days (MTX and NB-UVB) before initiating adalimumab (80 mg at week 0, then 40 mg every other week from week 1). The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving a Physician Global Assessment of "clear" or "minimal" at week 16.

Results

At week 16, Physician Global Assessment of "clear" or "minimal" was achieved by 52% of all enrolled patients (79 of 152) and 49%, 61%, and 48% in the etanercept, MTX, and NB-UVB subgroups, respectively. Four patients (2.6%) experienced at least 125% worsening of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score relative to screening value at any study visit. The adalimumab safety profile was consistent with results from other psoriasis clinical trials.

Limitations

This study is limited by its relatively short 16-week duration, small patient enrollment, and open-label design.

Conclusion

Patients who had a suboptimal response to etanercept, MTX, or NB-UVB phototherapy experienced a similar, approximately 50% likelihood of achieving a clinically relevant response to adalimumab. Immediate transition to adalimumab from prior suboptimal therapy, with no dosage tapering or overlap, had a low risk of psoriasis flare.

### An open-label, prospective cohort pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients who have not had an adequate response to adalimumab [^c7419ed3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The past several years have seen the approval of five different biologic agents for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the United States and Canada. Psoriasis has proven to be a difficult disease to treat and treatment failures, even with newer biologic therapies, are not uncommon. The vast majority of clinical data for these medications is derived from treatment of biologic-naive patients, or patients who have not responded to, or lost response to, or not tolerated systemic therapy for psoriasis. There is currently little data available on therapeutic response of a second biologic therapy after loss of response, or no response, to the first biologic therapy initiated. It has become common clinical practice to switch medications that are structurally distinct but therapeutically similar in order to achieve an improved clinical outcome. Therapeutic interchange now is being applied to the biologic agents used to treat psoriasis.

Objectives

Using a proof of concept study, describe the response of etanercept after adalimumab has failed to produce a satisfactory response in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

A total of 10 biologically naive patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who were initiated on adalimumab for at least 12 weeks but had a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of mild or worse were transitioned to commercial etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 12 weeks followed by a dose reduction to 50 mg once weekly (OW) for an additional 12 weeks. Ethics approval was obtained and the study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00833729). The primary outcome measured was the mean change in Physician?s Global Assessment (PGA) score (range 0–5) from baseline (when the first etanercept injection is given) to 12 weeks of etanercept therapy. The secondary outcomes measures included the mean change in Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI), mean change in body surface area (BSA) covered in psoriasis, Subject's Global Assessment of disease (SGA), proportion of patients achieving an improvement in PGA score from baseline to 12 weeks and again at 24 weeks and safety.

Results

Overall, there were significant favorable changes in all outcomes measured (PGA, SGA, BSA and DLQI) with respect to etanercept's efficacy after an inadequate response to at least 12 weeks of adalimumab therapy. There were no significant safety issues noted especially during the transition period from adalimumab to etanercept. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00833729.

### Combining biologic therapies with other systemic treatments in psoriasis: evidence-based, best-practice recommendations from the medical board of the National Psoriasis Foundation [^3914d197]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

While monotherapy with biologic agents is effective for many patients with psoriasis, some patients require combination therapy. Evidence-based recommendations on combination therapy provide guidance for treating appropriately selected patients with psoriasis.

Objective

To make evidence-based, best-practice recommendations regarding combining biologics with other systemic treatments, including phototherapy, oral medications, or other biologics, for psoriasis treatment.

Evidence Review

We searched the MEDLINE database for studies from January 1, 1946, to June 18, 2013, that evaluated therapies combining biologics with phototherapy, oral medications, or other biologic agents. The Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation arrived at best-practice recommendations through group discussion and voting.

Findings

Few trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of combination therapies in moderate to severe psoriasis. Combining biologics, such as etanercept or adalimumab, with phototherapy likely results in greater reduction in disease severity than either alone. Etanercept and methotrexate combination is more effective than monotherapy with either medication. A combination of infliximab with methotrexate results in greater efficacy than infliximab alone. With concomitant use of acitretin, the dosing of etanercept can be reduced to maintain similar levels of efficacy. Short-term cyclosporine use has been combined with etanercept or adalimumab to control psoriasis flares. Based on the expert opinion of the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation, the preferred order for combining a second modality with biologics is biologic and methotrexate combination, biologic and acitretin combination, and then biologic and phototherapy combination. In the psoriasis literature, there are overall insufficient data on combining biologics with acitretin, cyclosporine, or a second biologic.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among appropriately selected patients with psoriasis, carefully chosen combinations may result in greater efficacy, while minimizing toxicity.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the addition of methotrexate to etanercept in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^82d4ea3c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Previous psoriasis studies have shown that biologic therapy can be used effectively in combination with other systemic or topical antipsoriatic therapies.–Alefacept plus other psoriasis treatments, including methotrexate, appears to be efficacious and well tolerated in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. In a retrospective long-term cohort study, 70% of patients receiving infliximab plus either methotrexate or azathioprine had PASI 75 responses at week 14, and 15 of 23 patients continued to receive treatment for > 1 year.

The principal limitations of our study are the lack of a methotrexate monotherapy group and the 24-week study period. Although the combination of etanercept plus methotrexate demonstrated superior efficacy to etanercept monotherapy in this study, evaluation in a longer study would more firmly establish the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen. Long-term clinical efficacy and safety of etanercept alone have been reported for up to 2·5 years in open-label studies of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, and long-term data (up to 2 years) demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the etanercept and methotrexate combination in patients with early, active RA.

In conclusion, adding methotrexate to etanercept resulted in increased efficacy with acceptable tolerability and safety compared with etanercept alone in adults with stable moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the addition of methotrexate to etanercept in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^4e2f7201]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Etanercept plus methotrexate combination therapy has not been adequately investigated in psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate etanercept plus methotrexate vs. etanercept monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had not failed prior methotrexate or tumour necrosis factor-inhibitor therapy.

Methods

Patients received etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg once weekly for 12 weeks and were randomized 1: 1 to receive methotrexate (7·5–15 mg weekly) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 24.

Results

In total, 239 patients were enrolled in each arm. PASI 75 was significantly higher at week 24 for the combination therapy group compared with the monotherapy group (77·3% vs. 60·3%; P < 0·0001). Other PASI improvement scores at week 12 [PASI 75, 70·2% vs. 54·3% (P = 0·01); PASI 50, 92·4% vs. 83·8% (P = 0·01); and PASI 90, 34·0% vs. 23·1% (P = 0·03)] showed similar results as did week 24 PASI 50 (91·6% vs. 84·6%; P = 0·01) and PASI 90 (53·8% vs. 34·2%; P = 0·01). Significantly more patients receiving combination therapy than monotherapy had static Physician's Global Assessment of clear/almost clear at week 12 (65·5% vs. 47·0%; P = 0·01) and week 24 (71·8% vs. 54·3%; P = 0·01). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 74·9% and 59·8% of combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively; three serious AEs were reported in each arm.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with etanercept plus methotrexate had acceptable tolerability and increased efficacy compared with etanercept monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

### Continuous versus intermittent therapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis [^a2f99533]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Unlike other chronic inflammatory diseases receiving continuous treatment, psoriasis has traditionally been treated intermittently secondary to concern for cumulative toxicity of conventional systemic therapies. However, the development of targeted anti-inflammatory biologic agents allowed for continuous therapy for most patients. Herein, we review the literature for intermittent versus continuous use of widely available therapies for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: phototherapy, topical corticosteroids, conventional systemic therapies and biologic agents. These data support continuous treatment in biologic therapy, such as etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, and ustekinumab. Intermittent therapy with biologic agents leads to decreased efficacy and sometimes increased side effects. When conventional systemic therapy is used continuously, it is more efficacious; however the data support intermittent use of methotrexate and cyclosporine due to cumulative toxicities. Psoriasis severity may wax and wane, but it is a chronic disease requiring continuous treatment for optimal control of inflammatory activity and to minimise cutaneous involvement.

### Efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis who have shown an unsatisfactory response to etanercept [^104a42a9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab in patients who have shown an unsatisfactory response to etanercept are unknown.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in patients who failed to show a satisfactory response or lost their satisfactory response to etanercept.

Methods

This multicenter study enrolled patients who either failed to reach a physician global assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1 after 12 weeks of etanercept (group A; 50 patients) or who lost their PGA score of 0 or 1 at any time after etanercept dose decrease from 50 mg twice a week to 50 mg every week (group B; 35 patients). Patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week without loading dose for 12 weeks followed by 40 mg every week for an additional 12 weeks if they did not reach a PGA score of 0 or 1.

Results

After 12 weeks of adalimumab, 34.0% (n = 17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 20.4–47.6) and 31.4% (n = 11; 95% CI 15.2–47.6) of patients from groups A and B, respectively, reached a PGA score of 0 or 1. A total of 46.0% (n = 23; 95% CI 31.7–60.3) and 45.7% (n = 16; 95% CI 28.4–63.1) of patients from group A and B, respectively, achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 after 24 weeks of adalimumab. Adalimumab was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.

Limitations

This was an open-label uncontrolled study.

Conclusions

Adalimumab should be considered as an alternative in patients with psoriasis who have not shown an adequate response or who lost their response to etanercept after a dose decrease.

### Anti-TNF agents for the treatment of psoriasis [^64bae07d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is one of several systemic diseases that presents chiefly with cutaneous symptoms and has the potential to negatively impact patients' overall health and quality of life. Physicians who treat patients with psoriasis must be cognizant of the chronic, lifelong character of the disease and of the potential for multisystem pathology. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), between 5.8 and 7.5 million persons in the U.S. — approximately 2.2% of the population — have psoriasis; worldwide, it affects an estimated 125 million people. The annual cost of treating psoriasis may exceed $3 billion annually. Immunologic mechanisms are now accepted as the pathophysiologic basis for the development of psoriatic disease. Treatment strategies — which include topical treatment, phototherapy, methtrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin — also encompass several biologic agents that target immune mediators associated with the condition.

Discussion

Patients with mild disease may obtain symptomatic relief with topical agents and targeted phototherapy. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease are likely to benefit from systemic therapy. Shortcomings of the traditional agents, particularly their adverse event profiles, have motivated research and development of biologic agents. Currently three anti-TNF agents — etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab — are FDA-approved for treatment of psoriasis. Differences exist among study designs and, therefore, in interpretation of data; however, the improvements observed in the psoriasis study populations participating in clinical trials are dramatic. Long-term clinical data continue to accumulate and demonstrate sustained benefits with anti-TNF agents. Safety data also continue to be collected over the long-term; key safety considerations are infection, cytopenia, demyelinating disease, lupus-like syndromes, congestive heart failure and malignancies. Combination therapy should also be considered when managing psoriasis for such reasons as augmenting an inadequate response to monotherapy or improving tolerability. Combination therapy with an anti-TNF agent and phototherapy has shown considerably higher rates of response compared with either intervention alone.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to critically examine the anti-TNF studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the agents in patients with psoriasis and determine applicability of the data in clinical practice. In light of the chronic nature of this disease, the emphasis will be on the longest-term data available.

Conclusion

The treatment of plaque psoriasis with TNF-alpha antagonists is still a relatively recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium available to clinicians. The collection of long-term data is, therefore, small but growing as results from newer studies emerge. From the data reviewed here, the clinician can attempt to arrive at a satisfactory assessment of the benefits and risks of treatment with these agents.

### Sequential use of biologics in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [^acb21510]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

A number of biologic agents, including the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab, and the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 antagonist ustekinumab, are available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the U.K. Currently, the selection of the first biologic, and the choice of sequential biologics in the event of efficacy/tolerability concerns, is made using a limited evidence base. The efficacy of biologics, the potential mechanisms of primary and secondary failure and the evidence for sequencing therapy among TNF antagonists and between TNF antagonists and IL-12/IL-23 blockade are reviewed. As psoriasis biologics registers begin to produce long-term safety and efficacy data, therapy decisions in plaque psoriasis may become more objective, and it may be possible to individualize treatment based on clinical or pharmacogenetic information.

### From conventional to cutting edge: the new era of biologics in treatment of psoriasis [^09d7384e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the skin and joints that affects 1–3% of the world population. Conventional treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis are associated with broadband immunosuppression and/or organ toxicities that can be problematic when used long term. Advances in the understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis have led to targeted therapy in the form of biologics. These agents have gained popularity as safe, effective, and convenient alternatives for the treatment of chronic, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This review will focus on the five main biologics used in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: efalizumab, alefacept, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab. Mechanisms of action, guidelines for usage, efficacy data, and safety concerns will be discussed for each biologic. In addition, the new Th17 biologics and their role in psoriasis pathogenesis will also be examined.

Psoriasis — TNF-alfa antagonists usage and comparative efficacy indicates there is no specific sequence in which the currently available TNF-alfa antagonists should be used; pivotal phase III studies suggest the initial response rate of cutaneous disease to infliximab is superior to that of adalimumab, which is superior to that of etanercept; over the course of a year, a loss of response may be noted with these agents, necessitating the addition of phototherapy or methotrexate (MTX) or switching to another biologic; a retrospective study demonstrated that patients who develop positive antinuclear and antidsDNA antibodies to the monoclonal antibody TNF-alpha inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab, compared with the fusion protein TNF-alfa inhibitor etanercept, were more likely to lose response to treatment.

### Patient-reported reasons for the discontinuation of commonly used treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis [^ae400681]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread dissatisfaction and low treatment persistence in moderate to severe psoriasis, patients' reasons behind treatment discontinuation remain poorly understood.

Objectives

We sought to characterize patient-reported reasons for discontinuing commonly used treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis in real-world clinical practice.

Methods

A total of 1095 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis from 10 dermatology practices who received systemic treatments completed a structured interview. Eleven reasons for treatment discontinuation were assessed for all past treatments.

Results

A total of 2231 past treatments were reported. Median treatment duration varied by treatment, ranging from 6.0 to 20.5 months (P < .001). The frequency of each cited discontinuation reasons differed by treatment (all P < .01). Patients who received etanercept (odds ratio [OR] 5.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.23–8.33) and adalimumab (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.20–3.67) were more likely to cite a loss of efficacy than those who received methotrexate. Patients who received etanercept (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.23–0.49), adalimumab (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.30–0.75), and ultraviolet B phototherapy (OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.14–0.31) were less likely to cite side effects than those who received methotrexate, whereas those who received acitretin (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.08–2.25) were more likely to do so. Patients who underwent ultraviolet B phototherapy were more likely to cite an inability to afford treatment (OR 7.03; 95% CI 3.14–15.72).

Limitations

The study is limited by its reliance on patient recall.

Conclusions

Different patterns of treatment discontinuation reasons are important to consider when developing public policy and evidence-based treatment approaches to improve successful long-term psoriasis control.

### Long-term safety of biologics in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: review of current data [^cb3b8264]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Conventional non-biologic systemic agents are regarded as second-line therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis after topical treatments. However, long-term data have highlighted a number of safety concerns associated with their prolonged use. Biologic agents targeting specific immune mediators have emerged as an alternative treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, non-biologic systemic agents. Although several biologics have demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability in short-term trials, treatment guidelines recommend them as third-line therapies due to a relative lack of long-term safety data. Here, we have reviewed the long-term (≥ 1 year) safety data from randomized controlled trials, open-label extension studies and meta-analyses of etanercept, infliximab, efalizumab, adalimumab, alefacept and ustekinumab in the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. With the exception of efalizumab, which has been withdrawn from both the European and U.S. markets due to long-term safety concerns, these biologics are generally well tolerated in long-term studies, and offer a viable alternative to conventional non-biologic agents in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

### Management of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (part I): clinical update on antitumor necrosis factor agents [^6ddf7ddc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is an immunologic disorder mediated by T cells and proinflammatory cytokines. Novel biologic therapies, targeted at key pathogenic steps, have been developed and provide efficacy without the potential end-organ toxicity induced by traditional therapies. The biologic therapies currently approved for treatment of psoriasis are classified into 2 categories, as defined by their mechanism of action: inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and modulation of pathogenic activated T cells (alefacept, efalizumab). This review has been prepared in 2 parts: Part 1 focuses on anti-TNF agents and includes new data that have become available through increased clinical experience and use in eligible patients. Part 2 will present new data on T-cell modulators, new molecules in development, and considerations for optimal therapeutic selection for treatment of patients with psoriasis (Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, March 2009).

Combinations Involving Methotrexate

Initial findings of improved skin clearance in individuals with psoriatic arthritis after treatment with methotrexate and adalimumab led to further investigation of combined methotrexate and biologic therapy in psoriasis-specific populations. In an open-label pilot study of 59 patients with active psoriasis (PASI ≥ 8, BSA > 10%, or both) without an adequate response to long-term (≥ 3 months) methotrexate therapy, patients were randomized to receive either etanercept and continued methotrexate or etanercept with methotrexate tapered and discontinued. After 24 weeks, the proportion of patients with a Physicians' Global Assessment (PGA) rating of "clear" or "almost clear" was significantly higher in the combination therapy group than in the etanercept monotherapy group (66.7 versus 37.0%, respectively; P = 0.025). The same trend was also observed in the improvement of PASI scores by at least 75% (PASI 75) at weeks 12 and 24. The adverse event rates were 75.0% in the monotherapy group and 61.3% in the combination group; adverse infectious events were the most frequent (25.0 and 38.7%, respectively). The recent comparison of efficacy between etanercept and etanercept in combination with methotrexate by Gottlieb et al. is one of the most robust combination trials to date in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Almost 45% of patients in this trial had received prior systemic therapy, including methotrexate in about 17% of patients. In this randomized, double-blind trial of 478 patients (BSA ≥ 10%, PASI ≥ 10), PASI 75 response rates at 24 weeks were significantly higher with combination therapy than with etanercept alone (77.3 versus 60.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001), as were other PASI response rates (Fig. 1). Combination therapy was also associated with a significant increase in the proportion of patients with a PGA rating of "clear" or "almost clear", compared with etanercept alone (week 12: 65.5 versus 47.0%; week 24: 71.8 versus 54.3%; both P = 0.01). Adverse events were reported in 74.9% of patients receiving combination therapy and in 59.8% of those receiving etanercept monotherapy; the adverse event profiles of the two treatments were similar and included nasopharyngitis (9.6% with combination therapy versus 10.9% with monotherapy), headache (9.2 versus 9.2%), and upper respiratory tract infection (8.4 versus 5.0%).

### Adalimumab efficacy in patients with psoriasis who received or did not respond to prior systemic therapy: a pooled post hoc analysis of results from three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^35a03e5c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current treatment guidelines suggest that psoriasis may be treated with topical, ultraviolet (UV)-based, traditional systemic, or biologic therapies, depending on specific patient and disease characteristics. The majority of patients with psoriasis who are prescribed biologic therapy have previously received treatment with other systemic therapies, including methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine, and psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) therapy. It is of clinical relevance to understand whether patients who have received prior systemic therapy, especially patients who did not respond to previous treatment, will respond to biologics to the same degree as patients who are naive to systemic treatments.

Systemic therapies for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis include MTX, which acts as an immunosuppressant and is often a first-line systemic therapy, and cyclosporine, which is a short-term treatment alternative owing to its potential for nephrotoxicity. A third option is PUVA, which uses naturally occurring, photosensitizing psoralen compounds to sensitize cells to the effects of UVA light and form psoralen-DNA crosslinks upon exposure, thus preventing DNA replication. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis have included agents that modulate T cells (e.g. alefacept and efalizumab [both withdrawn from the market]) and inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF; e.g. adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab), interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 (e.g. ustekinumab), and interleukin-17 (e.g. secukinumab). Apremilast is a recently approved small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4. However, there are limited published clinical trial data on the outcomes of systemic biologics after discontinuing a different prior systemic therapy, particularly following failure of the previous therapy.

TNF-α inhibitor etanercept — adult plaque psoriasis dosing recommendations include that etanercept is recommended as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with a recommended starting dose of 50 mg taken as a self-administered subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 12 consecutive wk, and a recommended maintenance dose after the initial 12 wk of 50 mg once weekly; etanercept administered at a dose of 50 mg twice weekly is more efficacious than a dose of 50 mg once weekly and may be required for better disease control in some patients.

### Efficacy and safety of systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1e131b0f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Dermatologists may choose from various conventional and biological systemic agents to treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We set out to analyse systematically the efficacy and tolerability of approved treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of systemic treatment approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of participants with 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at primary efficacy measurement (week 8–16). Safety was summarized as rates of adverse events and withdrawals. Direct and indirect comparative efficacy was assessed by random effects meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs). In total, 48 eligible RCTs totalling 16 696 patients (11 178 randomized to biologics, 1888 to conventional treatments) were identified. In placebo-controlled trials, infliximab was the most efficacious [RD 76%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 73–79%]. Adalimumab (RD 61%, 95% CI 56–67%), and ustekinumab 45 mg (RD 63%, 95% CI 59–66%) and 90 mg (RD 67%, 95% CI 60–74%) each had similar efficacy. These biologics are more effective than etanercept and all conventional treatments. Head-to-head trials indicate the superiority of adalimumab and infliximab over methotrexate (MTX), the superiority of ustekinumab over etanercept, the nonsignificant superiority of ciclosporin over MTX, and the dose-dependent efficacy of etanercept and ustekinumab. Fumaric acid is as efficacious as MTX. Safety of treatments could not be pooled due to a lack of standardization in reporting across trials. In conclusion, the qualitative and quantitative evidence is much stronger for biological interventions than for conventional treatments.

### Sequential use of biologics in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: case studies illustrating an individualized approach [^1bb44591]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Biologics have added great value to the treatment of psoriasis; however, there is currently little guidance on which biologic to use and at what stage of disease, and even less guidance on how to switch therapy in the event of treatment failure or the occurrence of side-effects. Furthermore, drug switching may not always be essential in cases of biologic failure, and adding conventional systemics has a role in some patients. It is clear that we have limited data to support any particular policy in initiating and switching biologics in psoriasis, but a pragmatic approach to therapy is supported by the case reports described within this article. Specifically, the case studies include patients who were initiated on different biologics and subsequently switched to alternatives for a variety of reasons, such as unresponsiveness or a concomitant disease. As more evidence emerges from long-term studies and registry data, a clearer picture should emerge on how best to use biologics in different situations to aid successful treatment outcomes. Comparative studies are necessary before firm recommendations about sequential use can be made.

### Systemic pharmacologic treatments for plaque psoriasis… [^86970664]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Evidence-Based Answer Infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab are the most effective medications for achieving a 90% reduction in symptoms among patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

1. Practice Pointers Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder involving the skin and other organ systems. It affects an estimated 3. 2% of people older than 20 years in the United States. 2 Psoriasis can present significant challenges due to its variable clinical manifestations, potential for comorbidities, and the evolving landscape of treatment options.
3. This Cochrane review included 179 randomized controlled trials with a total of 62, 339 participants and evaluated 20 unique treatments.

1 The patient population included adults older than 18 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was used to assess psoriasis severity. The PASI instrument is completed by examiners, and the score considers the extent and severity of skin involvement, including factors such as redness, scaling, and thickness of psoriatic lesions in four body regions. PASI 90 describes when a patient has symptoms of psoriasis that have improved by 90% or more compared with their initial baseline PASI score and is, therefore, a measure of treatment effectiveness. Of the studies included in this review, 56% were placebo-controlled, and at least 77% were industry-sponsored.

### Efficacy and tolerability of biologic and nonbiologic systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cf554589]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The comparative efficacy and tolerability of conventional and biologic treatments for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are unknown.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting efficacy of systemic treatments approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis by means of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI).

Methods

We identified relevant articles by systematic electronic searches (Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Scopus). Efficacy was defined as proportion of participants with ≥ 75% decrease in PASI (PASI-75) at primary efficacy measurement (week 8–16). PASI-75 response rates of double-blind placebo-controlled trials were summarized as risk differences (RDs) and pooled using random effects models. Tolerability was assessed from rates of withdrawals and adverse events.

Results

Twenty-four RCTs totalling 9384 patients were analysed qualitatively. Sixteen double-blind placebo-controlled trials were eligible for meta-analysis. Infliximab was significantly superior to all other interventions [RD 77%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 72–81%]. Adalimumab (RD 64%, 95% CI 61–68%) was superior to ciclosporin (RD 33%, 95% CI 13–52%), efalizumab (RD 24%, 95% CI 19–30%), etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (RD 44%, 95% CI 40–48%) and etanercept 25 mg twice weekly (RD 30%, 95% CI 25–35%). Efalizumab was significantly less efficacious than fumaric acid esters (RD 48%, 95% CI 32–64%). Rates of withdrawals due to adverse events were highest for methotrexate and fumaric acid esters.

Conclusions

The efficacy of systemic agents approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis differs considerably both within and between biologics and nonbiologics. Infliximab is most efficacious, followed by adalimumab. Patients receiving infliximab have an excess chance of 77% over placebo to achieve PASI-75 response. Published evidence questions regulatory guidelines that recommend biologics as second-line therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

The clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab (40 mg administered subcutaneously every other week) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis have been demonstrated in several randomized, double-blind clinical trials, including the pivotal trials REVEAL (n = 1212) and CHAMPION (n = 271). Based on these trials, adalimumab was significantly more effective than placebo and methotrexate at relieving the signs and symptoms of psoriasis after 16 weeks of treatment, as assessed by the percentage of patients achieving a 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Based on open-label extension studies of up to 2 years' duration, the efficacy of adalimumab was sustained over the long term. Of patients who had responded to 33 weeks of treatment with adalimumab in REVEAL, patients randomized to remain on adalimumab for an additional 19 weeks of treatment were significantly less likely to experience loss of an adequate response than patients who were transferred to placebo. Compared with placebo or methotrexate, adalimumab was associated with significantly greater improvements in dermatology-specific and general measures of health-related quality of life in patients with plaque psoriasis. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated in trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, and the adverse-event profile was similar to that associated with its use in rheumatoid arthritis.

### Patients with psoriasis respond to continuous open-label etanercept treatment after initial incomplete response in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^fe0bb6cc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Etanercept provides rapid, significant improvement in psoriatic symptoms and disease.

Objective

The effectiveness of continued etanercept treatment beyond 24 weeks in patients who initially did not achieve at least a 50% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) was assessed.

Methods

Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis received 50 mg open-label, subcutaneous etanercept per week after completing blinded therapy with placebo or 1 of 3 doses of etanercept. The PASI was measured.

Results

Irrespective of prior dosing regimens, 43% of 157 patients who did not attain PASI 50 responses at week 24 achieved PASI 50 responses at week 36; 55% achieved PASI 50 responses at week 60. Etanercept was safe and well tolerated.

Limitations

Interpretation of these results is limited by the open-label design of the analysis.

Conclusion

More than half of patients who initially had an inadequate response to treatment achieved satisfactory responses with continued etanercept therapy. The safety profile of etanercept in these patients and in patients who had more immediate responses was similar.

### Biologic therapies in psoriasis: a new therapeutic approach [^89bf1788]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic plaque psoriasis is an immune-mediated, inflammatory skin disease with a heavy burden on quality of life of patients. The disease has a chronic relapsing course and may be life long. Comorbid disorders include psoriatic arthritis, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and an increased rate of cardiovascular disease. Conventional systemic treatments include methotrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin, which are associated with end organ toxicity that precludes long term therapy. Biological drugs are designed to selectively interfere with the immune mechanisms that induce psoriasis. Efalizumab is effective for skin psoriasis but not psoriatic arthritis. Anti-TNF-alpha agents (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) are active on both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Infliximab is the most effective and rapid agent, but its safety profile may be less favourable. Moreover, efficacy can reduce over time. Etanercept is moderately active but has a better safety profile, and can be discontinued and re-used without loss of efficacy. The long term safety of all these agents has not been established.

### A global phase III randomized controlled trial of etanercept in psoriasis: safety, efficacy, and effect of dose reduction [^9ca9c512]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In previous studies, etanercept significantly improved plaque psoriasis and was well tolerated.

Objectives

To examine further the efficacy and safety of etanercept and to assess maintenance of treatment effect after dose reduction of etanercept.

Methods

In this multicentre 24-week study in the U.S. A. Canada and Western Europe, patients were at least 18 years old; had active, clinically stable plaque psoriasis involving at least 10% of body surface area; had a minimum Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 10 at screening; and had received or were a candidate to receive systemic psoriasis therapy or phototherapy. During the first 12 weeks of the study, patients were randomly assigned to receive by subcutaneous injection etanercept twice weekly (BIW) at a dose of 50 mg or 25 mg, or placebo BIW in a double-blind fashion. During the second 12 weeks, all patients received etanercept 25 mg BIW. The primary endpoint was a 75% or greater improvement from baseline in PASI (PASI 75) at 12 weeks.

Results

Five hundred and eighty-three subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. At week 12, a PASI 75 was achieved by 49% of patients in the etanercept 50 mg BIW group, 34% in the 25 mg BIW group, and 3% in the placebo group (P < 0.0001 for each etanercept group compared with placebo). At week 24 (after 12 weeks of open-label 25 mg etanercept BIW), a PASI 75 was achieved by 54% of patients whose dose was reduced from 50 mg BIW to 25 mg BIW, by 45% of patients in the continuous 25 mg BIW group, and by 28% in the group that received placebo followed by etanercept 25 mg BIW. Etanercept was well tolerated throughout the study.

Conclusions

Etanercept provided clinically meaningful benefit to patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, with no apparent decrease in efficacy after dose reduction.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^5efd954a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Plaque psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Its overall prevalence for children 0–18 years of age is 0·2–1·4% in Europe and approximately 1% in the U.S. A. 1, 2 The disease in children and adults is associated with impaired quality of life 3, 4, 5 and an increased risk of comorbidities, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk, autoimmune diseases 6, 7, 8 and psychosocial issues, especially depression. 9, 10, 11

The limited number of approved systemic therapies and randomized controlled trials evaluating treatment in children has challenged the effective management of the disease. Conventional treatment options include topical therapy for mild‐to‐moderate disease, 12 and for severe or refractory disease, ultraviolet (UV)B phototherapy, narrowband UVB therapy if accessible and systemic treatments, including methotrexate (MTX), ciclosporin, acitretin (retinoids) and biologics. 13, 14, 15

Approved biologic therapies for plaque psoriasis in children include the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α inhibitors etanercept 16, 17, 18, 19 and adalimumab (ADA), 20 and the p40 inhibitor ustekinumab. 18, 19 Etanercept is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for children aged ≥ 6 years with severe disease, and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children aged ≥ 4 years; ADA is approved by the EMA for children aged ≥ 4 years with severe chronic disease; and ustekinumab is approved by the EMA and FDA for children aged ≥ 12 years with moderate‐to‐severe disease.

Results of long‐term treatment of children with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis have been published for open‐label etanercept, 21, 22 and for ustekinumab vs. placebo. 23 Biologic treatment of psoriasis in children is reported as less likely to result in adverse events or in treatment discontinuation compared with MTX. 24

The current analysis reports results from the first randomized 52‐week controlled trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of a biologic treatment, ADA (Humira ®, AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, IL, U.S. A.), a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF‐α, with the active comparator MTX, in children with severe plaque psoriasis. Results from the first three periods of this trial have been reported. 25

### Patient satisfaction with treatments for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in clinical practice [^7098697e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment satisfaction among patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis has not been studied and compared across treatments using a validated instrument.

Objectives

To assess patient-reported satisfaction with systemic and phototherapy treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in clinical practice and to correlate satisfaction with disease severity and quality-of-life measures.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of 1182 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the Dermatology Clinical Effectiveness Research Network in the U.S. A. Patients receiving either topical therapies only; monotherapy with oral systemic therapies, biologics or narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy; or combination therapy with biologics and methotrexate completed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication version II.

Results

Median unadjusted overall satisfaction scores were highest for patients receiving biologic monotherapies, biologic-methotrexate combinations, or phototherapy (83.3); scores were lowest for those receiving topical therapies only or acitretin (66.7). In fully adjusted models, compared with patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy, those receiving adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, phototherapy or adalimumab with methotrexate had significantly higher median overall satisfaction scores by 7.2–8.3 points, while those receiving topical therapies only had significantly lower overall satisfaction by 8.9 points. Adjusted convenience scores were lowest for patients receiving topical therapies only or infliximab. Modest but significant correlations were found between the overall satisfaction subscale and both the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (ρ = -0.36, P < 0.001) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (ρ = -0.47, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Discernible differences were found in treatment satisfaction among therapies, particularly regarding treatment effectiveness and convenience. Further application of treatment satisfaction measures may inform treatment decisions and guideline development.

### Etanercept monotherapy in patients with psoriasis: a summary of safety, based on an integrated multistudy database [^7dae35ce]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor antagonist, is an approved treatment in the United States and Europe for plaque psoriasis.

Objective

To further examine the safety profile of etanercept in patients with chronic, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Safety data from an integrated database of 1347 patients from 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were analyzed. Safety end points included incidence rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, serious infections, injection site reactions, and routine laboratory assessments. Pooled safety results from the first 12 weeks of each trial are reported here.

Results

Rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, and serious infections in the first 12 weeks of the 3 trials were similar among all active groups as well as each active group, compared with the placebo group. No dose-related toxicities were reported.

Limitations

This report includes a relatively short (12-week) time frame; data from patients exposed to etanercept for longer periods are needed.

Conclusions

Etanercept was generally safe in a large cohort of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Psoriasis topical therapy with biologics — combination recommendations: The addition of an ultrahigh potency (class 1) topical corticosteroid to standard dose etanercept for 12 weeks is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (strength of recommendation A). The addition of calcipotriene/betamethasone to standard dose adalimumab for 16 weeks is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis to accelerate clearance of psoriatic plaques (strength of recommendation B). All topical corticosteroids can be used in combination with any biologics for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (strength of recommendation C).

### The efficacy and safety of infliximab in patients with plaque psoriasis who had an inadequate response to etanercept: results of a prospective, multicenter, open-label study [^0c6567bb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with psoriasis and inadequate response (IR) to tumor necrosis factor-α antagonist treatment, the incremental benefit of switching to another tumor necrosis factor-α antagonist is unknown.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the clinical response to an etanercept-to-infliximab switch in patients with psoriasis and IR to etanercept.

Methods

Adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and IR to etanercept (≥ 4 months) were eligible for this open-label study (called PSUNRISE). Patients had a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of at least 2 (mild) on a 5-point scale with etanercept, with or without concomitant oral systemic methotrexate or cyclosporine at baseline and during the study. Patients received intravenous infusions of infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22. PGA was used to evaluate efficacy at week 10 (primary end point) and week 26 (durability). Safety was evaluated through the end of the study.

Results

Of 215 patients, only 10 received concomitant immunomodulators. At week 10, 65.4% of patients (138 of 211; 95% confidence interval 58.6%-71.8%) achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or minimal (1) (primary end point). This response was durable through week 26, at which time 61.3% (122 of 199; 95% confidence interval 54.2%-68.1%) achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or minimal (1). There were no unexpected side effects or safety concerns.

Limitations

This was an open-label, 26-week study; an incremental change of 1 PGA point, even mild to minimal, was considered clinically significant, as most psoriasis practitioners seek to achieve minimal psoriasis or clear skin.

Conclusion

After switching to infliximab, a substantial proportion of patients with psoriasis and IR to etanercept experienced rapid and durable improvement.

### Etanercept provides a more physiological approach in the treatment of psoriasis [^e330355a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin and joints. Moderate to severe psoriasis is traditionally treated with systemic treatments, which can be effective but are often associated with relevant adverse effects, even when administered intermittently or rotationally. Biologic therapies may provide high and consistent efficacy over time, long-term safety, and simple administration schedules compared with nonbiologic therapies, and can be used in patients intolerant and/or resistant to these therapies. TNF-antagonists have a definite advantage over other biologic agents (e.g. T-cell targeting drugs) in the early and late manifestations of joint involvement. TNF-antagonists are a class of drugs with distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and different safety profiles. Etanercept provides a more "physiological" mechanism of action compared to anti-TNF antibodies. Etanercept has less dramatic effects on TNF homeostasis although it has been proved to be highly effective in blocking psoriatic joint erosions. It maintains stable efficacy over time on skin psoriasis, also when used intermittently. Moreover, etanercept has been shown to be not immunogenic, and it only slightly increases the risk of granulomatous infections compared to anti-TNF antibodies. According to the "physiologic" paradigm of selection among TNF-antagonists linked to more or less physiologic mechanism of action, etanercept appears to be the anti-TNF of choice for treating most patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, possibly even at an early stage.

### An evolution in switching therapy for psoriasis patients who fail to meet treatment goals [^8e75b356]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is a wide range of options available for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe chronic plaque psoriasis, including topical therapies, phototherapy, older small‐molecule systemic agents (e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, and fumaric acid in Europe), the newer oral phosphodiesterase‐4‐inhibitor apremilast, and the biologics etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, and ustekinumab 1. Despite the availability of numerous therapies that can be highly effective and well tolerated, psoriasis is often undertreated such that patients do not achieve substantial skin clearance, symptom relief, or improvements in quality of life 2, 3, 4. This undertreatment is associated with widespread patient dissatisfaction 3 and is due, in part, to the reluctance among practitioners to initiate or alter systemic treatment regimens in patients with moderate‐to‐severe disease 2. In many cases, patients are left on ineffective or poorly tolerated regimens for long periods of time 2, which can result in sustained underlying inflammation and worsening of skin signs and symptoms, as well as comorbidities associated with psoriasis (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease) 5.

In an effort to improve patient care, several international groups have established objective parameters to help clinicians set psoriasis treatment goals and monitor patients' progress. Guidance based on the consensus of experts from 19 European countries defines treatment success as at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) from the time of treatment initiation 2. Intermediate response is defined as PASI ≥ 50 and < 75, with a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 5 or lower. If at least an intermediate response is not achieved within about 2 months, treatment modification is recommended 2. Similar treatment goals have been issued by the British Association of Dermatologists 6, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 7, the European Medicines Agency 8, and in an Australian consensus statement 4. The United States Food and Drug Administration also considers these endpoints in the assessment of new agents for psoriasis treatment. Conversely, some guidelines (e.g. those of the National Psoriasis Foundation) advocate against using numerical cutoffs to measure response in clinical practice, and instead recommend using "the patient's own perception of the disease and its burdens" to assess treatment adequacy 9.

### Switching from etanercept to adalimumab is effective and safe: results in 30 patients with psoriasis with primary failure, secondary failure or intolerance to etanercept [^0a66c3fe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge on the sequential treatment of psoriasis with biologics with regard to efficacy and safety is sparse. This also applies to the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients previously treated with etanercept. The relationship between the reasons for discontinuation of etanercept and the response to adalimumab is not clear in psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with psoriasis with primary failure, secondary failure or intolerance to etanercept in daily practice.

Methods

Data were extracted from two prospective registries from all patients with psoriasis with failure on etanercept treatment, who switched to adalimumab therapy. Thirty patients fulfilled these criteria. All patients were naive to biologics when etanercept was initiated. Primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving a 50% or 75% improvement of the baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (PASI 50 and PASI 75, respectively) at weeks 12, 24 and 48. Secondary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90, the mean percentage improvement in the PASI score from baseline and the adverse event rate.

Results

Compared with the baseline PASI score before the start of etanercept, the mean percentage improvement in PASI and the PASI 50/75/90 response rates to adalimumab until week 48 were comparable to those achieved with etanercept. In the patients failing on etanercept, PASI 75 was achieved by 27%, 36% and 54% at weeks 12, 24 and 48 of adalimumab treatment, respectively. The majority of patients showed a beneficial response to adalimumab, irrespective of the reason for discontinuation of etanercept. Previous treatment with etanercept did not increase the adverse event rate nor change the nature of the side-effects.

Conclusions

Adalimumab seems to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with psoriasis who failed on etanercept treatment irrespective of the reason for discontinuation.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^c6437e68]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Etanercept (2017)

Recommendations Etanercept is recommended as induction therapy and long‐term therapy in moderate‐to‐severe plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S17; see Supporting Information). A starting dose of 50 mg twice weekly is suggested, over a dose of 50 mg once weekly. Undesired effects of long‐term treatment are similar to induction therapy. A maintenance dose of 50 mg twice weekly is suggested over a dose of 50 mg once weekly.

Infliximab (2017)

Recommendations Infliximab is recommended as induction therapy for chronic plaque‐type psoriasis in week 0, 2 and 6 (Table S18; see Supporting Information). Infliximab is recommended as maintenance therapy every 8 weeks (with at least 4 weeks between two administrations).

Secukinumab (2017)

Recommendations Secukinumab is recommended as induction therapy in chronic plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S19; see Supporting Information). A dose of 300 mg is recommended over a dose of 150 mg in induction therapy. Secukinumab is suggested for maintenance therapy. Long‐term safety data are limited.

Ustekinumab (2017)

Recommendations Ustekinumab is recommended as induction therapy in chronic plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S20; see Supporting Information). Ustekinumab 45 mg is suggested in patients ≤ 100 kg. Ustekinumab 90 mg is suggested in patients > 100 kg. Ustekinumab is recommended as a maintenance therapy for at least 5 years. The long‐term safety profile of ustekinumab over a period of 5 years appears not to be evidently different from that for 1 year in additional literature.

Combination therapy (2017)

Prescription of systemic combination therapy is currently off‐label. Patients should be informed about this off‐label use and possible side‐effects. Therapy should be started only after careful weighing of benefits and risks tailored to the individual patient. 16

Recommendations

Etanercept in combination with methotrexate is suggested as induction and maintenance therapy of chronic plaque‐type psoriasis. Etanercept in combination with acitretin is suggested as induction and maintenance treatment of chronic plaque‐type psoriasis (based on one maintenance study). 16

Biologics or methotrexate in combination with ultraviolet B is not recommended as a maintenance treatment in patients with chronic plaque‐type psoriasis because of a lack of data on safety. 16

Treatment with adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or secukinumab in combination with methotrexate is suggested in treatment‐resistant psoriasis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 2. psoriatic arthritis: overview and guidelines of care for treatment with an emphasis on the biologics [^e9dd1d43]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Medium credibility.

TNF inhibitors for PsA — three TNF-α antagonists, adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, are currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of PsA, and guideline ratings show adalimumab A (level of evidence I), etanercept A (I), and infliximab A (I). Because the clinical trial ACR20 efficacy data at the primary end point with all 3 FDA-approved TNF blockers are roughly equivalent, the choice of agent is an individual one with the degree and severity of cutaneous involvement an important consideration.

### Efficacy and safety results from the randomized controlled comparative study of adalimumab vs. methotrexate vs. placebo in patients with psoriasis (CHAMPION) [^14725c57]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Biologic therapies such as adalimumab, a tumour necrosis factor antagonist, are safe and effective in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

To compare a biologic agent with methotrexate, a traditional systemic agent, to define clearly the role of biologics in psoriasis.

Methods

Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized to adalimumab (80 mg subcutaneously at week 0, then 40 mg every other week, n = 108), methotrexate (7.5 mg orally, increased as needed and as tolerated to 25 mg weekly; n = 110) or placebo (n = 53) for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) after 16 weeks. Safety was assessed at all visits through week 16.

Results

After 16 weeks, 79.6% of adalimumab-treated patients achieved PASI 75, compared with 35.5% for methotrexate (P < 0.001 vs. adalimumab) and 18.9% for placebo (P < 0.001 vs. adalimumab). Statistically significantly more adalimumab-treated patients (16.7%) than methotrexate-treated patients (7.3%) or placebo-treated patients (1.9%) achieved complete clearance of disease. The response to adalimumab was rapid, with a 57% improvement in mean PASI observed at week 4. Adverse events were similar across treatment groups. Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were greatest in the methotrexate group, primarily because of hepatic-related adverse events.

Conclusions

After 16 weeks, adalimumab demonstrated significantly superior efficacy and more rapid improvements in psoriasis compared with either methotrexate or placebo.

### Quantitative evaluation of biologic therapy options for psoriasis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^8178310e]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-severe psoriasis over the last decade. The first monoclonal antibodies targeting the tumor necrosis factor-alpha pathway were licensed in 2004 and, more recently, antibodies to IL-12/23 and IL-17A have been introduced. Currently, a total of six distinct biologic therapies are licensed for use in Europe and the USA: adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab, all of which perform significantly better than placebo, thus providing real choice in terms of treatment options for patients with psoriasis. Given this choice, the challenge is in deciding which treatment to use for which patients. Patients and clinicians are reliant on extrapolating data on average effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to help inform their decision-making process. Traditional pairwise meta-analyses of such trials are useful in summarizing these data; however, their application to practical clinical decision making is challenging when there are multiple treatments and multiple outcomes to consider. The issue is compounded by the paucity of direct head-to-head active-comparator RCTs needed to inform such pairwise meta-analyses.

We therefore wished to summarize the available data on biologic therapies for psoriasis in a meaningful way that can inform decision making by patients and clinicians. A useful way of understanding the differences between treatments is to perform a systematic review of the current evidence and a network meta-analysis (NMA), where a connecting network of evidence allows for comparisons to be made between all available interventions and a relative ranking of treatments produced. There are several advantages of this approach, namely, that the indirect evidence can fill gaps in the evidence and all comparisons can be considered simultaneously. In addition, the pooled estimates can provide greater statistical power and precision than can be obtained from individual studies.

Six NMAs have been published examining the relative efficacy of biologics for psoriasis. Treatment tolerability is an important consideration for patients, with such concerns directly influencing whether patients adhere to treatment after initiation. Tolerability is not directly measured in clinical trials; however, in a clinical trial setting, it can be inferred by patients' willingness to continue on treatment. Only one NMA has investigated both efficacy and the risk of adverse events of biologics for psoriasis, and thus far no study has investigated the efficacy and tolerability of treatments in combination.

### Comparative effectiveness of less commonly used systemic monotherapies and common combination therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis in the clinical setting [^c668fbd7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of psoriasis therapies in real-world settings remains relatively unknown.

Objective

We sought to compare the effectiveness of less commonly used systemic therapies and commonly used combination therapies for psoriasis.

Methods

This was a multicenter cross-sectional study of 203 patients with plaque psoriasis receiving less common systemic monotherapy (acitretin, cyclosporine, or infliximab) or common combination therapies (adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab and methotrexate) compared with 168 patients receiving methotrexate evaluated at 1 of 10 US outpatient dermatology sites participating in the Dermatology Clinical Effectiveness Research Network.

Results

In adjusted analyses, patients on acitretin (relative response rate 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–3.41), infliximab (relative response rate 1.93; 95% CI 1.26–2.98), adalimumab and methotrexate (relative response rate 3.04; 95% CI 2.12–4.36), etanercept and methotrexate (relative response rate 2.22; 95% CI 1.25–3.94), and infliximab and methotrexate (relative response rate 1.72; 95% CI 1.10–2.70) were more likely to have clear or almost clear skin compared with patients on methotrexate. There were no differences among treatments when response rate was defined by health-related quality of life.

Limitations

Single time point assessment may result in overestimation of effectiveness.

Conclusions

The efficacy of therapies in clinical trials may overestimate their effectiveness as used in clinical practice. Although physician-reported relative response rates were different among therapies, absolute differences were small and did not correspond to differences in patient-reported outcomes.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^7155e94a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents (acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, methotrexate), small molecules (apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod), anti-TNF alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), anti-IL12/23 (ustekinumab), anti-IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), anti-IL23 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other biologics (alefacept, itolizumab) for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant RCTs. We searched the trial results databases of a number of pharmaceutical companies and handsearched the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology meetings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic and biological treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI) 90) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE; we evaluated evidence as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing.

Main Results

We included 109 studies in our review (39,882 randomised participants, 68% men, all recruited from a hospital). The overall average age was 44 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo controlled (67%), 23% were head-to-head studies, and 10% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and placebo. We have assessed all treatments listed in the objectives (19 in total). In all, 86 trials were multicentric trials (two to 231 centres). All of the trials included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment at less than 24 weeks after randomisation); in fact, all trials included in the network meta-analysis were measured between 12 and 16 weeks after randomisation. We assessed the majority of studies (48/109) as being at high risk of bias; 38 were assessed as at an unclear risk, and 23, low risk. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90. In terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. Small molecules were associated with a higher chance of reaching PASI 90 compared to conventional systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, all of the anti-IL17 agents and guselkumab (an anti-IL23 drug) were significantly more effective than the anti-TNF alpha agents infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, but not certolizumab. Ustekinumab was superior to etanercept. No clear difference was shown between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. Only one trial assessed the efficacy of infliximab in this network; thus, these results have to be interpreted with caution. Tofacitinib was significantly superior to methotrexate, and no clear difference was shown between any of the other small molecules versus conventional treatments. Network meta-analysis also showed that ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90: the most effective drug was ixekizumab (risk ratio (RR) 32.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.61 to 44.60; Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 94.3; high-certainty evidence), followed by secukinumab (RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69; SUCRA = 86.5; high-certainty evidence), brodalumab (RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57; SUCRA = 84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to 30.38; SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 24.58, 95% CI 3.46 to 174.73; SUCRA = 75.7; moderate-certainty evidence), and ustekinumab (RR 19.91, 95% CI 15.11 to 26.23; SUCRA = 72.6; high-certainty evidence). We found no significant difference between all of the interventions and the placebo regarding the risk of serious adverse effects (SAEs): the relative ranking strongly suggested that methotrexate was associated with the best safety profile regarding all of the SAEs (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence), followed by ciclosporin (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very low-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.36; SUCRA = 70.9; moderate-certainty evidence), infliximab (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00; SUCRA = 64.4; very low-certainty evidence), alefacept (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; SUCRA = 62.6; low-certainty evidence), and fumaric acid esters (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.99; SUCRA = 57.7; very low-certainty evidence). Major adverse cardiac events, serious infections, or malignancies were reported in both the placebo and intervention groups. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to very low certainty for just over half of the treatment estimates in total, moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be considered with caution. Considering both efficacy (PASI 90 outcome) and acceptability (SAEs outcome), highly effective treatments also had more SAEs compared to the other treatments, and ustekinumab, infliximab, and certolizumab appeared to have the better trade-off between efficacy and acceptability. Regarding the other efficacy outcomes, PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1, the results were very similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for a third of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab are the best choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate to severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. At class level, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents, too. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured between 12 to 16 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficiently relevant for a chronic disease. Moreover, low numbers of studies were found for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 44 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs. Methotrexate appeared to have the best safety profile, but as the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, we cannot be sure of the ranking. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies as well. In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naïve patients, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents.

Etanercept and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor usage notes state that in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, TNF inhibitors including etanercept are often used in combination with methotrexate, whereas in psoriasis all clinical studies have been performed with etanercept as monotherapy; rebound does not typically occur when etanercept is discontinued, and an important issue is potential loss of efficacy over time, possibly related to the development of antibodies.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with psoriasis: an open-label study [^c0a84643]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In two previous phase 3 studies, up to 60 weeks of etanercept therapy significantly improved the symptoms of psoriasis and was well tolerated.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term safety of etanercept in an open-label extension study for up to 72 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

A total of 912 patients received 50 mg subcutaneous etanercept once weekly (OW) for the first 12 weeks of this extension study. Thereafter, eligible patients could maintain the 50 mg QW dose (n = 321) or escalate to 50 mg twice weekly (BIW; n = 591) anytime thereafter based on one of three predetermined criteria.

Results

Etanercept was well tolerated during 1056 patient-years of exposure; no difference was observed between the 50 mg QW and 50 mg BIW dosages in rates of adverse events and infections. Improvement in skin disease was maintained throughout the study. Patients who stopped and then restarted etanercept also showed improvement in psoriasis.

Conclusion

Psoriatic patients continued to benefit from open-label etanercept treatment, both continuous and interrupted therapy, which was generally well tolerated after a combined 2.5 years of experience.

14.8 Plaque Psoriasis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with ≥ 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week.

After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment score ranged from "moderate" (53%) to "severe" (41%) to "very severe" (6%).

BIOLOGICS

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors

Etanercept.

Etanercept was first approved by the FDA in children ages 4 and older with plaque psoriasis in November 2016. Etanercept functions as a human fusion protein binding to and blocking TNF- α. Weekly dose is subcutaneous injection of 0.8 mg/kg, adjusted to a maximum dose of 50 mg for those weighing 63 kg. In children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, etanercept significantly reduced disease severity (achieved PASI 50, 75, and 90 at 12 weeks) and this maintained through the 96-week extension study. Quality of life improvements (CDLQI) were more pronounced for etanercept than placebo at 12 weeks, achieving statistical significance. Though upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and mild, tolerable injection site reactions or pain were noted, no serious adverse events were reported. During the 264-week follow-up period, few participants withdrew due to adverse events, and there were no recorded instances of deaths or malignancies. Etanercept has the longest history of use in the pediatric population which contributes to its widespread use.

Adalimumab.

Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting TNF- α, binding both its soluble and membrane-bound forms. While not approved by the United States FDA for pediatric psoriasis, it was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2015 for children as young as 4 years specifically for psoriasis cases unresponsive to topical treatments and phototherapy. Adalimumab is administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg at weeks 0 and 1 and is then given every other week up to a maximum dose of 40 mg. In a comparison between methotrexate and adalimumab for severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents, those treated with adalimumab reached significant outcomes with PASI 50 and PASI 75 but not PASI 90 by week 16 and experienced better quality of life outcomes with sustained efficacy over 52 weeks. It should be noted that the average dose of methotrexate used in the study was below the typical dose for pediatric psoriasis. The safety profile of adalimumab did not differ significantly from that of methotrexate, and no additional safety concerns were identified. The most frequent adverse effects were nasopharyngitis and headache, followed by injection site reaction. With the availability of TNF- α inhibitors like adalimumab at lower costs, access to these treatments has markedly increased, offering more accessible options for patients.

### Efficacy of biologics in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^3a7c202d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ustekinumab, a novel monoclonal antibody for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, has recently received regulatory approval in Europe, bringing the total number of biologic agents licensed in this indication to five. To assist treatment selection in daily practice it is essential to understand the benefit/risk profile of these agents and in the absence of a clinical trial comparing all available biologics a number of reviews have used statistical techniques to generate estimates of the comparative effectiveness of these therapies through the available network of randomized clinical trials. These estimates have previously been published for a limited range of psoriasis biologic treatments, although, to date no review has compared all the currently available agents in Europe.

Objectives

To estimate the comparative effectiveness of all biologic agents indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis currently available in Europe based on the primary trial endpoints.

Methods

A number of databases were searched for details of randomized controlled trials of available biologics in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis in adults. Comparative effectiveness was estimated based on the reported Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 50, 75 and 90 response rates. A network meta-analysis conducted on the ordered probit scale and implemented as a Bayesian hierarchical model provided estimates for the probability of response and relative risk vs. placebo, based on all observed comparisons.

Results

Twenty trials were included in the meta-analysis including patients with a mean disease duration of 18-22years. Based on the indirect comparison and given a placebo PASI 50 response of 13%, infliximab had the highest predicted mean probability of response at PASI levels 50 (93%), 75 (80%) and 90 (54%), followed by ustekinumab 90mg at 90%, 74% and 46%, respectively, and then ustekinumab 45mg, adalimumab, etanercept and efalizumab.

Conclusions

The ordered probit model allowed a quantitative comparison of all currently licensed biologics, providing estimates on comparative effectiveness and a suggested ranking of treatments that is of potential use to decision-makers. However, the analysis is based on indirect comparisons of the primary endpoint reported from short-term randomized trials.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^fea6063e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treatment — case example and evidence-based approach: Photographs depict a patient 1 week after initiating anti–TNF therapy with generalized plaques and the same patient after 34 weeks with major improvement. Mild PsA is most often managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone, and if PsA is unresponsive after 2 to 3 months of therapy with NSAIDs, treatment with methotrexate (MTX) should be considered. For patients with moderate to severe PsA, MTX, TNF-alfa blockade, or the combination of these therapies is considered first-line treatment. In a 12-month randomized multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral cyclosporine plus oral MTX in PsA with prior incomplete MTX response, there was significant improvement in swollen joint count and C-reactive protein in the MTX–cyclosporine arm compared with baseline, but not in the MTX–placebo group. Across pivotal trials, the comparative efficacy of the 4 currently approved TNF-alfa blocking agents and ustekinumab shows similar efficacy for PsA signs and symptoms at the primary end point and marketed dosages, though differences are observed for cutaneous psoriasis; infliximab clears cutaneous psoriasis in the highest proportion and with the greatest rapidity, followed by adalimumab then etanercept. In TNF-alfa inhibitor studies of PsA, between 40% and 50% of patients were taking concomitant MTX. Golimumab has not been tested as monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who do not have PsA. PASI assessments in PsA studies often begin below 10, making PASI-75 evaluation difficult to interpret statistically. Ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy in a small phase II trial, with 42% of the 76 ustekinumab-treated patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20 response at week 12 compared with 14% of the 70 placebo-treated patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for psoriasis, more specifically with respect to monitoring during biologic therapy, BAD 2020 guidelines recommend to review the treatment goals, seek advice from a dermatologist experienced in biologic therapy and consider using any of the following strategies if a patient with psoriasis responds inadequately to the second or subsequent biologic agent:

- reiterate advice about modifiable factors contributing to poor response such as obesity and poor adherence (intentional or non-intentional)

- consider whether drug exposure is adequate

- optimize adjunctive therapy (such as switching from oral to subcutaneous methotrexate)

- switch to an alternative biologic agent

- alternative or supplementary non-biologic therapy approaches (such as inpatient topical therapy, phototherapy or systemic therapies).

### Economic evaluation of systemic therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis [^99fc801a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

New biologics have dramatically changed therapeutic options for psoriasis, albeit at additional cost.

Objectives

To determine the cost-effectiveness and optimal treatment sequence for moderate to severe psoriasis.

Methods

Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response rates from 22 randomized controlled trials evaluating biologic (adalimumab, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab) and nonbiologic systemic (methotrexate, ciclosporin) agents were considered. Short-term efficacy was based on relative probabilities of achieving PASI response (50/75/90) in a meta-analysis of trials. Published evidence and assumptions were used to predict long-term efficacy. Treatment benefits were determined by the relationship between PASI response and the EuroQOL 5D health utility measure. Costs included therapy, administration, monitoring and hospitalization. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and treatments ranked relative to supportive care.

Results

Infliximab provided the most incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) vs. supportive care (0.18 QALYs; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.13–0.24), followed by adalimumab (0.16 QALYs; 95% CI 0.11–0.22). Methotrexate and ciclosporin were less beneficial (0.13 and 0.08 QALYs, respectively) but were cost saving and considered the first two treatments in the optimal sequence. Comparing biologics, adalimumab was most cost effective (ICER pound30 000 per QALY), followed by etanercept (pound37 000 per QALY), efalizumab (pound40 000 per QALY) and infliximab (pound42 000 per QALY).

Conclusions

Methotrexate and ciclosporin are cost effective but require monitoring for toxicities. Of the biologics, adalimumab was most cost effective following conventional systemic treatment failure or inadequate response. Payers and policymakers will have to decide how to utilize their budgets effectively for treating patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

Although the studies reviewed above have provided some evidence that therapies combining a conventional agent with a biologic are more effective than those agents used alone, and may be well tolerated in patients with psoriasis, there are still a number of questions that remain regarding the most appropriate use of this strategy. Some of the trials involved patients with psoriatic arthritis and included those with psoriasis disease severity below the criteria for psoriasis trials, or had small sample sizes, or measured efficacy using inadequate or low efficacy endpoints (e.g. PASI 50). It is necessary to identify the safest and most effective combinations to limit potentially dangerous adverse events while achieving higher rates of skin clearance. In addition, the long-term safety of combination therapy is of particular concern; data are not available from controlled trials. Combination therapy with biologics may be beneficial in the management of comorbidities commonly found in patients with psoriasis. For instance, both TNF-α inhibitors and methotrexate reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, but it is unknown if their combination would produce additional benefits. To fully understand the potential positive or negative influence of combination therapy on comorbidities, additional studies are required. Patients with psoriasis are also more likely to develop other health issues such as metabolic syndrome, which may be affected by combination therapy. TNF-α inhibitors may improve insulin resistance and fasting glucose levels, suggesting a possible beneficial role in managing metabolic syndrome, but other studies have reported increases in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol following treatment. Likewise, further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of combination therapy on metabolic syndrome. Combination therapy may be a more cost-effective method of managing psoriasis, but economic evaluations are needed to determine potential savings in healthcare costs. Disease management for patients with severe psoriasis could be improved, particularly if the findings to date with short-term use of phototherapy or traditional systemic agents in combination with biologic therapy are confirmed in the long term. Finally, it remains to be determined if biologic therapies can be used in combination without an increased safety risk.

### Comparative efficacy of biological treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: a network meta-analysis adjusting for cross-trial differences in reference arm response [^80306a48]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple biological therapies are approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Objectives

To assess the short-term efficacy of biological treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis via a network meta-analysis that adjusts for reference arm response rates.

Methods

Fifteen randomized trials of biological treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis were identified. Rates of response, assessed as 50%, 75% and 90% reductions in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), were compared using a network meta-analysis. To account for variation across trials, the model was adjusted for placebo responses, the relevance of which was assessed by testing its statistical significance, impact on model fit, and extent to which lack of adjustment confounded the efficacy estimates for biologics.

Results

Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 response rates for placebo arms ranged from 1·8% to 18·9%. The probability of achieving a PASI 75 response was 80·5% [95% credible interval (CrI) 74·8–85·7] with infliximab 5 mg kg(-1); 72·5% (95% CI 66·1–78·3) with ustekinumab 90 mg; 67·5% (95% CI 60·7–73·9) with ustekinumab 45 mg; 66·2% (95% CI 57·3–73·3) with adalimumab 40 mg; 51·9% (95% CI 45·7–58·4) with etanercept 50 mg; and 38·0% (95% CI 31·6–45·1) with etanercept 25 mg. Infliximab had the highest PASI 75 response. Adalimumab and both ustekinumab doses had significantly higher PASI 75 responses than both etanercept doses. There were no significant differences among adalimumab and ustekinumab doses.

Conclusions

A model adjusted for reference arm response rates was found to fit clinical trial data significantly better than unadjusted models.

### Use of biologic agents in combination with other therapies for the treatment of psoriasis [^93ddfb1c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale for Combination Therapy

Some of the rationales for combining conventional therapies with biologic agents for psoriasis treatment have a historical basis in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. In particular, methotrexate has been widely used in combination with biologic agents in clinical trials involving patients with psoriatic arthritis. Indeed, the AAD guidelines recommend disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (e.g. methotrexate), TNF-α antagonists, or a combination of these agents for moderate to severely active psoriatic arthritis. The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) recommends that "a combination of two or more agents could be used in those patients who fail to respond to a single agent, or who present (with) joint damage progression in spite of treatment". The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has made similar recommendations, but notes that there is a lack of robust evidence in psoriatic arthritis for this type of therapy.

The basis for these recommendations is rooted in the potential benefits that combination therapy may offer these patients, and can be extended to patients with psoriasis. These rationales include the potential efficacy synergies that may permit a more complete response and achieve a response more quickly, or both, as well as a potentially diminished risk of specific safety concerns that are caused by broad immunosuppressive therapy or that have been otherwise associated with conventional therapies (e.g. hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and bone marrow toxicity). In addition, because the increased cytokine levels associated with psoriasis may also be associated with other inflammatory comorbid conditions, interventions targeting these upregulated cytokines may also provide a broader benefit to the patient. For example, a recent literature review found that methotrexate and TNF-α inhibitors may reduce cardiovascular events in individuals with psoriasis, although additional studies are required in this area. Additionally, data from clinical trials evaluating adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis demonstrate that patients on methotrexate had significantly higher blood levels of adalimumab than patients treated with adalimumab alone. Thus, methotrexate, through an unknown mechanism, may boost drug levels of adalimumab. It is important to note that exposure to multiple drugs could also increase the risk of certain side effects, depending on the safety profiles of the individual agents being combined.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^ec353bea]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate in psoriasis — methotrexate is the most commonly prescribed traditional systemic therapy worldwide for psoriasis, and detailed dosing and monitoring guidelines have been published by the National Psoriasis Foundation. The rheumatology guidelines for the use of methotrexate are less stringent than those in dermatology, especially in the monitoring of hepatotoxicity, and methotrexate can be dramatically effective even in severe cases. Methotrexate has been used in combination with all of the approved biologic agents for psoriasis; the greatest experience is with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and methotrexate has been used to suppress antibodies against the two monoclonal tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, adalimumab and infliximab. It is not known whether the use of methotrexate and biologics causes additive immunosuppression.

Combination therapy — methotrexate with etanercept or narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) shows enhanced efficacy: in a randomized study of 239 patients, at 24 weeks PASI 75 occurred in 77.3% on combination therapy versus 60.3% with etanercept monotherapy and "clear" or "almost clear" in 71.8% versus 54.3%; adverse events were 74.9% versus 59.8% without a difference in serious adverse events; a systematic review found etanercept plus methotrexate more beneficial than monotherapy for PASI 75 (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14–1.45) but with increased adverse effects (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10–1.42); methotrexate with NB-UVB increased efficacy and more rapid skin clearing at lower cumulative doses than either monotherapy, though long-term photocarcinogenesis effects remain to be determined.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^21e904a3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Biologics have significantly changed psoriasis treatment over the decades and have greatly improved patients' health‐related quality of life and patient‐relevant outcomes. 30, 31, 32, 33 ADA has been used to treat adults with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis for over a decade, and has shown superior efficacy to systemic treatments, such as MTX. Its accumulating safety data resulted in a first‐line label for adults and children. 34, 35 By blocking TNF‐α, ADA inhibits inflammation in psoriatic lesions by decreasing the level of proinflammatory cytokines. Other biologics approved for the treatment of children with plaque psoriasis are etanercept (age ≥ 6 years with severe disease) and ustekinumab (age ≥ 12 years with moderate‐to‐severe disease).

In this active‐comparator‐controlled study, response at the end of the initial 16 weeks to ADA 0·8 mg kg −1 was maintained through the 52‐week LTE period of this trial. These results in children with severe psoriasis are consistent with results from ADA clinical trials in adults with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. In an analysis of 250 adults, PASI 75, 90 and 100 rates after 160 weeks of ADA treatment were 76%, 50% and 31%, respectively, 36 compared with 68·5%, 48·1% and 29·6% of children overall in the current study. In an interim analysis from a 10‐year observational registry of ADA treatment in adults (n = 6059), PGA 0/1 was achieved between 3 and 5 years of treatment by > 60% of adults, compared with 60·2% of children overall in the current study. 37

Methotrexate in psoriasis therapy — Table III recommendations: Methotrexate is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. Methotrexate is less effective than adalimumab and infliximab for cutaneous psoriasis. Methotrexate is efficacious for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (peripheral arthritis, but not for axial involvement); in psoriatic arthritis, the efficacy of methotrexate is lower than tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors. Recommended methotrexate dosage typically ranges from 7.5 to 25 mg weekly, and the dose can be given as a single dose or in 3 doses over 24 hours. Methotrexate can be administered orally or subcutaneously. A test dose should be considered, especially in patients with impaired kidney function. Administration of folic acid or folinic acid is recommended to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic adverse effects, and large folic acid and folinic acid doses may reduce the efficacy of methotrexate. Combination therapy with methotrexate and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy can be considered for adult patients with generalized plaque psoriasis to enhance efficacy and lower cumulative doses of both treatments.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy [^f484f292]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Psoriasis phototherapy — narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) combined with adalimumab or ustekinumab produced defined PASI outcomes and histologic changes. In patients treated with NB-UVB thrice weekly in conjunction with adalimumab, 40 mg every other week, 95% achieved PASI 75, 75% achieved PASI 90, and 55% achieved a 100% improvement at week 12, with 65% retaining PASI 75 at week 24; there were no monotherapy arms, no serious adverse events were recorded, and mild-to-moderate UV erythema was the most frequent adverse effect. In a split-body study during adalimumab therapy, the end of treatment PASI for irradiated halves was 2.0 versus 6.9 with mean PASI reduction 86% versus 53%. With ustekinumab plus split-body NB-UVB 3 times per week for 6 weeks, mean PASI score reduction was 82% in irradiated halves versus 54%. After 6 weeks of etanercept plus NB-UVB, biopsy specimens had greater histologic improvement than plaques shielded from UVB.

### New-onset psoriasis with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor treatment in inflammatory diseases… [^f1a38f99]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The patients relevant for the sensitivity analysis are marked with dashed lines. IBD indicates inflammatory bowel disease; IMID, immune-mediated inflammatory disease; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; TNFi, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor. Conventional therapy indicates nonbiologic therapy relevant to inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. TNFi indicates tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor. The time in TNFi exposure needed for 1 additional event of TNFi-associated psoriasis was 241 patient-years for any type of TNFi-associated psoriasis, and the hazard ratio for any type of new-onset psoriasis for patients receiving TNFi was 2. 38 compared with conventional therapy.

Meaning Although TNFi treatment in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is associated with increased risk of new-onset psoriasis compared with conventional therapy, the absolute risk remains modest; physicians should be aware of this adverse event but ought not change their initial approach to treatment with TNFis. Importance Tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor –associated psoriasis is a rare adverse event following TNFi treatment. Data on the risk of developing TNFi-associated psoriasis when treated with TNFi are sparse. Objective To investigate the associated risk between new-onset psoriasis and TNFi treatment compared with nonbiologic conventional treatment. During treatment with TNFi, the hazard ratio was 2. 12 for developing nonpustular psoriasis and
6. 50 for pustular psoriasis compared with conventional treatment.

Exposure needed for 1 additional patient to be harmed was 241 patient-years for any type of TNFi-associated psoriasis, 342 patient-years for nonpustular psoriasis, and 909 patient-years for pustular psoriasis. Although the risk of new-onset psoriasis increased for both nonpustular and pustular types of psoriasis in TFNi-treated patients, the absolute risk remained modest at 241 patient-years of exposure need for 1 additional event and an estimated absolute risk difference around 5 per 1000 patient-years, indicating that the approach to treatment of patients in need of TNFi treatment should not change. Paradoxically, psoriasis develops in a number of patients during tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor treatment — henceforth referred to as TNFi-associated psoriasis. 8 This psoriasis appears to be a result of a prolonged production of type I interferon caused by the inhibition of the TNF-dependent maturation process of plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

9 The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and includes both nonpustular and pustular types of psoriasis. It most often occurs within the first 1. 5 years of treatment with TNFi but can occur within a week and up to several years after the initiation of treatment. 10, 11 Even though TNFi agents are widely used, studies on the epidemiology of TNFi-associated psoriasis are scarce, limited in the number of. included patients, and often include patients with established disease, making it difficult to interpret data clearly because the development of psoriasis may be a result of treatment failure or an adverse reaction. 12, 13 Furthermore, IBD is associated with development of psoriasis, 14, 15 and as studies on TNFi-associated psoriasis seldom use control groups, the extent of TNFi-associated psoriasis remains unknown.

### The treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with etanercept: practical considerations on monotherapy, combination therapy, and safety [^8b8deafb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2004). Low credibility.

It is quite evident the pathogenesis of psoriasis is modulated by immune-mediated mechanisms that invoke activated T cells and inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Current immunosuppressive systemic treatments may be effective in controlling psoriasis to a certain degree but have significant drawbacks, such as toxicity and relapse of the disease on discontinuation. The advantages of biologic agents are their greater selectivity in targeting specific pathways in the inflammatory cascade of psoriasis with a much higher safety profile. With specific antagonism directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, etanercept has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

### Systemic therapies for psoriasis: an evidence-based update [^d3d673a7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of psoriasis has evolved over the years, with the focus now largely on the use of biologic agents. With treatment options expanding, evidence-based studies to guide physicians' treatment decisions become increasingly important.

Objective

Our objective was to review current literature to provide an evidence-based update on systemic therapies for psoriasis.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was conducted from 1 January 2012 through 1 July 2013 to identify all randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews of systemic psoriasis treatments.

Results

A total of 46 publications were identified and reviewed. Randomized clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis focused heavily on biologic agents, both currently approved agents and anti-interleukin (IL)-17 agents in development. The anti-IL-17 agents appear effective according to phase II clinical trials. Several new oral agents are being studied, and, although they do not appear as effective as the biologic agents, they may be an option as an alternative to traditional oral agents, with more favorable safety profiles. Several systematic reviews focused on efficacy among the biologics, with infliximab consistently superior to the others, and etanercept the least effective of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Longer-term safety data on biologics is now available and encouraging.

Limitations

Current studies of traditional oral therapies are lacking.

Conclusions

Current studies continue to support the use of biologic agents in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, with better efficacy and safety profiles than traditional systemic agents. Newer anti-IL-17 agents and several new oral agents are in development and have shown promise in clinical trials.

### Anti-TNF agents for paediatric psoriasis [^6c9e1013]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that may develop at any age. Estimates for the United States and Europe suggest that psoriasis accounts for 4% of skin diseases in children. In most cases, the condition is mild and can be treated with creams. However, a small percentage of children have moderate to severe disease that requires drugs, such as ciclosporin or methotrexate, and some will require injections with newer biological agents, such as anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor) drugs. Anti-TNF drugs (among them etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) are designed to reduce inflammation in the body caused by tumour necrosis factor. Evidence for the safety and efficacy of these biological agents in paediatric psoriasis is lacking.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of paediatric psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to July 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched 13 trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and key review articles for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We handsearched conference proceedings and attempted to contact trial authors and relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's and European Medicines Agency's adverse effects databases.

Selection Criteria

All relevant RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in individuals less than 18 years of age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts and performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included studies. One review author entered data into Review Manager (RevMan), and a second review author checked the data. We also attempted to obtain unclear data from the trial authors where possible. Our primary outcomes were investigator-assessed number of participants achieving a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index-75 (PASI 75) compared to baseline, improvement in quality of life using an instrument such as Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), and adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants achieving PASI 50 and the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA).

Main Results

We included one study with 211 participants (median age 13 years), in which etanercept (dosage ranged from 0.8 to 50 mg per kilogram of body weight) was compared to placebo. Follow-up was over a 48-week period. At week 12, 57% versus 11% who received etanercept or placebo, respectively, achieved the PASI 75 (risk ratio 4.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.83 to 8.65; high-quality evidence). Absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat to obtain a benefit with etanercept was 45% (95% CI 33.95 to 56.40) and 2 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.95), respectively. The percentage improvement from baseline of the CDLQI scores at week 12 was better in the etanercept group than the placebo group (52.3% versus 17.5%, respectively (P = 0.0001)). Analysis between the groups showed an effect size that was clinically important (mean difference 2.30, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.75; high-quality evidence). However, means, medians, and minimal important difference results and results of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Stein Impact on Family Scale, and Harter Self-Perception Profile for Children scores must be interpreted with caution, as they were not prespecified outcomes. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were resolved without sequelae. Deaths or other events such as malignant tumours, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or demyelination were not reported in the included study. Also, 13% of participants in the placebo group and 53% in the etanercept group had a PGA of clear or almost clear (risk ratio 3.96, 95% CI 2.36 to 6.66; high-quality evidence) at week 12.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found only one RCT evaluating the use of this type of biological therapy. Although the risk of publication bias was high, as we included only one industry-sponsored RCT, the risk of allocation, selection, performance, attrition, and selective reporting biases for all outcomes (except for CDLQI) was low, and no short-term serious adverse events were found. We can conclude, based on this single included study, that etanercept seems to be efficacious and safe (at least in the short term) for the treatment of paediatric psoriasis. However, as the GRADE approach refers not to individual studies but to a body of evidence, we shall wait for the results of the ongoing studies in a future update of this review. In addition, future studies should evaluate quality-of-life endpoints established a priori and standardise primary outcome measures such as PASI 75, and should include the PGA as a secondary endpoint. Also, collating and reporting adverse events uniformly is required to better evaluate safety.

### Biosimilars in rheumatology: a review of the evidence and their place in the treatment algorithm [^d50c13cb]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

How should biosimilars fit into current clinical practice?

The two reference anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept) and their biosimilars are indicated for use in patients with rheumatic diseases (plus psoriasis and IBD), generally following lack of response or intolerance to first-line or standard therapy, the exception being their use in patients with severe active and progressive RA, in which they are approved for first-line use. Guidelines on the use of biologic agents for patients with rheumatic diseases follow a similar theme. For example, current European guidelines on the treatment of RA, which were updated in 2016, provide due consideration to biosimilars as part of the bDMARD treatment algorithm [6]. In those patients who do not respond adequately to first-line treatment, when alternative treatment strategies such as a treat-to-target (or tight control) approach with combination conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) and the use of combination csDMARDs following inadequate response to csDMARD therapy have failed, or those patients who experience unacceptable toxicity within 6 months of starting therapy (designated phase I), addition of firstly a bDMARD [an anti-TNF agent (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, including EMA/FDA approved biosimilar DMARDs), abatacept, IL-6 inhibitors, or rituximab] or secondly a Jak inhibitor should be considered either following an alternative synthetic DMARD strategy or in place of an alternative synthetic DMARD strategy (designated phase II) (Fig. 2). In the scenario where this first trial of biologic therapy fails, an alternative bDMARD should be considered (an alternative anti-TNF agent, abatacept, IL-6 inhibitor, or rituximab) or a Jak inhibitor. However, it would be expected that, even when current treatment algorithms for rheumatic disease are followed, a significant proportion of patients treated with bDMARDs would be unresponsive to treatment, would lose responsiveness or would experience unacceptable side effects leading to withdrawal.

### Comparative effectiveness of targeted immunomodulators for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^02f13673]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The comparative effectiveness of available targeted immunomodulators for moderate-to-severe psoriasis has not been evaluated.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of targeted immunomodulators for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Systematic literature review of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomized trials of 8 targeted immunomodulators that evaluated clinical benefits or harm. The primary outcome was a 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. We also conducted a network meta-analysis adjusted for placebo response to perform indirect comparisons between agents.

Results

In the network meta-analysis, the targeted immunomodulators ordered by increasing relative risk (demonstrating greater likelihood) of achieving a 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index relative to placebo were as follows: apremilast (6.2), etanercept (9.6), adalimumab (13.0), ustekinumab (14.0), secukinumab (15.4), infliximab (16.2), brodalumab (17.3), and ixekizumab (17.9). Ixekizumab, brodalumab, and infliximab were all statistically superior to ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, and apremilast; results were similar to those of head-to-head studies where data were available.

Limitations

Much of the evidence is short-term (covering 10–16 weeks); limited direct comparisons.

Conclusions

The interleukin 17A inhibitors are more effective in achieving clearance than ustekinumab, and they are generally more effective than etanercept, adalimumab, and apremilast.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis in pediatric patients [^423db7c7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric psoriasis — biologic therapy recommendations and dosing detail the following: Etanercept is recommended as an effective therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis in children 6 years of age and older, with dosing typically once weekly administered subcutaneously at 0.8 mg/kg with a maximum of 50 mg weekly. Adalimumab is recommended for off-label use as an effective therapy in children and adolescents with moderate to severe psoriasis; the dose of adalimumab is 0.8 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) at weeks 0 and 1 and then is given every other week, and adalimumab administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg is more efficacious than at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. Infliximab can be recommended as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for pediatric patients with severe plaque or pustular psoriasis that is unresponsive to other systemic medications, rapidly progressive, unstable, and/or life threatening, with a starting dose of an infusion of 5 mg/kg administered on weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks. Ustekinumab is recommended as an effective therapy for adolescents 12 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and can be used for pediatric patients younger than 12 years old with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; ustekinumab is given at weeks 0, 4, and 16 and then every 12 weeks with weight-based dosing as follows: 0.75 mg/kg if < 60 kg, 45 mg if 60 to ≤ 100 kg, 90 mg if > 100 kg. Biologics may be safely combined with topical corticosteroids, with or without a vitamin D analogue, to augment effectiveness for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and the major risk for biologics in children is injection site reaction, but patients should be monitored for their increased risk of infection.

### An evolution in switching therapy for psoriasis patients who fail to meet treatment goals [^b94defbb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

The recent availability of biologic agents that may be safer and more effective than conventional systemic has focused considerations for switching on safety, achieving greater skin clearance, and patient satisfaction. The high specificity and efficacy of biologics generally greatly outweighs the low risk of experiencing adverse events with these agents 29, as little‐to‐no cumulative toxicity has been observed in studies of biologics, and biologics are associated with less systemic toxicity than conventional agents 30, 31.

Findings from real‐world observational studies indicate that patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis who are switched from conventional systemic agents to biologics typically do very well, experiencing improvements in PASI score and measures of overall and dermatology‐specific quality of life 21. However, while biologics are generally very effective, 27% of patients treated with TNFα inhibitors were found to discontinue treatment after 29 months due to lack of initial efficacy (primary failure), loss of efficacy over time (secondary failure), or intolerance 32. Therefore, strategies are needed to maintain efficacy with acceptable tolerability. Switching from one biologic to another is now commonplace, although guidance on switching practices is limited 20. Alternatively, dose adjustments can be made with some biologics (i.e. adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab) 18, or biologics can be combined with conventional systemic or topical therapies to improve or maintain efficacy 12, 18, 29. When different types of treatments are combined, efficacy goals can often be met using lower doses of each drug, potentially resulting in less treatment‐associated toxicity 18.
