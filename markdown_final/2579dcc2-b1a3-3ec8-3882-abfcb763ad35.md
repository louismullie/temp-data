## Question

Adl assessmnt tools for older adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ADL assessment tools for older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining basic ADLs versus instrumental ADLs and why both matter. Then, I should verify which tools are most validated and commonly used. Next, I will review psychometrics and practical considerations like administration time and setting. After that, I should consider special populations and emerging technologies. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't gloss over basics. Basic activities of daily living, or BADLs, are core self-care tasks such as bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding, whereas instrumental activities of daily living, or IADLs, are more complex tasks required for independent community living, including managing medications, finances, transportation, shopping, meal preparation, housekeeping, and communication by phone or email, and I should note that IADL deficits often precede BADL deficits in cognitive decline, which is clinically important for early detection [^2cef828a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which tools to pick without anchoring on the classics. The Katz Index of Independence in ADL is a six-item scale covering bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding, and it remains a staple in geriatrics and primary care for its simplicity and wide validation, including endorsement by cardiology guidance for routine functional screening in older adults [^c795fc6c] [^62c884f2]. The Barthel Index expands to ten items and provides a 0–100 score with established reliability and predictive validity in community-dwelling older adults, making it useful when a more granular BADL profile is needed [^9046527b] [^d6f3d591]. For IADLs, the Lawton-Brody IADL Scale is the most widely used, though I should double-check its psychometrics and acknowledge its dated task set, which some authors argue needs modernization to reflect contemporary activities like online banking and smartphone use [^c14216c1] [^268ce27d].

> Wait, let me verify psychometric strength across these tools so I don't overstate their performance. The Barthel Index shows good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha around 0.82 in community cohorts and has demonstrated predictive validity for mortality at 6 months with an AUC near 0.74, supporting its clinical utility for risk stratification [^9046527b]. The Lawton IADL scale generally exhibits excellent reliability and construct validity, though criterion validity is only medium and many studies still lack complete psychometric reporting, which means I should be cautious about cross-setting comparisons and prefer tools with documented responsiveness when tracking change [^f6e65997]. The Functional Independence Measure is comprehensive but often shows ceiling effects in higher-functioning older adults, so I need to ensure it's matched to the right population and complemented by IADL measures when subtle deficits are suspected [^c14216c1].

> I need to check practical considerations that drive uptake in real-world care. The Katz ADL can be completed in under 5 minutes and is feasible for pre-visit screening or in-clinic use, which explains its inclusion in cardiology and oncology workflows for older adults [^c795fc6c] [^3ee1519f]. The Barthel Index adds only modest time and provides a quantitative score that clinicians can trend over visits, while the Lawton IADL typically takes 5–10 minutes and can be administered by trained staff or informants, which is crucial when cognitive insight is limited [^199b125a]. For hospitalized or rehab settings, I should confirm that tools like the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale and modified Reintegration to Normal Living Index have demonstrated responsiveness to change, which can guide discharge planning and follow-up intensity [^4d4eaa36].

> But wait, what if the patient has cognitive impairment or lives in a different cultural context. I should double-check that IADL tools are sensitive to early executive dysfunction and that they are culturally appropriate, especially in low- and middle-income countries where translated or adapted IADL measures are increasingly used to support dementia diagnosis and care planning, though external validation remains uneven and tool selection should be tailored to literacy, gender roles, and local task relevance [^2ee57ad6] [^c177c8ef]. In MCI, IADL deficits are typically the earliest functional change, so using instruments that capture cognitively demanding tasks like medication management or finances improves diagnostic discrimination and longitudinal monitoring, which I should explicitly build into the care pathway [^2cef828a] [^5847d3bf].

> Let me consider emerging and performance-based approaches, because self-report can miss deficits in insight-limited conditions. Computerized simulations and smart-home assessments show promise for ecologically valid, proxy-free evaluation of IADLs, with early data demonstrating discrimination between MCI and cognitively normal adults and good user acceptability, though I should confirm that these remain adjuncts pending broader validation and workflow integration [^e5ffe736] [^5256e905]. Virtual reality and sensor-based systems can quantify process features like inefficiency or errors that inform executive dysfunction, but I need to ensure equitable access and digital literacy before recommending routine deployment [^9c30be68].

> Hold on, I should verify how to integrate ADL/IADL into a broader geriatric assessment so I don't miss modifiable drivers. Functional status correlates with mobility, continence, nutrition, and cognition, and data-driven models show that these domains can approximate ADL disability with high accuracy, supporting targeted screening and early intervention to prevent decline, which is particularly relevant in outpatient and resource-constrained settings [^2633d1e9] [^c83025d5]. Guidelines in oncology and diabetes care endorse routine ADL/IADL assessment to uncover vulnerabilities that alter treatment decisions and follow-up intensity, reinforcing the need to embed these tools into standard workflows rather than reserving them for specialty consults [^3ee1519f] [^e7dfe2ee].

> I should double-check that my bottom-line recommendation is balanced and evidence-aligned. For most clinicians assessing older adults, a dual approach using a BADL tool and an IADL tool is prudent: the Katz ADL for rapid screening of basic independence and the Lawton IADL for detecting early functional decline, with the Barthel Index as an alternative when a more detailed BADL score is desired or when tracking change over time [^c795fc6c] [^f6e65997] [^9046527b]. In settings with higher acuity or rehabilitation focus, pair these with performance-based measures like the Short Physical Performance Battery or Timed Up and Go to capture mobility and fall risk, and consider validated alternatives such as the Functional Activities Questionnaire or the IADL Profile when cognitive impairment is suspected or when a more contemporary task set is needed [^b85e61a0] [^5b165b75] [^dcaa0bd2]. If the clinical question is dementia screening or staging, prioritize IADL instruments with documented diagnostic accuracy and consider combining IADL with cognitive screens to improve specificity, recognizing that no single tool fits all contexts and local validation matters [^a28f40c1] [^2ee57ad6].

ADL assessment tools for older adults include **basic ADL tools** (Katz Index, Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure) and **instrumental ADL tools** (Lawton-Brody IADL Scale, Functional Activities Questionnaire, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile) [^b85e61a0] [^f6e65997]. These tools are **validated for reliability and validity** [^e02b7fe7] and are used to detect functional decline, guide care planning, and monitor outcomes [^c14216c1]. Selection should match the clinical context, population, and setting, with **IADL tools more sensitive to early cognitive decline** [^2cef828a] and **basic ADL tools better for severe disability** [^c14216c1].

---

## Emerging and innovative tools

Recent developments include **performance-based and technology-enabled assessments** that improve ecological validity and detect subtle deficits [^e5ffe736].

- **Computerized simulations**: Assess cognitively intensive IADLs (e.g. medication management, finances) with good reliability and validity [^e5ffe736].
- **Smart home technologies**: Objective, proxy-free assessment of IADLs in naturalistic settings [^5256e905].
- **Virtual reality**: Ecologically valid assessment of functional tasks [^9c30be68].

---

## Clinical considerations and recommendations

- **Population-specific tools**: Choose tools validated for the target population (e.g. dementia, stroke, community-dwelling older adults) [^c14216c1] [^2ee57ad6].
- **Setting-specific tools**: Select tools appropriate for the clinical setting (e.g. hospital, rehabilitation, community) [^4d4eaa36].
- **Comprehensive assessment**: Combine basic ADL and IADL tools to capture the full spectrum of functional ability [^c14216c1].
- **Regular reassessment**: Monitor functional status over time to detect decline and guide interventions [^5847d3bf].

---

ADL assessment tools are essential for **evaluating functional status in older adults** [^ed0e9143]. Basic ADL tools assess self-care tasks, while IADL tools evaluate complex tasks for independent living. Emerging tools offer innovative, ecologically valid approaches. Selection should be tailored to the clinical context, population, and setting to optimize care and outcomes.

### Detecting disabilities in everyday life: evidence from a geriatric assessment [^d4442422]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many countries around the world are faced with rapidly aging societies. This demographic shift not only poses capacity problems for health care providers but also changes the quality-related requirements for health services. Early detection of diseases and impairments of everyday life is therefore an indispensable task to maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system.

This study addresses the mental and physical impairments of older people who underwent geriatric screening to assess their health status and potential limitations to participation in daily life. Such assessments typically rely on formal tools such as questionnaires and tests to evaluate the physical and mental dimensions of older adults' health. A key issue is the measurement of functional impairments, i.e. a person's inability to perform activities needed in everyday life. In clinical practice, the activities of daily living (ADL) score is used to measure such limitations. ADL is part of the geriatric assessment and represents a compound index of different everyday tasks, such as the ability to toilet, bathe or dress. The collection of these components requires ongoing inpatient observation and queries to the referring physician as well as large amounts of bureaucratic work. Providing an accurate and comprehensive measure of ADL is therefore a time-consuming and costly task. Hence, using more easily available information that is also collected in geriatric assessments to approximate ADL may facilitate a more efficient use of clinical resources, which in turn may improve the treatment of geriatric patients.

### Functional capacity and functional ability in an aging population: a scoping review [^0ec71144]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The rapidly aging global population brought increasing attention to the concepts of functional capacity (FC) and functional ability (FA), key indicators of health and well-being in older adults. Despite their importance, FC and FA are inconsistently defined, with varying dimensions and measurement approaches. This scoping review clarifies these concepts by summarizing current definitions, mapping their dimensions, identifying assessment tools, and proposing precise operational definitions to guide future research.

Research Design and Methods

In this scoping review, a search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo, supplemented by snowball searches of reference lists. Included were studies involving adults aged 60 and older, published after 2015. Definitions, dimensions, and measurement tools of FC and FA were extracted and analyzed.

Results

Among 85 included studies, only 16 explicitly defined FC or FA, with significant variability. Four primary dimensions emerged: physical, mental, social, and activities of daily living (ADL). FC predominantly emphasized physical health, while FA focused on ADL independence. Measurement tools were highly diverse, with 97 instruments identified, yet limited adoption of multi-dimensional approaches.

Discussion and Implications

The findings highlight the need for standardized definitions and comprehensive, multidimensional assessments of FC and FA. Adopting the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework offers a potential solution to align research and practice. Standardized, holistic approaches to defining and measuring FC and FA are essential to advance research, guide clinical interventions, and support aging-related policy development worldwide.

### The instrumental activity of daily living profile in aging: a feasibility study [^dcaa0bd2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Dysfunctions in complex activities of daily living (ADLs) are a normal part of the aging process. However, differentiating functional decline associated with healthy aging from the subtle decline experienced by individuals with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia constitutes a challenge. Finding an appropriate tool that can capture these subtle but important functional changes represents a priority.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile (IADL Profile) with elderly participants and to describe their level of difficulty encountered in each task.

Methods

The tool was administered to a group of 40 elderly participants living in the community.

Results

The IADL Profile was found to be feasible to use in older individuals; the tool also showed sensitivity to the difficulties experienced by this population in everyday functioning.

Conclusion

The IADL Profile is a promising ecological tool to evaluate independence in aging and may help to identify individuals with MCI. This tool may also contribute to the development of tailored interventions to enhance everyday functioning in the older population.

### Practical assessment and management of vulnerabilities in older patients receiving systemic cancer therapy: ASCO guideline update [^c1662be8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — literature characteristics for geriatric assessment (GA) in older adults with cancer are summarized as follows: For Clinical Question 1, a total of 15 publications met eligibility criteria, including the respective primary reports of nine RCTs, four reports of secondary analyses of data from the primary RCTs, one systematic review of GA studies, and one systematic review of GA studies with meta-analysis; the identified RCTs were published between 2020 and 2022 and evaluated comparable GA with management interventions; across these nine RCTs, the primary outcomes included completion of planned chemotherapy (n = 2); the proportion of patients with grade 3–5 toxicity (n = 2); quality of life (n = 2); overall survival (n = 1); a composite criterion of 6-month mortality, functional impairment (fall in the Activities of Daily Living [ADL] score ≥ 2), and weight loss (≥ 10%; n = 1); and patient satisfaction with communication about aging-related concerns (n = 1). For Clinical Question 2 concerning which GA tools should be used to predict outcomes and help inform the development of the PGA, a total of 11 publications were identified, including reports published between 2018 and 2022 of seven clinician surveys, one systematic literature review, and three narrative literature reviews.

### Quality improvement in dementia care: dementia management quality measurement set 2018 implementation update [^b85e61a0]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Functional assessment — recent literature underscores the importance of evaluating both activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and measuring complex IADLs is reported to help detect deficits as early as the beginning stages of dementia; current quality measures require a validated tool or evidence of direct assessment of specific domains of ADLs and IADLs, with Lawton IADL, Barthel ADL index, Katz Index of IADL, and the Functional Activities Questionnaire noted as commonly used instruments, and use of a validated instrument may increase objectivity, accuracy, and standardization.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^153c80fc]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Older adult functional assessment — psychologists are often called upon to assess the functional abilities of older adults, including activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). In 2019, approximately 44% of the older adult U.S. population reported having one or more disabilities, though advance age and functional decline are not necessarily linearly related. Psychologists are encouraged to be proficient in the functional assessment of strengths and limitations in ADLs and IADLs in the context of environmental demands and supports. Aging in itself does not typically result in disability for most older adults, and disabilities among older adults are often due to some combination of age-related cognitive and physical changes and the direct and indirect effects of chronic diseases. Psychologists are increasingly being asked to evaluate older adults' decision-making capacity. To make ecologically valid recommendations, psychologists often integrate standardized assessments such as the Katz IADL assessment and the Independent Living Scales with clinical interview information, collateral sources, direct observations of functional performance, and other pertinent considerations; several approaches to assess functional abilities range from questionnaires to performance-based evaluation.

Key Points

Assessment of functional status forms a core part of older adult care and research
Several structured tools exist to assess extended Activities of Daily Living (eADLs)
We identified redundant items in existing Activities of Daily Living (eADLs) tools and key missing tasks that are part of everyday life for older people
Collaborative work is needed to develop Activities of Daily Living (eADLs) measures that are valid and relevant to contemporary older people's activities and priorities

### A systematic review of measures of ability to meet basic needs in older persons [^31574e43]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The ability of older persons to meet their basic needs (i.e. personal, financial and housing security), as well as to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL), is crucial. It is unclear, however, whether such measures exist. This systematic review aimed to review English-language measures of the ability of older persons to meet their basic needs, and to critically review the comprehensiveness of these measures and their psychometric properties.

Methods

Fifteen electronic databases including PubMed, EBSCOhost and CINAHL were systematically searched for studies of measures that assessed the ability of older persons to meet their basic needs, as defined by the World Health Organization. Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated their comprehensiveness and psychometrics.

Results

We found seven instruments from 62 studies that assessed multi-domain function including ADL and some elements of basic needs. The instruments varied in breadth and in reporting of key psychometric criteria. Further, no single instrument provided a comprehensive assessment of the ability of older persons to meet their basic needs.

Conclusion

No single instrument that measures the ability to meet basic needs was identified by this review. Further research is needed to develop an instrument that assesses the ability of older persons to meet their basic needs. This measure should include an evaluation of ADL.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a65b6427]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Various factors contribute to functional disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. These factors include being aged 80 years and above, female gender, illiteracy, living with a small number of family members, lower income status, multi-morbidity, depression, reduced physical activity level, possible malnutrition, and chronic disease, falls, alcohol consumption, frailty syndrome, and multigenerational family arrangements and hospitalizations.

Various primary studies worldwide have reported a high prevalence of FD among older adults, which has negative consequences such as increased mortality risk, hospitalization, reduced quality of life, and susceptibility to geriatric conditions. For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in ASEAN region showed that the pooled prevalence of ADL disability was 21.5%. A systematic review and meta-analysis on functional disability among cancer patients found that 36.7% of patients reported disability related to basic activities of daily living (ADLs), while 54.6% reported disability related to instrumental ADLs.

These findings have significant public health implications, informing policies and strategies to improve health monitoring for older adults. Additionally, policymakers can utilize these findings to allocate resources and plan effective care provisions, supporting healthy aging and delaying the onset of functional disabilities.

Although numerous primary studies have investigated functional disability among older adults, their findings are often constrained by regional disparities, small sample sizes, and inconsistent use of measurement tools, population characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, and cultural practices. Additionally, previous reviews have generally exhibited inconsistent and wide variations. They also lack global representation, making it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions. To address these gaps, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to estimate the global pooled prevalence of functional disability in basic and instrumental ADLs among older adults.

### Not daily, sometimes not ever-mixed methods exploration of the contemporary relevance of tasks contained in extended activities of daily living scales [^268ce27d]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessment of functional status is an integral part of older adult healthcare and research. Therefore, it is essential that tools to capture function are contextually appropriate. Many tools designed to evaluate extended Activities of Daily Living (eADLs) were developed decades ago.

Objective

Our aim was to explore which eADL tasks are commonly performed by older adults and map these tasks to popular eADL scales, seeking stakeholder perspectives to inform recommendations on scale content.

Design

Online survey with quantitative questions and free text followed-by semi-structured interviews.

Subjects

Older adults (≥ 60-years), carers and health, social care and voluntary/community professionals.

Methods

We extracted eADL tasks from existing scales to develop a survey on frequency of performance, with space for additional comment. The survey was disseminated via Join Dementia Research and other clinical and professional networks. Online semi-structured interviews were undertaken with thematic analysis of verbatim transcripts.

Results

From 2244 online survey responses, 87% came from older people and two-thirds of respondents were female. Some eADL tasks were never performed by many participants. Tasks not part of existing tools included online banking and mobile phone use. From fifteen interviews, a recurring theme was that technological and societal changes have altered daily tasks.

Conclusions

Commonly used eADL scales contain obsolete tasks and omit tasks older people consider part of their everyday lives. There is a need to work collaboratively to update eADL tools to reflect the priorities and activities of older people to ensure these remain valid measures for use in practice and research. To complement this abstract, a video abstract is available online. A more detailed video-based summary of the content is also available as supplemental material.

### Calibrating ADL-IADL scales to improve measurement accuracy and to extend the disability construct into the preclinical range: a systematic review [^61940237]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the U.S. the number of those aged 65+ in the year 2000 was approximately 35 million. In 2050, this figure is expected to rise to nearly 82 million. The potential burden to healthcare becomes apparent if we couple these figures with evidence indicating that 55 years-of-age is the median age of detectable chronic disability. Such forecasts have prompted gerontologists and geriatricians to consider more seriously prevention-type models, with an emphasis on the earliest stages of functional decline. Increased interest in the maintenance of function and prevention of disability has led to relatively new diagnostic criteria, such as symptoms of frailty or preclinical disability. The utility of identifying individuals who are 'high risk' for future functional decline rests on the notion that it is potentially an easier state to reverse than overt disability. Intervention programs designed to prevent functional decline in older adults show that participants with relatively good functional status or moderate frailty are those who benefit the most from these programs. However, 'prehabilitation' strategies necessitate the use of assessment measures that exhibit a high degree of sensitivity. Standardised tests of physical performance have been employed with increasing frequency in recent years, presumably to meet this demand for greater sensitivity.

### Comparing the functional independence measure and the interRAI / MDS for use in the functional assessment of older adults: a review of the literature [^bed31885]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

interRAI/Minimum Data Set (MDS)

interRAI is an international research consortium that develops comprehensive assessment tools that are principally intended for older adult populations. These Resident Assessment Instruments (RAIs) are used internationally in a wide variety of health care settings for a large number of applications including care planning, outcome measurement, and quality indicators. Currently, there are 12 RAI tools designed for use in rehabilitation, long term care, home care, and other settings across the health care continuum. The instruments consist of over 300 items encompassing a large array of patient characteristics including functional status, admission history, medical conditions and other information. Initially these items were generated by reviewing previous literature on over 60 assessment instruments. The final sets of items were selected based on extensive clinical deliberations and an iterative review process mainly focused on interrater reliability and clinical relevance. All of the tools contain a proportion of common items that are intended to facilitate communication across multiple health care settings. Each individual tool also includes specialized items exclusive to that setting. The instrument specifically designed for use in rehabilitation is the interRAI Post Acute Care.

Physical functioning is measured by a range of activities of daily living (ADL) items that can be summed to form several ordinal ADL scales. These items were designed to measure activities across a wide range of functional independence levels to enable the detection of functional changes in individuals with both high and low levels of functioning. Each item is scored on the basis of the amount of assistance required for performance, with higher scores indicating greater dependence. The scales were developed based on exploratory factor analyses and hypothesis testing to arrange the ADL items hierarchically in relation to loss of functioning. Currently there has been no consensus on a single standard ADL subscale for the interRAI instruments.

Cognitive functioning can be estimated using the interRAI instruments in two ways - the 5-item Cognitive Performance Scale [CPS;] or the 11-item MDS Cognition Scale (MDS-COGS). Both scales are ordinal with the CPS ranging from 0 (intact) to 6 (very severe impairment) and the MDS-COGS ranging from 0 (cognitively intact) to 10 (very severe impairment). These scales were both developed based on their correlation with and ability to predict scores of existing cognition scales, including the Mini-Mental State Exam, Test for Severe Impairment and the Global Deterioration Scale.

### A systematic review of instrumental activities of daily living scales in dementia: room for improvement [^f802e405]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaires can be helpful in diagnosing dementia and are often used for clinical follow-up and treatment evaluation in dementia patients. Despite the large number of questionnaires, their quality has received little attention.

Objective

To systematically review the measurement properties of all available structured informant-based (I)ADL questionnaires, developed or validated for use in demented patients.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE for psychometric articles on (I)ADL questionnaires. In addition, reference lists of all retrieved articles were screened. Standardised criteria were used to assess the quality of the measurement properties. When possible, investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Two authors independently extracted studies and performed the quality assessment of the questionnaires.

Findings

Thirty-two articles were selected, covering 12 (I)ADL questionnaires. Information on 52.3% of the quality aspects was not available, 32.4% of the ratings were indeterminate, 8.1% were positive, and 7.2% were negative. Out of eight measurement properties, two scales (the DAD and the Bristol ADL) received two positive ratings and were classified as of moderate quality. Five scales (ADL-PI, ADL-IS, B-ADL, CSADL and Lawton IADL) received one positive rating.

Interpretation

The findings indicate that improvements in and more data on psychometric properties of (I)ADL questionnaires for dementia patients are necessary in order to justify their use.

### Calibrating ADL-IADL scales to improve measurement accuracy and to extend the disability construct into the preclinical range: a systematic review [^f3e23334]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Interest in measuring functional status among nondisabled older adults has increased in recent years. This is, in part, due to the notion that adults identified as 'high risk' for functional decline portray a state that is potentially easier to reverse than overt disability. Assessing relatively healthy older adults with traditional self-report measures (activities of daily living) has proven difficult because these instruments were initially developed for institutionalised older adults. Perhaps less evident, are problems associated with change scores and the potential for 'construct under-representation', which reflects the exclusion of important features of the construct (e.g., disability). Furthermore, establishing a formal hierarchy of functional status tells more than the typical simple summation of functional loss, and may have predictive value to the clinician monitoring older adults: if the sequence task difficulty is accelerated or out of order it may indicate the need for interventions.

Methods

This review identified studies that employed item response theory (IRT) to examine or revise functional status scales. IRT can be used to transform the ordinal nature of functional status scales to interval level data, which serves to increase diagnostic precision and sensitivity to clinical change. Furthermore, IRT can be used to rank items unequivocally along a hierarchy based on difficulty. It should be noted that this review is not concerned with contrasting IRT with more traditional classical test theory methodology.

Results

A systematic search of four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychInfo) resulted in the review of 2,192 manuscripts. Of these manuscripts, twelve met our inclusion/exclusion requirements and thus were targeted for further inspection.

Conclusions

Manuscripts presented in this review appear to summarise gerontology's best efforts to improve construct validity and content validity (i.e., ceiling effects) for scales measuring the early stages of activity restriction in community-dwelling older adults. Several scales in this review were exceptional at reducing ceiling effects, reducing gaps in coverage along the construct, as well as establishing a formal hierarchy of functional decline. These instrument modifications make it plausible to detect minor changes in difficulty for IADL items positioned at the edge of the disability continuum, which can be used to signal the onset of progressive type disability in older adults.

### Instrumental activities of daily living scales to detect cognitive impairment and dementia in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^2ee57ad6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The largest proportion of people with dementia worldwide live in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), with dementia prevalence continuing to rise. Assessment and diagnosis of dementia involves identifying the impact of cognitive decline on function, usually measured by instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

Objective

This review aimed to identify IADL measures which are specifically developed, validated, or adapted for use in LMICs to guide selection of such tools.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted (fourteen databases) up to April 2020. Only studies reporting on development, validation, or adaptation of IADL measures for dementia or cognitive impairment among older adults (aged over 50) in LMICs were included. The QUADAS 2 was used to assess quality of diagnostic accuracy studies.

Results

22 papers met inclusion criteria; identifying 19 discrete IADL tools across 11 LMICs. These were either translated from IADL measures used in high-income countries (n = 6), translated and adapted for cultural differences (n = 6), or newly developed for target LMIC populations (n = 7). Seven measures were investigated in multiple studies; overall quality of diagnostic accuracy was moderate to good.

Conclusion

Reliability, validity, and accuracy of IADL measures for supporting dementia diagnosis within LMICs was reported. Key components to consider when selecting an IADL tool for such settings were highlighted, including choosing culturally appropriate, time-efficient tools that account for gender- and literacy-bias, and can be conducted by any volunteer with appropriate training. There is a need for greater technical and external validation of IADL tools across different regions, countries, populations, and cultures.

### Validity and reliability of the Arabic version of activities of daily living (ADL) [^5b5e9df8]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Assessing the activities of daily living is essential for planning geriatric interventions. For example, exercise can have positive health outcomes for people who start exercising at a later age. A quick, easy assessment instrument in Arabic would support caregivers and geriatricians in assessing elderly patients in Lebanese NHs and prescribing appropriate physical exercise. The Arabic ADL appears to be such an instrument.

### Not daily, sometimes not ever-mixed methods exploration of the contemporary relevance of tasks contained in extended activities of daily living scales [^0ce8d9f9]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assessment of functional status is an integral part of older adult healthcare and research. For example, at the individual level, this can be used in diagnosing dementia, to evaluate recovery after stroke and inform discharge planning following hospitalisation. On a wider scale, allocation of resources, social care policies and clinical research all rely, in part, on assessment of ability to perform tasks. Assessing function is relevant to older adults as maintenance of function and thus independence is an important goal for many.

A usual approach to functional assessment is to describe performance in basic activities of daily living (bADL) and extended activities of daily living (eADL), based on the person's level of independence. The bADL are those tasks which are considered fundamental to individuals' functioning, including eating, washing and moving. Commonly used scales include the Barthel Index and the Katz Index. The eADL include a broad range of tasks required to live independently and adapt to the environment, for example shopping and housekeeping. As eADL require more complex physical and cognitive skills than bADL, performance declines are often observed before deficits in bADL become apparent, making eADL more responsive to change and an important part of older adult assessment. There are several synonyms and concepts related to eADL, including instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), however, for consistency we will refer to eADL throughout this paper.

### Functional decline in older adults [^9c1c70f9]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Functional disability is common in older adults. It is often episodic and is associated with a high risk of subsequent health decline. The severity of disability is determined by physical impairments caused by underlying medical conditions, and by external factors such as social support, financial support, and the environment. When multiple health conditions are present, they often result in greater disability than expected because the patient's ability to compensate for one problem may be affected by comorbid conditions. Evaluation of functional disability is most effective when the physician determines the course of the disability, associated symptoms, effects on specific activities, and coping mechanisms the patient uses to compensate for the functional problem. Underlying health conditions, impairments, and contextual factors (e.g., finances, social support) should be identified using validated screening tools. Interventions should focus on increasing the patient's capacity to cope with task demands and reducing the demands of the task itself. Interventions for functional decline in older adults are almost always multifactorial because they must address multiple conditions, impairments, and contextual factors.

### Detecting disabilities in everyday life: evidence from a geriatric assessment [^c83025d5]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We used data from a comprehensive geriatric assessment to explain the activities of daily living (ADL) index, which is used to measure functional impairment and older patients' needs for assistance in everyday life. Empirically, we proposed a data-driven approach that allowed us to employ all patient-related information typically recorded in a geriatric assessment. In particular, we identified nine variables belonging to four groups of impairments that are most influential for ADL: mobility, urinary incontinence, nutritional status and cognitive function. For each of the underlying variables, we derived cut-off values indicating functional impairment and the need for support in everyday tasks. Jointly, these selected variables were able to indicate ADL disability with high accuracy.

Our findings might be of interest for clinical purposes. First, determining ADL requires a comprehensive observation of patients. In some cases, additional information must be obtained from the referring physicians, and the writing of test protocols is time-consuming and causes high administrative costs. Our study proposes a method of approximating ADL based on limited patient information that is typically easy to obtain. Using this information rather than the ADL score may lead to significant cost savings for a hospital. Second, and perhaps more importantly, ongoing monitoring of the main drivers of ADL allows for early detection of limitations in daily living. This seems particularly interesting for general practitioners and physicians in outpatient care, where information on ADL is usually not collected.

### Geriatric assessment: ASCO global guideline [^c3fb0f2a]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO Global Guideline — estimating general (noncancer-specific) life expectancy for older adults with cancer in resource-constrained settings: In settings not adequately represented in the validated tools listed at ePrognosis, clinicians may use actuarial life-expectancy tables, with preference given to those that consider quartiles of overall health status (Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak). Based on the best clinical opinion of the Expert Panel, clinicians should use one of the validated tools listed at ePrognosis to estimate life expectancy ≥ 4 years (Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). For settings outside the United States and Canada, the Expert Panel especially recommends the Suemoto Index, and common variables considered in these indices include age, sex, comorbidities (eg, diabetes, COPD), functional status (eg, ADLs, IADLs, mobility), health behaviors and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking status, body mass index), and self-rated health. Several indices have "presence of cancer" as a relevant variable, and answering "no" to this question will allow for noncancer life expectancy, to consider competing risks of mortality.

### The classic measure of disability in activities of daily living is biased by age but an expanded IADL / ADL measure is not [^dbb1e9ef]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate, by age, the performance of 2 disability measures based on needing help: one using 5 classic activities of daily living (ADL) and another using an expanded set of 14 activities including instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), walking, getting outside, and ADL (IADL/ADL).

Methods

Guttman and item response theory (IRT) scaling methods are used with a large (N = 25,470) nationally representative household survey of individuals aged 18 years and older.

Results

Guttman scalability of the ADL items increases steadily with age, reaching a high level at ages 75 years and older. That is reflected in an IRT model by age-related differential item functioning (DIF) resulting in age-biased measurement of ADL. Guttman scalability of the IADL/ADL items also increases with age but is lower than the ADL. Although age-related DIF also occurs with IADL/ADL items, DIF is lower in magnitude and balances out without causing age bias.

Discussion

An IADL/ADL scale measuring need for help is hierarchical, unidimensional, and unbiased by age. It has greater content validity for measuring need for help in the community and shows greater sensitivity by age than the classic ADL measure. As demand for community services is increasing among adults of all ages, an expanded IADL/ADL measure is more useful than ADL.

### The geriatric assessment [^ed0e9143]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The geriatric assessment is a multidimensional, multidisciplinary assessment designed to evaluate an older person's functional ability, physical health, cognition and mental health, and socioenvironmental circumstances. It is usually initiated when the physician identifies a potential problem. Specific elements of physical health that are evaluated include nutrition, vision, hearing, fecal and urinary continence, and balance. The geriatric assessment aids in the diagnosis of medical conditions; development of treatment and follow-up plans; coordination of management of care; and evaluation of long-term care needs and optimal placement. The geriatric assessment differs from a standard medical evaluation by including nonmedical domains; by emphasizing functional capacity and quality of life; and, often, by incorporating a multidisciplinary team. It usually yields a more complete and relevant list of medical problems, functional problems, and psychosocial issues. Well-validated tools and survey instruments for evaluating activities of daily living, hearing, fecal and urinary continence, balance, and cognition are an important part of the geriatric assessment. Because of the demands of a busy clinical practice, most geriatric assessments tend to be less comprehensive and more problem-directed. When multiple concerns are presented, the use of a "rolling" assessment over several visits should be considered. Academy of Family Physicians.

### Patterns and predictive factors of loss of the independence trajectory among community-dwelling older adults [^1d1c16dd]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

According to National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (INSEE)), French older adults population aged ≥ 75 years is expected to reach more than 11.9 million and those aged ≥ 85 years to reach more than 5.4 million in 2060. This aging would be accompanied by chronic diseases, physical, psychological, biological, and socioeconomic difficulties, dementia that can lead to a loss of independence and institutionalization. Loss of independence is associated with aging, as is disability, and can be defined as the inability make decisions and/or perform activities of daily living. With the aging population growing rapidly, the number of dependent people is increasing. Several tools developed to assess older person independence degree including: activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), the Independence Gerontology Iso-Resource Groups (AGGIR) grid, a system for measuring functional independence (SMAF), and the multidimensional evaluation guide Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI). These tools are available or under evaluation in France and in other nations for assessing the needs of older people who have lost their independence.

In this study, we investigated the patterns of independence loss in a representative sample of French community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years using the SMAF tools. Most prior studies of the independence trajectories of older adults used the ADL or GIR score, and those that did use SMAF were descriptive analysis. The SMAF tool was developed in Canada in 1984 (, and comprises 29 functions in five categories: ADLs, mobility, communication, mental functions, and IADLs. Each function is evaluated on a fifth-point scale, as follows: 0 (independence), 0.5 (difficulty), 1 (need for stimulation or supervision), 2 (assistance), 3 (complete help or dependence). The SMAF is available in multiple languages and is used in the clinical setting in, for example, Canada (Quebec) and France. Its validity and reliability have been verified.

### Studies of illness in the aged… [^62c884f2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The Index of ADL was developed to study results of treatment and prognosis in the elderly and chronically ill. Grades of the Index summarize over-all performance in bathing, dressing, going to toilet, transferring, continence, and feeding. More than 2, 000 evaluations of 1, 001 individuals demonstrated use of the Index as a survey instrument, as an objective guide to the course of chronic illness, as a tool for studying the aging process, and as an aid in rehabilitation teaching. Of theoretical interest is the observation that the order of recovery of Index functions in disabled patients is remarkably similar to the order of development of primary functions in children. This parallelism, and similarity to the behavior of primitive peoples, suggests that the Index is based on primary biological and psychosocial function, reflecting the adequacy of organized neurological and locomotor response.

### Constructing the concept of healthy ageing and examining its association with loneliness in older adults [^3a5a0e51]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Seventeen components were selected in this study to verify WHO five domains of functional ability. Seven components related to functional limitations were selected to check people's ability to meet their basic needs, and three components were included to assess being mobile. The components of the two domains are consistent with most existing studies that commonly used standards for assessing the functional ability of older adults are Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Three components of the domains of being mobile are also aligned with the documented evidence on managing comorbidities, pain levels and the level of physical activity among older adults to achieve healthy ageing. However, a discrepancy in the definition of functional ability has been identified between existing studies/measurement tools for the functional ability and the WHO classification. According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) of WHO, functional ability consists of the intrinsic capacity of the individual, relevant environmental characteristics and the interaction between these two factors. Based on that, this study included five domains of functional ability intending to evaluate healthy ageing comprehensively to enable the whole well-being of older adults, while the current measurement tools (e.g. ADL, IADL) are focusing on physical health only. The findings of this study are aligned with the WHO Guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) proposing evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals to place the needs and preferences of older adults at the center of coordinated care models (World Health Organization, 2017). Future research could also consider evaluating long-term healthy ageing by constructing the concept of healthy ageing based on cohort studies.

### Association among activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and health-related quality of life in elderly Yi ethnic minority [^ae13991b]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Measurement instruments

ADLs: the functional capacity of the elderly can be measured by Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale that is widely used in clinical studies and community-based researches. Two ADL tools were applied into present study. One is the Barthel Index, a widely used ADL tool to assess basic activities of daily living of the elderly, which measures functional levels of self-care and mobility and rates the ability to feed and groom oneself, bathe, go to the toilet, walk or use a wheelchair, climb stairs, and control bowel and bladder. The score of ADL varies from 0 to 100 in accordance with older adult's ability to do the daily activities on his or her own. A result of 0 stands for complete dependency in activities of daily living; whereas the result of 100 means complete independent in activities of daily living. Another is Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) scale, which include a range of activities that are considered to be more complex with ADLs and address the older adult's ability to interact with his or her environment and community. IADLs include the ability to use the telephone, cook, shop, do laundry, housekeeping, manage finances, take medications, and prepare meals. The scores of this scale ranged from 0 to 8, with 0 being the least independent and 8 being the most independent in the above eight items. The internal consistency was measured by Cronbach α coefficient, which was 0.739 for both of these two ADL scales (Additional file 1).

HRQoL: as above indicated, SF-36 scale is a reliable tool to assess the health-related quality of life in different population. SF-36 contains eight health concepts that are distributed in 36 items. The concepts are as follow: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical problems (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), and mental health (MH). The Physical Component Summary includes PF, RP, BP, GH and Mental Component Summary contains VT, SF, RE, and MH. The scores of each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score standing for better HRQoL. The result of internal consistency reliability SF-36 was 0.842 by calculating the value of Cronbach α coefficient.

### Detecting disabilities in everyday life: evidence from a geriatric assessment [^2633d1e9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The activities of daily living (ADL) score is a widely used index to establish the degree of independence from any help in everyday life situations. Measuring ADL accurately is time-consuming and costly. This paper presents a framework to approximate ADL via variables usually collected in comprehensive geriatric assessments. We show that the selected variables serve as good indicators in explaining the physical disabilities of older patients.

Methods

Our sample included information from a geriatric assessment of 326 patients aged between 64 and 99 years in a hospital in Tyrol, Austria. In addition to ADL, 23 variables reflecting the physical and mental status of these patients were recorded during the assessment. We performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to determine which of these variables had the highest impact on explaining ADL. Then, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression techniques to validate our model performance. Finally, we calculated cut-off points for each of the selected variables to show the values at which ADL fall below a certain threshold.

Results

Mobility, urinary incontinence, nutritional status and cognitive function were most closely related to ADL and, therefore, to geriatric patients' functional limitations. Jointly, the selected variables were able to detect neediness with high accuracy (area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.89 and 0.91, respectively). If a patient had a limitation in one of these variables, the probability of everyday life disability increased with a statistically significant factor between 2.4 (nutritional status, 95%-CI 1.5–3.9) and 15.1 (urinary incontinence, 95%-CI 3.6–63.4).

Conclusions

Our study highlights the most important impairments of everyday life to facilitate more efficient use of clinical resources, which in turn allows for more targeted treatment of geriatric patients. At the patient level, our approach enables early detection of functional limitations and timely indications of a possible need for assistance in everyday life.

### Is independence of older adults safe considering the risk of falls? [^6fba27a1]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Study tools

Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) was used to evaluate cognitive abilities. Scoring range in this scale was from 0 to 10 points. A score of 4–5 meant a moderate mental impairment and 3–0 – a severe mental impairment. Normal mental abilities were within the score range from 6 to 10.
The degree of independence in functioning was analyzed using EASY-Care Standard 2010 which allows a comprehensive functional evaluation and sociomedical needs of elderly people living in their own homes and those residing in care institutions. It analyses 7 areas of functioning: 1. Seeing, hearing and communicating, 2. Looking after yourself, 3. Getting around, 4. Your safety, 5. Your accommodation and finance, 6. Staying healthy, 7. Mental health and well-being. 3 scales in the final section of the questionnaire summarize the results: Independence score – to evaluate independence of the study subject in terms of basic and complex life activities. Scoring range is 0–100. The higher the score, the greater the dependence on other people. Risk of breakdown in care – is a scale used to identify the risk of 24/7 care. Scoring range is 0–12. The risk of continuous care increases with higher score. Risk of falls – a scale allowing assessment of the risk of falls. Final score is from 0 to 8 points. 3 or more points is understood as risk of falls. EASY-Care Standard 2010 tool has been subject to psychometric evaluation during previous studies.
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) – used for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. It helps diagnose depression in elderly people. Scoring range is 0–15. Score of 0–5 is no depression, 6–10 is moderate depression, and 11–15 – severe depression.
Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (Index Barthel) – a scale of 0–100 points. Patients with score above 86 are in good functional condition, while score below 20 means severe impairment.
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL) – the version with 9 questions, with 3 options of answers was used: 1 point means full dependence, 2 points – partial dependence, and 3 – independence. Maximum total score is 27 points.
Timed Up and Go (TUG) is a gait fluency assessment on a distance of 3 m. It measures the time of: getting up from a chair, walking a distance of 3 m, turning by 180 o, return and sitting again. Older adults do this test twice, and the better result is then analyzed. Risk of falls occurs if more than 12 s are required to complete these tasks. For statistical purposes, the following classification was adopted: steady and fast gait, unsteady and fast gait, steady and slow gait, unsteady and slow gait.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1582b7cc]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional disability in older adults refers to difficulties in performing daily activities. It is usually evaluated based on an individual's ability to carry out basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Although existing studies provide valuable insights, comprehensive global data on functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults remain limited. This study aims to review existing research worldwide to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of functional disability in these areas.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted across EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar from May 5 to July 11, 2024. Cross-sectional studies worldwide on functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among adults aged 60 and older, published in English up to July 11, 2024 were included. Studies were excluded if they did not report the outcomes of interest, were inaccessible, case reports, low quality, review articles, or published in languages other than English. Data extraction and cleaning were performed using Microsoft Excel, and STATA version 17 was used to compute the pooled effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for functional disability in both basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. To derive these estimates, we used weighted averages, where each study's prevalence was weighted by the inverse of its variance. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane I² statistic and its associated p-value. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the impact of individual studies on the overall results. Publication bias was assessed with Egger's test and funnel plots, and was addressed through trim-and-fill analysis.

Results

This review includes 35 studies with a total of 133,827 participants. The pooled prevalence of functional disability in basic activities of daily living was estimated at 26.07% (95% CI: 19.04–32.74), while on instrumental activities of daily living, it was estimated at 45.15% (95% CI: 36.02–54.29). After applying the trim-and-fill method, the adjusted overall prevalence of disability in basic activities of daily living was 15.12%, (a 95% CI: 11.25–19.13%). Subgroup analysis showed highest prevalence in Africa (BADL: 42.91%, IADL: 69.34%) and lowest in Asia (BADL: 19.15%, IADL: 32.66%). Participants aged 65 and above, those in institutional settings, and studies with smaller sample sizes tended to report higher levels of functional disability.

Conclusions

Nearly one-fourth of the study participants had functional disability related to basic activities of daily living, while about half experienced disability in instrumental activities of daily living. This emphasizes the need for continued effort in improving the quality of life and support systems for individuals facing functional disability, particularly in instrumental activities.

### A systematic review of measures of ability to meet basic needs in older persons [^49f2e0fc]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Method

This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews methodology for conducting a systematic review. We also have submitted registration of the protocol of the review prior to the literature search in the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022300183).

Criteria for considering studies for this review

English language studies published between 2000 and 2022, that assessed the psychometric properties (i.e. content validity, internal consistency, criterion validity, construct validity, reproducibility, responsiveness, floor and ceiling effects and interpretability) of instruments of older persons (aged 60 years or over) ability to meet their basic needs were considered for inclusion in this systematic review.

We expected that instruments of ability to meet basic needs in older persons might be done in those with different levels of function over the course of ageing, as well as in different settings (community and long-term care facilities, healthcare facilities, old age homes, nursing homes, residential care facilities, congregate settings and frail care settings). We also expected that some instruments would assess ADL.

Instruments considered for inclusion were based on types of measures classified as psychometric measures, for example, surveys, self-report measures, questionnaires, tools, scales, checklists, test batteries, interview schedules and multi-dimensional instruments. The domain and main outcomes considered for assessment were the ability to meet basic needs, which includes personal security, financial security and adequate housing.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^363c0036]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

ADLs, IADLs, and disability measurement — The term activities of daily living (ADLs) refers to routine self-care tasks performed as part of everyday life, and ADLs are generally subdivided into basic ADLs (personal self-care and fundamental mobility) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) involving more complex domestic, community, and leisure activities. An evidence-based consensus conference sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) concluded that a single consensus definition of disability is not feasible or desirable, and the AHRQ report contends that the meaning of disability is dependent on context and purpose; the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) uses disability as a generic term that includes body functions and structure, activity, and participation within environmental and personal/social contexts. In the 2005 stroke rehabilitation clinical practice guidelines, there were 2 recommendations on the assessment of function: that a standardized assessment tool be used to evaluate functional status in individuals with stroke, and to consider using the FIM as the standardized assessment for function. Over the past decade, there has been substantial progress in 2 general areas: development of methods based on item response theory and computer-adapted testing, and recent attention to patient-centered and patient-reported outcome measures related to healthcare reform and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

### Hospitalization-associated disability: "She was probably able to ambulate, but I' M not sure" [^0fb51863]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

In older patients, acute medical illness that requires hospitalization is a sentinel event that often precipitates disability. This results in the subsequent inability to live independently and complete basic activities of daily living (ADLs). This hospitalization-associated disability occurs in approximately one-third of patients older than 70 years of age and may be triggered even when the illness that necessitated the hospitalization is successfully treated. In this article, we describe risk factors and risk stratification tools that identify older adults at highest risk of hospitalization-associated disability. We describe hospital processes that may promote hospitalization-associated disability and models of care that have been developed to prevent it. Since recognition of functional status problems is an essential prerequisite to preventing and managing disability, we also describe a pragmatic approach toward functional status assessment in the hospital focused on evaluation of ADLs, mobility, and cognition. Based on studies of acute geriatric units, we describe interventions hospitals and clinicians can consider to prevent hospitalization-associated disability in patients. Finally, we describe approaches clinicians can implement to improve the quality of life of older adults who develop hospitalization-associated disability and that of their caregivers.

### Instrumental activities of daily living scales to detect cognitive impairment and dementia in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^1b880fba]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this review

A significant strength of this review was our comprehensive and rigorous search strategy (see Supplementary Material) and use of multiple electronic databases to identify potential articles for inclusion. We also hand-searched reference lists of all included articles to maximize the scope of our search. We carried out independent title, abstract, and full-text screening and all disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Our quality assessment indicated that, although most diagnostic accuracy studies included demonstrated some risk of bias, overall, they showed moderate-good quality. However, we only included articles available in English due to limited resources and may not have captured all relevant IADL tools for LMICs. For example, we have limited representation of Asian countries despite significant work reported on cognitive assessments in Asia. Additionally, we excluded studies which combined IADL questions with cognitive assessments within one tool (e.g. Everyday Cognition Scale) as they did not fall within the strict remit of our review question. These tools could also be considered within the diagnostic process in LMICs, and further investigation should determine how useful they may be. A variety of IADL tools were assessed within this review across a diverse range of populations. As such, a meta-analysis was inappropriate to conduct at this time but may be useful in the future when greater evidence bases are built for discrete measures. At this time, the evidence for any tool is limited by inconsistencies in validation methods, and lack of external validation across all scales. As such, we do not recommend any particular IADL tool as a diagnostic aid for dementia in LMICs but do provide suggestions to bridge this gap.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^e7dfe2ee]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of older patients with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we advise assessing the patient's overall health and personal values prior to the determination of treatment goals and strategies (Ungraded Good Practice Statement), and Table 2 provides a guide for the comprehensive assessment of the older adult, including the general medical assessment and diabetes-focused evaluations; functional status is most often documented using subsets of specific activities that are necessary for living independently, including activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring) and instrumental activities of daily living (preparing meals, shopping, managing money, using the telephone, and managing medications), and in patients with diabetes, deficits in IADLs identified during routine evaluation should trigger a more in-depth evaluation including a detailed assessment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, microvascular and macrovascular complications, and cognition.

### Scaling functional status within the interRAI suite of assessment instruments [^2fcbadb4]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

As one ages, physical, cognitive, and clinical problems accumulate and the pattern of loss follows a distinct progression. The first areas requiring outside support are the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and over time there is a need for support in performing the Activities of Daily Living. Two new functional hierarchies are presented, an IADL hierarchical capacity scale and a combination scale integrating both IADL and ADL hierarchies.

Methods

A secondary analyses of data from a cross-national sample of community residing persons was conducted using 762,023 interRAI assessments. The development of the new IADL Hierarchy and a new IADL-ADL combined scale proceeded through a series of interrelated steps first examining individual IADL and ADL item scores among persons receiving home care and those living independently without services. A factor analysis demonstrated the overall continuity across the IADL-ADL continuum. Evidence of the validity of the scales was explored with associative analyses of factors such as a cross-country distributional analysis for persons in home care programs, a count of functional problems across the categories of the hierarchy, an assessment of the hours of informal and formal care received each week by persons in the different categories of the hierarchy, and finally, evaluation of the relationship between cognitive status and the hierarchical IADL-ADL assignments.

Results

Using items from interRAI's suite of assessment instruments, two new functional scales were developed, the interRAI IADL Hierarchy Scale and the interRAI IADL-ADL Functional Hierarchy Scale. The IADL Hierarchy Scale consisted of 5 items, meal preparation, housework, shopping, finances and medications. The interRAI IADL-ADL Functional Hierarchy Scale was created through an amalgamation of the ADL Hierarchy (developed previously) and IADL Hierarchy Scales. These scales cover the spectrum of IADL and ADL challenges faced by persons in the community.

Conclusions

An integrated IADL and ADL functional assessment tool is valuable. The loss in these areas follows a general hierarchical pattern and with the interRAI IADL-ADL Functional Hierarchy Scale, this progression can be reliably and validly assessed. Used across settings within the health continuum, it allows for monitoring of individuals from relative independence through episodes of care.

### Computer simulations for assessing cognitively intensive instrumental activities of daily living in older adults [^e5ffe736]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the present study provides encouraging preliminary evidence that these novel computerized simulations of cognitively intensive activities of daily living can be an efficient, reliable, and valid assessment tool when used with older adults of varying cognitive abilities.

Research in Context

1 Systematic review: Assessment of functional abilities is a requirement for a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia and useful in developing treatment planning. Current methods of assessing functional abilities have significant limitations. We evaluated the validity, reliability, diagnostic precision, and user acceptability of a brief, easy-to-administer, set of five computer simulations of cognitively intensive functional abilities in a sample of older adults with no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia.
2 Interpretation: We found that performance (accuracy, time to complete the task) on the computer simulations significantly distinguished the clinical groups, was reliable over a one-month period, correlated with proxy-reported functional abilities, showed good-to-excellent receiver operating characteristics, and demonstrated high user acceptability. This provided preliminary support for the utility of computer simulations for evaluating functional abilities of older adults.
3 Future directions: Additional research will focus on the predictive validity and sensitivity to change of the performance on the simulations; their cost-efficiency when used in the clinic; and the relationship between performance and disease markers.

### Psychometric properties of the late-life function and disability instrument: a systematic review [^e680cabe]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate assessment of physical functional limitations and disability is critical for improving access to health care services for older adults, and for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions designed to slow or prevent the progression of late-life disability. Detecting meaningful changes in function and disability in older adults can be challenging, particularly if the outcome tool is not designed to accurately assess or reflect the purported change. The choice of outcome measure for use as a primary outcome in studies with older adults should be guided by the construct being measured and evidence for its psychometric properties.

Patient-reported measures (PROs) of function and disability are commonly used in studies of older adults because of their low cost and convenience. However, many existing measures were not designed for evaluative purposes and do not offer a comprehensive assessment of function or disability based on an explicit theoretical framework. The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) was developed to overcome some of these limitations. Unlike many other PROs, the LLFDI comprehensively assesses discrete functional tasks and operationalizes disability in important life roles beyond the narrow construct of activities of daily living.

The conceptual underpinnings for the LLFDI was Nagi's disablement model and also draws from the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). The LLFDI assesses both functional limitations (inability to perform discrete physical tasks) and disability (inability to participate in major life tasks and social roles). The Function component evaluates difficulty in performing 32 physical tasks and is comprised of an overall scale of function and three subscales: basic lower extremity, advanced lower extremity and upper extremity. The Disability component evaluates limitations in and frequency of taking part in 16 major life activities. The frequency dimension is comprised of social and personal role subscales plus an overall scale; the limitation dimension includes instrumental and management role subscales plus an overall scale. Raw scores are transformed to scaled scores (0–100) based on a Rasch model with higher scores indicating better levels of functioning.

Since its development in 2002, the LLFDI has been frequently used as an outcome measure in geriatric research. While the original LLFDI development papers provide preliminary support for its validity and reliability, there is no synthesis of research on its psychometric properties. The objectives of this systematic review are to characterize the use of the LLFDI in published studies of community dwelling older adults and to evaluate the current available evidence on its psychometric properties.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^da3cc290]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional disability in instrumental activities of daily living

The pooled prevalence of functional disability in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) was 45.15% (95% CI: 36.02–54.29), with substantial heterogeneity indicated by an I² value of 99.9% (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Forest plot indicating pooled prevalence of functional disability in instrumental activities of daily living among older adults in the World, 2024

Heterogeneity and publication bias

The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using I² and its corresponding p-value. This study found significant heterogeneity, with I² values of 99.9% and a p-value of 0.00 for both BADL and IADL. This suggests the need for subgroup analysis.

To explore the source of this heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses based on several factors: the continent where the study was conducted, publication year, sample size, age of the participants, and study setting. However, the subgroup analysis did not identify the source of the heterogeneity, as the I² value remained high, indicating significant variability. Other potential sources of heterogeneity may include differing definitions of functional disability, cultural variations in the perception and reporting of disability, and variations in measurement tools or methodologies used across studies. These factors could contribute to the observed differences in prevalence rates.

Sub-group analysis by continent of the studies

Studies conducted in Asia had the lowest prevalence of functional disability in both basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, with rates of 19.15% (95% CI: 12.23–25.97) and 32.66% (95% CI: 21.76–43.55), respectively (Fig. 4).

Conversely, studies conducted in Africa reported the highest pooled prevalence of functional limitations, with 42.91% (95% CI: 31.61–54.21) for BADL and 69.34% for IADL, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

### Not daily, sometimes not ever-mixed methods exploration of the contemporary relevance of tasks contained in extended activities of daily living scales [^8c1e2999]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the issues we highlight, clinicians could use existing eADL scales as a template and make bespoke changes to the tasks assessed based on the circumstances of the older adult being tested. While intuitively attractive, we would not recommend this approach as it will lead to poor standardisation across populations. Updating eADL tools with 'like for like' technology driven replacements is not straightforward. As highlighted in our interviews, the underlying physical and cognitive skills necessary may differ substantially between tasks with the same purpose, for example engaging in social media is very different to writing and posting a letter.

A potential solution would be to develop a tool or adapt an existing tool to allow for continual re-assessment of component items. This could include information on use of strategies to enable task completion, or use of aids. There is a precedent for this approach in bADL scales which enquire about the level of assistance required to complete a task, and may have separate scoring for mobility and continence aids. A tool that uses a pool of differing eADL task and selects assessment based on item response theory or similar could facilitate this approach and improvements in information technology could allow for iterative assessment building upon the individual's previous responses while using comparisons against all those tested. Another approach may be to consider how skills and abilities have changed over time, as has been used in cognitive assessments used to inform dementia diagnosis, to reflect abilities lost in a more structured way.

Older adult views on important eADL differ from what others think may be important to them. While this does not negate the value of including responses from both older adults and other stakeholders, it suggests that if designing a new eADL tool, it will be essential to work with the key stakeholders – older adults. We consider updating eADL tools as a priority area for development, and are starting to work with key stakeholders to improve contemporaneous eADL assessment.

### Detecting disabilities in everyday life: evidence from a geriatric assessment [^35d33634]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous research has adopted three major approaches to approximate ADL. A first strand of literature used sensor data from wearable devices or smart home environments to obtain information on functional limitations. Although these studies provided accurate results, they were faced with specific problems, especially in the older and population. For example, not everyone in this age cohort is able to operate electronic devices properly. A second line of research relied on large-scale data and machine learning algorithms to predict ADL. For example, Wojtusiak et al. used patient records of approximately 200,000 patients in the US and identified 578 patient characteristics to explain ADL. In addition to the fact that comparable datasets are not easily available, such a large number of explanatory variables is hardly suitable for daily clinical use, particularly in the outpatient sector. Therefore, a third approach referred to clinical data (e.g. from patient admissions), which are more easily available and also have a high degree of accuracy. For instance, Guralnik et al. and Prasitsiriphon and Weber utilized large-scale clinical studies from the US and Thailand and identified mainly physical performance measures influencing ADL. In a similar vein, Jonkman et al. conducted a cohort study on patients aged between 65 and 75 years in four countries (Germany, UK, Italy and the Netherlands) and identified ten out of 22 potential covariates to predict ADL.

However, the participants did not suffer from an ADL disability at baseline and only 22.3% developed one in the following three years. One possible reason for this could be the fact that only participants younger than 75 years were included in the study. The authors concluded that additional research with adults above 75 years was required.

This paper is related to the third strand of literature and extends the existing research in two ways. First, using clinical data from a comprehensive assessment of 326 geriatric patients, we focused on the age group between 64 and 99 years. Hence, we were particularly able to detect ADL for older-aged patients. Second, we propose a framework that allows us to not only identify the most important explanatory variables of ADL but also to estimate the cut-off values at which ADL falls below a certain threshold. Monitoring the selected explanatory variables together with their derived cut-off values could be interesting from a clinical perspective as it supports more efficient use of medical resources, which in turn allows for more targeted treatment of geriatric patients. In addition, it facilitates early detection of functional limitations and the potential need for daily assistance, which might be particularly useful in outpatient care.

### Geriatric assessment: ASCO global guideline [^3ee1519f]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO Global Guideline — geriatric assessment recommendations — endorses using geriatric assessment (GA), including essential domains, to identify vulnerabilities or impairments not routinely captured in oncology assessment for all older patients over 65 years old with cancer; all care plans for patients with cancer over 65 years old receiving systemic therapy with GA-identified deficits should include GA-guided management, and a geriatric evaluation should at a minimum include the use of a brief geriatric screening tool. Tools in the Practical Geriatric Assessment (PGA) are validated in multiple languages, but users may use more appropriate tools in some settings and languages if they include the relevant guideline-specified domains; maximal-resource settings have traditionally developed cutoffs for GA-identified deficits, but locally validated research and practice may inform differing cutoffs; if validated all-cause mortality prognosis tools do not adequately represent the setting, clinicians may use actuarial life-expectancy tables with quartiles of overall health status.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9b0f806a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized the findings from 35 observational studies reporting functional disabilities in basic and instrumental activities of daily living. The included studies varied in sample size, study setting, and age of the participants, publication year, and the continent where they were conducted. Overall, the pooled prevalence of functional disability in basic activities of daily living was approximately 25%, indicating that one in four older adults' faces limitations in basic activity of daily living. In contrast, nearly 50% of participants experienced difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living. These results emphasize the significant impact of functional disability on both instrumental and basic activities of daily living in older adults around the world, indicating that the aging process universally affects instrumental activities like meal preparation, grocery shopping, and medication management, as well as basic activities like dressing, walking, and bathing.

The variability in how BADL and IADL were measured across studies limits comparability and underscores the need for standardized tools. This difference highlights the necessity for standardized, trustworthy measurement instruments and makes it challenging to compare results.

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the global pooled prevalence of functional disability in both basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The estimated prevalence was 26.07% (95% CI: 19.04–32.74) for BADLs and 45.15% (95% CI: 36.02–54.29) for IADLs. These results are comparable to those of a similar review conducted in the ASEAN region, which reported a prevalence of 21.5% (95% CI: 16.2–27.3) for BADLs and 46.8% (95% CI: 35.5–58.3) for IADLs.

Daily activity level — assessing daily activities can indicate a patient's general physical functioning; where impairment is a concern, the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) is a useful tool that can be completed by the patient before the visit or in the examination room on paper or via a mobile device; the tool rates independence in 6 ADL domains (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding), and categorizing patients in this way can inform the need for support and the level required.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b3f5b60b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — adults ≥ 65 years or adults with substantial comorbidities: Adults who are ≥ 65 years benefit from therapy, despite higher treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Chronological age is a poor surrogate for fitness of therapy, and patients should be evaluated on an individual basis, including for the following factors: end-organ reserve, end-organ dysfunction, and performance status. Careful assessment of comorbid conditions, performance status, and ability to attend to activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) is important when deciding treatment intensity, and for tools to aid optimal assessment and care of adults ≥ 65 years with cancer, see the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology. Dose reduction of pegylated asparaginase (1000 IU/m2), anthracycline (50% dose), and/or other myelosuppressive agents may be warranted. The categorization of regimens as low, moderate, or high intensity is based on two factors: 1) the presence or absence of myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents; and 2) the relative dose intensity of the included agents. All regimens should include CNS prophylaxis, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and growth factor support, and for appropriate fit individuals achieving remission, consideration of allogeneic HCT may be appropriate.

### Comparing the functional independence measure and the interRAI / MDS for use in the functional assessment of older adults: a review of the literature [^6bedd3c8]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Measurement and reporting health outcomes have become an essential component guiding the development and evolution of health care systems. As the focus of health care changes to adapt to the aging population, aggregate data from health assessment systems can be used to inform policy decisions regarding service use and best practices. One health care setting that serves a primarily older clientele is post acute rehabilitation. There is a substantial need for accurate assessment in this population as it can have significant implications for older patients' care planning and future quality of life. Despite some encouraging research in this area, there is limited data that focus on measuring rehabilitation outcomes in older adults. One major challenge is that the performance of currently available assessment systems is not well understood in this population.

Development of valid and reliable outcome measures for use with older adults is complicated by frailty, comorbidity, and heterogeneity in this population. Geriatric patients are different from their younger counterparts as they tend to have lower functional status on admission and higher clinical complexity due to multicausal disability and intercurrent medical conditions. Older adults are an extremely diverse population and represent a wide range of physical and cognitive abilities. Individualized measures, such as Goal Attainment Scaling, have been suggested as a possible approach to address this heterogeneity, however such measures present challenges for the development of a consistent database of client information. Wells and colleagues recommend that standardized tools should be used for diagnosis, assessment, and outcome measurement in geriatric rehabilitation. Instruments that are designed for younger, healthier, and more homogenous groups are unlikely to have the same psychometric properties with older adults and additional research is required specifically related to the performance of assessment tools and outcome measures in older populations of rehabilitation patients.

Both the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the interRAI/Minimum Data Set (MDS) are instruments designed to measure functional ability, and both have been used widely with older persons and are mandated in multiple health care settings. Specific components of these instruments collect parallel information and items on both the FIM and the MDS can be used to predict total scores on the other tool.

In spite of their similarities, the range of content coverage, item definitions, scoring, and psychometrics are not identical for both tools, which prevents direct translation of scores from one instrument to another. Comparative information on their psychometric properties would be helpful in assessing the relative merits and potential applications of the two instruments. The purpose of this investigation was to examine previously published research on the measurement properties of these tools for use in populations of older adults.

### An assessment of the content and properties of extended and instrumental activities of daily living scales: a systematic review [^f6e65997]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We performed a systematic review to assess the psychometric properties of extended Activities of Daily Living (eADL) scales.

Materials and Methods

Articles assessing eADL scales' properties were retrieved by searching multidisciplinary databases, and reference screening. Data on the following properties were extracted: validity, reliability, responsiveness, and internal consistency. The COSMIN (Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments) risk of bias checklists are used to assess the quality of included articles. All aspects were performed by two independent researchers.

Results

Of 245 titles, 26 articles were eligible, comprising 15 different eADL scales. The Lawton scale had the most papers describing properties, while the Performance-based Instrumental Activities of Daily Living received the highest COSMIN rating. Properties most often assessed were convergent validity and reliability, no articles assessed all COSMIN properties. The COSMIN assessment rated 43% of the properties as 'positive', 31% 'doubtful' and 26% 'inadequate'. Only Lawton was assessed in more than one paper, available data suggest that this scale has excellent reliability, construct validity, internal consistency, and medium criterion validity.

Conclusion

Despite their common use, there are limited data on the properties of eADL scales. Where data are available there are potential methodological issues in the studies.

### Development of a proxy-free objective assessment tool of instrumental activities of daily living in mild cognitive impairment using smart home technologies [^199b125a]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, ADL functioning is usually assessed by informant-report measures like interviews or standardized questionnaires; less common is the use of self-report or direct performance-based measures. All of these measures have specific advantages and disadvantages: Informant-report allows a quick evaluation of a broad range of everyday competences; however, a reliable proxy is not always available and evaluation can be prone to judgment biases. Self-report also allows a quick evaluation of ADL functioning, however, patients with dementia lack awareness of their problems. In MCI, there are inconsistent results regarding patients' self-assessment: Some studies report preserved, others reduced awareness of deficits. Using performance-based measures, a proxy is not necessary and judgment bias is a minor problem. Examples of existing performance-based measures are the "Revised Observed Tasks of Daily Living", which assesses nine different IADL domains and has good psychometric properties or the "Financial Capacity Instrument", which thoroughly analyzes financial abilities in seven domains. However, existing performance-based assessments are often time-consuming and mostly evaluate only a small range of ADL functioning, e.g. financial capacity. Furthermore, the testing environment is quite artificial, which enhances internal validity but reduces ecological validity. A possible solution to this problem could be provided by smart home environments. A smart home is defined as 'a physical world that is richly and invisibly interwoven with sensors, actuators, displays, and computational elements, embedded seamlessly in the everyday objects of our lives, and connected through a continuous network'. Smart homes have initially been developed to support people in their everyday life, monitor their health status, or detect falls. Research concentrated on activity recognition, detection of emergency situations, or automation of processes. The diagnostic value of smart homes, however, has only been recognized by few researchers so far who focus on the automated assessment of cognitive health. Another stream of research concentrates on the development of fully automated video analyses to detect deficits in everyday functioning, however, they do not apply any additional sensor technology.

### Towards a global scale for functional ability: what gets measured and gets done-but are we measuring the right thing? [^c6187444]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Looking forward: personalising functional ability measurement

Looking ahead, we must complement population-level measures with personalised functional ability profiles. Healthy ageing is highly heterogeneous: some 80-year-olds are as fit as those decades younger; others require support. Assessments should reflect personal goals and preferences as well as domain scores. The WHO's Healthy Ageing concept distinguishes between achieved function and the capability to achieve. Evaluating what older people value — playing with grandchildren, community involvement, or lifelong learning — should become part of how we assess functional ability. Emerging technologies can support this. Smartphones, wearables, and digital platforms can track real-time data on mobility, social interaction, and cognition. Machine learning may help identify patterns — e.g. high physical function but low social participation — prompting tailored interventions. Person-reported outcome tools could also enable individuals to set and evaluate their own ageing goals. Although full personalisation may be achieved beyond 2030, laying the groundwork now is critical. Pilot programmes and research on AI-based prediction models can inform future refinement of the global scale. In this way, person-centred care becomes embedded in the measurement system itself.

### Systematic review of EASY-care needs assessment for community-dwelling older people [^ba89c275]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

With older age comes an increased chance of frailty constituted by physical, social, mental and possibly environmental factors. Complex interventions have been shown to help older people live safely and independently, and can be tailored to meet individuals' needs and preferences through personalised assessments. A tool to do this should ideally be comprehensive, covering a broad range of domains; person-centred, putting the older person at the heart of the assessment; proven to be valid and reliable for clinical use; acceptable for both patients and practitioners to use internationally; and informative to local health and social care commissioners to assist in health resource planning.

One example of a needs assessment tool is 'EASY-Care' which was developed in the United Kingdom, United States and Europe. The first version from 1994, 'EASY' consisted of 31 questions. This was further refined in 1999, 2004 and 2010. The current version is a three-part questionnaire consisting of 49 core questions covering a broad range of physical, mental, social and environmental domains. EASY-Care incorporates questions from several validated and published health outcome measures including the Medical Outcome Scale Short Form 36, Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living, the Duke Older Americans Resources and Services Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Duke OARS IADL) and items from a former World Health Organisation (WHO) multinational survey on the socio-medical status of elderly people. A 'not-for-profit' company has been set up in the United Kingdom to host and licence the EASY-Care tool, the EASY-Care website provides comprehensive information about the assessment tool.

Several papers have commented on EASY-Care's development, but no systematic review analysing the potential benefits of using EASY-Care as a tool to support comprehensive geriatric assessment for community-dwelling older people has been published. This review seeks to examine the evidence of validity, reliability and acceptability of EASY-Care. We use 'acceptability' in this context as a broad term to incorporate effectiveness, cross-cultural acceptability to practitioners and older people, cost-effectiveness and feasibility. The main focus of this review is to scope available literature with empirical evidence; however, other reviews and commentaries are also included for completeness. This systematic review was outlined in the SOPRANO (Supporting Older People though Assessing Needs and Outcomes) study protocol which received scientific committee approval.

### Assessing the building blocks of function: utilizing measures of functional limitation [^8a52a440]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To better understand the health of older people, it is valuable to go beyond conventional measures of disease and self-perceived health and utilize assessments of functional status and disability. Physical decrements can be characterized at the level of organs and body systems (impairments); the organism as a whole (functional limitations); and the person in the context of the environment and its challenges (disability). To understand the dynamics of the pathway leading from disease to disability, it is critical to measure functional limitations that can be assessed through either self-report or standardized objective measures of physical performance. Both of these approaches may be used to evaluate functions such as grasping objects, walking, and climbing stairs. In aging research, measures of functional limitation are utilized as outcomes that indicate the impact of disease, impairments, and other risk factors on function. In turn, measures of functional limitation can be used to characterize the functional status of individuals and populations, and are powerful predictors of various adverse outcomes, including incident disability in people not currently disabled. Functional limitation measures add substantially to our knowledge about older populations, but further work is needed to promote their standardization and use in both clinical and research settings.

### Measures of everyday competence in older adults with cognitive impairment: a systematic review [^bd81a565]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The issue of safety of the cognitively impaired elderly people living alone has been continuously raised. Traditional psychometric measures of cognitive abilities may not adequately reflect older adults' functioning in a real everyday context.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review on instruments available for evaluating the everyday problem-solving or everyday competence of the elderly with cognitive impairment and to critically review the measurement properties of the identified instruments.

Methods

We searched the databases such as Cinahl, Medline, PsycINFO, AARP Ageline, ProQuest and the Cochrane Library for the time period between January 1995 and December 2010. Reference lists of the included papers were also manually searched.

Results

Five instruments were included. All the instruments focused their framework on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) domains which meet well with suggestions from other studies on the importance of IADL in determining an elderly individual's capability to live independently in the community. No available instruments for the moderate to severe impairment group were identified under this review.

Conclusions

Few existing instruments to assess the ability of everyday problem-solving of the elderly with cognitive impairment can be identified in the literature. Further research validating them against functional, real-world outcomes is needed.

### Assessment of instrumental activities of daily living in patients with cognitive impairment based on their ability to use household appliances [^9b9c9984]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that MCI is characterized by minimal impairments in IADL, evaluating these activities is critical for distinguishing between dementia and MCI. Additionally, assessing IADL remains essential even after a dementia diagnosis, as these impairments significantly influence the daily lives of both patients and caregivers and are, thus, essential for planning care needs, legal matters, and financial decisions. In summary, the assessment of IADL is important for both diagnostic purposes and follow-up care management.

The Lawton IADL scale, developed in 1969, remains a widely used tool by clinicians and researchers. This informant-based questionnaire provides valuable insights into the functional skills necessary for individuals to live independently within their community. The scale comprises eight items: telephoning, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundering, use of transportation, use of medicine, and financial behavior. The IADL items form an eight-point scale for females and a five-point scale for males, as certain tasks in the scale, such as food preparation, housekeeping, and laundering, are deemed exclusive to females. However, there is a growing consensus among experts such as Fessler et al. that the IADL scale requires updating to accurately reflect modern-day functional abilities to continue being used as a valid tool in clinical and research practice. The increased reliance on electrical devices today has altered the skills needed to perform daily activities compared to when the Lawton IADL scale was first introduced. Therefore, the scale must be revised to align with current functional expectations.

### Psychometric properties of the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study-activities of daily living for mild cognitive impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL) scale: a post hoc analysis of the ADCS ADC-008 trial [^2cef828a]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Mild cognitive impairement (MCI) is a common disorder in older populations with its prevalence increasing with age, as demonstrated by the findings that an estimated 6.7% of persons age 60–64 and 25% of persons age 80–84 are living with MCI globally. While MCI disease etiology can vary, it is estimated that more than half of those with MCI have underlying disease pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia, relfecting 60–80% of the estimated 50 million cases of dementia globally.

The current view of AD is that the disease process and clinical manifestations are distributed along a continuum of decline, with symptoms reflecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) occurring between "normal aging" and dementia. MCI can have both amnestic and non-amnestic presentations, with symptoms of amnestic MCI occuring frequently in patients with MCI due to AD. Amnestic MCI manifests as objective impairments in one or more cognitive domains (typically including memory), with the potential for mild/initial impairments in select activities of daily living (ADLs), typically those activities that require more cognitive complexity such as managing finances and medications. These activities known as instrumental ADLs (IADLs) are affected well before changes are noticeable in basic ADLs (BADLs), such as personal hygiene, dressing, and feeding. Notably, while there may be detectable impacts on IADLs in patients with MCI, impairments in BADLs are absent, as this would qualify the patient to be classified as having AD dementia.

### Evaluating the reliability and validity of the geriatric assessment of disability scale in older adults undergoing hemodialysis [^16caf330]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With continuous advancements in dialysis technology, patients with uremia are undergoing prolonged periods of dialysis treatment. However, the mortality rate among older adults undergoing dialysis remains significantly high, approximately twice that of observed in younger and middle-aged patients undergoing HD. Concurrently, owing to the impact of underlying diseases, HD treatment, and associated complications, the degree of functional impairment in older adults undergoing HD. Concurrently, owing to the impact of underlying diseases, HD treatment, and associated complications, the degree of functional impairment in older adults undergoing HD is more pronounced than that observed in healthy older adults of similar ages. As these patients age, a gradual decline in bodily function is observed, resulting in varying degrees of impairment. Consequently, the risk of adverse events such as falls, disability, and death is further elevated. To effectuate optimal functional status management in older adults undergoing HD, assessing the severity of their functional impairments accurately and efficiently is crucial. Medical professionals typically use appropriate assessment tools to evaluate a patient's conditions. However, discrepancies often arise in the assessment outcomes across different activities of daily living or functional status evaluation instruments, which can affect the relevance and effectiveness of functional status management in older adults. Furthermore, because of uremia, a significant majority of patients undergoing HD are anuric, rendering them unsuitable for evaluation using commonly employed clinical assessment tools. Therefore, meticulously comparing and selecting the most appropriate assessment tools to ensure accuracy and consistency in identifying the degree of functional impairment in older adults undergoing HD is essential. This approach will provide a theoretical foundation for the clinical development of personalized treatment and nursing programs tailored for older adults with compromised functional status undergoing HD in the future. The findings of this study indicate that the FIST scale demonstrates good reliability and validity in assessing the level of functional impairment in older adults undergoing HD treatment, making it a suitable tool for evaluating physical function within this population.

### A geriatric approach to percutaneous coronary interventions in older adults, part II: AExpert panel [^5b165b75]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

At a minimum, we recommend an assessment of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living for all older adults undergoing PCI to provide a broad baseline assessment of physical and cognitive function. Examples of useful tools for the assessment of ADLs, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and physical function include the modified Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale, the Rosow-Breslau Functional Health Scale, and the Nagi Scale. For every older adult undergoing invasive assessment, documentation of multimorbidity and polypharmacy is essential as part of geriatric risk assessment, particularly prior to invasive cardiovascular procedures. For those interested in an assessment of lower extremity functioning to inform post procedural recovery, the short physical performance battery can provide valuable information, particularly for those requiring large bore access. An alternative option is the Timed Up and Go test, which provides a simple way to assess functional mobility and fall risk in older adults and represents one of the strongest predictors of functional decline, 180-day readmission, and 6-month mortality among older adults with acute myocardial infarction.

There are several instruments to capture frailty in practice including the Fried physical frailty phenotype, the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Score and the Frail Scale. The essential frailty toolset correlates well with other more complex instruments and may be preferred as it demonstrated superior performance for predicting worsening disability and mortality compared with other commonly used frailty measures and has been validated in patients after revascularization procedures. The essential frailty toolset provides objective information and is easy to administer in clinical practice, including 4 components: chair-rise test, cognitive function assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination or Mini-Cog, hemoglobin, and serum albumin. Albumin is a frequently collected and common element of many of the available frailty measures which reflects nutritional frailty. Nutritional frailty can also be captured with simple measures such as body mass index and inquiries regarding unintentional weight loss. Handgrip strength is another straightforward bedside test that has been included in prior frailty measures. Whichever frailty tool is selected should be predictive of adverse outcomes and quick and relatively easy to perform to promote adoption in routine clinical practice.

### Performance-based physical function in older community-dwelling persons: a systematic review of instruments [^15cfa178]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Identification of older persons at risk for the loss of independence, onset of (co)-morbidity or functional limitations through screening/assessment is of interest for the public health-care system. To date several different measurement instruments for overall physical function are frequently used in practice, but little information about their psychometric properties is available. Objectives and

Methods

Our aim was to assess instruments with an overall score related to functional status and/or physical performance on content and psychometric properties. Electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, AMED, Cochrane Library and CINAHL) were searched, using MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Studies, published in English, were included if their primary or secondary purpose was to evaluate the measurement properties of measurement instruments for overall physical function in community-dwelling older persons aged 60 years and older. Reliability, validity, responsiveness and practicability were evaluated, adhering to a specified protocol.

Results

In total 78 articles describing 12 different functional assessment instruments were included and data extracted. Seven instruments, including their modified versions, were evaluated for reliability. Nine instruments, including their modified versions, were evaluated with regard to validity.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Short Physical Performance Battery can be recommended most highly in terms of validity, reliability and responsiveness, followed by the Physical Performance Test and Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance.

### Prediction of physiological status, community participation, and daily activity function to sleep quality for outpatient dynapenic older people [^811ac2e4]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Daily activity function

The study measures daily activity function using the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales, which are well-established tools for assessing functional status in older adults. The ADL scale, developed by Katz et al. evaluates basic self-care tasks such as bathing, dressing, and eating, with reported reliability (Cronbach's alpha) typically ranging between 0.85 and 0.95. This indicates strong internal consistency and reliability in measuring basic daily functions.

The IADL scale, introduced by Lawton and Brody, assesses more complex daily tasks, including managing finances, handling transportation, and managing medications, which are crucial for independent living. The IADL scale has shown high reliability, with Cronbach's alpha values typically ranging from 0.80 to 0.92, indicating excellent internal consistency. Its validity has been extensively documented, with studies demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the needs of older adults, such as the likelihood of requiring home care services or the risk of institutionalization.

### Passive exercise to improve quality of life, activities of daily living, care burden and cognitive functioning in institutionalized older adults with dementia-a randomized controlled trial protocol [^6c209e96]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

QOL and ADLs

To assess QOL and ADLs a series of questionnaires are used.

The EQ-5D-5 L is filled in by the primary formal caregiver. It consists of five 5-point Likert scale questions, and is used to measure health-related quality of life based on five different domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). An index value can be computed using the Crosswalk Index Value Calculator with the value set from the Netherlands; an index value closer to 1 resembles a better quality of life. This index value of the EQ-5D-5 L can also be used for cost effectiveness analyses.

The Qualidem is also filled in by the primary formal caregiver. The questionnaire consists of 40 items on a 4-point Likert scale and is specifically developed to quantify QOL in institutionalized patients with dementia. The following subscales can be distinguished: care relationship, positive affect, negative affect, restless tense behavior, positive self-image, social relations, social isolation, feeling at home, having something to do and other. A sum score between 0 and 120 can be obtained, a higher score reflects a better quality of life.

The Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey Minimum DataSet (TOPICS-MDS) is a set of brief, standardized questionnaires filled in by the primary informal caregiver, if possible in consultation with the participant. Next to demographic characteristics, outcome measures are comorbidity, quality of life, mood, functional limitations, mental health, social functioning, care use and care burden. For QOL the TOPIC-MDS includes the EQ-3D-3 L and two questions adapted from the RAND-36. For ADLs the TOPICS-MDS includes a modified version of the Katz Index and an additional indicator of mobility. Respondents are asked if the participant requires assistance for six basic functions (e.g. dressing, eating and bathing), and seven instrumental functions (e.g. grooming and taking medication). Responses are rated on a binary scoring system (dependent = 1; independent = 0) and summated, with higher scores representing greater functional limitations.

An adapted version of the Barthel-Index is filled in by the primary formal caregiver and is used to measure ADL functioning and mobility. The adapted version is an observation scale that consists of ten items on a 5-points Likert scale. Sum scores can range between 0 and 90, with higher scores representing greater ADL functioning and mobility.

### Measuring functional ability in hospitalized older adults: a validation study [^4d4eaa36]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the internal consistency, construct validity and responsiveness of functional assessments tools when used with hospitalized older adults.

Materials and Methods

The functional ability of 66 patients was assessed using a semi-structured interview scale (n = 16 tools). The assessment of motor and process skills was administered during hospital admission and again at three months post-discharge.

Results

Tools showed poor-to-excellent internal consistency (α = 0.27–0.92). Of the tools that were internally consistent, only two demonstrated change: the Groningen activity restriction scale (GARS) (smallest detectable change [SDC] 11.68, effect size -1.59) and the modified reintegration to normal living scale (SDC 7.04, effect size -1.20). Validity was supported by strong correlations between the functional independence measure™ (FIM™) and the GARS, FIM™ and Sunnaas activity daily living (ADL) index.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that the GARS and the modified reintegration to normal living index (mRNLI) are internally consistent, valid and responsive to change over time when applied to a sample of hospitalized older adults. Further investigation of these tools in terms of inter and intra rater reliability in clinical practice is warranted. Implications for Rehabilitation Therapists and researchers need to choose standardized functional assessments carefully when working with hospitalized older adults, as not all assessments are reliable and valid in this population. The GARS and mRNLI are valid and responsive functional assessments for hospitalized older adults. Activity and participation have been viewed traditionally as only one component of function. Therapists and researchers can use standardized assessments of function that are activity or participation-based.

### Underestimating physical function gains: comparing FIM motor subscale and interRAI post acute care activities of daily living scale [^5a50148e]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the construct validity of the activities of daily living (ADLs) sections of 2 major systems developed to measure functional ability in rehabilitation settings. Health assessment systems can inform care planning as well as policy decision-making on service effectiveness. Frailty, comorbidity, and heterogeneity make it difficult to accurately measure health outcomes for older adults. Objective investigation of the value of geriatric rehabilitation services requires assessment systems that are comprehensive, reliable, valid, and sensitive to clinically relevant changes in older patients.

Design

Trained health care workers assessed patients with both tools at admission and discharge. We used Rasch analysis to compare the instruments' dimensionality, item difficulty, item fit, differential item function, and number of response options.

Setting

Musculoskeletal and geriatric rehabilitation units in 2 Ontario hospitals.

Participants

Older adults receiving rehabilitation (N = 209; mean age ± SD, 78.5 ± 9.3; 67% women).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

FIM and the interRAI Post Acute Care Assessment (interRAI PAC).

Results

For both the FIM motor and the interRAI PAC ADLs items, the difficulty level of the items was much lower than the participant's level of ability, resulting in a large ceiling effect. Also, on both scales, less actual change in functional ability was required to move between the midlevel response options.

Conclusions

Both scales have limited ability to discriminate between subjects with higher functional ability, which indicates that they may underestimate the effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation for this group of patients when used alone.

### Kinematic analysis of activities of daily living performance in frail elderly [^533f600d]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, early detection of risks associated with the aging process is important to minimize and/or slow down its negative consequences. In case of frailty, this becomes particularly clear when we take a closer look at the disease-related risks that threaten independency of daily living in older people. Elderly people, categorized as frail, show an elevated risk of disability. Thus, frail individuals demonstrate higher rates of developing or worsening disabilities in mobility as well as in basic (b-ADL) and instrumental (i-ADL) activities of daily living over time. These associations can equally be observed among pre-frail elderly, though with a lower magnitude of effect (e.g.). ADL typically involve various self-care activities with different degrees of complexity. In general, b-ADL are defined as 'activities essential for an independent life or necessary for survival, representing everyday tasks required for self-care'. Whereby i-ADL cover somewhat a more complex set of behaviors and are more sensitive to early cognitive decline. Limitations of b-ADL are frequently measured using the Katz ADL scale or the Barthel Index. I-ADL, on the other hand, are commonly assessed by the Lawton & Brody scale. Changes in ADL performance and especially altered daily activity levels are associated with poor quality of life, increased health care costs, higher mortality, and institutionalization. Furthermore, they can provide important information regarding functional and cognitive abilities, loss of autonomy, and deterioration in health status. Macklai and colleagues, as an example, illustrated in their study involving 11,015 community-dwelling men and women, that at 2-year follow up, frail individuals had odds ratios of developing disability in mobility OR 3.07 (95% CI 1.02–9.36), i-ADL OR 5.52 (95% CI 3.76–8.10), and b-ADL OR 5.13 (95% CI 3.52–7.44). Thus, deficits of all types of ADL are associated with frailty and these deficits are of highest relevance.

### The association between restricted activity and patient outcomes in older adults: systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^5e9e9acd]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures of restricted activity

The measures used in included studies were bed rest (n = 6), restricted movement (n = 6), and activities of daily living (n = 4). These measures are evaluated in more detail in Supplementary Material 1: Appendix D.

Measures ranged from hours in bed, to walking across a room. All were simple questions a patient could report, through a range of methods: self-completed surveys, telephone interviews, and in-person interviews with a researcher or a healthcare professional. Time-scales of follow-up periods varied from monthly to annual, or biennial check-ups, over different follow-up periods.

The only measure that followed an established matrix was the ADL scale using the Katz index of independence (Supplementary Material 1: Appendix D). This is scored on a 6-point scale, to determine physical functions and dependence (maintaining personal hygiene, transferring, ambulating, and feeding themselves). It was either reported as a combined score of all the measures, or dependency for each measure was reported individually. For this study, dependency for walking was chosen as the most relevant ADL measure to explore further.

Other measures included how the respondent spent most of their day (e.g. sitting or in bed), bed-bound states (measured by days or hours in bed), and a combination of everyday activities (measured with 3-point Rosow-Breslau) and limb strength (measured with 5-point Nagi measures) used to create a Rosow-Breslau/Nagi measure (Supplementary Material 1: Appendix D: evaluation of measures).

### Decline in activities of daily living after a visit to a Canadian emergency department for minor injuries in independent older adults: are frail older adults with cognitive impairment at greater risk? [^235efeb0]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare functional decline in activities of daily living (ADLs) of older adults visiting emergency departments (EDs) for minor injuries according to frailty and cognitive status.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Seven Canadian EDs.

Participants

Individuals aged 65 and older who were independent in ADLs at baseline were recruited between March 2011 and March 2013 (N = 1,114).

Measurements

The Older American Resources and Services (OARS) questionnaire was completed during the ED visit or within 7 days and 3 and 6 months after a minor injury to ascertain functional decline (≥ 1-point drop in ADL score). Participants were considered frail based on the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale (≥ Level 4, vulnerable). Cognitive impairment was defined as performing below cutoffs on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (< 23/30) or Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (≤ 31/50). Four subgroups were created: frail with cognitive impairment, frail without cognitive impairment, nonfrail with cognitive impairment, nonfrail without cognitive impairment. Sociodemographic and health data were also collected.

Results

Information on OARS, frailty, and cognitive impairment were available for 850 at 3 months and 728 at 6 months; 19.9% of participants showed declining function at 3 months and 25.3% at 6 months. After adjusting for age, number of comorbidities, and instrumental activity of daily living disability at baseline, frail participants with cognitive impairment were at significantly greater risk of functional decline at 3 (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38–2.59) and 6 (aRR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.45–3.00) months than nonfrail participants without cognitive impairment.

Conclusion

Easy-to-administer frailty and cognitive screening tools should be included in ED assessments to identify independent older adults at high risk of functional decline after minor injury so that appropriate services may be provided to prevent deterioration in ADLs.

### Using comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults undertaking a facility-based transition care program to evaluate functional outcomes: a feasibility study [^f41edf7b]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Facility-based TCP have been found to improve older peoples' performance in self-care and ADL performance on discharge. However, mixed results have been observed for their effectiveness in improving other functional outcomes for older people. Over 60% of older people in the USA demonstrated slow gait speed and poor physical function (measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery) at discharge from a skilled nursing facility in the USA. Older people who completed facility-based TCP in Australia have been found to make improvement in ADL but are more likely to be admitted to RAC and have increased mortality compared to age-matched populations. Changes in self-care in ADL is measured in both Australian and UK facility-based care using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). However, in Australia, the MBI is the only mandated assessment tool for older people undertaking TCP. The MBI only assesses the older adult in the performance of ADLs without assessing impairments such as strength and balance, or cognitive ability and social and emotional wellbeing that comprise function. Older adults admitted for TCP have complex conditions that broadly impact their physical and psychosocial wellbeing. If specific impairments representing these domains of function are not assessed, then deficits in abilities such as cognition, mobility, endurance, balance and falls risk may not be identified and subsequently treated. Therefore, more comprehensive assessments may be required for health professionals to understand how the older person is functioning and provide individualized rehabilitation. Recent reviews of TCP in Australia and the UK have identified that the current assessment outcome measures may only provide limited information about the functional ability of older people undergoing TCP. National audits have recommended that outcome measures used should provide a more holistic picture of older peoples' health status. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the evidence for the effectiveness of TCP on health-related outcomes for older adults undertaking facility-based TCP after hospitalization. This review found that while TCP improved older adults' performance of ADL, other functional outcomes such as cognitive ability, emotional status and physical impairments such as balance were infrequently evaluated, making it uncertain if facility-based transition rehabilitation effectively assisted older adults to regain functional independence.

### Psychometric properties of the persian version of the physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE) [^c1267df3]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several tools for measuring daily activity in adult populations, which are also used for the elderly. Some of them are Functional Independence Measure (FMI), Barthel index and Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Although these tools, have been good metrics proprieties and are widely used to assess functional decline some of them, such as the Katz Index used to assess the level of independence in older adults. Specifically, most activity questionnaires do assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and not involved in less strenuous activities such as light housework. Also, little is known about the patterns of physical activity among older people. This is due, in part, to a lack of reliable and valid measures of physical activity among the aged. One of the tools for measuring the level of physical activity in the elderly, currently used globally, is the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). PASE was first designed in 1993 by Washburn et al. The PASE is a self-report/interview-based measure designed to capture and assess occupational, household, and leisure activities typically performed by older adults; that is, those who are 65 year. of age and older. The results indicated that PASE can be considered as an appropriate tool for measuring the physical activity of the elderly. The advantages of The PASE compared to the others are the short practice period, the easy scoring process, and self-report/interview-based measures that applicability via letters or phone. Separately, it consists of three subheadings of leisure time, household, and work-related activities. which makes it easier to compare subheadings with others and to evaluate the physical activities of individuals among themselves in more detail. To investigate the broad characteristics of physical activity of the Persian population, the translation and validation of scale are important. Therefore, the aims of the study were to translate the PASE scale into Persian, to culturally adapt the instrument, and to evaluate its validity and reliability.

### Comprehensive geriatric assessment for oral care in older adults: a focus group study [^09caad66]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Expert opinions on CGA components and tools to be used in dental settings

A summary of the scoping review was provided to experts before the focus groups. The key points from focus group discussion are summarized in Table 3. It became an agreement among the experts of both focus groups that dentists must evaluate general and oral health when providing oral treatment and care to older adults. Multiple medicine use, or polypharmacy, and frailty had been a common concern among older adults. It was recommended that dental geriatricians must understand oral health problems in multiple dimensions. This referred to assessment in physical, social, and psychological dimensions including changes in association with aging and self-care ability. In addition to the components identified from the scoping review, certain CGA components, including swallowing problem, fall risk, and nutritional status, were emphasized in a focus group.

Dependency and cognition

Both focus groups indicated that the assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) is essential because it reflects a patient's dependency level. During discussion, the phase "dependency" was mentioned with a general agreement on using basic activity of daily living as a determinant. Notably, cognitive ability and social factors were mentioned frequently. Assessment of cognitive functions was viewed to be crucial for oral care, because it impacted oral hygiene maintenance and treatment compliance. The choice of assessment tools should be practical and aligned with assessment purposes. In this part, it was mentioned by the family medicine expert (1FGs3; Table 2) that 'When evaluating primarily for dental treatment, it is preferable to select the shorter and simpler assessment option such as Mini-Cog for screening cognitive impairment. However, if the goal is to share the assessment results for the use of other healthcare professions, conducting the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) may be preferrable". On another occasion, the experts in geriatric medicine (1FGs2; Table 2) mentioned, "I think a diagnosis of dementia or depression may not be necessary in dental settings. However, the impact of these conditions on oral health is important. This also relates to decisional capacity and self-care abilities of the patients. It's important to understand how well they comprehend daily activities and whether they are physically capable of performing them".

### A comparison between an ICT tool and a traditional physical measure for frailty evaluation in older adults [^b9eba68d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Frailty is a clinical condition among older adults defined as the loss of resource in one or more domains (i.e. physical, psychological and social domains) of individual functioning. Senile anorexia and malnutrition have to be considered among the main risk factors for frailty. Authors underline that the risk of frailty may be reduced by improved nutritional status for macronutrients and micronutrients. Frailty makes older adults more vulnerable and susceptible to adverse health outcomes, such as falls, hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. An impaired physical function is the major indicator of frailty and negatively affects the autonomy in the activities of daily living. In particular, the mobility function, defined as the ability to move in the environment easily and without restriction, resulted strictly related to frailty. Indeed, poor mobility was associated with higher frailty scores. Moreover, the daily step count and the amount of energy spent performing the activities of daily living (in kcal/week) were strongly associated with frailty levels.

Generally, mobility function, based on self-report or performance-based measurements, are useful tools for frailty screening (e.g.). However, these measures may lead to possible self-report bias, non-objective parameters or may be not ecological. For example, a Walking test, that evaluates the time taken to walk a path, typically is used to assess mobility function in older adults (e.g.). However, this assessment is limited to laboratory environment and does not reflect the mobility in everyday life activity. Thus, ICT systems may provide objective parameters for monitoring continuously and in a non-intrusive way the older adults during everyday life. Indeed, ICT systems that evaluates mobility levels (e.g. resting, sitting or walking activity) during everyday life activity may overcome the limitations of the traditional assessment of older adults' health status and provide specific information on their behaviour.

### Interprofessional medication assessment among home care patients: any impact on functioning? Results from a randomised controlled trial [^eb1eff99]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Katz index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and the Lawton and Brody scale of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale were used to evaluate each patient's performance. The maximum score in ADL is six; in IADL it is eight, with lower scores indicating increased requirement for assistance in daily activities. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to assess mobility, lower extremity strength and balance. The time taken to complete the TUG test correlates with the level of functional mobility. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for screening cognitive functions; MMSE scores ≤ 24 indicate impaired cognitive function. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) was used for assessing depressive symptoms. Sum scores ≥ 6 are suggestive of depression. The preference-based, five-dimension instrument provided by EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L)(1) was used for measuring health-related quality of life. These measurements were carried out at baseline and repeated at the six-month follow-up.

Statistical methods

Data were analysed according to randomisation group irrespective of whether the patients received the intervention as planned (the intention to treat principle). Baseline characteristics of the sample were summarized using proportions, percentages, and means with standard deviation (SD).

We used linear mixed models (LMM) with a random subject effect to detect differences in ADL, IADL, TUG, MMSE, GDS-15, and EQ-5D-3L between the usual care and intervention groups. Treatment (FIMA vs. usual care), time (baseline vs. 6-month follow-up), and sex served as factors, and age and CCI (excluding dementia) at baseline served as covariates. Based on our preliminary analyses (shown as request), the final models also included a treatment-time-sex interaction. IBM® SPSS® Statistics Version 25 served as the statistical platform.

### Screening for frailty and its association with activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and falls among community-dwelling older adults in China [^a6acf595]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Activities of daily living (ADL)

The participants' basic activities of daily living (BADL) were assessed using an independence of daily living assessment form. The BADLs assessed the basic daily self-care activities of the participants. It includes feeding, grooming, dressing, toileting, and transferring. Each item has a detailed description of its various levels and scores, and the total score is calculated by summing all the scores, ranging from 0 to 37. The participants were categorized as either BADL independent (BADL score < 4) or as having limitations in BADL (BADL score ≥ 4).

The instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale developed by Lawton and Brody was used to assess IADL performance in this survey. The scale consists of eight items, each with 4 levels, and any item that cannot be completed independently is considered a limitation in IADL. The IADLs evaluated more complex daily life activities associated with interactions between individuals and the external environment.

Cognitive impairment screening

The subjective cognitive impairment screening of the participants was assessed utilizing the Cog-12, which is a modified and translated iteration of the Ascertain Dementia 8 (AD8) questionnaire. The original version of the AD8 questionnaire included eight yes-or-no questions, while the cog-12 included four additional questions: "Q9. Have you been encountering emotional instability or modifications in your personality? "; "Q10. Are you exhibiting unusual behavior or experiencing changes in your habits? "; "Q11. Have you been experiencing hallucinations? "; "Q12. Are you encountering difficulties in speech or communication?" In contrast to the AD8, the Cog-12 expanded the grading of scale options, with each item utilizing a 0–4 Likert scale. The accumulation of scores from the 12 items resulted in a total score ranging from 0 to 48. According to previous clinical evidence from China, a score of 6 or higher was identified as the optimal threshold for a positive result in this study.

The objective cognitive impairment screening of the participants was assessed utilizing the Mini-cog, which is a recommended brief cognitive evaluation tool for primary care. The assessment included a three-word recall task and the clock drawing test (CDT). A positive screening for cognitive impairment was indicated by a delayed word recall score of 0 (out of 3) or if the delayed word recall score was 1 or 2, alongside an abnormal CDT result.

### A novel longshi scale measured activity of daily living disability in elderly patients affected by neurological diseases: a multi-center cross-sectional study in China [^d6f3d591]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

At the end of 2019 the total population of mainland China aged over 60 totaled more than 250 million, or about 18.1% of the total population. Older adults often have structural decline and degraded physiological functioning which may impair their ability to perform common activities of daily living (ADL). More seriously, loss of ADL ability may induce a poor quality of life to go with increased medical needs with their economic burden on the family and the healthcare system. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the ADL disability in clinical practice, and the social security system demands that as well.

Katz and others have proposed the ADL as a context to evaluating the health and functional status of older adults, that view has gradually been adopted. Several instruments have been developed for the purpose. The Barthel Index (BI) is an instrument recommended by the Royal College of Physicians for routine use in the assessment of the ADL ability of older people. The index assesses ten daily activities using ordinal scales. The original BI was scored in steps of five points to give a maximum total score of 100. Functional Independence Measures have also been validated for evaluating the older adults. They cover 18 items, with a total score ranging from 18 to 126. But using them properly requires professional training and is time-consuming. As an alternative, the Japanese have developed a Functional Independence and Difficulty Scale with 14 items, but it has been validated only with a Japanese population.

The Longshi Scale is a novel pictorial instrument, with good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability(Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, ICC > 0.8) developed to assess disability associated with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal conditions. A subject is first evaluated to assign them to the bedridden group, domestic group or community group (Fig. 1). The patient is then evaluated using a form to their particular group (Fig. 2). Each form consists of 3 items. Each item is assessed using three pictures by a professional corresponding to three levels on a Likert-type scale: 1 for maximum to fully dependent, 2 for partially independent, and 3 for maximum to fully independent. However, the Longshi Scale has not yet been validated for use with older people, especially those disabled by a medical condition.

### Diagnostic accuracy of instrumental activities of daily living for dementia in community-dwelling older adults [^a28f40c1]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Background

many people living with dementia remain underdiagnosed and unrecognised. Screening strategies are important for early detection.

Objective

to examine whether the Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, compared with other cognitive screening tools-the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Ascertain Dementia 8-item Informant Questionnaire (AD8)-can identify older (≥ 65 years) adults with dementia.

Design

population-based cross-sectional observational study.

Setting

all 19 counties in Taiwan.

Participants

community-dwelling older adults (n = 10,340; mean age 74.87 ± 6.03).

Methods

all participants underwent a structured in-person interview. Dementia was identified using National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association core clinical criteria for all-cause dementia. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine the discriminant abilities of the IADL scale, MMSE and AD8 to differentiate participants with and without dementia.

Results

we identified 917 (8.9%) participants with dementia, and 9,423 (91.1%) participants without. The discriminant abilities of the MMSE, AD8 and IADL scale (cutoff score: 6/7; area under curve = 0.925; sensitivity = 89%; specificity = 81%; positive likelihood ratio = 4.75; accuracy = 0.82) were comparable. Combining IADL with AD8 scores significantly improved overall accuracy: specificity = 93%; positive likelihood ratio = 11.74; accuracy = 0.92.

Conclusions

our findings support using IADL scale to screen older community-dwelling residents for dementia: it has discriminant power comparable to that of the AD8 and MMSE. Combining the IADL and the AD8 improves specificity.

### Assessment of cognitive instrumental activities of daily living: a systematic review [^9c30be68]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cognitive instrumental activities of daily living are particularly related to executive functions, such as scheduling appointments, monthly payments, managing the household economy, shopping or taking the bus. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the available tests for the assessment of executive functions with ecological validity to predict individuals' functioning.

Materials and Methods

An electronic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, PsyCInfo and IEEE Xplore until May 2019, in addition to a manual search. The PRISMA criteria and the Covidence platform were used to select articles and extract data.

Results

After applying the search selection criteria, 76 studies were identified. They referred to 110 tools to assess instrumental activities of daily living. Those that have received most attention are related to menu preparation and shopping. Performance-based measures are the most widely used traditional methods. Most tests were aimed at the adult population with acquired brain damage, cognitive impairment or dementia. There was a predominance of tests based on the Multiple Errands Test paradigm.

Conclusions

In recent years, it has increased the number of tools that assess the instrumental activities of daily living based on technologies such as personal or environmental sensors and serious games. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONAssessment of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living through performance-based measures is especially useful for the early detection of dysfunctions or preclinical disability. Difficulties in performing instrumental activities of daily living are closely associated with deficits in executive functions and prospective memory. Activities of Daily Living can be understood as multitasks. The use of virtual reality-based tests was shown to be sensitive to the detection of cognitive deficits in Activities of Daily Living. An advantage of using virtual reality in assessments is that it can help to predict the level of personal autonomy in patients who are in an institutional environment and could be a first approximation to the real environment.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c14216c1]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living assessment after stroke — measurement approach notes that until computer-adapted tests become routine, a combination of a basic activities of daily living (ADL) measure and an instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) measure is recommended, with examples including the 10-item Barthel Index, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and the 15-item Frenchay Activity Index; even individuals scoring 100 on the Barthel Index after mild stroke or transient ischemic attack may still have health status deficits, and the IADL assessment tool will likely be more sensitive to subtle deficits at discharge and provide useful information for discharge planning.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^43ca873d]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF research gaps — interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults emphasize that research is needed to develop and validate primary care–feasible risk assessment tools for adults 65 years or older, to compare exercise plus multifactorial interventions with exercise alone, to improve availability and accessibility of effective interventions (including remote delivery), to evaluate effectiveness and harms in distinct functional/risk groups (including persons 85 years or older and those with frailty), and to assess benefits and harms of educational and psychological interventions.

### Patient-reported outcome measure use among older adults after emergency department care: a systematic review [^f8afed53]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are gaining favor in clinical and research settings given their ability to capture a patient's symptom burden, functional status, and quality of life. Our objective in this systematic review was to summarize studies including PROMs assessed among older adults (age ≥ 65years) after seeking emergency care.

Methods

With the assistance of a medical librarian, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science-Core Collection, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through June 2023 for studies in which older adult ED patients had PROMs assessed in the post-emergency care time period. Independent reviewers performed title/abstract review, full-text screening, data extraction, study characteristic summarization, and risk-of-bias (RoB) assessments.

Results

Our search strategy yielded 5153 studies of which 56 met study inclusion criteria. Within included studies, 304 unique PROM assessments were performed at varying time points after the ED visit, including 61 unique PROMs. The most commonly measured domain was physical function, assessed within the majority of studies (47/56; 84%), with measures including PROMs such as Katz activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, and the Barthel Index. PROMs were most frequently assessed at 1-3months after an ED visit (113/304; 37%), greater than 6months (91/304; 30%), and 4-6months (88/304; 29%), with very few PROMs assessed within 1month of the ED visit (12/304; 4%). Of the 16 interventional studies, two were determined to have a low RoB, four had moderate RoB, nine had high RoB, and one had insufficient information. Of the 40 observational studies, 10 were determined to be of good quality, 20 of moderate quality, and 10 of poor quality.

Conclusions

PROM assessments among older adults following an ED visit frequently measured physical function, with very few assessments occurring within the first 1month after an ED visit.

### The tools of disability outcomes research functional status measures [^c2b44141]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the major functional status measures currently used in rehabilitation research, including the domains and scope of functional status measures, as well as the psychometric properties of selected functional status measures and their use in adult rehabilitation populations.

Data Sources

Measures of physical functioning widely used in rehabilitation research.

Study Selection

Major generic measures included the following activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living: the FIM instrument, the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale, the Level of Rehabilitation Scale, the Barthel index, and the Patient Evaluation and Conference System. Measures were evaluated based on published evidence of validity, reliability, and sensitivity.

Data Extraction

Measures were chosen on the basis of the amount and quality of published research on the functional measures widely used in rehabilitation medicine. Independent research of computer databases and reviews of functional measures were conducted to determine suitability for inclusion. The quality and validity of the measures were assessed using standard psychometric guidelines.

Data Synthesis

Measures were evaluated based on published evidence of validity, reliability, sensitivity response and administrative burdens and instrument bias. Each criterion was graded on a 3-point scale reflecting the level of evidence.

Conclusion

Researchers in the field of disabilities research need to consider carefully study objectives when measuring physical functioning in people with disabilities.

### Proposition of a corrected measure of the lawton instrumental activities of daily living score [^c8270864]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Alzheimer's disease or related disorders are a main cause of functional decline, and the diagnosis of major neurocognitive stage is defined as a significant cognitive decline which interfere with independence in activities of daily living, as presented in the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-V) criteria. Functional decline in older adults leads to institutionalization and increased health-care costs, as well as shifting many daily responsibilities to caregivers and increasing their burden. The accuracy of the functional abilities assessment is therefore one of the key features in the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and their change, as well as in research studies which aim to assess the effect of interventions to delay functional decline. Among the several scales available to measure the level of functional abilities, and in the current lack of consensus, the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale has been widely adopted, and is usually part of the evaluation in clinical practice in the memory centers in France. The Lawton IADL scale was developed to assess more complex abilities of daily living necessary for living independently in the community, there are nevertheless a few information on its psychometric proprieties. Additionally, the original Lawton IADL scale displays some limits since it does not take into account the possibility to have never done one or several assessed activities, which lead to potentially underestimate the overall patient's functional level. In this case, the total score could lack of precision because it does not capture the real abilities of the patient. This issue is particularly noticeable when comparing IADL scores between men and women, considering that some tasks are more representative of men or women activities, as previously mentioned. Consequently, previous studies have proposed to differentiate the calculation of the score between men and women, or to calculate the score by using only some items (3, 4 or 5 depending on the study) of the IADL questionnaire less dependent of gender or more related to the risk of dementia or cognitive disorders, nevertheless, the reliability of such new scales has not been formally tested, and the choice of item varies between studies making comparison difficult. Conversely, others publications have recommended to rate all items without differentiation for both genders. Given the different situations, it still appears complicate to decide how the Lawton IADL should be used in clinical practice as well as in research studies.

### Daily activities and suspected dementia among community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional study [^70cbe1b3]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dementia is a complex syndrome resulting from different neurodegenerative processes that lead to cognitive decline, affecting memory, language, perception, and executive functions. However, many people with dementia never receive a diagnosis, and most cases in lower income countries are likely to be undiagnosed. Dementia is undiagnosed among many Chinese older adults, and more than half the people in local communities live with symptoms of dementia are not properly treated. As dementia is an irreversible disease, early diagnosis and detection of dementia are critical for its prevention and treatment.

Dementia often, but not invariably, begins with memory impairment and eventually progresses to a stage where the individual is unable to independently manage daily activities. Daily activities include instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as transportation or taking medications, and basic activities of daily living (BADLs), such as feeding or grooming. The BADLs and IADLs are two different categories used to assess an older adults' functional ability, when evaluating their capacity to live independently. The severity of dementia interfered with the older adult's performance in daily activities. Cognitive decline, motor impairments, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia influence daily activities performance in individuals with dementia. Previous studies have highlighted the complex interplay between these factors and their impact on daily activities.

Diagnosis of dementia in older adults with cognitive impairment was quite tricky, which made it impossible to identify underlying dementia and to perform therapy at the early stage. Identification of the characteristics of people who have undiagnosed dementia is challenging and this is our study to explore whether daily activities of undiagnosed dementia is normal. Comparable to complex diagnosis methods, the Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R) is a valuable initial screening tool for identifying individuals who may need further evaluation of possible dementia. Previous research suggested that daily activities may be an essential variable, when determining the severity of dementia. Moreover, the fundamental tasks of BADLs are essential for personal survival and independent living, and difficulty with BADLs often signifies the need for direct care assistance. In patients with dementia, impairment in IADLs occur soon after onset. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the relationships between of daily activities impairment and incidence of suspected dementia among community-dwelling older adults.

### Limitations in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living capacity in a representative sample: disentangling dementia-and mobility-related effects [^c83c6825]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

A representative sample of the Leipzig population aged 75 years and older showed 61.8% of the participants with relevant deficits in their capacity for independent living, according to a combined activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL) scale. The quantity and quality of care needed almost exponentially increases above 85 years of age. Looking at potential reasons for ADL/IADL limitations, 44% of variance in single ADL/IADL activities and 75% of the combined ADL/IADL sum score could come from a minimal set of predictor variables. Most important are dementia- or mobility-related declines, but living conditions also explain small but significant amounts of variance. These seem initially impressive, yet analyses showed about half the explained variances shared among the mobility and dementia indicators, limiting the use not only of ADL/IADL sum scores but of many single ADL/IADL items as well. Before deriving specific conclusions from variations in ADL/IADL instruments, one must note that the data suggest that interpretations of covariations — whether for health/mobility or dementia — are useful and substantial only if both indicators/predictors are verified. The information given captures the mobility- and dementia-related variance if ADL/IADL items, facilitating more specific scale developments.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^4ec0f972]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society falls prevention — assessment changes call for a multifactorial falls risk assessment for all older adults who present with a fall or have gait and balance problems and also for individuals who simply report difficulties with gait or balance, whereas a falls risk assessment is not considered necessary for older persons reporting only a single fall without report or demonstrated difficulty or unsteadiness. The history should address frequency of falling, symptoms at the time of fall, and injuries from fall, and new assessment elements include examination of the feet and footwear; functional assessment of activities of daily living (including adaptive equipment and mobility aids as appropriate); assessment of the individual's perceived functional ability and fear related to falling; and environmental assessment, including home safety.

### Development of a proxy-free objective assessment tool of instrumental activities of daily living in mild cognitive impairment using smart home technologies [^5256e905]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) is essential for dementia diagnostics. Even in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subtle deficits in instrumental ADL (IADL) may occur and signal a higher risk of conversion to dementia. Thus, sensitive and reliable ADL assessment tools are important. Smart homes equipped with sensor technology and video cameras may provide a proxy-free assessment tool for the detection of IADL deficits.

Objective

The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of a smart home environment for the assessment of IADL in MCI.

Method

The smart home consisted of a two-room flat equipped with activity sensors and video cameras. Participants with either MCI or healthy controls (HC) had to solve a standardized set of six tasks, e.g., meal preparation, telephone use, and finding objects in the flat.

Results

MCI participants needed more time (1384 versus 938 seconds, p < 0.001) and scored less total points (48 versus 57 points, p < 0.001) while solving the tasks than HC. Analyzing the subtasks, intergroup differences were observed for making a phone call, operating the television, and retrieving objects. MCI participants showed more searching and task-irrelevant behavior than HC. Task performance was correlated with cognitive status and IADL questionnaires but not with participants' age.

Conclusion

This pilot study showed that smart home technologies offer the chance for an objective and ecologically valid assessment of IADL. It can be analyzed not only whether a task is successfully completed but also how it is completed. Future studies should concentrate on the development of automated detection of IADL deficits.

### Associations between anemia and dependence on basic and instrumental activities of daily living in older women [^396aa667]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Main outcomes

Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (BADL) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale

The Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (BADL) records the level of independence and functional status in basic daily activities, including, eating, bathing, dressing, bowel/bladder control, toileting, transfers from bed to chair, mobility on flat surfaces, and stair climbing. BADL is scored on a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 indicating dependency on another person and 100 indicating independence. The BADL is divided into five categories (100–91: fully independent; 99–91: mildly dependent; 62–90: moderately dependent; 61–21: highly dependent; 20–0: fully dependent).

Disability levels in community-dwelling older adults were first evaluated by Lawton and Brody in 1969 who developed the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL) to achieve this aim. The IADL is a commonly used assessment tool for this outcome among older adults. The IADL measures eight activities, including using a telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, use of transportation, responsibility for taking own medication, and ability to handle finances. On the Turkish version of the IADL each individual activity is scored on a scale from 0 to between 2 and 4. Low scores indicate a high degree of dependency, and the sum of scale runs from 0 to 23. The total score is interpreted as follows: 0–8: dependent; 9–16: semi-dependent; 17–23: independent.

### Obesity influences transitional States of disability in older adults with knee pain [^98fdf3db]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study employed relatively new statistical methods to understand how many states are needed to describe disability in older adults with knee pain, describe the relative probability of transitioning between states over time, and examine whether obesity influences the probability of transitioning between states.

Design

Prospective epidemiologic study of older adults with knee pain.

Setting

Community.

Participants

The participants, 245 women and 235 men, were 65 years or older, had chronic knee pain on most days, and had difficulty with at least 1 mobility-related activity caused by knee pain.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary instrument, the Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability, evaluated self-reported difficulty with mobility, basic activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

Results

The Hidden Markov Model yielded 6 states reflecting changes in mobility, ADLs, and IADLs. There is evidence that loss in more demanding mobility-related activities such as stair climbing is an early sign for the onset of disability and that functional deficits in the lower extremities are critical to the early loss of ADLs. Overall the trend is for older adults to experience greater progression than regression and for obesity to be important in understanding severe states of disability.

Conclusions

These data provide a strong rationale for characterizing disability on a continuum and underscore the fluid nature of disability in older adults. As expected, lower-extremity function plays a key role in the disablement process; obesity is also particularly relevant to understanding severe states of disability.

### Association between physical activity and physical and functional performance in non-institutionalized Mexican older adults: a cohort study [^9046527b]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Basic activities of daily living assessment

The Barthel Index (BI) is an instrument that measures the capacity of a person to carry out ten Activities of Daily Living (ADL), considered as basic, obtaining a quantitative estimation of its degree of independence. The activities of daily living that it evaluates are: Feeding, transfer from chair to bed, bathing, dressing, grooming, stool, urination, use of the toilet, walking and climbing stairs. The items of the BI possess a hierarchy of difficulty and yield ordinal intervals between adjacent scores, the total score ranges from 0, indicating that they are completely dependent, to 100, completely independent. The reliability of the instrument applied to older people living in the community, measured with Cronbach's α, is 0.82, which indicates good reliability.

On the other hand, Barthel index also is a validated scale for international use to assess functional capacity in older adults as Katz scale evaluated the structural and predictive validity, internal consistency, sensitivity to change of the Barthel Index scores and their relationship with other measurement instruments through 4 cohorts. The factor loadings were greater than 0.40, and the fit indices were satisfactory. The internal consistency of the scores was optimal and the results confirm the one-dimensional structure found in other validation studies of the original version. The predictive validity of their scores regarding mortality at 6 months, the cut-off value of 95 for both cohorts showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.742.

### Practical assessment and management of vulnerabilities in older patients receiving systemic cancer therapy: ASCO guideline update… [^88dfbbf7]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

5, 6the update reconsiders the question of which GA tools are best suited for use in everyday clinical oncology practice. In that context, the update highlights and makes the case for the use of a Practical Geriatric Assessment instrument designed to address barriers to routine implementation of GA in clinical practice. Clinical adaptation of the GA based on patient population, resources, and time is appropriate. The remaining recommendations from the 2018 guideline are unchanged because there were no new potentially practice-changing data to support other substantive revisions. The evidence supporting these unchanged recommendations is reviewed in the previous guideline publication.

1.

5based on the results of a survey of 1, 277 providers who treated adults with cancer, reported that just 21% of respondents indicated that they performed a multidimensional GA using validated tools always or most of the time; 22% performed multidimensional GA some of the time; and 57% performed multidimensional GA rarely or never. A greater frequency of using a multidimensional GA with validated tools was associated with awareness of the 2018 ASCO GA guideline (aware of the ASCO guideline. 69to identify essential domains from multiple validated GA tools. To this end, the Task Force first compiled multiple validated tools for each domain and reviewed the strengths and concerns of each tool with a focus on practical clinical use. The Task Force then conducted a consensus exercise using a modified Delphi process with predetermined levels of consensus to identify one tool for each domain.

91detailing the PGA with scoring instructions, suggestions for actions to take based on the scoring, video guidance on how to conduct the PGA, and references for evidence to support its use. Through ASCO's website, there are updated details on how to use the information generated. Finally, if there is widespread adoption of the PGA in multiple locations, the opportunity for real-world data collection and evidence based on a consistent measurement will ensure continued refinement of the PGA into the future. 70Given that clinical judgment has not proven reliable in assessing frailty, the PGA is recommended to be used as the appropriate evaluation for older adults. Specific questions on the use of the PGA are also contained in a companion article by Williams et al 91in JCO Oncology Practice.

The Panel acknowledges the challenges of adopting a new practice, and recognizes that judgment will be exercised by individual practices on how best to incorporate these assessments as much a possible into their practices.

### Geriatric assessment: ASCO global guideline [^977b8c3a]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO Global Guideline — geriatric assessment (GA) in Basic resource settings recommends that clinicians apply the results of GA to develop an integrated and individualized plan for patients that informs treatment selection by helping to estimate risks for adverse outcomes and to identify nononcologic problems that may be amenable to intervention; the Expert Panel suggests that clinicians consider G8 screening tool plus or minus practical geriatric assessment (PGA) results when recommending treatment and that the information be provided to patients and caregivers to guide decision making for treatment, and clinicians should implement targeted, GA-guided interventions to manage nononcologic problems; a qualifying statement notes that most processes were developed in Maximal-resource settings and that a model utilizing GA to inform clinicians to adapt treatment decisions may be reasonable in Basic settings; rating for all settings is stated as (Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak).

### A scoping review of nonpharmacological interventions to reduce disability in older adults [^9d4834d4]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Minimizing disability is critical to reduce the costly health care associated with disability and maintain quality of life into old age. We examined the effect sizes of nonpharmacological intervention studies in reducing disability and explored the active ingredients of interventions.

Research Design and Methods

A scoping review was conducted via PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Thirty-one randomized controlled trials were included. Eight active ingredients were identified by three experts (exercise, problem-solving, cognitive behavioral therapy, environmental modification, education, goal setting, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and cognitive training).

Results

The range of Cohen's d was -0.85 to 1.76 across 31 studies (included 33 interventions); 67% studies (n = 22) obtained small-to-negative effect sizes (d = -0.85 to 0.18), accounting for 83% participants across studies. Interventions that incorporated exercise, problem-solving, cognitive behavior therapy, and environmental modification were associated with stronger effect sizes. Interventions that incorporated comprehensive geriatric assessment obtained small effect sizes.

Discussion and Implications

Majority of intervention studies found little or no effect in reducing disability for older adults. To optimize the effects of nonpharmacological interventions, we recommend researchers to (i) develop a screening tool for "risk of disability" to inform those who are early on the disability progression, yet not experience any difficulties in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living; (ii) specify the active ingredients embedded in complex interventions to facilitate change in disability; and (iii) select sensitive tools to capture the progression of disability in late life.

### Influencing factors on instrumental activities of daily living functioning in people with mild cognitive disorder-a secondary investigation of cross-sectional data [^32c847fd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Measurements

IADL functioning was assessed using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale as part of the Brussels Integrated Activities of Daily Living Inventory (BIA). The BIA and particular of interest for this paper, the i –ADL tool has shown to be reliable and valid in identifying cognitive disorders in a geriatric population. The tool evaluates the nine IADLs from the LAWTON scale by informant report. Informants were relatives or caregivers (spouse, family, or close friend), interacting with the person close enough to provide accurate information about IADL performance. The tool considers only the relevant activities. Relevant activities were activities that the participant currently or lately performed since the years of retirement. This is important because, some of the activities may have never been performed before and are therefore irrelevant to evaluate for the participant. The total number of relevant activities was calculated. Next, the informant was asked how the relevant activities were currently performed and the interviewer assigned a score ranging from 0 (no difficulty to perform) to 4 (complete difficulty to perform), based on the performance qualifiers of the ICF. Each activity with a score of more than zero was counted as an activity with limitations. Based on this information, a total i-ADL disability index (i-ADL-DI) was calculated, considering the sum of relevant activities, the number of limited activities, and each limitation's severity. The i-ADL-DI was expressed as a percentage with higher scores representing worse functioning.

### Predictive model to identify multiple synergistic effects of geriatric syndromes on quality of life in older adults: a hospital-based pilot study [^7940aa57]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Quality of life (QOL) has been reported to be associated with sociodemographic characteristics and geriatric syndromes in older adults, but the impact of interactions among multiple geriatric syndromes on QOL remains unexplored. We aimed to apply a machine learning method to evaluate the effects of interactions among multiple geriatric syndromes on QOL in older adults.

Methods

We recruited adults aged ≥ 65 years admitted to a tertiary medical center from June 2018 to September 2018. The main outcome was the three-level five-dimensional Euro-Quality of Life tool (EQ-5D-3 L) utility value. The random forest algorithm was used to identify and rank the strongest predictors of geriatric syndromes. The relation between predictors and outcomes was visualized with accumulated local effects plots and interaction effects. Model performance was evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation with metrics of R-square, the mean square error of estimation and the mean absolute error of estimation.

Results

The study included 160 older adults with a mean age of 79 years. The top ten features that significantly influenced the utility prediction were activities of daily living (ADL), frailty, pain, the number of medications used, age, depression, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), body mass index (BMI), peptic ulcer, and emotional loneliness. The two-way interactions between ADL, frailty, and pain significantly interacted with other predictors.

Conclusion

ADL, frailty, and pain are important factors to be considered when assessing QOL in older adults. It is important for clinicians to consider them together in clinical decision-making.

Prevention of falls in older persons — home environment interventions: Home environment assessment and intervention performed by a healthcare professional should be included in a multifactorial assessment and intervention for older persons who have fallen or who have risk factors for falling. [A] The intervention should include mitigation of identified hazards in the home and evaluation and interventions to promote the safe performance of daily activities. [A]

### Multivariate analysis of independent determinants of ADL / IADL and quality of life in the elderly [^e02b7fe7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome

The outcome variables in this study were disability and QOL.

Disability was examined applying the Barthel index (BI) for ADL according to the Hamburg Classification Manual and the Lawton and Brody scale for IADL. The BI is a valid geriatric assessment measure, and the Hamburg Classification Manual is considered to be the standard operationalisation of the BI in German geriatrics. The BI contains ten items with maximum item scores ranging from five to fifteen depending on the specific item. Full dependence concerning an item is equated with a score of zero. If a person exhibits full dependence in one or more items (i.e. attainment of one or more scores of zero), the person is identified as ADL disabled. Hence, study participants were dichotomised as ADL disabled or ADL independent. The Lawton and Brody scale for IADL is a valid and reliable assessment tool including eight items. An item score of one indicates mastery of the respective task, while an item score of zero displays dependency regarding the particular item. Study participants achieving the maximum total score of 8 were considered as IADL independent, while subjects with one or more IADL dependencies were identified as IADL disabled.

QOL was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-OLD. The WHOQOL-BREF is a valid and reliable short version of the WHOQOL-100. It contains the four domains 'Physical Health, 'Psychological', 'Social Relationships' and 'Environment' which are evaluated with a total of 24 items. In addition, the WHOQOL-BREF includes two general items assessing the global QOL as well as the contentment with the current self-perceived health status (i.e. the 'Global Score'). The WHOQOL-OLD is commonly used as add-on instrument in a geriatric setting in order to cover specificities regarding the QOL of elderly people. It is composed of six facets, each comprising four items. The six facets are: 'Sensory Abilities', 'Autonomy', 'Past, Present and Future Activities', 'Social Participation', 'Death and Dying', 'Intimacy'. The mean of those six facets forms the 'Total Score' of the WHOQOL-OLD. For both the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-OLD, each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Mean scores of each domain/facet were then transformed into a scale with values ranging from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater levels of QOL.
