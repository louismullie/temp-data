## Question

Elevated a1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage an elevated hemoglobin A1c. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the result and verifying assay quality. Then, I should classify the A1c into prediabetes or diabetes ranges and consider discordance with glucose. Next, I will evaluate patient-specific factors that can falsely elevate or depress A1c. After that, I should outline initial workup and confirmatory testing. Then, I will individualize management targets and choose therapy based on severity and phenotype. Finally, I will set a monitoring cadence and address special populations and perioperative considerations, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the A1c result and the testing context, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a spurious value. I should verify that the assay is NGSP-certified and traceable to DCCT, and I should repeat the test if the result is unexpected or if the clinical picture conflicts with glucose data, since confirmation is required unless there is unequivocal hyperglycemia with symptoms or crisis, and discordance warrants repeating the same or an alternate test to resolve the discrepancy [^113ijYvh] [^116xiHbV] [^115MFVh2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify the A1c into diagnostic categories: normal is less than 5.7%, prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%, and diabetes is 6.5% or higher, remembering that A1c has lower sensitivity than fasting glucose at the diagnostic threshold, so a nondiagnostic A1c does not exclude diabetes and should be interpreted alongside glucose-based tests when discordant [^113ijYvh] [^11683ts9].

> Wait, let me verify potential interferences and patient factors that can distort A1c before I label the patient. Altered erythrocyte turnover from anemia, iron deficiency, hemolysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, erythropoietin therapy, CKD, cirrhosis, pregnancy, HIV, and hemoglobinopathies can yield misleading A1c; in these settings, plasma glucose criteria should be used for diagnosis, and I should consider fructosamine or CGM-derived metrics when A1c is unreliable or discordant with glucose [^115MFVh2] [^115kb4S7] [^111Cy3rP].

> I need to check for assay-specific interferences as well. Some HPLC and immunoassay methods are confounded by hemoglobin variants such as Hb Hope, HbS, HbC, HbE, or elevated HbF; if suspected, I should request a method less affected by variants or use an alternate test, and I should double-check results that are inconsistent with the clinical context or with self-monitoring data [^112n2mmm] [^112mjdi3].

> Next, I should review the initial workup. If A1c is 6.5% or higher, I should confirm with a second abnormal result using the same or a different test, and if A1c is 5.7% to 6.4%, I should obtain fasting plasma glucose or a 75-g OGTT to better characterize risk and phenotype, because A1c and glucose tests detect different populations and combining them improves sensitivity and specificity [^113ijYvh] [^116xiHbV] [^1178QS3D].

> Let me consider the clinical context and risk stratification. I should assess age, BMI, family history, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, medications, and symptoms, and I should remember that older adults may have limited progression from prediabetes and that overtreatment carries hypoglycemia risk, so I should tailor intensity to life expectancy and vulnerability [^115SHvkB] [^111NsTqj].

> For prediabetes, I should confirm with glucose testing when feasible, counsel on risk, and prioritize lifestyle intervention, with consideration of metformin in high-risk individuals such as those with A1c 6.0% or higher, age under 60, BMI 35 kg/m² or higher, or prior gestational diabetes, while monitoring progression at least annually and more often if multiple risk factors are present [^115PDvtC] [^112Y2Ggc].

> For diabetes, I should confirm the diagnosis and then individualize the A1c target. Many nonpregnant adults without significant hypoglycemia risk can reasonably aim for less than 7.0%, whereas older adults, those with limited life expectancy, severe hypoglycemia, or multiple comorbidities may appropriately target 7.5% to 8.0% or higher, and the VA/DoD suggests a 7.0% to 8.5% range for most patients if safely achievable, with deprescribing considered when risk outweighs benefit [^111M9U9g] [^111FocK4] [^114keyam].

> I will now examine pharmacotherapy choices. For new-onset type 2 diabetes, metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated, and for A1c 7.5% or higher, dual therapy may be reasonable; for A1c 10% or higher or symptoms, insulin is often indicated initially, though observational data suggest that in severe hyperglycemia, rapid follow-up and education may enable non-insulin regimens to succeed in some newly diagnosed patients, so I should avoid reflexive insulinization without a plan for de-escalation [^116weoCm] [^113Dkm39] [^113a3QwM].

> But wait, what if the A1c is markedly elevated and the patient is acutely ill or perioperative? I should confirm whether this reflects chronic dysglycemia versus stress hyperglycemia, because preoperative A1c elevation is independently associated with higher 30-day complications, readmissions, and mortality, supporting routine preoperative A1c screening and perioperative glycemic optimization when elevated [^11393fKd] [^116N8W1D].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence. In stable, at-target patients, A1c every 6 months is reasonable, whereas those not at target or with changing therapy should have A1c checked about every 3 months, and I should integrate SMBG or CGM when medication changes occur or when hypoglycemia or variability is a concern, recognizing that GMI from CGM may diverge from A1c and should be interpreted in that context [^1116WPeD] [^111Cy3rP].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In older adults, I should screen with FPG and or A1c every 2 years and individualize targets to mitigate hypoglycemia, in people with HIV on ART I should avoid A1c for diagnosis and rely on plasma glucose, and in pregnancy or conditions altering RBC lifespan, A1c should not be used for diagnosis and glucose criteria must be used instead [^114XeHmx] [^114ZULC2] [^115MFVh2].

> I should double-check that my plan addresses assay quality and point-of-care use. Only NGSP-certified, FDA-cleared POC devices operated in CLIA-certified settings with proficiency testing should be used for diagnosis, and when results are discordant with glucose, I should repeat testing or use an alternate modality rather than forcing a label that does not fit the clinical picture [^115MFVh2] [^117QG6Tr].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm the A1c with a standardized method, classify the range, screen for interferences and patient factors that distort A1c, confirm diabetes with a second abnormal test when appropriate, individualize targets and therapy by risk and phenotype, and monitor at guideline-directed intervals while remaining ready to pivot when new data or patient status changes, because accurate interpretation and judicious action reduce both under- and overtreatment and improve outcomes [^113ijYvh] [^111FocK4] [^1116WPeD].

An elevated A1c reflects **chronic hyperglycemia** over ~3 months and is defined as ≥ 6.5% for diabetes and 5.7–6.4% for prediabetes [^113ijYvh] [^115PDvtC]. It is a **reliable marker** of glycemic control and risk for microvascular complications, but results can be misleading in conditions that alter red cell turnover (anemia, hemoglobinopathies, CKD, pregnancy) or with certain assays [^114mu8U3] [^114dkPgY]. Confirm an elevated A1c with a second test or glucose-based criteria, assess for interfering factors, and individualize targets and therapy based on comorbidities, age, and hypoglycemia risk [^116xiHbV] [^117MZD4o] [^112z9Yaz].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

- **Definition**: Elevated A1c is ≥ 6.5% for diabetes and 5.7–6.4% for prediabetes [^113ijYvh] [^115PDvtC].
- **Clinical significance**: Reflects chronic hyperglycemia and predicts microvascular complications; also signals higher cardiovascular risk in prediabetes [^1157ezWP] [^113MwR1P].
- **Physiological basis**: A1c forms when glucose irreversibly glycates hemoglobin; because RBCs live ~120 days, A1c reflects average glycemia over ~3 months [^11683ts9].

---

## Factors influencing A1c levels

Several factors can **alter A1c independent of glycemia**:

| **Category** | **Factors influencing a1c levels** |
|-|-|
| Physiological | - Age (rises ~0.1% per decade) [^notfound] <br/> - Race/ethnicity (higher in African Americans, Asians) [^114AQYxP] <br/> - Pregnancy (altered RBC turnover) [^115MFVh2] |
| Pathological | - Anemia (iron deficiency, hemolysis, CKD) [^115MFVh2] <br/> - Hemoglobinopathies (HbS, HbC, HbE) [^114mu8U3] <br/> - Liver disease, HIV, erythropoietin therapy [^115kb4S7] |
| Assay-related | - Method-specific interferences (e.g. Hb Hope) [^112n2mmm] <br/> - Point-of-care variability [^111QPPKS] |

---

## Clinical implications of elevated A1c

- **Diabetes risk**: Prediabetes (5.7–6.4%) confers a 20–50% 5-year risk of progression; risk rises with higher A1c and additional abnormal glucose tests [^115PDvtC] [^111VxgLJ].
- **Complications**: Strongly linked to retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy; macrovascular risk increases with A1c > 7% [^1157ezWP].
- **Perioperative risk**: Elevated pre-op A1c associates with more infections, complications, and mortality [^11393fKd].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Discordance**: A1c can misclassify vs glucose tests; confirm with FPG or OGTT when results conflict or in high-risk groups [^116xiHbV] [^115MFVh2].
- **Assay quality**: Use NGSP-certified, DCCT-traceable methods; avoid POC for diagnosis unless FDA-cleared and CLIA-compliant [^116ehav9] [^115MFVh2].
- **Individualization**: Tailor targets to age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^112z9Yaz] [^117MZD4o].

---

## Management strategies

- **Lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, and weight loss are first-line for prediabetes and foundational in diabetes [^113MwR1P].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Metformin for prediabetes when high risk; add agents for diabetes based on A1c, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk [^116weoCm] [^112z9Yaz].
- **Monitoring**: Check A1c at least twice yearly if stable, quarterly if not at goal; use CGM when appropriate to reduce hypoglycemia and improve control [^1116WPeD] [^111t2kVN].

---

## Special populations

- **Older adults**: Higher A1c targets (7.0–8.5%) are reasonable to limit hypoglycemia and falls [^111FocK4] [^114keyam].
- **Pregnancy**: Use glucose-based criteria; A1c is not recommended for diagnosis [^115MFVh2].
- **HIV**: A1c may underestimate glycemia on ART; use glucose-based tests for diagnosis [^114ZULC2].

---

Elevated A1c is a **key marker of chronic hyperglycemia** and complication risk, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when appropriate, confirmed with glucose-based testing. Management should be **individualized**, with lifestyle and pharmacotherapy aligned to patient characteristics and preferences.

### Point-of-care HbA1c in clinical practice: caveats and considerations for optimal use [^111QPPKS]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is widely used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Accurate measurement of A1C is necessary for optimal clinical value. Assay standardization has markedly improved the accuracy and consistency of A1C testing. Devices to measure A1C at point of care (POC) are commercially available, allowing rapid results when the patient is seen. In this review, we describe how standardization of A1C testing was achieved, leading to high-quality results in clinical laboratories. We address the use of POC A1C testing in clinical situations and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing. We emphasize the importance of considering the limitations of these devices and following correct testing procedures to ensure that accurate A1C results are obtained for optimal care of patients.

### Executive summary: guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114F16N1]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in patients with diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments in the full version of the guideline). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the patients measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring; genetic testing; and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^1171rfep]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Finally, that the A1C diagnostic threshold now being defined at 6.5% while the recommended target for most diabetic patients remains at 7% will be viewed by some as untidy — if not a contradiction of sorts. However, good clinical judgment suggests that for many patients it may be appropriate to start at least lifestyle interventions whenever the diagnosis is made, irrespective of A1C. Whether this threshold should now be considered one for the initiation of metformin therapy (or other agents) will be extremely, and appropriately, controversial. The argument will not be settled until we have randomized clinical trials that better inform our clinical decisions in patients with such mild degrees of hyperglycemia. Such data are sorely lacking at this point. Indeed, clinical research in this arena may be easier to conduct now that the new criteria have been suggested, given that cases will be easier to identify at this early stage.

In summary, the adoption of the A1C test as a diagnostic criterion is a reasonable proposition on the practical grounds analyzed by the report. Its worldwide feasibility is, at present, limited. In addition, anchoring the diagnostic threshold solely to microvascular risk, leaving a diagnostic hiatus in the A1C range 6.1–6.5%, and choosing an A1C threshold different from the treatment target recommended by most guidelines (7%) are problematic aspects carried over from the glucose-based diagnostics. Perhaps further analysis and relevant new evidence will be considered before the findings and arguments of the International Expert Committee can be transposed into widely endorsed recommendations.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^114HbEug]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: when results may be misleading [^114dkPgY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results. The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^111bidT7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG. We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^116Edjgu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115PDvtC]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025: A1C-based identification of high-risk states — An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular complications; these individuals should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risk, and aggressive intervention and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk, such as those with A1C ≥ 6.0% [≥ 42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Analyses also note that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of high-risk Diabetes Prevention Program participants.

### The risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes in… [^115SHvkB]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the likelihood that older adults with pre-diabetes will develop diabetes mellitus over an average of 6. 5 years. Bottom Line Older patients generally will not progress to diabetes; they will either, over an average of 6. 5 years, stay at the prediabetic levels or revert to normal levels. If a patient makes it to their mid-70s without a diagnosis of diabetes, it is unlikely to occur. Synopsis Prediabetes has a few definitions. This study evaluated 3, 412 community-dwelling participants, including 2, 482 patients who had an A1C level of 5. 7% to
6. 4% or a fasting glucose level of 100 mg per dL to 125 mg per dL, or both, in a community cohort of adults with a mean age of 75. 5 years. Over 6. 5 years of follow-up with 27% attrition, 9% of patients with elevated A1C levels progressed to diabetes and 13% regressed to normoglycemia.

Of those with elevated fasting glucose levels, 8% developed diabetes and 44% returned to normoglycemia. These rates compare with a 3% development of diabetes in patients with normoglycemia at the start.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^11627gHn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

2. Testing frequency.

There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA 1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician". In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA 1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA 1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs [e.g. Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)] have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA 1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA 1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce large improvements in HbA 1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

3. Interpretation.

HbA 1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values (e.g. two- to threefold increases in some patients) that reflect an extreme degree of hyperglycemia. A proper interpretation of HbA 1c test results requires that physicians understand the relationship between HbA 1c values and mean plasma glucose, the kinetics of HbA 1c, and specific assay limitations/interferences. Small changes in HbA 1c (e.g. ± 0.3% HbA 1c) over time may reflect assay imprecision rather than a true change in glycemic status.

5. Emerging considerations

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c MAY BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, WITH VALUES ≥ 6.5% BEING DIAGNOSTIC. AN NGSP-CERTIFIED METHOD SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY. ANALOGOUS TO ITS USE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HbA 1c ASSAY WILL PRECLUDE ITS USE IN DIAGNOSIS A (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: POINT-OF-CARE HbA 1c ASSAYS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO USE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES B (moderate).

### Tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11117rvm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This paper discusses tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with particular reference to the 1997 diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The potential benefits of the lower diagnostic threshold for fasting plasma glucose are not well defined. However, the change in the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes mellitus affects as many as 1.9 million persons in the United States; therefore, the medical and social costs of the lower threshold may be considerable. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is defined by a threshold imposed on the continuous distribution of glycemic levels, typically with respect to risk for microvascular complications. However, the burden of type 2 diabetes relates more to macrovascular than microvascular complications. Because no clear threshold exists for macrovascular complications, a formal balancing of direct and indirect costs with both microvascular and macrovascular complications may be appropriate to establish glycemic thresholds. Because fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and the oral glucose tolerance test all predict diabetic complications yet test reliability is better for fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c than for the oral glucose tolerance test, we suggest an alternative diagnostic approach: If random plasma glucose is elevated (≥ 11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]) and the hemoglobin A1c level is more than 2 SDs above the laboratory mean, then diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed, and management should be based on the hemoglobin A1c level. If the result of only one of these tests is positive, then fasting plasma glucose should be tested to evaluate the patient for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus. The glycemic threshold for type 2 diabetes should be established by cost-effectiveness analysis. The clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could be streamlined by incorporation of hemoglobin A1c into established criteria.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large as to the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to an enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests somewhat inconvenient to patients and clinicians and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of Diabetes Care, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically, the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by either of the associations (or other organizations), it does represent a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and, ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been dogged by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state (most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state) or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, i.e. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test — the latter done rarely in clinical practice for obvious reasons: inconvenience and cost. In addition, considerable variability not only in 2-h postglucose load values but also in fasting glucose has been a problem. Appropriately, clinicians have long wondered why they cannot use another diagnostic index, such as A1C, an inherently attractive option because it recapitulates long-term ambient glycemia as opposed to a single point in time. With the recent introduction of the standardized global assay for the measurement of A1C, greater accuracy and precision than achieved with plasma glucose have been predicated.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

This is the first of a series of articles based on presentations at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions held 5–9 June 2009 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

A series of elegant investigations some 4 decades ago led to the realization that elevated levels of certain hemoglobin components are found in individuals with diabetes. The useful measurement of A1C became standard in assessment of glycemia. A1C, rather than direct measures of glycemia, is now used as the "goal" for diabetes treatment.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Position statement executive summary: guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115kKPZQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory analysis in patients with diabetes. A new system was developed to grade the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. A draft of the guidelines was posted on the Internet, and the document was modified in response to comments. The guidelines were reviewed by the joint Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Committee of the AACC and the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and were accepted after revisions by the Professional Practice Committee and subsequent approval by the Executive Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

In addition to the long-standing criteria based on measurement of venous plasma glucose, diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations in the blood. Monitoring of glycemic control is performed by the patients measuring their own plasma or blood glucose with meters and by laboratory analysis of HbA(1c). The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and other analytes are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory testing for patients with diabetes. A new system was developed to grade the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Draft guidelines were posted on the Internet and presented at the 2007 Arnold O. Beckman Conference. The document was modified in response to oral and written comments, and a revised draft was posted in 2010 and again modified in response to written comments. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and the Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Committee of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry jointly reviewed the guidelines, which were accepted after revisions by the Professional Practice Committee and subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

In addition to long-standing criteria based on measurement of plasma glucose, diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased blood hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations. Monitoring of glycemic control is performed by self-monitoring of plasma or blood glucose with meters and by laboratory analysis of HbA(1c). The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and other analytes are addressed.

Summary

Glycemic management — HbA1c targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are described as uncertain regarding which patient characteristics would yield greater benefits than harms with lower target ranges, though there are valid reasons to speculate greater net benefit in younger, newly diagnosed patients with minimal or no T2DM complications, longer life expectancy, or low hypoglycemia risk medications. Trial design, conduct, and demographic limitations hinder definitive conclusions for specific subgroups, and additional research is needed to determine whether particular subsets achieve a favorable balance of benefits and harms by targeting lower HbA1c ranges.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115MFVh2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C testing for screening/diagnosis, discordance management, and assay requirements specifies that "Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel", and instructs to "Evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results". In conditions with an altered A1C–glycemia relationship (e.g., some hemoglobin variants; pregnancy [second and third trimesters and the postpartum period]; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; HIV; hemodialysis; recent blood loss or transfusion; hemolysis; erythropoietin therapy), "plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes". Methodologically, "The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)… and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay". For point-of-care use, "A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic management" and "FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards", which "include… participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program".

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1c-based diagnostic criteria [^113iAKCS]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Although A1C screening may be of limited value, better test characteristics appear to be provided by measuring random plasma glucose or glucose 1 h after a 50-g oral glucose challenge; either could be obtained opportunistically during office visits, at any time of day, and without a prior fast. Other tests or combinations of tests may also be useful, and it is possible that health economics analyses would identify one or another test as being more cost-effective in different patient populations and clinical settings. We still need to identify previously unrecognized diabetes and pre-diabetes to initiate preventive management.

Despite intensive research, therapy of diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is far from be effective. The most important unresolved issue is to establish a safe glycosylated hemoglobin C (A1c) value well balanced between benefit and side effects. As a result different guidelines suggest different A1c targets generating confusion for patients and clinicians. Here we report two observations which might support a relaxed A1c as suggested by American college of physician (ACP).

### Impact of HbA1c testing at point of care on diabetes management [^1148Gzip]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease also implicated in the development of several other serious complications like cardiovascular or renal disease. HbA1c testing is a vital step for effective diabetes management, however, given the low compliance to testing frequency and, commonly, a subsequent delay in the corresponding treatment modification, HbA1c at the point of care (POC) offers an opportunity for improvement of diabetes care. In this review, based on data from 1999 to 2016, we summarize the evidence supporting a further implementation of HbA1c testing at POC, discuss its limitations and propose recommendations for further development.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Prediabetes [^113MwR1P]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.

### Delay in diagnosis of diabetes mellitus due to inaccurate use of hemoglobin A1c levels [^113bvoBr]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Testing of hemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)) levels has become widespread in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus. Since the 1980s, it has proven to be an invaluable tool correlating with a patient's average blood glucose levels as well as with their disease morbidity. Clinicians often base treatment decisions and make adjustments depending on a patient's HbA(1C) level. As useful as the HbA(1C) is, it does have notable limitations. A number of conditions can lead to a falsely elevated or a falsely low HbA(1C) level. When one of these conditions is present, it is important to recognize the inaccuracy of the HbA(1C) test to prevent a delay or error in the diagnosis or care of patients with diabetes mellitus. It is also important to be aware of alternative methods of monitoring a patient's diabetes such as a fructosamine assay or home and office blood glucose measurements. Presented is the case of a patient with diabetes mellitus and hereditary spherocytosis, a condition that interfered with her HbA(1C) value and resulted in a delay in her care.

### Glycemic control and complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1157ezWP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are based on glycemic standards derived from epidemiologic data; however, the course of the disease, from prediabetes to end-stage complications, is not the same in all patients. Microvascular complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, are strongly related to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, vascular complications may progress in patients who have HbA1c < 7.0% and may appear even in undiagnosed patients owing to transient increases in plasma glucose concentrations. Concomitant atherosclerosis and occult macrovascular disease may follow an accelerated course in type 2 diabetes. Macrovascular complications may develop early, and, like microvascular complications, do not correlate linearly with HbA1c. Managing hyperglycemia in the later stages of type 2 diabetes does not appear to be associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. The glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity that may precede prolonged hyperglycemia and beta-cell dysfunction are early, reversible pathophysiologic events. This suggests that prompt management may modify the course of hyperglycemia and prevent or delay long-term complications. The challenge remains to identify patients with early type 2 diabetes who are at risk for rapid progression of beta-cell decline and premature development of microvascular complications. Ongoing research into the mechanisms responsible for diabetic complications may provide new markers to help identify patients with type 2 diabetes who can benefit from earlier antidiabetes treatments.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^117U5J1X]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis suggests that elevated A1C (> 6%) is common in the general population of nondiabetic adults. The overall prevalence of A1C > 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1 million individuals in the U.S. population. Approximately 45% of these individuals have IFG and 45% have fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl. Elevated A1C levels were particularly common among older adults, non-Hispanic blacks, and obese individuals. We found that demographic characteristics and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and its complications including older age, male sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity, lower attained education level, adiposity, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with elevated A1C even in the presence of normal fasting glucose.

Significant advantages of adopting A1C for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes are the high repeatability of the measurement and the high specificity of elevated values for detecting undiagnosed diabetes. Recent recommendations have stated that diagnosis based on A1C should be confirmed using a glucose-dependent test (FPG or OGTT) or by a second A1C. However, glucose-dependent tests are less reliable (repeatable) than A1C. Requiring confirmation of a highly reliable test by one that is less reliable poses problems for the interpretation of any discrepancy between the two values. In a previous study, we analyzed repeated measurements taken ∼2 weeks apart on an unselected sample of individuals without diabetes and found that 100% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7% had a second A1C measurement of ≥ 7% ∼2 weeks later and 80% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5 had an A1C level ≥ 6.5% 2 weeks later (Pearson's r = 0.95). There is little marginal gain to repeating the A1C test within a short (several week) time period. Furthermore, we show in the present study that 92% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7.0% also had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and 77% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5% had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl. At the population level, elevated A1C is rare in the absence of elevated fasting glucose. Additional advantages to using A1C for screening and/or diagnosis of diabetes include national standardization of the assay, the low analytic variability (high methodological quality of the assay, even when compared with glucose), the widespread availability of the A1C test and its current use in the management and treatment of diabetes, and the fact that the patient does not need to fast.

### Translating "Nondiabetic" A1c levels to clinical practice: the art of medicine [^111Pfq11]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that there is a significant delay from the time clinical research findings are first reported and when the results become an integral part of clinical care. With the understanding that the prevalence and incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide, and that the resulting complications are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, the need for more rapid clinical translation of research findings for diabetes could not be greater.

Specifically, a large amount of clinical research data has been reported in the recent past that is of great interest to the provider caring for individuals with diabetes. Much of the emphasis for research has been devoted to understanding the contribution of hyperglycemia and its treatment on macrovascular disease. For example, within the last decade, we have not only recognized the pivotal role that chronic hyperglycemia, as assessed with A1C levels, contributes to the development of microvascular complications, but we have recognized the importance of glycemia in contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Observations from large-scale prospective trials over the last couple of years have reported that in high-risk subjects, intensive therapy to lower A1C levels below suggested targets may not be beneficial or may increase mortality. However, as observed from these studies, we also learned that certain subsets of patients with type 2 diabetes may actually benefit from intensive glycemic control. The most recent analysis, reported in May 2010, has now suggested that mortality may actually be greater for those who maintain a higher A1C level despite attempts at intensive glycemic management. Interestingly, the excess mortality in the group randomized to intensive glycemic management was only seen at A1C levels greater than 7%. Thus, the findings regarding A1C targets for selected patient populations with type 2 diabetes continue to evolve to this day and remain important data for clinicians.

### Top 20 POEMs of 2021… [^111NsTqj]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes has a few definitions. This study evaluated 3, 412 community-dwelling participants, including 2, 482 patients who had an A1C level of 5. 7% to
6. 4% or a fasting glucose level of 100 mg per dL to 125 mg per dL, or both, in a community cohort of adults with a mean age of 75. 5 years. Over 6. 5 years of follow-up with 27% attrition, 9% of patients with elevated A1C levels progressed to diabetes and 13% regressed to normoglycemia. Of those with elevated fasting glucose levels, 8% developed diabetes and 44% returned to normoglycemia. These rates compare with a 3% development of diabetes in patients with normoglycemia at the start. We now find ourselves practicing "quaternary prevention, " which is protecting patients from overmedicalization and overtreatment.

Case in point: The overtreatment of older patients with type 2 diabetes, meaning a consistent A1C level of less than 7%, is associated with hospitalization at least once for the treatment of hypoglycemia. An A1C level less than 7% coupled with treatment with a sulfonylurea or insulin magnifies the risk. A recent systematic review found a high prevalence of overtreatment in nursing home patients, especially those with dementia. From a database of almost 23, 000 patients seen in general practice in the United Kingdom, these authors identified 6, 288 patients at least 70 years old with type 2 diabetes and three consecutive A1C levels of less than 7%. Ninety percent of these patients were treated with a sulfonylurea. The authors matched these patients with up to three patients of similar age, sex, and duration of diabetes who did not have an A1C level of less than 7% and were not receiving a sulfonylurea or insulin treatment. Patients with tight control were 2.

5 times more likely than the matched control patients to be hospitalized for severe hypoglycemia, though overall mortality rates, which were high in this age range, were not different between groups. The researchers followed PRISMA guidelines and assessed the quality of evidence. They included eight studies of 59, 747 patients, comprising three studies that included patients without diabetes.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c SHOULD BE MEASURED ROUTINELY IN ALL PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS TO DOCUMENT THEIR DEGREE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL A (moderate).

Measurement of glycated proteins, primarily HbA 1c, is widely used for routine monitoring of long-term glycemic status in patients with diabetes. [The terms "glycated hemoglobin", "glycohemoglobin", "glycosylated" (which should not be used), "glucosylated hemoglobin", "HbA 1", and "HbA 1c " have all been used to refer to hemoglobin that has been modified by the nonenzymatic addition of glucose. These terms are not interchangeable, however. The current acceptable term for glycation of hemoglobin in general is "glycated hemoglobin" (GHb). HbA 1c is the specific glycated species that is modified by glucose on the N terminus of the hemoglobin β chain. "HbA 1c " is also the internationally accepted term for reporting all GHb results. Assay methods that measure total GHbs (e.g. boronate affinity methods) should be calibrated to report an equivalent HbA 1c and be reported as HbA 1c for purposes of harmonization of results. HbA 1 is composed of HbA 1a, HbA 1b, and HbA 1c and should not be measured or reported. The term "A1C test" is used by the ADA in place of HbA 1c to facilitate communication with patients. As described in the text, most of the clinical-outcome data that are available for the effects of metabolic control on complications (at least for the DCCT and UKPDS) involved the use of assay methods that quantified HbA 1c. In this report, we use the abbreviation GHb to include all forms of glycated hemoglobin.] HbA 1c is used both as an index of mean glycemia and as a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications. HbA 1c testing and maintenance of specified concentrations during pregnancy in patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes are important for maximizing the health of the newborn and decreasing perinatal risks for the mother. Specifically, stringent control of HbA 1c values during pregnancy decreases the risk of congenital malformations, large-for-date infants, and the complications of pregnancy and delivery that can otherwise occur when glycemic control is not carefully managed. A recent consensus statement recommends an HbA 1c value of < 6% (42 mmol/mol) in these patients if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia. HbA 1c is also being used increasingly by quality-assurance programs to assess the quality of diabetes care (e.g. requiring that healthcare providers document the frequency of HbA 1c testing in patients with diabetes and the proportion of patients with HbA 1c values below a specified value).

Diabetes mellitus — adult diagnostic criteria and confirmation: Diabetes mellitus (DM) diagnosis can be made using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2‑hour plasma glucose (PG) during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or hemoglobin A1C (A1C) thresholds, and may also be made with symptoms plus a random PG; specifically, "FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2-hour PG ≥ 200 mg/dL, and A1C ≥ 6.5%" are accepted, while "Symptoms of hyperglycemia… and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL" also qualify, and "Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results… However, a glucose level > 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms most often confirms the diagnosis of DM".

### Understanding the clinical implications of differences between glucose management indicator and glycated haemoglobin [^111Cy3rP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for assessing glycaemic control in people with diabetes and correlates with their risk of long-term complications. The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has highlighted limitations of HbA1c testing. HbA1c can only be reviewed infrequently and can mask the risk of hypoglycaemia or extreme glucose fluctuations. While CGM provides insights in to the risk of hypoglycaemia as well as daily fluctuations of glucose, it can also be used to calculate an estimated HbA1c that has been used as a substitute for laboratory HbA1c. However, it is evident that estimated HbA1c and HbA1c values can differ widely. The glucose management indicator (GMI), calculated exclusively from CGM data, has been proposed. It uses the same scale (% or mmol/mol) as HbA1c, but is based on short-term average glucose values, rather than long-term glucose exposure. HbA1c and GMI values differ in up to 81% of individuals by more than ± 0.1% and by more than ± 0.3% in 51% of cases. Here, we review the factors that define these differences, such as the time period being assessed, the variation in glycation rates and factors such as anaemia and haemoglobinopathies. Recognizing and understanding the factors that cause differences between HbA1c and GMI is an important clinical skill. In circumstances when HbA1c is elevated above GMI, further attempts at intensification of therapy based solely on the HbA1c value may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. The observed difference between GMI and HbA1c also informs the important question about the predictive ability of GMI regarding long-term complications.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^112wjk2D]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A. Diagnosis/screening.

The glucose-based criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes are based on outcome data (the risk of micro- and macrovascular disease) correlated with plasma glucose concentrations — both fasting and 2 h after a glucose load — assayed in an accredited laboratory. Whole blood is used in portable meters. Although most portable meters have been programmed to report a plasma glucose concentration, the imprecision of the current meters (see below) precludes their use from the diagnosis of diabetes. Similarly, screening with portable meters — although attractive because of convenience, ease, and accessibility — would generate many false positives and false negatives.

RECOMMENDATION: SMBG IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL INSULIN-TREATED PATIENTS WITH DIABETES A (high).

RECOMMENDATION: IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES TREATED WITH DIET AND ORAL AGENTS, SMBG MAY HELP ACHIEVE BETTER CONTROL, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERAPY IS INITIATED OR CHANGED. DATA ARE INSUFFICIENT, HOWEVER, TO CLAIM AN ASSOCIATED IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE ROLE OF SMBG IN PATIENTS WITH STABLE TYPE 2 DIABETES CONTROLLED BY DIET ALONE IS NOT KNOWN C (high).

B. Monitoring/prognosis.

SMBG is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes. Intensive glycemic control can decrease microvascular complications in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In the DCCT, patients with type 1 diabetes achieved intensive glycemic control by performing SMBG at least 4 times per day. Therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UKPDS was adjusted according to FPG concentration; SMBG was not evaluated.

The role of SMBG in individuals with type 2 diabetes has generated considerable controversy. Faas et al. reviewed 11 studies published between 1976 and 1996 that evaluated SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes. Only one of the published studies reported that SMBG produced a significant improvement in glycated Hb (GHb). The review's authors concluded that the efficacy of SMBG in type 2 diabetes is questionable. Similar conclusions were drawn in an early (2000) meta-analysis of a sample of patients with type 2 diabetes in the NHANES and the Freemantle Diabetes Study. Two early randomized trials assessed the use of glucose meters in individuals with type 2 diabetes. One of these trials had statistical power to detect a 0.5% reduction in HbA 1c but reported only a modest decrease (0.3%) in HbA 1c among poorly controlled patients treated with oral agents. The second study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in HbA 1c in patients who were assigned to use meters, compared with those who were not.

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^111VxgLJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113ijYvh]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — diagnostic tests and recommendations state that "Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria", with plasma glucose criteria including the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or hyperglycemic crises (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]). Recommendation 2.1a (B) directs to "Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria" with these plasma glucose options, and recommendation 2.1b (B) states that "In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing"; additionally, "FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagnosis".

### Contributions of glucose and hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes screening [^1178QS3D]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Given the long-term consequences of untreated diabetes, patients benefit from timely diagnoses. Payer policies often recognize glucose but not hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for diabetes screening. This study evaluates the different information that glucose and HbA1c provide for diabetes screening.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of national clinical laboratory testing during 2020 when glucose and HbA1c were ordered for routine diabetes screening, excluding patients with known diabetes, out-of-range glucose, or metabolic syndrome.

Results

Of 15.47 million glucose and HbA1c tests ordered simultaneously, 672,467 (4.35%) met screening inclusion criteria; 116,585 (17.3%) were excluded because of diabetes-related conditions or the specimen was nonfasting, leaving 555,882 result pairs. More than 1 in 4 patients 60 years of age or older with glucose within range had an elevated HbA1c level. HbA1c claims were denied more often for Medicare beneficiaries (38,918/65,273 [59.6%]) than for other health plans combined (23,234/291,764 [8.0%]).

Conclusions

Although many health plans do not cover HbA1c testing for diabetes screening, more than 1 in 4 glucose screening patients 60 years of age or older with an in-range glucose result had a concurrent elevated HbA1c result. Guideline developers and health plans should explicitly recognize that glucose and HbA1c provide complementary information and together offer improved clinical utility for diabetes screening.

GLUCOSE

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: WHEN GLUCOSE IS USED TO ESTABLISH THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, IT SHOULD BE MEASURED IN VENOUS PLASMA A (high).

RECOMMENDATION: WHEN GLUCOSE IS USED FOR SCREENING OF HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS, IT SHOULD BE MEASURED IN VENOUS PLASMA B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: PLASMA GLUCOSE SHOULD BE MEASURED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY WHEN USED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF OR SCREENING FOR DIABETES Good Practice Point (GPP).

RECOMMENDATION: OUTCOME STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING C (moderate).

A. Diagnosis/screening.

The diagnosis of diabetes is established by identifying the presence of hyperglycemia. For many years the only method recommended for diagnosis was a direct demonstration of hyperglycemia by measuring increased glucose concentrations in the plasma. In 1979, a set of criteria based on the distribution of glucose concentrations in high-risk populations was established to standardize the diagnosis. These recommendations were endorsed by the WHO. In 1997, the diagnostic criteria were modified to better identify individuals at risk of retinopathy and nephropathy. The revised criteria comprised: 1) an FPG value ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL); 2) a 2-h postload glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during an OGTT; or 3) symptoms of diabetes and a casual (i.e. regardless of the time of the preceding meal) plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) (Table 4). If any one of these three criteria is met, confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day is necessary to establish the diagnosis [note that repeat testing is not required for patients who have unequivocal hyperglycemia, i.e. > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hyperglycemia]. The WHO and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommend either an FPG test or a 2-h postload glucose test that uses the same cutoffs as the ADA (Table 5). In 2009, the International Expert Committee, which comprised members appointed by the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the IDF, recommended that diabetes be diagnosed by measurement of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), which reflects long-term blood glucose concentrations (see HbA 1c section below). The ADA and the WHO have endorsed the use of HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^113nGgLu]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 3 decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased dramatically in North America, ushering in a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which previously was not typically seen until much later in life. The rapid emergence of childhood T2DM poses challenges to many physicians who find themselves generally ill-equipped to treat adult diseases encountered in children. This clinical practice guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations on managing 10- to 18-year-old patients in whom T2DM has been diagnosed. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a Subcommittee on Management of T2DM in Children and Adolescents with the support of the American Diabetes Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association). These groups collaborated to develop an evidence report that served as a major source of information for these practice guideline recommendations. The guideline emphasizes the use of management modalities that have been shown to affect clinical outcomes in this pediatric population. Recommendations are made for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM. The recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent peer review before it was approved by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with T2DM, and its recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with T2DM. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated. The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians may not be confident of their ability to successfully treat T2DM in a child because of the child's age, coexisting conditions, and/or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made. If a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model in which the pediatrician partners with parents to ensure that all health needs are met.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^114qe4sd]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

### Diabetes: how are we diagnosing and initially managing it? [^114Cg5og]. Annals of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We undertook this study to examine the symptoms, clinical events, and types of health care encounters that preceded the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults, and to examine changes in glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in the first year after a diabetes diagnosis.

Methods

We conducted a historical cohort study of patients in a large multispecialty medical group in Minnesota. Among 55,121 adults who were continuously enrolled in the health plan and receiving care at the study medical group from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1996, we identified 504 who received a new diagnosis of diabetes in 1995 or 1996. Our main outcome measures were the type of symptoms at diagnosis; the clinical circumstances and type of encounter that led to diabetes diagnosis; and changes in glycemic control (assessed by hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] value), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, blood pressure (BP), aspirin use, and body weight in the first year after diagnosis, ascertained from a detailed review of medical records.

Results

Almost one third (32.3%) of adults with newly diagnosed diabetes had symptoms of hyperglycemia at initial diagnosis. Compared with patients who did not have hyperglycemia symptoms at diagnosis, those who did were younger and more often male, and had lower comorbidity scores and higher HbA1c values (9.9% vs 8.1%) at diagnosis (P < .01 for each comparison). In the 12 months after diagnosis, the group as a whole had significant improvements (P < .001) in HbA1c values (from 8.8% to 7.1%), systolic blood pressure (137.5 to 133.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (80.7 to 77.3 mm Hg), weight (207.7 to 201.1 lb), and aspirin use (15.3% to 26.1%). Improvements were seen in all patient subgroups, including those defined by symptoms at diagnosis and by visit type at diagnosis.

Conclusions

Primary care practices may improve detection of undiagnosed diabetes in primary care and improve 1-year outcomes by being vigilant for symptoms of diabetes, by evaluating those at high risk for this disorder, and by instituting appropriate treatments at the time of diagnosis.

A. Use of HbA 1c for diabetes screening/diagnosis.

The role of HbA 1c in the diagnosis of diabetes has been considered for several years. In the past, the lack of standardization has been a major barrier. With improved standardization through the NGSP and the IFCC, and new data demonstrating the association between HbA 1c concentrations and the risk for retinopathy, the International Expert Committee recommended the use of HbA 1c in the diagnosis of diabetes. In making its recommendation, the Committee also considered several technical advantages of HbA 1c testing compared with glucose testing, such as its preanalytical stability and decreased biological variation. Finally, the clinical convenience of the HbA 1c assay, which requires no patient fasting or tolerance tests, compared with glucose-based diagnosis, convinced the Committee to recommend HbA 1c testing for diagnosis. A value ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered diagnostic on the basis of the observed relationship with retinopathy. For diagnosis, a positive test result [≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] should be confirmed with a repeat assay. The ADA indicates that although either an HbA 1c assay or a glucose assay (FPG or OGTT) can be used as the confirmatory test, repeating the same test is preferred. The frequency of HbA 1c testing for diagnosis has not been established, but guidelines similar to those for glucose-based testing seem appropriate. Only NGSP-certified HbA 1c methods should be used to diagnose (or screen for) diabetes. The ADA cautions that point-of-care devices for measuring HbA 1c should not be used for diagnosis. Although several point-of-care HbA 1c assays are NGSP certified, the test is waived in the U.S. and proficiency testing is not necessary. Therefore, no objective information is available concerning their performance in the hands of those who measure HbA 1c in patient samples. A recent evaluation revealed that few point-of-care devices that measure HbA 1c met acceptable analytical performance criteria. Absent objective — and ongoing — documentation of performance with accuracy-based proficiency testing that uses whole blood (or other suitable material that is free from matrix effects), point-of-care HbA 1c devices should not be used for diabetes diagnosis or screening. The ADA has endorsed the use of HbA 1c for the diagnosis of diabetes (Table 4), as have The Endocrine Society and the WHO. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists supports it in a more limited fashion. Other international organizations, including the IDF, are considering HbA 1c testing for diabetes diagnosis and screening. Note that glucose-based testing for diagnosis remains valid. Analogous to the concept of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, individuals with HbA 1c values between 5.7% and 6.4% (39 and 46 mmol/mol) should be considered at high risk for future diabetes and should be counseled about effective measures to reduce their risk.

### A1c for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice [^11616NuJ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

A1C as a screening/diagnostic tool has some limitations. The main issues are method bias, which is now being addressed by Internation Federation of Clinical Chemistry standardization and certain confounding medical conditions (hemoglobinopathies and anemia). Most new A1C methods can identify or are unaffected by hemoglobinopathies. Anemia is also readily identifiable.

The cost of A1C has also been raised as a concern. While A1C analysis, per se, is more expensive than for glucose, the overall differences are small once the costs for blood collection are accounted for. From our own estimates, total costs are AUD $10.20 for A1C compared with AUD $8.80 for FPG and AUD $12.10 for a two-point collection of OGTT. These cost comparisons are consistent with reports from other countries. Further, the time and inconvenience to patients in having to fast for an OGTT cannot be ignored.

A1C ≤ 5.5% and ≥ 7.0% predicts with 97.5% confidence the absence or presence of type 2 diabetes using the OGTT as a reference. Many with impaired A1C have pre-diabetes, while diabetes is highly probable when A1C reaches 6.5–6.9%. Impaired A1C thus requires follow-up and lifestyle modification. Although the cost of A1C is slightly higher than for FPG, the overall efficiency of using A1C as a first line for diabetes screening may facilitate early diagnosis and reduce the health burden associated with diabetes complications.

### Haemoglobin A1c in the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus [^116pDsu3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) is due to celebrate its 40th birthday. Many people would argue that the clinical studies relating the test to diabetes complications while in its late 20s are likely to be its finest ever achievement. However, this article looks at how HbA(1c) has matured since then and discusses in detail how its many strengths and idiosyncrasies as a marker of glycaemic risk have, as a 30-something, become more clearly understood. As HbA(1c) approaches middle age, this paper also describes how the test appears to be developing a mid-life crisis, as debate over how its results should be expressed seems likely to divide opinion among clinicians for some time to come.

We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy. We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved. In insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not achieving glycemic goals, we suggest real-time continuous glucose monitoring to decrease hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.

8. HbA 1c

a. HbA 1c should be measured routinely in all patients with diabetes mellitus to document their degree of glycemic control. A (moderate)

b. Laboratories should use only HbA 1c assay methods that are certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) as traceable to the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) reference. The manufacturers of HbA 1c assays should also show traceability to the IFCC reference method. GPP

c. Laboratories that measure HbA 1c should participate in a proficiency-testing program, such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP) HbA 1c survey, that uses fresh blood samples with targets set by the NGSP Laboratory Network. GPP

d. Laboratories should be aware of potential interferences, including hemoglobinopathies, that may affect HbA 1c test results, depending on the method used. In selecting assay methods, laboratories should consider the potential for interferences in their particular patient population. In addition, disorders that affect erythrocyte turnover may cause spurious results, regardless of the method used. GPP

e. Desirable specifications for HbA 1c measurement are an intralaboratory CV < 2% and an interlaboratory CV < 3.5%. At least two control materials with different mean values should be analyzed as an independent measure of assay performance. B (low)

f. Samples with HbA 1c results below the lower limit of the reference interval or > 15% HbA 1c should be verified by repeat testing. B (low)

g. HbA 1c values that are inconsistent with the clinical presentation should be investigated further. GPP

h. Treatment goals should be based on American Diabetes Association recommendations, which include generally maintaining HbA 1c concentrations at < 7% and more-stringent goals in selected individual patients if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse treatment effects. Somewhat higher intervals are recommended for children and adolescents and may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy, extensive comorbid illnesses, a history of severe hypoglycemia, or advanced complications (note that these values are applicable only if the NGSP has certified the assay method as traceable to the DCCT reference).

Testing methodology and confirmation — footnotes to criteria: Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours. FPG is the preferred diagnostic test, but either of the two listed is acceptable; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, one of these tests should be done on different days. HbA1c should use a clinical laboratory (not a point-of-care) methodology standardized to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The VA/DoD DM CPG recommends that when HbA1c values between 6.5% and 7.0% suggest diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, this observation should be confirmed with fasting plasma glucose levels to improve diagnostic specificity.

### A review of the challenge in measuring hemoglobin A1c [^112e29Bd]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The attraction of the simple biochemical concept combined with a clinical requirement for a long-term marker of glycolic control in diabetes has made hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) one of the most important assays undertaken in the medical laboratory. The diversity in the biochemistry of glycation, clinical requirements, and management demands has resulted in a broad range of methods being developed since HbA1c was described in the late 1960s. A range of analytic principles are used for the measurement of HbA1c. The charge difference between hemoglobin A0 and HbA1c has been widely utilized to separate these two fractions, most notably found these days in ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography systems; the difference in molecular structure (affinity chromatography and immunochemical methods) are becoming widely available. Different results found in different laboratories using a variety of HbA1c analyses resulted in the need for standardization, most notably in the United States, Japan, and Sweden. Designated comparison methods are now located in these three countries, but as they are arbitrarily chosen and have differences in specificity, results of these methods and the reference values and action limits of the methods differ and only harmonized HbA1c in specific geographic areas. A reference measurement system within the concept of metrological traceability is now globally accepted as the only valid analytic anchor. However, there is still discussion over the units to be reported. The consensus statement of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC), the American Diabetes Association, the International Diabetes Federation, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes suggests reporting HbA1c in IFCC units (mmol/mol), National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program units (%), and estimated average glucose (either in mg/dl or mmol/liter). The implementation of this consensus statement raised new questions, to be answered in a concerted action of clinicians, biochemists, external quality assessment organizers, patient groups, and manufacturers.

### Statement by an American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control [^116Vz6kN]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

This report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A1C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. We prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. We recommend only combinations of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. It is essential to monitor therapy with A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. We provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. This algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology Diabetes Guidelines and the recent medical literature.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^113a3QwM]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines recommend insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and severe hyperglycemia, but this recommendation lacks sufficient evidence and poses practical challenges. It is unclear whether non-insulin treatments are effective in this setting. The objective of this study was to describe treatment strategies of T2D patients with severe hyperglycemia and identify which initial treatments, interventions, or patient characteristics correlated with successful glucose lowering.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of 114 patients with T2D and a glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) ≥ 12%. Changes in A1C were compared between patients started on non-insulin medications versus insulin-based regimens. Regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of success in achieving A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year. The main outcomes measures were change in A1C from baseline and predictors of success in achieving A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year.

Results

At baseline, 43 patients (37.7%) started one or more non-insulin medications; 71 (62.3%) started insulin. Fifty-eight patients (50.8%) achieved an A1C ≤ 9%. Predictors of success were newly diagnosed T2D, certified diabetes educator (CDE) visits, and less time to follow-up A1C; insulin therapy was not. Change in A1C was significantly better in the non-insulin cohort compared to the insulin cohort (-4.5% vs. -2.8%, p = 0.001). Newly diagnosed patients were less likely to start insulin therapy (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001), less likely to use insulin at any point (29.2% vs 81.1%, p < 0.001), and more likely to achieve an A1C ≤ 9% compared to patients with established T2D (87.5% vs 41.1%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Insulin therapy was used in roughly two-thirds of patients with severe hyperglycemia, but did not result in better glycemic control compared to non-insulin regimens. Rapid follow-up, more CDE visits, and a new diabetes diagnosis were predictors of successful glucose lowering. Patients with T2D and severe hyperglycemia, particularly those newly diagnosed, may be managed with non-insulin therapy.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) individualized management — We recommend developing an individualized glycemic management plan, based on the provider's appraisal of the risk-benefit ratio and patient preferences. We recommend assessing patient characteristics such as race, ethnicity, chronic kidney disease, and non-glycemic factors (e.g., laboratory methodology and assay variability) when interpreting HbA1c, fructosamine and other glycemic biomarker results. We recommend an individualized target range for HbA1c taking into account individual preferences, presence or absence of microvascular complications, and presence or severity of comorbid conditions.

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people, previously controversial, is now recommended for those at risk of developing the disease. The ADA proposes that all asymptomatic people ≥ 45 years of age be screened in a healthcare setting. An HbA 1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT evaluation is appropriate for screening. The IDF recommends that the health service in each country decide whether to implement screening for diabetes. FPG is the suggested test. In contrast, the International Expert Committee and the ADA have recommended that HbA 1c can be used for screening for diabetes (see section on HbA 1c below). If an FPG result is < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and/or a 2-h plasma glucose concentration is < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year intervals. Screening should be considered at a younger age or be carried out more frequently in individuals who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) or obese and who have a least one additional risk factor for diabetes [see for conditions associated with increased risk]. Because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children, screening of children is now advocated. Starting at age 10 years (or at the onset of puberty if puberty occurs at a younger age), testing should be performed every 3 years in overweight individuals who have two other risk factors — namely, family history, a race/ethnicity recognized to increase risk, signs of insulin resistance, and a maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation. Despite these recommendations and the demonstration that interventions can delay and sometimes prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, there is as yet no published evidence that treatment based on screening has an effect on long-term complications. In addition, the published literature lacks consensus as to which screening procedure (FPG, OGTT, and/or HbA 1c) is the most appropriate (,–). On the basis of an evaluation of NHANES III data, a strategy has been proposed to use FPG to screen whites ≥ 40 years and other populations ≥ 30 years of age. The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes has been estimated. The incremental cost of screening all persons ≥ 25 years of age has been estimated to be $236,449 per life-year gained and $56,649 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Interestingly, screening was more cost-effective at ages younger than the 45 years currently recommended. In contrast, screening targeted to individuals with hypertension reduces the QALY from $360,966 to $34,375, with ages between 55 and 75 years being the most cost-effective. Modeling run on 1 × 10⁶ individuals suggests considerable uncertainty as to whether screening for diabetes would be cost-effective. By contrast, the results of a more recent modeling study imply that screening commencing at 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective (< $11,000 per QALY gained). Long-term outcome studies are necessary to provide evidence to resolve the question of the efficacy of diabetes screening.

### Preoperative hemoglobin A1c, glycemic status, and postoperative outcomes in general surgery [^11393fKd]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Dysglycemia is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to adverse surgical outcomes. However, the clinical utility of preoperative hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) screening in general surgery remains unclear.

Objective

To determine whether elevated HbA1c is associated with increased 30-day postoperative complications, readmissions, and mortality in patients undergoing general surgery procedures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2021 to 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between glycemic status and complications within 30 days after surgery. The multicenter database comprised more than 700 participating institutions worldwide, predominantly in the US. Participants included adult patients (18 years or older) undergoing general surgery procedures with available HbA1c data.

Exposures

Glycemic status categorized by documented diabetes diagnosis and HbA1c levels, ranging from normoglycemia to very poor glycemic control. Patients without a diagnosis but HbA1c levels higher than 6.4% (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01) were considered to have undiagnosed diabetes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes included occurrence of any, surgical, and medical complications, as well as readmissions, reoperations, and mortality within 30 days after surgery.

Results

Among 282 131 patients (mean [SD] age, 60 [15] years), 36% had diagnosed diabetes, whereas 6.4% had HbA1c values in the diabetes range but no diagnosis. In those patients with diabetes, risk of any complication increased progressively from near normal (HbA1c level < 6.0%; odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00–1.11) to very poor glycemic control (HbA1c level > 9.0%; OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.25–1.39). Undiagnosed diabetes was also associated with higher risks of medical complications (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04–1.18) and mortality (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07–1.42).

Conclusions and Relevance

Dysglycemia-both diagnosed and undiagnosed-is highly prevalent among general surgery patients and independently associated with increased risks of complications, readmissions, or mortality. A significant proportion of patients had HbA1c levels in the diabetes range, despite lacking a diabetes diagnosis. These findings support routine preoperative HbA1c screening and the adoption of individualized glycemic management strategies to optimize surgical risk assessment, reduce complications, and improve perioperative outcomes.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — Table 2.3 contrasts practical attributes of glucose and A1C tests relevant to selection and interpretation. For A1C, the test is "More expensive than glucose and not as widely available globally", is a "Nonfasting test; no participant preparation is needed", and results are "Unaffected by recent food intake, stress, illness, activity". Factors affecting A1C include "Altered erythrocyte turnover (e.g., anemia, iron status, splenectomy, blood loss, transfusion, hemolysis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, erythropoietin), HIV, cirrhosis, renal failure, dialysis, pregnancy", and interferences "Depends on specific assay: hemoglobin variants, severe hypertriglyceridemia, severe hyperbilirubinemia". For glucose testing, preanalytic stability is "Poor; plasma must be separated immediately or samples must be kept on ice to prevent glycolysis", and A1C "Requires whole-blood sample".

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1c-based diagnostic criteria [^1135hewr]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects > 21 million American adults, with a lifetime risk ranging from 20 to 50+%, depending on sex and race. Identification of diabetes and its precursor, pre-diabetes, can permit management to prevent complications or delay progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes. Because most U.S. health care systems do not have systematic screening programs, many Americans have undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes, and, therefore, these individuals are not initiating programs targeted at prevention.

An International Expert Committee (IEC) recently proposed new diagnostic criteria based on measurement of A1C, with A1C ≥ 6.5% for diabetes and 6.0–6.4% for "high risk" of progression to diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) subsequently proposed A1C ≥ 6.5% for the diagnosis of diabetes and 5.7–6.4% for the highest risk to progress to diabetes.

Because A1C testing is readily available in the U.S. is relatively well standardized, exhibits low intraindividual variation, and does not require fasting or restriction to certain times of the day, many clinicians might wish to use A1C measurements to screen for diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, the proposed diagnostic criteria were based largely on identification of diabetic retinopathy, and use of the proposed criteria as a screening test is not understood. The IEC A1C criteria have recently been compared with testing with fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in various populations to diagnose diabetes and high-risk/pre-diabetes, but the ADA A1C criteria have not been studied.

We hypothesized that A1C diagnostic criteria would fail to identify many subjects with unrecognized diabetes or pre-diabetes. We evaluated the proposed criteria as screening tests in three populations, compared with the OGTT as a "gold standard" used for identification of diabetes and pre-diabetes around the world.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^113aHNsj]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

A. Testing for type 2 diabetes and risk of future diabetes in adults

Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-fourth of all people with diabetes in the U.S. may be undiagnosed. Although the effectiveness of early identification of pre-diabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been proven definitively (and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur), pre-diabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate. Both conditions are common, are increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens. There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made. Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease. Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes (see IV. PREVENTION/DELAY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see VI. PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES COMPLICATIONS).

Recommendations for testing for diabetes in asymptomatic undiagnosed adults are listed in Table 4. Testing should be considered in adults of any age with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² and one or more risk factors for diabetes. Because age is a major risk factor for diabetes, testing of those without other risk factors should begin no later than at age 45 years.

Either A1C, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is appropriate for testing. The 2-h OGTT identifies people with either IFG or IGT and thus more people at increased risk for the development of diabetes and CVD. It should be noted that the two tests do not necessarily detect the same individuals. The efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes has primarily been demonstrated among individuals with IGT, but not for individuals with IFG (who do not also have IGT) or those with specific A1C levels.

### Interference of the hope hemoglobin with hemoglobin A1c results [^112n2mmm]. Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is now considered to be the marker of choice in diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus, based on the results of certain landmark clinical trials. Herein, we report the case of a 52-year-old ethnic Southeast Asian Indian man with impaired glucose tolerance whose glycated hemoglobin (ie, HbA1c) levels, as measured via Bio-Rad D10 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Roche Tina-quant immunoassay were 47.8% and 44.0%, respectively. No variant hemoglobin (Hb) peak was observed via the D10 chromatogram. We assayed the patient specimen on the Sebia MINICAP capillary electrophoresis platform; the HbA1c level was 6.8%, with a large variant Hb peak of 42.0%. This finding suggested the possible presence of the heterozygous Hb Hope, which can result in spuriously elevated HbA1c results on HPLC and turbidimetric immunoassays. Although the capillary electrophoresis system was able to identify the variant, the A1c results should not be considered accurate due to overlapping of the variant and adult Hb peaks on the electrophoretogram reading. Hb Hope is usually clinically silent but can present such analytical challenges. Through this case study, we critically discuss the limitations of various HbA1c assay methods, highlighting the fact that laboratory professionals need to be aware of occurrences of Hb Hope, to help ensure patient safety.

### Prevalence of elevated hemoglobin A1c among patients admitted to the hospital without a diagnosis of diabetes [^113TPWNg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

One in four hospitalized patients has diagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of unrecognized, or undiagnosed, diabetes among hospitalized patients is not well established.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the prevalence of unrecognized probable diabetes in this patient population determined by elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level.

Design

We conducted a prospective observational cohort trial with retrospective follow-up of patients with elevated HbA1c levels and no diagnosis of diabetes. HbA1c levels were obtained for all patients.

Setting

The study was conducted at an acute care general hospital.

Patients

Patients included 695 adult, nonobstetric patients admitted on 11 d in 2006.

Main Outcome Measures

Outcome measures included rate of unrecognized probable diabetes, defined as admission HbA1c of more than 6.1% and no diagnosis of diabetes or treatment with antidiabetic medications before or during their admission and rate of unrecognized diabetes 1 yr after discharge.

Results

Eighteen percent of hospitalized patients had elevated HbA1c levels without a diagnosis of diabetes. Random glucose levels poorly predicted elevated HbA1c levels (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.60). Neither diagnosed diabetes nor HbA1c level was associated with length of stay or costs (P > 0.1 for all comparisons). Only 15% of patients with elevated HbA1c levels who continued to receive care within the system studied had diabetes diagnosed in the year after the index admission.

Conclusions

Nearly one in five adult patients admitted to a large general hospital had unrecognized probable diabetes, based on elevated HbA1c levels. Random glucose levels during the hospital stay were poorly predictive of this condition. Few hospitalized patients with elevated HbA1c levels were diagnosed within the year after admission.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^116xiHbV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic threshold, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. Admittedly, in most circumstance the "nondiabetic" test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis. The healthcare professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.

The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in Table 2.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

Glucose metabolism and diabetes in people with HIV — diagnosis and monitoring should follow American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria using plasma glucose thresholds rather than hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on antiretroviral therapy (ART): diabetes may be diagnosed by fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/ dL (7.0 mmol/L), 2‑hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) on oral glucose tolerance testing with 75 g, or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%; some endorse an HbA1c cutoff of ≥ 5.8% to improve sensitivity in HIV; ADA 2019 Standards recommend against using HbA1c to diagnose diabetes in persons with HIV on ART. Before ART, random or fasting serum glucose and HbA1c should be obtained; after initiation of ART, only plasma glucose criteria should be used. A random glucose > 200 mg/dL should prompt fasting glucose testing. For screening, either a random or fasting glucose should be obtained at entry to care and annually thereafter. For patients with diabetes, HbA1c should be monitored at least every 6 months with a goal of < 7% per ADA, while the American College of Physicians recommends an HbA1c between 7% and 8%. If pharmacologic treatment is needed, insulin‑sensitizing agents are preferred, and no data suggest switching antiretrovirals benefits impaired glucose tolerance due to HIV infection itself or traditional risk factors.

A new diagnosis of T2D at the time of presenting with an A1C ≥ 12% was found to be a confounding variable in the regression analysis. Therefore, additional post hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results between newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed patients. There were significantly greater reductions in A1C in newly diagnosed patients compared to patients with established diabetes (−6.3% vs. −2.7%, p = 0.001, Table 5), with A1C differences emerging within 3–5 months from baseline (Fig. 1). Twenty-one out of 24 newly diagnosed patients (87.5%) were classified as responders, achieving an A1C ≤ 9%, which was significantly higher than the 41.1% of patients with established diabetes (p < 0.001). In addition, 17 (70.9%) of the newly diagnosed population achieved the ADA-recommended goal A1C of ≤ 7% as opposed to 12 (13.3%) of previously diagnosed patients. This occurred despite the fact that newly diagnosed patients were less likely to be initially treated with insulin (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001) or receive insulin at any point throughout the year (29.2% vs. 81.1%, p < 0.001). Of note, 16 of the 24 patients (67%) started a single non-insulin medication; 14 of those achieved an A1C ≤ 9% and 10 of those achieved the ADA-recommended A1C of ≤ 7% within a year. Details regarding the other initial treatment regimens of newly diagnosed patients are shown in Table 6.
