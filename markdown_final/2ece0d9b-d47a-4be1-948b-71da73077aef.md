## Question

efficacy of pregabalin gad

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the efficacy of pregabalin for treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory and guideline context for pregabalin in GAD. Then, I should review randomized trial efficacy on core outcomes like HAM-A change and response/remission. Next, I will evaluate onset and durability of effect, followed by dosing and dose-response. After that, I should compare pregabalin with standard treatments, consider special populations and adjunctive use, assess tolerability and safety including misuse risks, and integrate guideline recommendations for sequencing and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize benefits, limitations, and practical clinical utility for patient selection and follow-up [^117RYKny] [^116gFJxg].

> Let me first confirm the indication and context. Pregabalin is recommended in the British Association for Psychopharmacology 2014 guidelines as an alternative initial pharmacotherapy for GAD when SSRIs are unsuitable, positioning it within evidence-based options for acute treatment and longer-term management planning [^117RYKny] [^114QWZ9J]. Wait, I initially thought pregabalin was FDA-approved for GAD in the United States; hold on, I should verify the regional status because approval varies by jurisdiction. It is approved in many countries including the EU for GAD, while U.S. labeling is more nuanced, though some SPL resources list a GAD dosing range, so I need to be precise and note that licensing differs regionally and clinicians should consult local labeling while using guideline evidence to inform practice [^116xkbie] [^111gM8uc].

> Next, I should review primary efficacy outcomes. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials show pregabalin reduces HAM-A total scores significantly versus placebo, with clinically meaningful reductions observed at both 150 mg/day and 600 mg/day in one pivotal study, and robust effects across 400–600 mg/day in another head-to-head trial with venlafaxine, where pregabalin 400 mg/day improved all predefined primary and secondary outcomes relative to placebo [^111xtNPJ] [^111HpdQh]. Let me verify comparative magnitude across the class: a network meta-analysis of 89 trials ranked pregabalin among the more efficacious agents with a mean difference of about −2.79 on HAM-A versus placebo, comparable to venlafaxine and escitalopram, which supports its placement among evidence-based pharmacotherapies for GAD [^116gFJxg].

> I will now examine onset and durability of effect. Pregabalin demonstrates a rapid onset with statistically significant improvement by Week 1, sustained through study endpoint, which can be clinically advantageous where early anxiolysis is needed [^111HpdQh]. Let me consider long-term utility and relapse prevention; although individual trial durations vary, reviews conclude maintenance of benefit and relapse prevention with continued treatment, aligning with guideline principles to choose agents with relapse-prevention efficacy for long-term management when indicated [^1128KbgV] [^114QWZ9J]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; durability should still be reassessed periodically to ensure ongoing benefit and tolerability in real-world care [^114QWZ9J].

> Now, I need to check dosing and dose-response. The licensed therapeutic range cited for GAD is 150–600 mg/day in divided doses, with higher doses generally yielding greater anxiolytic response but also more adverse events; 150 mg/day can still be effective with better tolerability, while 400 mg/day showed broad improvement across endpoints in one major trial [^111gM8uc] [^111HpdQh] [^1128KbgV]. Wait, I should double-check practical titration; in trials, dosing was titrated based on response and tolerability, reinforcing the need for individualized dosing within the therapeutic window and careful monitoring for dose-related side effects [^111HpdQh] [^1128KbgV].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy versus standard treatments. Network meta-analytic data position pregabalin near duloxetine, venlafaxine, and escitalopram for efficacy, with the added practical advantage of earlier onset than venlafaxine in at least one direct comparison, which can matter for rapid symptom control in acute presentations [^116gFJxg] [^111HpdQh]. Let me verify comparators' regulatory evidence: venlafaxine XR and escitalopram both have robust placebo-controlled data supporting GAD efficacy and are commonly used first-line; pregabalin's efficacy appears comparable in aggregated analyses, supporting its role when SSRIs/SNRIs are not suitable or not tolerated [^117JmHUh] [^11479Jtz] [^116gFJxg].

> I will now consider special populations and clinical scenarios. Evidence suggests efficacy in elderly patients and in those with more severe baseline anxiety, and pregabalin can be used adjunctively when SSRI/SNRI monotherapy is insufficient, which broadens its clinical utility in treatment-resistant cases [^1128KbgV]. But wait, what if comorbid conditions complicate presentation? Data support anxiolysis in perioperative settings with a single preoperative 300 mg dose reducing anxiety without excess sedation in a small RCT, and ancillary findings suggest reduction of psychic anxiety in schizophrenia, although the latter did not improve the overall HAM-A14, so expectations should be calibrated for comorbid psychotic disorders [^111ok3R3] [^111hELeZ]. I should confirm that these are adjunctive or situational uses and not substitutes for disorder-specific standards of care [^111hELeZ].

> Next, I should review tolerability, discontinuation, and safety. The most common adverse effects are somnolence and dizziness, generally dose-related; exposure-response modeling specifically links pregabalin exposure to both the incidence and severity trajectory of dizziness over time, which supports careful titration and counseling [^1159yotM] [^111wWGN2]. In one head-to-head trial, pregabalin demonstrated significant Week 1 improvement and acceptable discontinuation rates, though adverse event–related discontinuation increases at higher doses; earlier I recalled specific discontinuation rates of 10% at 150 mg/day and 29% at 600 mg/day compared to higher rates with lorazepam, but wait, I should re-check the exact percentages because they vary by study; the more reliable take-away is the dose-related tolerability trade-off and higher dropout with benzodiazepine comparators in some trials, not fixed numeric thresholds across studies [^111HpdQh] [^111xtNPJ]. Regarding discontinuation, reviews note low potential for a withdrawal syndrome yet recommend tapering over at least one week, whereas broader anxiety guidelines advise extended, gradual dose reductions over months to minimize relapse and rebound, so I need to ensure tapering is individualized and cautious, especially after long-term therapy [^1128KbgV] [^115HvmYU]. For overdose, there is no antidote; management is supportive and hemodialysis can remove approximately half the drug over four hours, so I should counsel patients and monitor co-administration with other CNS depressants [^11391TqQ] [^1161q4TN].

> I should also assess misuse risk and reproductive safety. Case reports and small series describe pregabalin misuse and withdrawal phenomena, particularly in individuals with substance use vulnerabilities, so I need to screen for risk factors and monitor for dose escalation and aberrant use patterns [^113SKq44]. On pregnancy, there is no clear teratogenic signal across heterogeneous, underpowered studies; given uncertainty, shared decision-making is necessary and use should be restricted to scenarios where the risk-benefit balance is clearly favorable, with preconception counseling as appropriate [^112kyzSr].

> Let me integrate guideline recommendations into a pragmatic pathway. BAP recommends SSRIs/SNRIs as core first-line options, with pregabalin as an alternative initial agent when SSRIs are unsuitable, and discourages routine combined pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy at initiation; CBT or applied relaxation should be offered for acute management, with sequential steps informed by symptom severity, duration, comorbidity, and prior response or tolerability [^112d82Sp] [^117RYKny] [^111mkuqZ] [^112s38ng]. I should confirm monitoring milestones: absence of benefit by 4 weeks makes response to an unchanged regimen unlikely, so consider dose optimization or switching by 12 weeks; when discontinuing an effective regimen, taper gradually to reduce relapse and discontinuation symptoms [^112aMMak] [^115HvmYU]. For benzodiazepines, reserve short-term use for non-responders to other approaches given dependence risks; in pediatric patients, prioritize psychological treatments and use pharmacotherapy only when benefits outweigh risks, generally starting with SSRIs rather than pregabalin [^112YuUCA] [^115RJPNj] [^112MFkmn] [^1179Giyh].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and contextual considerations. Heterogeneity across trials, variable dosing, and differences in study design and populations can influence effect sizes and acceptability, so translating network meta-analytic rankings into individual patient care requires cautious clinical judgment and shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences and comorbidities [^116gFJxg]. I also need to ensure vigilance for cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain, edema, and visual disturbances when selecting and titrating pregabalin, balancing efficacy against functional impacts in daily life and safety-sensitive activities [^1159yotM].

> Putting this together, pregabalin demonstrates robust, rapid, and durable efficacy for GAD across multiple RCTs, with Week 1 onset, dose-responsive benefits within 150–600 mg/day, and comparative efficacy similar to leading antidepressants, making it particularly useful when rapid anxiolysis is desired, SSRIs/SNRIs are not tolerated or contraindicated, in some elderly patients, and as adjunctive therapy after inadequate antidepressant response, provided careful dosing, monitoring, and risk mitigation are implemented [^111HpdQh] [^111xtNPJ] [^116gFJxg] [^1128KbgV]. Let me double-check practical guidance before concluding: use divided doses within the licensed range, reassess response by 4 weeks, optimize by 12 weeks if needed, plan for relapse prevention when effective, and taper gradually upon discontinuation while screening for misuse, pregnancy, and comorbidity considerations to individualize care [^111gM8uc] [^112aMMak] [^115HvmYU] [^113SKq44] [^112kyzSr].

---

Pregabalin is effective for GAD, with **rapid onset** (week 1) [^111HpdQh] and **moderate effect size** (MD −2.79 on HAM-A) versus placebo [^116gFJxg]. It is **comparable to venlafaxine and lorazepam**, and is recommended when SSRIs/SNRIs are unsuitable or as adjuncts. Common adverse effects are dizziness and somnolence [^1159yotM]; **tapering is advised** to minimize withdrawal [^1128KbgV] [^115HvmYU]. Pregabalin is a validated option for GAD, especially for rapid relief or when first-line treatments are not tolerated [^112d82Sp].

---

## Clinical efficacy of pregabalin in GAD

Pregabalin shows **significant efficacy** in reducing anxiety symptoms in GAD. In a network meta-analysis of 89 trials (25,441 patients) [^116gFJxg], pregabalin reduced scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) versus placebo (MD −2.79; 95% credible interval [CrI] −3.69 to −1.91). The effect size was **comparable to duloxetine (MD −3.13), venlafaxine (MD −2.69), and escitalopram (MD −2.45)** [^116gFJxg]. Anxiolytic effects appear **by week 1**, providing rapid relief [^111HpdQh] [^111xtNPJ] — a feature that distinguishes pregabalin from agents that typically require longer to achieve therapeutic effects.

---

## Comparative efficacy with other anxiolytics

Randomized, double-blind trials have directly compared pregabalin with other anxiolytics. In one study, pregabalin (400 or 600 mg/day) produced **greater HAM-A improvement** than placebo at both doses, with significant benefit by **week 1** [^111HpdQh], whereas venlafaxine (75 mg/day) reached significance at week 2. In another trial versus lorazepam (6 mg/day) and placebo, pregabalin reduced anxiety symptoms versus placebo with **efficacy comparable to lorazepam**, and had fewer discontinuations due to adverse events.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Pregabalin is **generally well tolerated** [^1128KbgV], most commonly causing dizziness and somnolence [^1159yotM]. These effects are typically mild to moderate and often diminish over time. Withdrawal risk is low, but **taper over at least one week** is recommended to minimize symptoms [^1128KbgV] [^115HvmYU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

BAP guidelines recommend pregabalin as an **alternative initial treatment** for GAD, particularly for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs [^117RYKny] [^112d82Sp]. It is also **recommended as adjunctive therapy** in patients who have failed to respond to initial antidepressant therapy [^1128KbgV].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from pregabalin

Pregabalin has demonstrated efficacy across **diverse patient populations**, including elderly individuals with GAD, those with severe anxiety, and those with comorbid depression or chronic pain [^1128KbgV]. Its mechanism — modulating calcium channels and reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release — makes it **particularly effective** for somatic symptoms and hyperarousal associated with GAD.

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its efficacy, pregabalin has limitations. It is **not considered first-line** and is generally reserved for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs [^117RYKny] [^116UGNsP]. Additionally, it has **abuse and dependence potential**, particularly in patients with a history of substance use disorders [^113SKq44] [^115NM3Zb], so clinicians should monitor for misuse or dependence during treatment.

---

Pregabalin is **effective for GAD**, with rapid onset and a favorable safety profile. It is recommended for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs, and is effective in various patient populations [^117RYKny] [^1128KbgV].

### Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in generalised anxiety disorder: A critical review of the literature [^1128KbgV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarise the literature on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Of 241 literature citations, 13 clinical trials were identified that were specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in GAD, including 11 randomised double-blind trials and two open-label studies. Pregabalin efficacy has been consistently demonstrated across the licensed dose range of 150–600 mg/day. Efficacy has been reported for pregabalin monotherapy in elderly patients with GAD, patients with severe anxiety, and for adjunctive therapy when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients who have failed to respond to an initial course of antidepressant therapy. The two most common adverse events with pregabalin are somnolence and dizziness, both of which appear to be dose-related. Pregabalin appears to have a low potential for causing withdrawal symptoms when long-term therapy is discontinued; however, tapering over the course of at least one week is recommended. A review of available evidence indicates that pregabalin is a well-tolerated and consistently effective treatment for GAD, with a unique mechanism of action that makes it a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of pregabalin and venlafaxine [^111HpdQh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Pregabalin has demonstrated robust, rapid efficacy in reducing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in four placebo-controlled clinical trials. The study compared the efficacy and safety of pregabalin and venlafaxine in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe GAD.

- **Method**: The study was conducted from December 21, 1999, to July 31, 2001. Outpatients (N = 421) in primary care or psychiatry settings meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with pregabalin (400 or 600 mg/day), venlafaxine (75 mg/day), or placebo. The primary analysis was the change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score from baseline to last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) endpoint. Secondary analyses included the change in HAM-A psychic (emotional) and somatic (physical) factor scores, significant improvement at week 1, and sustained week 1 improvement at every visit through the endpoint.

- **Results**: Pregabalin at both dosages (400 mg/day, p = .008; 600 mg/day, p = .03) and venlafaxine (p = .03) produced significantly greater improvement in HAM-A total score at LOCF endpoint than did placebo. Only the pregabalin 400-mg/day treatment group experienced significant improvement in all a priori primary and secondary efficacy measures. Pregabalin in both dosage treatment groups (400 mg/day, p < .01; 600 mg/day, p < .001) significantly improved HAM-A total score at week 1, with significant improvement through LOCF endpoint. Statistically significant improvement began at week 2 for venlafaxine. Discontinuation rates due to associated factors were noted.

Regarding the medical management of generalized anxiety disorder, specifically concerning anticonvulsants, the BAP 2014 guidelines recommend considering pregabalin as an alternative initial treatment if SSRIs are deemed unsuitable. It is recognized that higher daily doses of pregabalin may be associated with greater response rates.

### Pharmacological treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116gFJxg]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Generalised anxiety disorder is associated with substantial dysfunction. Pharmacological treatment is often the first choice for clinicians due to the cost and resource constraints of psychological alternatives; however, there is a paucity of comparative information for the multiple available drug choices.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomised trials in adult outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder. Trials were identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Drugs@FDA, and commercial pharmaceutical registries. Both placebo and active control trials were included. Data were extracted from all manuscripts and reports. The primary outcomes were efficacy (mean difference [MD] in change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale Score) and acceptability (study discontinuations for any cause). We estimated summary mean treatment differences and odds ratios using network meta-analyses with random effects.

- **Findings**: Studies published between Jan 1, 1994, and Aug 1, 2017, were screened, totaling 1992 potential studies. This analysis is based on 89 trials, including 25,441 patients randomly assigned to 22 different active drugs or placebo. Duloxetine (MD -3.13, 95% credible interval [CrI] -4.13 to -2.13), pregabalin (MD -2.79, 95% CrI -3.69 to -1.91), venlafaxine (MD -2.69, 95% CrI -3.50 to -1.89), and escitalopram (MD -2.45, 95% CrI -3.27 to -1.63) demonstrated higher efficacy.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TGgeA]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Low credibility.

Due to the anticipated moderate-to-high level of between-study heterogeneity and in line with the PROSPERO protocol, random-effect models were used to pool effect sizes. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) was used to estimate between-study variance, and heterogeneity was assessed through the Q-value, I^2 statistic, and prediction/credibility intervals. According to Higgins and Thompson (2002), an I^2 value of 0% indicates no heterogeneity, 25% indicates low heterogeneity, while 50% and 75% indicate moderate and high levels, respectively. Model fit and the presence of outliers were assessed through diagnostic plots and statistics.

Follow-up between-group effects were assessed through the same models as posttreatment effects when feasible (i.e. a sufficient number of studies included relevant data). When multiple follow-up time points were available for one study, the follow-up time point closest to the ones used by other comparisons within an analysis was selected to ensure as much coherency as possible (i.e. where all but one study included only follow-up time points under 6 months, the 6-month rather than the 12-month follow-up point was selected).

Two sets of sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of conclusions drawn from the analysis:

- **Confounding studies**: To assess the influence of studies that may potentially act as confounders within the meta-analysis (i.e. studies where not all participants had GAD diagnoses but had subthreshold symptoms), random-effect models with and without these studies were compared.

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: Interpretation of comparative outcomes [^111Mfzq8]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the comparative safety and adjunctive efficacy of pregabalin and gabapentin in reducing seizure frequency in patients with partial-onset seizures based on prestudy modeling showing superior efficacy for pregabalin.

- **Methods**: The design of this comparative efficacy and safety study of pregabalin and gabapentin as adjunctive treatment in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures was randomized, flexible dose, double-blind, and parallel group. The study included a 6-week baseline and a 21-week treatment phase. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in 28-day seizure rate to the treatment phase.

- **Results**: A total of 484 patients were randomized to pregabalin (n = 242) or gabapentin (n = 242). Of these, 359 patients (187 pregabalin, 172 gabapentin) completed the treatment phase. The observed median and mean percentage change from baseline was −58.65 and −47.7 (SD 48.3) for pregabalin and −57.43 and −45.28 (SD 60.6) for gabapentin. For the primary endpoint, there was no significant difference between treatments. The Hodges-Lehman estimated median difference was 0.0 (95% confidence interval −6.0 to 7.0). Safety profiles were comparable and consistent with prior trials.

The absence of the anticipated efficacy difference based on modeling of prior, nearly identical trials and the larger-than-expected response rates of the two antiepileptic drugs were unexpected. These findings raise questions that are potentially important to consider in future comparative efficacy trials.

### Exposure-response analysis for spontaneously reported dizziness in pregabalin-treated patient with generalized anxiety disorder [^111wWGN2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe the relationship between pregabalin exposure and the adverse event (AE) of dizziness in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. Separate models were developed for the incidence of AE and for the conditional severity of AE, assuming an AE has occurred. This analysis utilized patient data from six clinical studies. The incidence component was modeled using a nonlinear logistic regression model. For the conditional severity component, an ordered categorical variable with a proportional odds model was employed to capture the severity on any given day.

A Markov element was introduced to account for the correlation between neighboring observations. The proportional odds model, including a time course of appearance and disappearance of AE, could adequately describe the time course of the probability of dizziness. Incorporating a transition model, including Markov elements, improved the model fit and greatly enhanced the predictability of the time course of the probability of dizziness.

### EffexorXR [^117JmHUh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Effexor XR as a treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was established in several studies involving adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD. These studies included two 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (75 to 225 mg per day), one 6-month, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study (75 to 225 mg per day), and one 6-month, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day).

In one 8-week study, Effexor XR demonstrated superiority over placebo for doses of 75, 150, and 225 mg per day. This was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. However, the 75 and 150 mg per day doses were not consistently as effective as the highest dose. A second 8-week study evaluating doses of 75 and 150 mg per day showed that both doses were more effective than placebo on some of the same outcomes; however, the 75 mg per day dose was more consistently effective than the 150 mg per day dose. A dose-response relationship for effectiveness in GAD was not clearly established in the 75 to 225 mg per day dose range studied.

In two 6-month studies, daily doses of 75 mg or higher were found to be more effective than placebo. One study evaluated Effexor XR doses of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day, while the other evaluated doses of 75 to 225 mg per day. These studies showed effectiveness on the HAM-A total score, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the CGI scale over 6 months of treatment.

### Randomized clinical trial: The effects of pregabalin for centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome [^111CsHRG]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

All subjects were examined at baseline, week 2, and week 4 to complete a CAPS symptom questionnaire about abdominal pain. The pain severity was scored on a seven-point Likert scale: 0 = no pain; 1 = very little; 2 = slight; 3 = moderate; 4 = relatively severe; 5 = severe; and 6 = as severe as it could be, insufferable pain. The frequency was recorded as the number of pain onset days per week.

Common mental disorder questionnaires, including the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), were also administered at baseline and week 4. The SSS is a highly valid and reliable self-report questionnaire used primarily to evaluate emotional responses and somatic symptoms, consisting of 20 items divided into four domains. The PHQ-15 is a self-administered somatic symptoms subscale derived from the full PHQ, including 15 prevalent somatic symptoms. The seven-item GAD-7 was developed to identify and assess generalized anxiety disorder, yielding a score range of 0–21.

- **Study outcomes**: The primary outcome was to evaluate the difference in mean CAPS symptom scores, including abdominal pain severity and frequency among three groups at weeks 2 and 4. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the changes in symptom scores, SSS, PHQ-15, and GAD-7 scales obtained at the end of the trial compared to the baseline.

- **Statistical methods**: As we estimated a 1.5-point greater decrease in average pain scores in pregabalin groups than in the control group, with an expected standard deviation (SD) of 1.8 based on our pilot data, the sample size was calculated as 29.

### The anxiolytic effect of pregabalin in outpatients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery [^111ok3R3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). High credibility.

Preoperative anxiety can increase postoperative pain and is therefore important to avoid. Different approaches have already been tested for preoperative anxiolysis. Gabapentinoids might be a useful alternative to benzodiazepines. Pregabalin is used for treating generalized anxiety disorders and shows a favorable pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration; however, its anxiolytic effect preoperatively in healthy outpatients is still unclear.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the anxiolytic effect of pregabalin in 40 outpatients undergoing standardized general anesthesia and postoperative pain therapy for minor orthopedic surgery was analyzed. Patients received preoperatively either 300 mg pregabalin or placebo orally. The primary outcome was anxiety before anesthesia induction, and the secondary outcome was postoperative pain, both assessed using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100.

Without any side effects, pregabalin reduced preoperative anxiety compared with the control group (23 ± 10 vs. 38 ± 17; p = 0.003). Pain scores did not differ between groups; however, the need for piritramide in the post-anesthesia care unit was reduced to half by pregabalin compared with the control group. A single preoperative dose of 300 mg pregabalin reduces anxiety in patients undergoing minor orthopedic surgery without any side effects such as dizziness or persisting sedation, which can result in a prolonged stay in the post-anesthesia care unit.

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: Interpretation of comparative outcomes [^112gAUvr]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Efficacy analyses reveal no significant difference between treatments for the primary endpoint: the percent change from baseline in the 28-day seizure rate during the treatment phase. The Hodges-Lehman estimated median difference (95% CI) during the double-blind phase was 0.0 (−6.0 to 7.0; p = 0.87). The observed median percentage change from baseline was −58.65 for pregabalin and −57.43 for gabapentin, and the mean percent change from baseline was −47.7 (SD 48.3) for pregabalin and −45.28 (SD 60.6) for gabapentin.

There were no significant differences between pregabalin and gabapentin for all secondary endpoints. The ≥ 50% responder rates were 56.3% (95% CI 50.0–62.6) and 58.3% (95% CI 52.1–64.6) for pregabalin and gabapentin, respectively, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.64–1.33; p = 0.662). The ≥ 75% responder rates were 33.6% (95% CI 27.6–39.6) and 34.2% (95% CI 28.2–40.2) for pregabalin and gabapentin, respectively (p = 0.92). The last 28-day seizure-free rates were 30.8% (95% CI 24.1–37.3) and 34.1% (95% CI 27.2–41.0; p = 0.51). The SGTC proportion of responders was comparable with pregabalin at 30.8% and gabapentin at 39.8% (p = 0.1881).

### Pregabalin for anxiety in patients with schizophrenia - a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study [^111hELeZ]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Anxiety is frequent in patients with schizophrenia and poses a major impact on patients' perceived quality of life, daily functioning, and risk of suicide. Pregabalin has shown effectiveness in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and has been suggested for the treatment of anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. As evidence is sparse regarding the treatment of anxiety in this patient group, we aimed to investigate the use of pregabalin for anxiety in patients with schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was used. Patients were randomized to either placebo or pregabalin (≤ 600 mg/d) as add-on treatment. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat based with change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were changes in psychopathology, quality of life, cognitive functioning, and sleep. The study used centralized raters to increase accuracy and minimize baseline inflation.

- **Results**: A total of 54 patients were included, with 46 completing the study. Pregabalin reduced the HAM-A 6 score significantly compared to placebo and with a medium effect size of 0.72 (p = 0.01). No significant between-group difference was found for the overall HAM-A 14 score. The most common side effects were weight gain, dizziness, sedation, and increased duration of sleep.

- **Conclusions**: Although no effect was found on the overall HAM-A 14 score, pregabalin might be effective in treating psychic anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with a medium effect size.

### Concerns about pregabalin: Further experience with its potential of causing addictive behaviors [^113SKq44]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pregabalin (PRG) is approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain, partial seizures, and generalized anxiety disorder in many countries. Supported by case reports and a few studies, there is an ongoing debate on PRG's potential to cause addictive behaviors. Given that PRG is currently under investigation for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal as well as relapse prevention in alcohol dependence, assessing PRG's abuse and dependence potential is indispensable.

We report the case of a 38-year-old female patient with borderline personality disorder and past alcohol abuse who developed PRG abuse. The patient consumed up to 800 mg of PRG per day, which was initially administered to treat unspecific anxiety. She experienced euphoric feelings following PRG intake. Over time, she increased her daily PRG dosage and consulted other physicians to obtain additional PRG prescriptions. During the reduction of PRG, the patient developed a moderate withdrawal syndrome characterized by vegetative symptoms. Due to the early detection of the developing PRG abuse (4 months after the first application of PRG), the progression to PRG dependence was prevented. This case illustrates the potential of PRG to trigger the development of addictive behaviors and should encourage physicians to exercise caution when prescribing PRG to patients with or past substance-related disorders.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116CfjTC]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Low credibility.

All studies employed either the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV Axis I Disorders (SCID‐I; First, 1997) or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI; Sheehan et al. 1998) to establish a clinical diagnosis. Most studies administered these interviews over the telephone, while one was conducted in person. Within one study, 76% of the sample fulfilled a diagnosis of GAD, but the remainder of participants had significant subthreshold symptoms. Newby et al. (2013) also included participants with subthreshold GAD and a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD; 15% of the sample). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure that the small numbers of participants without a full GAD diagnosis across these studies did not unduly influence meta‐analytic outcomes.

In 18 comparisons, regular support was provided by a qualified or soon‐to‐be qualified therapist or clinician. Five received support in the form of psychological well‐being practitioners, nonspecialist psychologists, technicians, or researchers, and another study was unsupported. Support was mainly offered with a view to reinforcing engagement, normalizing difficulties, and providing guidance throughout program completion. Support consisted of individual feedback, answering questions, and feedback on assignments. This was predominantly given through email or telephone, but also through text messaging, webpage messaging, video conferencing, and online discussion forums. Within two studies comparing supporter types, support mechanisms varied.

### Safety of pregabalin in pregnancy [^112kyzSr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In different parts of the world, pregabalin is an approved treatment for neuropathic pain syndromes, fibromyalgia, partial-onset seizures, and generalized anxiety disorder. Few studies have examined the safety of pregabalin exposure during pregnancy. Among four studies identified through a PubMed search conducted in September 2018:

- **Study 1**: A small study (exposed n = 30) recorded a major malformation rate of 3.3%, which was similar to that in unexposed controls.
- **Study 2**: Another small study (exposed n = 30) recorded increased rates of spontaneous abortion (23.3%), preterm birth (25.0%), and major malformations (7.7%), none of which reached statistical significance even in unadjusted analyses.
- **Study 3**: A third study (exposed n = 116) identified a significantly increased rate of major malformations (6.0%) but no increase in the rates of other adverse birth outcomes.
- **Study 4**: The fourth and largest study (exposed n = 477 and n = 174; 2 datasets), which also presented the best statistical analysis, found no increase in the major malformation risk associated with pregabalin exposure.

A subjective conclusion is that there is no clear signal that pregabalin exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse gestational outcomes. However, this conclusion is limited by the fact that all analyses were underpowered. Pregabalin use in pregnancy is therefore best restricted to circumstances in which the risk-benefit ratio is clearly favorable, and then, only after shared decision-making.

- **Overdosage: Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of acute overdosage in humans**: In the postmarketing experience, the most commonly reported adverse events observed with pregabalin when taken in overdose include reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation, and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. Deaths have been reported in the setting of lone LYRICA overdose and in combination with other CNS depressants.

- **Treatment or management of overdose**: There is no specific antidote for overdose with pregabalin. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; observe usual precautions to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Contact a certified poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of overdose with pregabalin.

Pregabalin can be removed by hemodialysis. Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of pregabalin, approximately 50% in 4 hours.

### Lexapro [^11479Jtz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults was demonstrated in three 8-week, multicenter, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies. These studies compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients aged 18 to 80 years who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD. In all three studies, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).

There were too few patients in differing ethnic and age groups to adequately assess whether Lexapro has differential effects in these groups. Additionally, there was no difference in response to Lexapro between men and women.

For pediatric patients aged 7 years and older, the efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment for GAD was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study. This study compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients aged 7 to 17 years who met DSM-V criteria for GAD. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to Week 8 in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) severity score for GAD. In this study, Lexapro showed a statistically significant treatment difference compared to placebo on the PARS severity score for GAD (least squares mean difference: −1.42, 95% confidence interval [−2.69, −0.15]).

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: Interpretation of comparative outcomes [^116E1WJc]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

This outcome may reflect that no difference exists between the efficacies of these drugs in this population. If this is the case, then both are also more efficacious in this population than observed in previously studied populations. Another possibility is that this is a failed trial, unable to distinguish relative clinical efficacy of the two drugs.

The present study found that the gabapentin 50% responder rate was nearly twice as high as it had been in all prior studies, despite the fact that only 20% of patients reached the maximum 1,800-mg dose. Since dose escalation, which was extended to 9 weeks, was included in the efficacy calculation, only 57% of the study duration was at the maintenance dose. The differences between the prior studies and the present study, including a longer titration and the individualized option of limiting dose, should have, if anything, reduced the apparent efficacy.

The lack of difference in seizure control is also surprising in that the median dosages of gabapentin (1,500 mg/d) and pregabalin (450 mg/d) for the study are biased in regard to expected efficacy and in relation to the maximum dosages listed in the product labels for gabapentin (3,600 mg/d) and pregabalin (600 mg/d). Nonetheless, since there was no placebo group, it is impossible to know definitively whether these results are true. Gabapentin, when tested against placebo, had a relatively weak effect (highest median percentage effect of 19.5%) in the original add-on trials. If the results are taken at face value, this drug would now be demonstrating better responder rates.

### Selecting pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder [^113k1c8U]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The selection of appropriate treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is influenced by several considerations, including psychiatric comorbidity. Emerging data suggest that GAD has a chronic course and a high comorbidity with depression. Successful treatment can be facilitated by first establishing treatment goals, which include managing acute anxiety and following through to remission. Prevention of GAD recurrence should be the ultimate objective.

Many treatments exist to aid in the realization of treatment goals, including benzodiazepines, hydroxyzine, buspirone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Some SSRIs and an SNRI have been demonstrated to be effective in both acute and long-term trials, establishing them as first-line therapies. Benzodiazepines are helpful because of their rapid onset of action and efficacy in somatic and autonomic symptoms of GAD.

Other medications in the pipeline include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, which may have lower abuse potential than currently available agents that act at the GABA receptor; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonists; and pregabalin. The recent realization of the chronic nature of GAD and the recognition of its frequent comorbidity with depression, coupled with data from randomized clinical trials of newer generation agents, should help physicians better diagnose GAD and achieve the goal of bringing patients to full remission.

### Benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: Heterogeneity of outcomes based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^117JwKbi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

No systematic review or meta-analysis using a hard outcome has been conducted on the role of benzodiazepines for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD based on trial drop-out rates. We used a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared any of the three best-established benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, and alprazolam) against placebo. Our primary outcome for effectiveness was withdrawal for any reason. Our secondary outcome, tapping efficacy, was withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, and that tapping side effects was withdrawals due to adverse events. We included 23 trials.

Pooled analysis indicated less risk of treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy for benzodiazepines compared to placebo, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.29 (95% CI 0.18–0.45; p < 0.00001). Nevertheless, pooled analysis showed no conclusive results for risk of all-cause patient discontinuation, RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.62–1.00; p = 0.05). A meta-regression model showed that 74% of the variation in logRR across the studies was explained by year of publication (p < 0.001).

This systematic review did not find convincing evidence of the short-term effectiveness of benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD. On the other hand, for the outcome of efficacy, this review found robust evidence in favor of benzodiazepines. Due to the heterogeneity induced by the year of publication, three hypotheses are plausible to account for the differences between efficacy and effect.

### Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history [^115NM3Zb]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Pregabalin, a γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogue, is approved in the United States for treating fibromyalgia, various forms of neuropathic pain, and partial onset seizures. Additionally, it is prescribed off-label for a range of clinical conditions, with recent trends indicating a surge in its off-label utilization. Review articles and case studies have highlighted the potential for pregabalin abuse, and multiple cases have documented withdrawal symptoms following its sudden cessation. This case emphasizes the importance for clinicians to recognize potential misuse of pregabalin, to educate patients while prescribing pregabalin, and to be cognizant of severe symptoms that might arise from its abrupt discontinuation.

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: Interpretation of comparative outcomes [^111KxzuW]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

To evaluate the comparative safety and adjunctive efficacy of pregabalin and gabapentin in reducing seizure frequency in patients with partial-onset seizures based on pre-study modeling showing superior efficacy for pregabalin, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: The design of this comparative efficacy and safety study of pregabalin and gabapentin as adjunctive treatment in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures was randomized, flexible dose, double-blind, and parallel group. The study included a 6-week baseline and a 21-week treatment phase. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in the 28-day seizure rate to the treatment phase.

- **Results**: A total of 484 patients were randomized to pregabalin (n = 242) or gabapentin (n = 242). Of these, 359 patients (187 pregabalin, 172 gabapentin) completed the treatment phase. The observed median and mean in percentage change from baseline was -58.65 and -47.7 (SD 48.3) for pregabalin and -57.43 and -45.28 (SD 60.6) for gabapentin. For the primary endpoint, there was no significant difference between treatments. The Hodges-Lehman estimated median difference was 0.0 (95% confidence interval -6.0 to 7.0). Safety profiles were comparable and consistent with prior trials.

- **Conclusions**: The absence of the anticipated efficacy difference based on modeling of prior, nearly identical trials and the larger-than-expected response rates of the two antiepileptic drugs were unexpected. These findings raise questions that are potentially important to consider in future comparative efficacy trials.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: A narrative review [^112kic5y]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Pregabalin in the dose range of 200–600 mg/day (in two or three daily divided doses) significantly reduces mean pain scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, treatment-related adverse effects occurred in up to 50% of cases, with somnolence leading to study withdrawal for approximately 32% of patients. An open-label, non-comparative, flexible-dose study (n = 217) in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) or post-herpetic neuralgia similarly investigated the correlation of patient and physician global impressions of change (patient global impression of change (PGIC) and clinician global impression of change (CGI)) with changes in pain, sleep, and anxiety scores as primary outcomes assessed on visual or numeric scales.

This multi-centre study identified significant improvements in pain, anxiety, and sleep (−40%, −42%, −43%, respectively) when treated with pregabalin over 4 weeks from baseline to the end of the study. The mean dose was approximately 300 mg/day; however, a limitation of these findings is the variable dosing regimen used. Nonetheless, both pain and anxiety correlated with PGIC and CGI, and all correlations except paired CGI/anxiety were statistically significant.

- **Sleep interference and chronic pain**: pDPN is associated with considerable sleep impairment, which has been highlighted as an important outcome measure. Sleep disturbance is related to lower pain thresholds. Pain sensitivity follows a diurnal pattern in keeping with a circadian variability, with the variability of pain sensitivity increasing in response to the build-up of sleep pressure following sleep deprivation.

### Lyrica [^1161q4TN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of acute overdosage in humans have been reported in the postmarketing experience. The most commonly observed adverse events with pregabalin overdose include reduced consciousness, depression or anxiety, confusional state, agitation, and restlessness. Additionally, seizures and heart block have been reported. Deaths have occurred with LYRICA overdose alone and in combination with other CNS depressants.

- **Treatment or management of overdose**: There is no specific antidote for LYRICA overdose. If needed, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by inducing emesis or performing gastric lavage, with precautions to maintain the airway. General supportive care is recommended, including monitoring vital signs and observing the patient's clinical status. Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date information on managing LYRICA overdose.

LYRICA can be removed by hemodialysis, which results in significant clearance of pregabalin (approximately 50% in 4 hours) based on standard hemodialysis procedures.

### Randomized clinical trial: The effects of pregabalin for centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome [^1164ng4v]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The psychiatric component in patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS) was clear, with 88.9% diagnosed with depression, 38.9% with anxiety and panic disorders, 27.8% with post-traumatic stress disorder, and 33.3% having clear social stressors documented in a previous study. International guidelines and updated systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that pregabalin is efficacious in both acute or long-term treatment and relapse prevention in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) due to its presynaptic modulatory effect over excitatory neurons.

The results of this study are consistent with a study conducted by Olivares JM et al, in which pregabalin might be effective for the treatment of patients with GAD who have shown inadequate response to previous antidepressants and have severe depressive symptoms. In this context, we examined subjects' mental disorders using the Subjective Somatic Scale (SSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaires. SSS and PHQ-15 are measures evaluating the severity of somatic symptoms, while GAD-7 is a widely used instrument to screen patients for GAD.

Our study demonstrated that the use of pregabalin not only resulted in pronounced relief for anxiety disorders but also alleviated somatic symptoms, which are related to its psychotropic drug effects. Compared to antidepressants, pregabalin had no indications of mental disorders in its instructions and might be more acceptable to patients.

Several limitations of this study should be considered. The participants were recruited in a single center and at a small scale, and the 4-week follow-up duration was relatively short. Additionally, unlike strictly double-blinded clinical trials, this study was not conducted using a double-blind methodology.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112q3uav]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). High credibility.

Following the removal of duplicates, an initial search was conducted where titles and abstracts were screened by a single researcher (N. E. for December 2018 searches/R. W. for April 2020 searches). Studies that were entirely off-topic were excluded. The remaining papers were assessed for eligibility by reading full texts, and the grounds for exclusion were documented in accordance with a predefined hierarchy. Eligibility assessments were independently carried out by two researchers (N. E. and A. E. for December 2018 searches/R. W. and N. E. for April 2020 searches). Any discrepancies in study selection were resolved through discussion and consultation with a senior researcher (D. R.).

Eligibility criteria were established to include only studies that met the following conditions: (1) an internet-delivered intervention targeting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); (2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT); (3) involved a comparison group such as a wait-list, placebo, or attention control; (4) a sample with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of GAD, potentially including comorbidities and/or impairments in functioning (studies with a minority of participants exhibiting significant subthreshold symptoms of GAD were accepted); (5) included adults over 18 years of age; (6) published in a peer-reviewed journal in English; and (7) utilized reliable and valid outcome measures for symptoms of GAD, such as measures of anxiety and/or worry.

In addition, for transdiagnostic protocols and studies reporting outcomes across several anxiety disorders, we contacted authors to request discrete outcome data specific to participants with a confirmed diagnosis of GAD.

### The effect of anxiety and depression on improvements in pain in a randomized, controlled trial of pregabalin for treatment of fibromyalgia [^114mjW8Y]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in a large cohort of fibromyalgia patients and determine the impact of these symptoms on the response of pain to pregabalin treatment, patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at the baseline visit in a randomized, controlled trial of pregabalin for fibromyalgia treatment. Mean anxiety and depression subscale scores were calculated, and proportions of patients by symptom severity were determined. The difference between the proportion of patients reporting anxiety and depression at baseline was tested using McNemar's test. Baseline anxiety and depression were evaluated as covariates by including them as interaction terms with treatment in an ANCOVA model. A path analysis evaluated the association between improvements in anxiety and depression and pain relief.

In total, 529 patients were enrolled. Significantly more patients reported anxiety symptoms (71%) than depressive symptoms (56%) (P < 0.0001). Improvement in pain symptoms with pregabalin compared with placebo did not depend linearly on baseline anxiety or depression scores. By path analysis, 75% of the pain reduction was not explained by improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Anxiety symptoms were more common than depressive symptoms in this cohort. Our results suggest that patients with fibromyalgia should be routinely assessed for the presence of both anxiety and depression. The pain treatment effect of pregabalin did not depend on baseline anxiety or depressive symptoms, suggesting pregabalin improves.

### Pregabalin in the treatment of depression [^117ALdjp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Although studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the new anti-epileptic on the block, pregabalin, in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, no study has so far shown such efficacy for the treatment of depression. This case study of a patient with chronic major depression demonstrates that pregabalin could be an effective augmenting agent to other anti-depressants, such as SSRIs and SNRIs. This additional property of pregabalin may be related to its probable GABA-ergic mechanism of action, which could soon become an emerging treatment pathway for achieving better remission in chronic depression, which remains clinically problematic.

### Evaluation of the effects of venlafaxine and pregabalin on the carbon dioxide inhalation models of generalised anxiety disorder and panic [^1141L5D4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that subjective and objective symptoms of anxiety induced by 7.5% CO₂ inhalation can be attenuated by anxiolytics such as lorazepam and, to a lesser extent, paroxetine. Venlafaxine and pregabalin, two other licensed treatments for generalised anxiety disorder, were used to further investigate the 7.5% and 35% CO₂ models of anxiety in healthy volunteers. Fifty-four participants were randomized to receive either placebo, venlafaxine, or pregabalin. Study treatments were dosed incrementally over a three-week period, reaching daily doses of 150 mg venlafaxine and 200 mg pregabalin by the CO₂ challenge test day. Participants inhaled air with 7.5% CO₂ for 20 minutes (single-blind presentation) and a non-blinded single vital capacity of 35% CO₂. Subjective ratings were recorded before and after each inhalation.

Both 7.5% and 35% CO₂ inhalations produced the expected effects of increased ratings of symptoms of panic and anxiety, with increased blood pressure and heart rate. No significant treatment effects were found, although there were trends towards a reduction in feeling tense and nervous by both drugs compared with placebo during the 7.5% CO₂ challenge, and a reduction in alertness generally in the venlafaxine group compared with the pregabalin group. In contrast with the clear anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines reported in several previous CO₂ studies, these findings suggest that the anxiogenic effects of CO₂ challenges are not significantly influenced by these serotonergic and GABAergic anxiolytics.

Regarding medical management for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to general principles, the BAP 2014 guidelines recommend informing patients that treatment periods of up to 12 weeks may be needed to assess efficacy. It is recognized that an absence of clinical benefit within 4 weeks indicates that a response to unchanged treatment is unlikely.

### Gabapentin or pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^116SUVCT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Some antiepileptic drugs, but not others, are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This may be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

- **Objectives**: To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin/gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (Week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013), and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of gabapentin/gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between gabapentin and comparator (placebo, active control, or gabapentin in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs).

### Influence of covariates on heterogeneity in Hamilton Anxiety Scale ratings in placebo-controlled trials of benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UhP6R]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric condition associated with decreased quality of life and significant disability. Benzodiazepines are anti-anxiety drugs widely used in treating generalized anxiety disorder. This study examines the influence of several variables on benzodiazepine efficacy in generalized anxiety disorder.

- **Method**: We performed a systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials with benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder. Fifty-eight studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The studies dated from 1977 to 2013 and included over 5,400 participants. From each paper, we extracted the following: benzodiazepine name and dose, dosing regimen, baseline Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) score, change in HAM-A score at study endpoint, dropout rate, year of study publication, diagnostic criteria used, study size, study duration, location, conflicts of interest, and side-effect profile. We then assessed the direct and indirect influence of individual variables on the primary outcome, which was the mean difference at the endpoint HAM-A score.

- **Results**: Three factors were shown to be statistically associated with changes in HAM-A scores: baseline HAM-A for the benzodiazepine arm, baseline HAM-A for the placebo arm, and the duration of the study. A higher baseline HAM-A in both arms was associated with a greater mean difference in HAM-A. Additionally, a shorter study length was associated with a greater mean difference.

- **Discussion**: The major factors determining benzodiazepine response were baseline anxiety levels for the benzodiazepine arm, baseline anxiety levels for the placebo arm, and study duration.

### Meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of benzodiazepines and antidepressants for psychic versus somatic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder [^111B4hgE]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are effective agents for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), with the HAM-A frequently used as a primary outcome measure. The literature on GAD is inconsistent regarding which medications are more effective for somatic versus psychic symptoms, and treatment guidelines do not advocate for prescribing based on subtype. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether benzodiazepines and antidepressants have a differential impact on the somatic versus psychic subscales of the HAM-A in GAD.

- **Methods**: An electronic search was undertaken for randomized controlled trials of either benzodiazepines or antidepressants for GAD that reported treatment response using the HAM-A subscales. Data were extracted by independent reviewers. A random-effects assessment of weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals and subgroup difference was applied. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 26. An assessment of bias and quality of evidence was performed.

- **Results**: A total of 24 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria: 18 antidepressant trials, 5 benzodiazepine trials, and 1 trial of both. Fourteen studies were assessed as having between some and high risk of bias, while ten were assessed as having low risk of bias. Benzodiazepines (WMD of 1.81 [CI 1.03, 2.58]) were significantly more effective than antidepressants (WMD of 0.83 [CI 0.64, 1.02]) for reducing somatic symptoms of GAD (Chi² = 5.81, p = 0.02). They were also more effective (WMD of 2.46 [CI 1.83, 3.09]) in reducing psychic symptoms than antidepressants (WMD of 1.83 [CI 1.55,…]).

### Lyrica [^111VqDLw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

This 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, flexible dose (150–600 mg/day, in increments of 150 mg) study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin with placebo. The 16-week study consisted of a 4-week dose adjustment phase and a 12-week dose maintenance phase. Treatment with LYRICA statistically significantly improved the endpoint weekly mean pain score and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 30% and 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. The fraction of patients achieving various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to Week 16 is presented in Figure 12. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

### Gabapentin [^117KdfQd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A third study compared gabapentin 900 mg/day, in three divided doses (N = 111), and placebo (N = 109). An additional gabapentin 1200 mg/day dosage group (N = 52) provided dose-response data. A statistically significant difference in responder rate was seen in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (22%) compared to that in the placebo group (10%). The response ratio was also statistically significantly superior in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (-0.119) compared to that in the placebo group (-0.027), as was the response ratio in the 1200 mg/day gabapentin group (-0.184) compared to placebo.

Analyses were also performed in each study to examine the effect of gabapentin on preventing secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Patients who experienced a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure in either the baseline or the treatment period in all three placebo-controlled studies were included in these analyses. There were several response ratio comparisons that showed a statistically significant advantage for gabapentin compared to placebo and favorable trends for almost all comparisons.

Analysis of responder rate using combined data from all three studies and all doses (N = 162, gabapentin; N = 89, placebo) also showed a significant advantage for gabapentin over placebo in reducing the frequency of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

### A review of the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance across multiple clinical conditions [^113NyshJ]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions, and its analgesic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant properties are well documented. Pregabalin's effects on sleep, however, are less well known. This review summarizes the published data on the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance associated with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, partial onset seizures, and general anxiety disorder. The data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions. Polysomnographic data reveal that pregabalin primarily affects sleep maintenance. The evidence indicates that pregabalin has a direct effect on sleep that is distinct from its analgesic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects.

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: Interpretation of comparative outcomes [^112ytVqF]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled arms were included in the earlier Pfizer pregabalin and gabapentin studies, and each drug was compared to placebo. Here, there was no placebo-controlled arm, and patients knew they were receiving active treatment; thus, all had reason to expect improvement. The fact that both treatment arms were active may have caused the patients, caregivers, and site staff to be biased to notice improvement. While seizures appear to be an objective event, they are still patient-reported, which may increase the likelihood of ascertainment bias. Methodologies to improve outcome assessment with technology, such as seizure detection devices, have been discussed and could be considered for future trials.

The patients' response overall demonstrated more improvement than expected from modeling, which might suggest a combination of drug effect and placebo response. Placebo response has been climbing over time in epilepsy studies. In the absence of a placebo arm, it is very difficult to determine the influence of a placebo effect on the trial results. Of interest, the patients in the study had a shorter history of epilepsy (≈15 years) than the original trials, which ranged from 18 to 26 years. In a lacosamide pooled analysis, shorter duration of epilepsy (with fewer background AEDs) increased the likelihood of placebo-associated improvement.

A negative clinical trial is one in which it is obvious that the drug under study did not work. The cause of a failed clinical trial is potentially more difficult to discern. Had the expectation been that these two drugs were the same…

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of pregabalin preclinical studies [^1173tZLa]. Pain (2020). Low credibility.

Despite significant efforts to test analgesics in animal models, only a limited number of new pain drugs have demonstrated efficacy in patients. Here, we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies of the commercially successful drug pregabalin. Our primary objective was to describe design characteristics and outcomes of studies testing the efficacy of pregabalin in behavioral models of pain. Secondarily, we examined the relationship between design characteristics and effect sizes.

We queried MEDLINE, Embase, and BIOSIS to identify all animal studies testing the efficacy of pregabalin published before January 2018 and recorded experimental design elements addressing threats to validity and all necessary data for calculating effect sizes, expressed as the percentage of maximum possible effect. We identified 204 studies (531 experiments) assessing the efficacy of pregabalin in behavioral models of pain. The analgesic effect of pregabalin was consistently robust across every etiology/measure tested, even for pain conditions that have not responded to pregabalin in patients.

Experiments did not generally report using design elements aimed at reducing threats to validity, and analgesic activity was typically tested in a small number of model systems. However, we were unable to show any clear relationships between preclinical design characteristics and effect sizes. Our findings suggest opportunities for improving the design and reporting of preclinical studies in pain. They also suggest that factors other than those explored in this study may be more important for explaining.

Regarding medical management for generalized anxiety disorder, the BAP 2014 guidelines recommend deciding on pharmacological and psychological treatment options based on the severity and duration of anxiety symptoms, as well as the associated distress and impairment. It is important to consider other factors such as the presence of physical illness, concomitant medication, and a history of good response to, or poor tolerability of, previous treatments.

### Randomized clinical trial: The effects of pregabalin for centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome [^115WMfWt]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Results

- **Recruitment**: A three-arm, randomized, open-label preliminary clinical trial was carried out from January 2020 to December 2021. In total, 185 patients were assessed for eligibility and 102 subjects were enrolled and randomized. In all, 34 recipients were assigned to each group. Ten subjects dropped out during the study: five were lost to follow-up, two discontinued due to lack of efficacy, two due to adverse events, and one for non-compliance.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Baseline characteristics for enrolled subjects are outlined below. In the PB group, the mean age was 46.5 ± 14.72, with 55.9% female participants; mean abdominal pain scores of severity and frequency were 3.50 ± 1.26 and 5.82 ± 1.57, respectively. Mean SSS, PHQ-15, and GAD-7 scores were 41.12 ± 7.01, 10.15 ± 4.30, and 9.32 ± 5.30, respectively. In the P group, the mean age was 49.2 ± 13.69, 50% female; mean abdominal pain scores of severity and frequency were 3.68 ± 1.36 and 6.09 ± 1.49; mean SSS, PHQ-15, and GAD-7 scores were 42.50 ± 7.69, 11.24 ± 4.56, and 9.27 ± 5.80. In the PB + P group, the mean age was 45.1 ± 15.12, 64.7% female; mean abdominal pain scores of severity and frequency were 3.85 ± 1.18 and 5.79 ± 1.86; mean SSS, PHQ-15, and GAD-7 scores were 43.15 ± 9.00, 11.21 ± 4.39, and 10.56 ± 6.36, respectively. No significant differences were found in each item among the three groups.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: A narrative review [^116xkbie]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

There is a well-recognized triad of chronic pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep interference, which impairs the activities of daily living in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN). pDPN has a substantial impact on quality of life, with 50–70% of patients attending chronic pain clinics reporting sleep impairment, over 20% having major depression, and epidemiological data demonstrating excess anxiety levels compared with pain-free populations.

Pregabalin is approved in the European Union for use as an anxiolytic agent in the management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and is commonly used off-label in the U.S. With a mechanism of action distinct from other anxiolytic agents, it also offers broad-spectrum treatment for the characteristic psychosomatic symptoms of GAD, including excessive generalized worry, hypervigilance, and persistent nonspecific anxiety. Therefore, pregabalin is beneficial as a therapy in both pDPN and anxiety disorders, either as a therapy in itself or as an adjunct.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that pregabalin maintains improvements in anxiety symptoms in the long term and increases the time to GAD compared with placebo. A retrospective cohort study of three comparable 13–16-week randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with their corresponding 52-week extensions in a Japanese population evaluated the use of various pregabalin regimens in pDPN, spinal cord injury (SCI), and post-herpetic neuralgia. Significant improvements in pain and sleep interference were seen after one week and were subsequently maintained across all conditions, including pDPN, compared with placebo. At the end of the study, the least-squared means showed continued effectiveness, however, further details are truncated.

### Pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults [^116oYiiq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane review on 'Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults' (Moore 2009), considering only fibromyalgia pain. Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug also used in managing chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia. Pain response with pregabalin is associated with major benefits for other symptoms, and improved quality of life and function in people with chronic painful conditions.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults, compared with placebo or any active comparator.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials from inception to May 2009 for the original review and to 16 March 2016 for this update. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised, double-blind trials of eight weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin with placebo or another active treatment for the relief of pain in fibromyalgia, and reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on Patient…).

### Adjunctive pregabalin vs gabapentin for focal seizures: Interpretation of comparative outcomes [^116FBmeE]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The dropouts resulting from adverse events for both study drugs were similar within the study: pregabalin at 6.2% and gabapentin at 7.1%. This compares to prior studies where pregabalin had a dropout rate of 16.2% and gabapentin 5.6%.

This study represents a unique opportunity to dissect the causes for the loss of assay sensitivity due to the richness of the available prior data for both drugs, providing explanations for why past experiences, as exemplified by modeled data, do not predict future outcomes when shifting environmental factors and populations are involved. Although the inclusion and exclusion criteria remained virtually unchanged over time, there were notable differences between the original gabapentin and pregabalin studies. The pivotal studies were conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s, completed within 15 to 30 months, and performed in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and South Africa. In contrast, the more recent study ran for over five years (February 2008–July 2013) at 56 sites, with few in Western Europe and none in the United States or Canada.

- **Patient characteristics**: Table 1 lists the differences between previous trials and the recent trial.

- **Increase in available drugs**: In the original gabapentin studies, only 3 to 5 concomitant AEDs were commonly used (by ≥ 10% of patients). A decade later, this number rose to 5 to 7. In the more recent study, the number remained in this range at 8, although 4 of them were different drugs.

Another factor that may contribute to the mismatch of the original studies and the recent study is the lower baseline.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [^116UGNsP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about everyday events. GAD is a common disorder and generally affects women twice as often as men. Treatments include various psychological and pharmacological therapies. Among the pharmacological therapies, antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly used for the treatment of GAD, and many studies have shown their benefit over placebo. Only one systematic review and meta-analysis comparing all antidepressants to placebo has been done in the past. Since then, new data on existing antidepressants have emerged, and new antidepressants have been introduced. An updated and more comprehensive review is needed to provide a stronger understanding of the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and impact on the quality of life of the various types of antidepressants compared to placebo.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antidepressants in GAD in adults, specifically to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of GAD compared to placebo, and to review the acceptability of antidepressants in GAD in terms of adverse effects, including the general prevalence of adverse effects compared to placebo.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Health Disorders (CCMD) register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in October 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or clust…

### Xanax [^114YW8E7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Generalized anxiety disorder**: Xanax was compared to a placebo in double-blind clinical studies with doses up to 4 mg per day in patients diagnosed with anxiety or anxiety with associated depressive symptomatology. Xanax was significantly better than the placebo at each of the evaluation periods of these 4-week studies. This was assessed using the following psychometric instruments: Physician's Global Impressions, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Target Symptoms, Patient's Global Impressions, and Self-Rating Symptom Scale.

- **Panic disorder**: The effectiveness of Xanax in the treatment of panic disorder was studied in three short-term, placebo-controlled studies lasting up to 10 weeks in patients with diagnoses closely corresponding to DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder. The average dose of Xanax was 5 mg to 6 mg per day in two of the studies, while doses were fixed at 2 mg and 6 mg per day in the third study. In all three studies, Xanax was superior to the placebo on a measure defined as "the number of patients with zero panic attacks", with 37% to 83% meeting this criterion, as well as on a global improvement score. In two of the three studies, Xanax was superior to the placebo on a measure defined as "change from baseline on the number of panic attacks per week", ranging from 3.3 to 5.2, and also on a phobia rating scale. A subgroup of patients who improved on Xanax during short-term treatment in one of these trials continued on an open basis for up to 8 months, without an apparent loss of benefit.

### Pregabalin in generalized anxiety disorder: A placebo-controlled trial [^111xtNPJ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Drug therapies for generalized anxiety disorder have limitations. In a controlled trial, the novel agent pregabalin was studied for the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder.

- **Method**: In this double-blind study, patients with DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive pregabalin (150 mg/day or 600 mg/day), lorazepam (6 mg/day), or placebo. A 1-week placebo lead-in was followed by 4 weeks of treatment and then a 1-week dose taper. The primary efficacy measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score at endpoint.

- **Results**: A total of 276 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group and received at least one dose of their assigned medication. Fewer patients given lorazepam (59%, N = 40 of 68) completed the trial than did those given placebo (73%, N = 50 of 69), 600 mg/day of pregabalin (71%, N = 50 of 70), or 150 mg/day of pregabalin (90%, N = 62 of 69). The mean baseline-to-endpoint decreases in total Hamilton anxiety scale score in the patients given 150 mg/day of pregabalin (-9.2), 600 mg/day of pregabalin (-10.3), and lorazepam (-12.0) were significantly greater than the decrease in those given placebo (-6.8). As early as the week 1 observation, pregabalin significantly reduced the total Hamilton anxiety scale score compared with placebo. The most frequent adverse events reported for pregabalin and lorazepam were somnolence and dizziness. There were no serious adverse events reported by patients given pregabalin, and no withdrawal syndrome was associated with pregabalin treatment.

- **Conclusions**: These results indicate the potential efficacy of pregabalin in treating generalized anxiety disorder.

### Evidence-based pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder: A revision of the 2005 guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116WuigG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, BAP 2014 guidelines recommend assessing for the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and comorbid depression. They advise treating depression if symptoms are of more than mild intensity. It is important to recognize that coexisting depressive symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders are associated with greater functional impairment and a longer duration of illness.
