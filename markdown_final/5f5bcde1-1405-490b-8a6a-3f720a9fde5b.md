## Question

Dermoid cyst vs swollen lymph nodes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to distinguish dermoid cysts from swollen lymph nodes in the head and neck. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about embryology and fundamental pathology to anchor pretest probabilities. Then, I should verify the clinical history and physical examination discriminators. Next, I will review first-line imaging with ultrasound and define key sonographic features that separate cysts from nodes. After that, I need to check advanced imaging nuances on CT/MRI, especially fat and diffusion characteristics. Then, I will consider pitfalls and mimics that can confound diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and management implications, including when to observe, aspirate, or excise, and I will double-check guideline alignment throughout.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation, because misclassification here drives downstream errors. Dermoid cysts are congenital germ cell lesions (mature cystic teratomas) containing ectoderm and mesoderm, classically showing a squamous epithelial lining with skin appendages and, on imaging, internal fat globules that are pathognomonic when present, whereas lymph nodes are immune organs that enlarge reactively or due to infiltration by infection, inflammation, or malignancy, lacking fat content and showing a preserved fatty hilum when benign [^115FEN3e] [^112MwNpv] [^116yMwLp].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical discriminators before jumping to imaging. Dermoids typically present in infancy or early childhood as a painless, slow-growing, firm, non-tender, mobile subcutaneous mass along embryonic fusion lines, often midline or periorbital, and they do not fluctuate with intercurrent infections; by contrast, reactive lymph nodes are often tender, fluctuate with viral or bacterial illnesses, and may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise, with persistence beyond 4–6 weeks or size > 2 cm raising concern for alternative pathology [^1169ZRzn] [^112YtB8B] [^112kJ5LS].

> Hold on, I should verify the first-line imaging modality and why. Ultrasound is the preferred initial study for pediatric neck masses because it characterizes cystic versus solid nature, vascularity, and nodal architecture without radiation; for dermoids, ultrasound may show a well-circumscribed cyst with internal echogenic debris or fat globules and no internal vascularity, whereas reactive nodes show a preserved echogenic hilum, cortical thickening, and central vascularity on Doppler, with size thresholds informing concern for malignancy in adults per AAO-HNS guidance [^116yMwLp] [^113XakQL] [^113GpimA].

> I need to check the advanced imaging signatures next. On CT, dermoids show fat attenuation internally with possible calcification and thin peripheral enhancement, and on MRI they demonstrate fat signal on T1 that suppresses with fat saturation, with variable T2 signal and no diffusion restriction; conversely, benign nodes show a fatty hilum and homogeneous soft-tissue attenuation/signal, while necrotic metastatic nodes can mimic cysts but lack internal fat and may show peripheral enhancement patterns suggestive of malignancy [^112MwNpv] [^112TUvrC] [^115Q9K1s].

> But wait, what if the ultrasound is equivocal or the location is atypical. I should confirm the key mimics and pitfalls. Infected or necrotic lymph nodes and branchial cleft cysts can appear cystic and mimic dermoids, while dermoids in the floor of mouth or lateral neck can be misread as lymphatic malformations; careful attention to internal fat globules, diffusion restriction (favoring epidermoid), nodal hilum preservation, and anatomic location reduces error, and in some cases excisional biopsy is ultimately required for definitive diagnosis [^115Q9K1s] [^117CpFsQ].

> Let me reconsider age-specific patterns because they shift the differential. In children, most palpable neck masses are benign and reactive lymphadenopathy predominates, with dermoids comprising a minority but often presenting in the first decade along midline or orbital regions; in adults, a new neck mass should be considered malignant until proven otherwise, so persistent nodes or cystic masses warrant prompt tissue diagnosis with ultrasound-guided FNA rather than open biopsy when feasible [^1169ZRzn] [^114UJbTb] [^117Q3nWn].

> I should double-check the management algorithm and thresholds. For a classic dermoid with supportive imaging, complete surgical excision is curative and prevents complications such as rupture or infection; for presumed reactive nodes, observe with a short interval after treating any source of infection, but if the node persists beyond 4–6 weeks, enlarges beyond 2 cm, becomes firm/fixed, or is associated with B symptoms, then obtain ultrasound and proceed to FNA or core biopsy per guidelines, and in pediatric patients with suspected dermoid, early excision is advised due to risks of intracranial extension in frontotemporal lesions [^1169ZRzn] [^117Q3nWn] [^1167EwAo].

> Hold on, I should verify a few special scenarios that change urgency. Frontotemporal or nasal dermoids have a higher propensity for intracranial extension and sinus tracts and merit preoperative CT or MRI to plan complete excision, whereas floor-of-mouth dermoids require delineation relative to the mylohyoid to choose intraoral versus transcervical approaches; rare nodal entities like angiomyomatous hamartoma can masquerade as cysts and may only be clarified on histopathology, so if imaging is discordant with clinical suspicion, tissue diagnosis should not be deferred [^115eV5hX] [^112TUvrC] [^1115Ahmo].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnostic flow remains disciplined: use location and clinical course to generate pretest probability, confirm with ultrasound looking for internal fat or a preserved nodal hilum, escalate to CT/MRI when fat globules, diffusion restriction, or deep extension are suspected, and proceed to FNA or excision if imaging is inconclusive or red flags emerge; maintaining vigilance for cystic metastases in adults and for intracranial extension in select pediatric dermoids is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and delays in care [^113XakQL] [^112MwNpv] [^117Q3nWn].

Dermoid cysts and swollen lymph nodes are distinguished by **origin and imaging**: dermoid cysts are congenital, lined by ectoderm, and often contain fat or calcification [^112TUvrC], whereas lymph nodes are immune structures that enlarge with infection or inflammation [^115Wbnoy] [^1169ZRzn]. On ultrasound, dermoids are **cystic with internal echogenic debris** [^116yMwLp] and no vascularity, whereas nodes are solid with a **preserved fatty hilum** and vascular flow [^116yMwLp]. CT/MRI shows dermoids as fat-attenuation cysts with rim enhancement [^113tFScy], while nodes enhance uniformly or with a necrotic center in malignancy [^115Q9K1s]. Dermoids are managed by **complete surgical excision** [^1167EwAo]; nodes are observed or biopsied if suspicious [^114AD7pq] [^117Q3nWn].

| **Feature** | **Dermoid cyst** | **Swollen lymph node** |
|-|-|-|
| Origin | Congenital; ectodermal inclusion | Immune structure; reactive or neoplastic |
| Location | Midline or along fusion lines; superficial | Lateral neck; along lymphatic chains |
| Consistency | Fluctuant, non-tender | Firm to rubbery; may be tender if inflamed |
| Ultrasound | Cystic with internal echogenic debris; no vascularity | Solid with preserved fatty hilum; vascular flow |
| CT/MRI | Fat-attenuation cyst with rim enhancement [^113tFScy] | Uniform enhancement; necrotic center in malignancy [^115Q9K1s] |
| Management | Surgical excision [^1167EwAo] | Observation; FNA or biopsy if persistent or suspicious [^114AD7pq] [^117Q3nWn] |

### Ultrasound evaluation of persistent cervical lymph nodes in young children [^115SXVf8]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To review the ultrasonographic outcomes of persistent lymph nodes, in the absence of other concerning signs or symptoms, in patients < 6 years of age.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 98 patients < 6 years old who had neck ultrasound for persistent lymph nodes at a single university hospital over a 3.5 year period between January 2016 and June 2019.

Results

There were no cases of malignant disease or serious systemic illness. Ninety-two of the 98 examinations showed normal or reactive lymph nodes. There were three sonographically indeterminate cases and two non-lymph-node structures: haemangioma and dermoid cyst. One examination reported an abnormal lymph node, which had resolved by the time of review in clinic.

Conclusion

Persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes should be investigated; however, a distinction should be made between lymph nodes that have regressed to < 1 cm but are still palpable and persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes. The findings of the present study indicate that persistence of non-enlarged lymph nodes is not a predictor for malignancy. It is advised that clear guidelines are used, which state the criteria for further investigation, to promote the best use of imaging.

### Dermoid cyst of the parotid gland location [^115Tf7Cy]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Dermoid cysts (DCs) can occur anywhere in the body. However, DCs on neck or head are not common, which account for about 7% among all kinds of DCs and mostly occur in superficial areas. These cysts are hardly seen in the parotid gland. It is challenging to make accurate diagnosis before surgery because of its rarity and the ambiguous findings on radiology images. Based on a short review of the literature on DCs in the parotid gland, we discussed their clinical features and histopathological and radiological characteristics.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112rHnWH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic neck mass statement — policy basis and supporting text emphasize avoiding misdiagnosis and outline the recommendation rationale: Risks, harms, costs are the cost of additional diagnostic tests, and the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments express concern by the GDG that some patients receive false reassurance about cystic masses despite studies showing a high rate of malignancy and false-negative biopsies. Intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences are none; exceptions are none; the policy level is recommendation; and there were no differences of opinion. The supporting text states the purpose is to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis of malignant cystic neck masses in adults, notes that the most common cause of a lateral cystic neck mass has traditionally been thought to be a branchial cleft anomaly, yet a single cervical cystic lymph node metastasis can mimic a branchial cleft cyst clinically.

### Post-traumatic preauricular pulsatile swelling in a patient on oral anticoagulation therapy [^114mkwtw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The differential diagnoses for preauricular swellings include dermoid cyst, lymph nodes, lipoma, nerve sheath tumours, parotid swelling, mastoiditis, vascular malformations and arterio-venous fistulas aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms. Superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysm(s) (STAPA) are rare (1% of all aneurysms) vascular complications, which occur following a blunt injury of the head or iatrogenic causes. The use of anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of pseudoaneurysm formation. We present a case of traumatic STAPA while on oral anticoagulation. He was treated with surgical exploration, STAPA excision with ligation of the vessel. He had an uneventful recovery with a good functional and cosmetic outcome at 1 year.

### Causes of facial swelling in pediatric patients: correlation of clinical and radiologic findings [^113byLMv]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Facial swelling is a common clinical problem in pediatric patients. The causes of swelling are diverse, and knowledge of the typical clinical and imaging manifestations and the most common sites of occurrence of these conditions is needed to formulate a differential diagnosis. The general clinical manifestations may be classified into the following four groups: (a) acute swelling with inflammation, (b) nonprogressive swelling, (c) slowly progressive swelling, and (d) rapidly progressive swelling. Conditions that may account for acute swelling accompanied by inflammation include lymphadenitis, sinusitis, odontogenic infection, and abscess. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the modality of choice for detection of abscesses requiring surgical drainage. Nonprogressive midfacial swelling is suggestive of a congenital anomaly (eg, a cephalocele, nasal glioma, or nasal dermoid or epidermoid cyst). Slowly progressive swelling may indicate the presence of a neurofibroma, hemangioma, lymphangioma, vascular malformation, or pseudocyst, or of fibrous dysplasia. The differential diagnosis for rapidly progressive facial swelling in association with cranial nerve deficits should include rhabdomyosarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Ewing sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and metastatic neuroblastoma.

### Tumors and tumor-like lesions of the neck: from childhood to adult [^117Krxfu]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

In childhood, tumors and tumor-like lesions of the neck are rare and tend to be benign. Very common are congenital cystic lesions (thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cysts, dermoid cysts, lymphangiomas, cystic hygromas). Common neoplastic lesions are hemangiomas and papillomas. The most common malignant tumors in the head and neck region are lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. Lymph node enlargements, reactive or/and infectious, account also for a significant amount of cervical masses.

### Updated WHO nomenclature of head and neck lesions and associated imaging findings [^111EoNnd]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

As opposed to metastases, heterotopia-associated carcinomas of the head and neck most commonly arise from ectopic salivary or thyroid tissue. For example, papillary thyroid carcinoma can arise from thyroglossal duct cysts (Fig. 14). The ectopic tumors can display analogous imaging features to their counterparts in regular locations. However, imaging may not necessarily help differentiate heterotopic primary tumors from lymph node metastases, which is an important consideration and may require detailed histological examination in order to make such a distinction.

There are many types of developmental and acquired cysts included in the updated WHO section on tumor-like lesions of the head and neck, including thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cleft cysts, inclusion cysts, foregut duplication cysts, and ranulas (Fig. 15). While all of these can appear as simple cysts on imaging, the location of the lesions, such as midline versus lateral neck, can help distinguish them. Furthermore, some of the tumor-like lesions can display specific features, such as fat components in dermoids and sinus tracts with branchial cleft cysts. In addition, some of these cysts can be complicated by rupture and infection, which can manifest as cyst wall thickening and surrounding inflammation, and in rare cases, there may be an underlying neoplasm.

### Presternal dermoid cyst mimicking lymphatic malformation: a case report and review of the literature [^114ce1xU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

We describe an 11-month-old boy with an unusually large presternal mass present since birth. The large size, fluctuant properties, transillumination, compressibility, and imaging of this lesion were characteristic of a lymphatic malformation. Although four treatments with sclerotherapy markedly reduced its size, it was not until definitive treatment with surgical excision and the final pathology report that we arrived at the ultimate diagnosis of dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts, although appearing along embryologic lines of closure, are rarely presternal. They are usually small, thick walled, and filled with sebaceous or keratinous fluid, which typically allows for clinical diagnosis, and show characteristic features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound. However, this case illustrates that dermoid cysts can appear in somewhat atypical locations, and imaging is not always diagnostic, so dermoid cyst should remain a part of the differential diagnosis for any lesion presenting midsternally, regardless of the size and imaging characteristics.

### Dermoid cyst of the parotid gland [^117CVjz6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A dermoid cyst is an ectodermally differentiated form of teratoma. Its occurrence in the parotid gland is very rare. Such a presentation must be properly evaluated in order to rule out malignancy. We describe the diagnostic evaluation and surgical management of a parotid dermoid cyst in an 18-year-old man. We also review the embryologic pathogenesis of the tumor and the usefulness of the physical examination, preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography in evaluating the extent of the tumor, its histologic features, and its cystic characteristics. Finally, we discuss the role of surgical management in terms of preserving facial nerve integrity and preventing recurrence.

### Sonographic findings of axillary masses: what can be imaged in this space? [^115Kts83]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of axillary masses can be challenging because various tumors can develop in parts of the axilla other than lymph nodes, even though we frequently encounter axillary masses in daily practice. These lesions include soft tissue masses associated with nontumorous conditions (accessory breast tissue and chronic granulomatous inflammation) and benign and malignant tumorous conditions (lipomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, lymphangiomas, fibroadenomas, schwannomas, malignant neuroendocrine tumors, and lymph node-associated diseases). In this pictorial essay, we display commonly encountered sonographic findings of various axillary lesions to assist in the differential diagnosis of axillary masses.

### Subcutaneous dermoid cysts on the eyebrow and neck [^114Ze4Ym]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a case of dermoid cysts on the right lateral eyebrow and anterior neck. Multiple concurrent dermoid cysts, as in the present case, are very rare. The differential diagnosis of dermoid cyst includes epidermoid (epidermal inclusion) cyst, trichilemmal cyst, pilomatrixoma, lymphatic malformation, and lipoma. In particular, thyroglossal duct cyst and midline anterior neck inclusion cyst are part of the differential diagnosis when the lesion is in the anterior neck.

### Unusual presentation of angiomyomatous hamartoma in an eight-month-old infant: case report and literature review [^113AQWe3]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Palpable neck masses are a common clinical concern in pediatric patients, and differential diagnosis includes a wide range of pathologies, such as congenital, inflammatory, tumoral and traumatic lesions. Malformative neck masses in childhood are branchial cleft cysts, ectopic thymus, teratomas, cystic lymphangioma, aberrant thyroid tissue and others. Thyroglossal duct cyst is a congenital anomaly related to persistence of thyroglossal duct, presenting as a midline cyst, near the hyoid bone with variable sonographic appearances. AH is a rare, benign lymph node pathology consisting of a fibrous transformation of the hilar region, also with presence of vessels and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Of 28 cases hitherto reported, only two were located in the lateral neck region, both in adult patients, and the lesion has been more frequently found in the inguinal and femoral region.

Ultrasonography (US) is an accurate, cost-effective, non-invasive preoperative analysis, usually sufficient to make correct preoperative diagnoses, even if the accuracy of this imaging method may have limitations, because of the variability of the sonographic appearances. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging play a supplementary diagnostic role. Obviously, surgical excision with histological examination allows a definite diagnosis.

The authors herein describe an unusual case of AH presenting as a palpable mass in the anterior midline neck region of an infant. US preoperative evaluation of the lesion appeared compatible with a partly cystic mass, and, due to the peculiar location, a thyroglossal duct cyst was suspected or, secondly, a dermoid cyst, a small teratoma or an enlarged reactive lymph node.

### Craniofacial epidermoid and dermoid cysts [^115eV5hX]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Temporal Area

Although dermoid cysts located in the lateral skull region are rarely associated with intracranial extension, temporal dermoid cysts have a high rate of intracranial extension. An association between frontotemporal location and bone erosion was reported. Preoperative imaging evaluation with CT or MRI was recommended for congenital mass in a sinus in the temporal area.

A 17-year-old man presented at Brong Ahafo Regional Hospital with a recurrent facial mass of about 8 months duration. One year before the presentation, the patient had reported to a district hospital with a similar mass, which was excised but not histopathologically diagnosed. Two months after the surgical procedure, the patient noticed a recurrence of the mass, which was not completely removed, had gradually increased in size and had no known associated symptoms. A clinical examination revealed a well-defined elliptical facial mass with scarification marks extending from the mastoid of the temporal bone to the anterio-superior aspect of the left postauricular region (Fig. 2 A, B). The edges and surface of the mass were smooth with no ulceration, and the mass was not mobile, with attachment to both underlying and overlying tissue. The mass was dark in color, similar to the patient's facial skin, and no palpable facial or cervical lymph nodes were observed. Contrast CT revealed a predominantly hypodense fluid attenuation and an expansile intradiploic lesion in the left temporal bone and mastoid region involving the inner table of the diploic space, as shown in Figure 2 C. The patient underwent surgical removal of the lesion. The scalp flap exposed an encapsulated whitish intradiploic tumor. The tumor was resected from apparently normal bone and was overlaid by scarified skin (Fig. 2 D).

Differential diagnosis / clinical importance

The differential diagnosis includes: squamous cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), Warthin tumour (infarcted), and epidermoid or dermoid cysts. Squamous cell carcinoma is an overtly malignant epithelial tumour characterized by invasion, often perineural or intravascular invasion, and necrosis. Most squamous cell carcinomas in the parotid represent cutaneous metastases to intraparotid lymph nodes, which is far more common than keratocystoma. Keratocystoma is benign, lacks significant cytological atypia, and contains only scant mitoses confined to the basal layer. Keratocystoma will not have mucous cells that are found in MEC and will have significant keratinization. Squamous metaplasia and necrosis can be seen in an infarcted Warthin tumour; however; a Warthin tumour may focally contain bilayered oncocytic epithelium and lymphoid stroma with germinal centre formation not present in keratocystoma. As the differential diagnosis includes benign and malignant entities, it is crucial to exclude malignancy in order to avoid overtreatment and associated morbidities.

### A pediatric lateral submental mass: a rare presentation of dermoid cyst [^112kJ5LS]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Dermoid cysts are benign cutaneous neoplasms that contain germ cells from the ectoderm and mesoderm. Approximately 70% are diagnosed during childhood before the age of 5. Although they can present throughout the body, the prevalence is 7% for those arising from the head and neck. These lesions present primarily as midline masses and are classified as sublingual, submental, or overlapping depending on their relationship with the muscles of the floor of mouth. A 10-year-old female presented with a 2-week history of right submental swelling. She denied pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, or respiratory distress. Physical examination showed nontender fullness of the submental region without erythema or induration and no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound showed an oval-shaped cystic mass measuring 4.8 × 4.0 × 2.6 cm. After a course of clindamycin, a computed tomography was obtained which showed a right 4.5 × 4.0 × 2.6 cm fluid filled lesion, within the right lateral floor of mouth. Intraoral resection was performed and the mass was freed from the geniohyoid and mylohyoid. Histopathology was consistent with a dermoid cyst. Submental masses have a broad differential, but rarely are they dermoid cysts if they arise lateral to the midline. With appropriate diagnosis and total surgical excision, patients and their families can be reassured in similar cases.

### Squamous cell carcinoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma invading the sigmoid colon: a rare presentation [^111Jk6go]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We discuss a rare presentation of malignant teratoma in a 63-year-old woman who was admitted to accident and emergency with abdominal distension, bloody diarrhoea and peritonitis. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed free air in the abdomen and a gas-fluid filled cavity measuring 12×6cm in the mid-pelvis with possible fistulation that was suspicious for malignancy. A 10×12cm ruptured dermoid cyst was found intraoperatively, which was adherent to the bowel wall. Bulky lymph nodes were also appreciated. The surgeon suspected a metastatic malignant teratoma, and a Hartmann's procedure, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoopherectomy were performed with clearance of the para-aortic lymph nodes. Subsequent histological analysis revealed a squamous cell carcinoma arising from an ovarian malignant teratoma. The patient went on to have carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy and is alive at 6months follow-up.

### Thyroglossal duct pathology and mimics [^112tHSdn]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital anterior neck masses comprise a rare group of lesions typically diagnosed in childhood. Most commonly, lesions are anomalies of the thyroglossal duct, namely the thyroglossal duct cyst, along with ectopic thyroid tissue. Although usually suspected based on clinical examination, imaging can confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent, and evaluate for associated complications. Imaging characteristics on ultrasound, CT, and MRI may at times be equivocal; differential considerations include branchial cleft cyst, dermoid/epidermoid, laryngocele, thymic cyst, lymphatic malformation, and metastatic disease. Thus, understanding of the embryologic course of thyroid development is crucial with recognition of critical landmarks such as the foramen cecum, hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and strap musculature to aid in the diagnosis of an anterior neck mass.

### Evaluation and management of neck masses in children [^1169ZRzn]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Neck masses in children usually fall into one of three categories: developmental, inflammatory/reactive, or neoplastic. Common congenital developmental masses in the neck include thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cleft cysts, dermoid cysts, vascular malformations, and hemangiomas. Inflammatory neck masses can be the result of reactive lymphadenopathy, infectious lymphadenitis (viral, staphylococcal, and mycobacterial infections; cat-scratch disease), or Kawasaki disease. Common benign neoplastic lesions include pilomatrixomas, lipomas, fibromas, neurofibromas, and salivary gland tumors. Although rare in children, malignant lesions occurring in the neck include lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Workup for a neck mass may include a complete blood count; purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis; and measurement of titers for Epstein-Barr virus, cat-scratch disease, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and toxoplasmosis if the history raises suspicion for any of these conditions. Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging study for a developmental or palpable mass. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is recommended for evaluating a malignancy or a suspected retropharyngeal or deep neck abscess. Congenital neck masses are excised to prevent potential growth and secondary infection of the lesion. Antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial lymphadenitis should target Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus. Lack of response to initial antibiotics should prompt consideration of intravenous antibiotic therapy, referral for possible incision and drainage, or further workup. If malignancy is suspected (accompanying type B symptoms; hard, firm, or rubbery consistency; fixed mass; supraclavicular mass; lymph node larger than 2 cm in diameter; persistent enlargement for more than two weeks; no decrease in size after four to six weeks; absence of inflammation; ulceration; failure to respond to antibiotic therapy; or a thyroid mass), the patient should be referred to a head and neck surgeon for urgent evaluation and possible biopsy.

Mimics and difficult diagnoses

Cystic masses

Both benign and malignant cystic neck masses can become infected and mimic abscesses. Benign cystic masses include vascular malformations and developmental branchial cleft cysts, and, if previously undiagnosed, are often diagnosed after the acute infection has dissipated (Fig. 31). Clinically the most important malignant cystic neck mass that can be secondarily infected is the necrotic lymph node metastasis from neck mucosal space squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 32). The importance of this caveat is increasing because of the rising incidence of cystic necrotic metastases from human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal carcinoma, especially in young adults. Although not secondary to underlying cystic mass, suppurative lymphadenitis refers to a collection of purulent fluid within an infected lymph node; imaging findings are similar to those of true abscess or infected cystic mass, but diagnosis can often be made based on location and general lymphadenopathy.

### Angiomyomatous hamartoma in a postauricular lymph node: a rare entity masquerading as a cyst [^112WjVRG]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angiomyomatous hamartoma (AMH) of the lymph node (LN) is an uncommon, benign vascular proliferation of unknown etiology. Histologically, it is characterized by the replacement of nodal architecture with blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and variable amounts of fibrous and adipose tissue in a collagenous stroma. First described in 1992, there are now 30 cases reported in the literature, primarily involving the inguinal and femoral LNs; rarely, cervical and submandibular nodal involvement have been described. Herein we present the first case, to our knowledge, of AMH arising within a postauricular node and clinically masquerading as an epidermal inclusion cyst.

### Let's face it-13 unusual causes of facial masses in children [^116M6s3z]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Facial swelling is a common clinical scenario in the paediatric setting, associated with a diverse range of possible causes. The underlying aetiology ranges from congenital lesions to infective and inflammatory conditions, and various other benign or malignant masses.

Advances in imaging techniques have led to the ever-increasing use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluating the extent of disease and for treatment planning.

In the case of facial swelling associated with a systemic illness, poor response to antibiotic treatment, or a clinical suspicion of malignancy, cross-sectional imaging should be considered.

At our institution, MRI is favoured for the assessment of paediatric facial masses, with the advantages of superior soft tissue resolution and a lack of ionizing radiation.

There are several key clinical features that should be taken into account when interpreting this type of imaging, including the age of the child, the location of the mass, the duration and nature of onset, and any underlying condition associated with the development of neoplasms.

The most commonly encountered facial masses in the paediatric population are infective in nature, typically due to lymphadenitis, sinusitis, or a dental infection.

Congenital masses tend to be non-progressive; examples include fronto-ethmoidal cephaloceles, nasal gliomas, and nasal dermoid and epidermoid cysts.

Rapidly progressive masses include malignancies, with rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma being the most common, in addition to osteogenic sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Ewing's sarcoma, and metastatic neuroblastoma.

Although several reviews of the common causes of facial masses can be found in the literature, there is relatively little on the spectrum of more unusual causes such as salivary gland tumours and teratomas.

Our series includes 13 examples of rare, biopsy-proven conditions (Table 1), selected from a total of 136 MRIs of children presenting with facial masses between April 2007 and May 2013. These include two HIV-associated malignancies, three parotid gland tumours, two congenital facial masses, two lesions of the mandible, a paranasal sinus tumour, and three additional unusual facial malignancies. A literature review has been conducted, although in many instances the information available is scant.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^117Q3nWn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass — preferred tissue diagnosis and management of cystic masses: Clinicians should perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) instead of open biopsy, or refer to someone who can perform FNA, for patients at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis remains uncertain, and for cystic neck masses determined by FNA or imaging, clinicians should continue evaluation until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign.

### US of pediatric superficial masses of the head and neck [^116yMwLp]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Superficial palpable masses of the head and neck are common in the pediatric population, with the vast majority of the lesions ultimately proven to be benign. Duplex ultrasonography (US) has emerged as the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of superficial pediatric masses. Without utilizing radiation, iodinated contrast material, or sedation and/or anesthesia, US provides a means for quick and cost-effective acquisition of information, including the location, size, shape, internal content, and vascularity of the mass. In this review, the US findings are described for a variety of common and uncommon pediatric head and neck masses diagnosed in our practice. Specifically, the entities covered include neonatal scalp hematoma, craniosynostosis, dermoid and epidermoid cysts, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymph nodes and their complications, fibromatosis colli, thyroglossal duct cyst, branchial cleft cyst, cervical thymus, congenital goiter, thyroid papillary carcinoma, parathyroid adenoma, hemangioma, lymphangioma, jugular vein phlebectasia, Lemierre syndrome, acute parotitis and parotid abscess, leukemia and/or lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Ultimately, in situations in which the head or neck mass is too large, deep, or hyperechoic to be fully assessed within the US field of view, or if malignancy or a high-flow vascular lesion is suspected, then further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is warranted.

### Thyroglossal duct pathology and mimics [^112MwNpv]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Dermoid and epidermoid cysts

Dermoid and epidermoid cysts represent a part of the spectrum of congenital and acquired cystic malformations sharing the common characteristic of a squamous epithelial lining. Dermoid cysts will be differentiated by internal calcific and fat content (Fig. 14). Epidermoid cysts will show diffusion restriction. Dermoid and epidermoid cysts arise from dermal elements of the first and second branchial arches, and therefore are located at base of tongue and superficially within the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior neck. In contrast, thyroglossal duct cysts are classically in a deeper location, embedded within strap musculature and in close proximity to the hyoid bone.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis, classification, and treatment of cervical lymphatic malformation in paediatric patients: a retrospective study [^117CpFsQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Differentiating cervical lymphatic malformations from other conditions is essential for proper treatment. Colour and power Doppler ultrasonography do not show flow signals in the wall and septations of most cervical lymphatic malformations. Of the 320 patients with cervical lymphatic malformations in our study, 19 showed sparse flow signals in the wall and septations of the masses during colour and Doppler ultrasonography. Therefore, this feature can be used to differentiate cervical lymphatic malformations from cervical haemangiomas, which shows rich flow signals. Unilocular cervical lymphatic malformations should be differentiated from pyriform cysts, which are generally located anterolateral to the trachea and have thicker walls. In this study, two patients with pyriform cyst were misdiagnosed with cervical lymphatic malformations, and one patient with a cervical lymphatic malformation was misdiagnosed with a pyriform cyst. When a cervical lymphatic malformation is complicated by haemorrhage, infection, or calcification, it should be differentiated from a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are most commonly located in the submental part of the midline of the neck, above the hyoid bone, and have a thicker wall than cervical lymphatic malformation. On imaging, internal echoic patterns of dermoid cysts are generally low and turbid, the pattern of distribution is scattered, and real-time ultrasonography displays fine spot rolling and reflection stripes in the envelope. In this study, one patient with dermoid cyst was misdiagnosed with a cervical lymphatic malformation. Moreover, cervical lymphatic malformations should be differentiated from cervical lipoblastoma, which is common in infants < 3 years old. These masses occur separately and have a medium-to-soft texture, clear boundaries, and good mobility. Most lesions are located under the skin, presenting as slightly hyperechoic masses with hyperechoic septations inside. Colour Doppler ultrasonography may reveal low-speed strip colour Doppler signals in and around the tumour. Therefore, according to its clinical features and the echoic pattern, location, and distribution of blood flow, differentiating cervical lymphatic malformations from other conditions can be easy.

### An unusual presentation of a lingual dermoid cyst [^113JwMbt]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Dermoid cysts are rare lesions of the head and neck that usually present in children as an asymptomatic, slowly growing mass. We report a case that demonstrates that dermoid cysts can present later in life as a recurrent acute infection. Our patient was a 48-year-old man with a 22-year history of recurrent abscesses of the tongue and floor of the mouth that had required a tracheotomy and multiple hospitalizations. Magnetic resonance imaging performed between acute episodes revealed the presence of a 1.8-cm lesion within the tongue musculature. The patient underwent resection, and pathology was consistent with a lingual dermoid cyst. At 2 years of follow-up, he experienced no recurrence of symptoms.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for neck mass, more specifically with respect to fine-needle aspiration (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to complete a thorough and appropriate evaluation until a diagnosis is obtained in patients with a cystic neck mass who are deemed at high risk of malignancy. Avoid assuming prematurely that the mass is benign.

### Uncommon insidious dumbbell-shaped double thyroglossal duct cyst [^1171KBvy]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC) is one of the most common congenital neck masses. Although 70% of the cases are found in children, reports suggested that there is a bimodal age distribution in the first and fifth decades. However, its sexual distribution was still controversial.TGDCs generally present as painless, asymptomatic soft masses in midline neck, which move with tongue protrusion and swallowing. However, the lingual subtype could cause laryngeal stridor, respiratory obstruction, and dysphagia. Most TGDCs are solitary, and the reports about double TGDCs were rare. Here, we presented a case of dumbbell-shaped double TGDCs with concomitant epiglottic cysts.

Though most of TGDCs locate inferior to hyoid bone, some TGDCs are found at the level of hyoid or above the hyoid and few cases are found at the base of the tongue. Generally, the differential diagnoses of TGDCs include dermoid or epidermoid cysts, sebaceous cysts, lymphadenopathy, cystic hygromas, ectopic thyroid gland, branchial cleft cysts, hemangiomas, lipomas, bronchogenic cyst, and tuberculous lymphadenitis. The close relationship between TGDC and hyoid bone is the key character for differentiation and the final differentiation relies on histopathological examination. Besides, some researchers validated that subclinical persistence of TGDC could manifest it as a cyst in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancers. In those cases, particular attentions should be paid to differentiate them from metastases.

### Thyroglossal duct cysts in children: sonographic features every radiologist should know and their histopathological correlation [^114WugGa]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between thyroglossal duct cysts (TGDC) and dermoid cysts (DC) sonographically can be challenging. We illustrate the three sonographic features in neck masses in children recently identified as being most suggestive of TGDC (septa, irregular wall and solid elements) and their corresponding histopathology. These three variables form a proposed predictive model for TGDC as a guide to surgical intervention. Pediatric radiologists should be familiar with these key imaging features, as compared with other imaging features described in TGDC also illustrated here, which are less discriminating.

Follow-up expectations — neck mass management: Clinicians should inform the patient about the expected time until response of the neck mass, including the return of the lymph node to normal size, < 1.5 cm, and the need for clinical follow-up if the mass persists; the patient and clinician are jointly responsible to ensure that the neck mass decreases in size or that a final diagnosis is made. The nature of follow-up is at the discretion of the patient and the clinician, and follow-up may entail a revisit or telephone call with the clinician, referral to a specialist, or additional testing.

### Imaging of pediatric neck masses [^113ZP3Mo]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Palpable neck masses are a common indication for pediatric imaging. Such lesions may be caused by infectious, inflammatory, tumoral, traumatic, lymphovascular, immunologic, or congenital etiologies. Radiological assessment of neck masses in young children should be tailored based on patient presentation and physical examination, as well as clinical suspicion. The goal of imaging should be to help arrive at a diagnosis or limited differential in an efficient manner while minimizing radiation exposure.

### Congenital cervical cysts, sinuses and fistulae [^112pke7v]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital cervical anomalies are important to consider in the differential of head and neck masses in children and adults. These lesions can present as palpable cystic masses, infected masses, draining sinuses, or fistulae. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common, followed by branchial cleft anomalies, dermoid cysts, and more rarely median cervical clefts. Other topics discussed include median ectopic thyroid, cervical teratomas, and branchiootorenal syndrome. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these lesions requires a complete understanding of their embryology and anatomy. Correct diagnosis, resolution of infectious issues before definitive therapy, and complete surgical excision are essential to prevent recurrence.

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^113XakQL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

AIUM practice guideline — lymph nodes ultrasound specifies that indications for an ultrasound examination of enlarged cervical lymph nodes include determination of likely inflammation from metastatic malignant lymph nodes; determination of a lymph node from another mass lesion such as a cyst, schwannoma, paraganglioma, lipoma, or parathyroid adenoma; determination of possible lymphomatous node(s); determination of the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy at specific levels to determine the required type of neck dissection; determination of the specific level of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma within lymph node(s) to assist in defining the primary source; fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology; and core sampling for lymphoma. A mass identified on physical examination is well suited to subsequent sonographic evaluation, lymph nodes are examined initially with grayscale ultrasound imaging, and if a focused examination is performed, a regional or comprehensive ultrasound inspection of other lymph node levels is usually required. If a primary malignant lesion in the aerodigestive tract or thyroid gland is identified on physical examination, ultrasound may be the first-line imaging modality used, allowing identification of other nodes that may not be palpable and access to cytology with ultrasound-guided FNA.

### Unusual CT features of dermoid cyst in the posterior fossa [^111CVXXP]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

A dermoid cyst of the posterior fossa in a 73-year-old man is reported. The presentation of the cyst was unusual because of the age of the patient, the spontaneously hyperdense aspect of the mass on CT, the partial rim enhancement of the lesion, and the presence of perilesional edema. On pathologic examination, the cyst contained small amount of fat, hairs, necrosis, and small areas of hemorrhage. The amount of hemorrhage found could not explain the spontaneous hyperdensity of the lesion found on CT. The hyperdensity may be related to high protein content of the lesion.

### Craniofacial epidermoid and dermoid cysts [^114NKJY9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although epidermoid and dermoid cysts are rare, they can present in a variety of craniofacial locations. Classification by location is helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Despite benign pathology, epidermoid and dermoid cysts can invade adjacent structures. Clinical features of the cysts according to anatomic location should be considered. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions in the craniofacial region.

### Congenital cystic neck masses: embryology and imaging appearances, with clinicopathological correlation [^117RBR52]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Congenital cystic masses of the neck are uncommon and can present in any age group. Diagnosis of these lesions can be sometimes challenging. Many of these have characteristic locations and imaging findings. The most common of all congenital cystic neck masses is the thyroglossal duct cyst. The other congenital cystic neck masses are branchial cleft cyst, cystic hygroma (lymphangioma), cervical thymic and bronchogenic cysts, and the floor of the mouth lesions including dermoid and epidermoid cysts. In this review, we illustrate the common congenital cystic neck masses including embryology, clinical findings, imaging features, and histopathological findings.

### "Stealth surgery": transaxillary subcutaneous endoscopic excision of benign neck lesions [^111cRgVH]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Benign neck lesions are traditionally removed through an overlying incision. The resultant scar can be aesthetically displeasing. We previously reported our experience with a transaxillary subcutaneous endoscopic approach for management of torticollis. We now report a similar technique for removal of benign lesions of the neck.

Methods

The study uses a retrospective review of 5 elective transaxillary endoscopic procedures from March to December 2006. The lesions included an enlarged cervical lymph node, thyroglossal duct cyst, dermoid cyst, ectopic dilated neck vein, and a parathyroid adenoma. Outcome measures included need for conversion, cosmetic outcome, and complications.

Results

All procedures were successfully completed using the endoscopic approach. Postoperative pain was controlled with acetaminophen, and all patients were discharged from the hospital the same day. There were no intraoperative complications. The patient who had a thyroglossal cyst removed developed a postoperative seroma that resolved spontaneously. All families were pleased with the cosmetic results.

Conclusions

A transaxillary subcutaneous endoscopic approach can be applied effectively to a variety of benign lesions of the neck, allowing adequate exposure for dissection, and resulting in a quick recovery. Neck scarring is absent, with small scars well hidden in the axilla.

### Congenital cervical cysts, sinuses, and fistulae in pediatric surgery [^113LbBa2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital cervical anomalies are essential to consider in the clinical assessment of head and neck masses in children and adults. These lesions can present as palpable cystic masses, infected masses, draining sinuses, or fistulae. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common, followed by branchial cleft anomalies and dermoid cysts. Other lesions reviewed include median ectopic thyroid, cervical teratomas, and midline cervical clefts. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these lesions requires a thorough understanding of their embryology and anatomy. Correct diagnosis, resolution of infectious issues before definitive therapy, and complete surgical excision are imperative in the prevention of recurrence.

### Metastatic extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma presenting as a forehead mass [^114dXnG7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of EMC is wide surgical excision with or without adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. Although EMC has an indolent course, it is associated with a high rate of local and distant recurrence, with an estimated 10-year survival rate of 60.7%. The most common site of distant metastasis is the lungs; however, other sites include lymph nodes, bony skeleton, soft tissue, and the brain.

Our patient underwent surveillance with yearly chest computed tomography and nuclear bone scans after the initial diagnosis of EMC of the foot and was considered disease-free for 9 years before presenting to the dermatology clinic for a forehead mass presumed to be a lipoma. Other differential considerations for a mass on the forehead included dermoid cyst, meningocele/meningocephalocele, osteoma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoid osteoma, ossifying fibroma, giant cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, calcified cephalohematoma, and growing skull fracture (leptomeningeal cyst). Although this patient's clinical and histologic findings are consistent with EMC, the anatomical location of his mass is atypical. Additionally, the patient's time from the initial presentation of EMC to distant relapse differs from the literature that reports a median interval of 20 months for distant recurrence. Our case highlights the importance for dermatologists to maintain a broad differential diagnosis for scalp and skull masses, consider preoperative imaging in atypical cases, and be cautious during surgery for lesions that may have communication to the underlying dura or brain.

The sagittal (a) fat saturated proton density weighted image shows fluid in the suprahoffatic recess (white arrow), in the infrahoffatic recess (black arrow) and in the suprapatellar pouch (grey arrow).

The coronal (b) fat saturated proton density weighted image shows the parameniscal recesses (white arrows) with fluid above and below the lateral meniscal margins at the level of the body

Other miscellaneous cyst-like lesions

A variety of "cystic" lesions can be encountered in and around the knee joint that may complicate the differential diagnosis even more. The most common benign non-tumoral are the following:

Popliteal artery aneurysms present on MR images with variable signal intensity depending on flow characteristics and pulse sequences. They are typically situated within the popliteal fossa. A laminated MR appearance consistent with multilayered thrombus and occasionally rim-like calcification may also be demonstrated. The lesion shows continuity with the popliteal artery, which is a hallmark in diagnosis. Popliteal vein varices are focal dilatations of the popliteal vein. They present on MR images as lobulated masses in continuity with the popliteal vein. Lymph nodes located in and around the popliteal fossa may also manifest as cyst-like structures. Knowledge of their location as well as of the normal MR appearance of the lymph node fatty hillum aids in the differential diagnosis. Haematomas may simulate a cyst but can be differentiated by its signal intensity which depends on blood products' age (haemoglobin degradation products). Abscesses that can also mimic cysts are associated with infection and inflammation in the surrounding soft tissues and occasionally underlying osteomyelitis. Contrast enhancement is necessary for the correct diagnosis and for unmasking a possible sinus tract (Figs. 23, 24 and 25).

### Dermoid cysts: a report of 75 pediatric patients [^116qwAcU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Dermoid cysts (DCs) are benign cutaneous tumors that tend to persist and grow. The aim of this study was to examine the clinicopathologic features of congenital DCs. We present a case series of 75 children with a clinicopathologic diagnosis of DC. Seventy-two cysts were located on the head, one on the neck, and two on the trunk. Six cysts were located along the midline. Eight patients had symptoms other than changes in cyst size. Imaging studies were performed on 15 patients. Surgical excision was the primary treatment in all 75 cases. Neurosurgery and ophthalmology services were involved in the care of some patients. Histopathologic studies reported a foreign body giant cell reaction in 17 of the cysts. No recurrence was documented. DCs can remain stable for years, but they can become symptomatic as a result of enlargement and rupture or, more rarely, as a result of extension into surrounding tissues. Physicians should be aware that certain locations have a higher risk of DC extension, and adequate diagnostic investigations should be performed before their complete resection.

### Dermoid cyst of the spermatic cord in children [^111WUj3i]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Most of inguinal masses in children correspond to inguinal indirect hernias, but other pathologic entities may be found. Dermoid cysts of the spermatic cord are very rare, with only 9 clear cases reported in the literature to date, all of them in adults. We present a case of dermoid cyst of the spermatic cord in a 2-year-old boy, the youngest patient reported so far. Dermoid cysts of the spermatic cord should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of inguinal masses in children, especially in cases of long-standing, nontender, and irreducible inguinal mass.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112xahXC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Metastasis patterns and midline neck masses — adult evaluation: Skin cancers can metastasize to levels I to V as well as the external jugular, postauricular, suboccipital, and parotid regions. Nasopharyngeal, tongue base, and midline oral cavity (tongue) cancers may result in bilateral cervical metastases, and patients with distant lymphadenopathy may have a malignancy outside the head and neck, including lymphoma, lung, breast, or gastrointestinal tract, and should undergo thorough evaluation of those possible sources. Midline neck masses warrant special consideration given the diversity of the differential diagnosis, including thyroglossal duct cyst, thyroglossal duct carcinoma, thyroid malignancy, or metastatic spread from laryngeal malignancy (Delphian node). The GDG acknowledges that experienced clinicians may be able to distinguish a midline neoplasm that is separate and distinct from a mass suggestive of metastasis from upper aerodigestive tract tumors, and clinicians are not obliged to follow the CPG if they are reasonably certain that clinical findings are not consistent with the CPG paradigm.

### Radiological manifestations of thoracic hydatid cysts: pulmonary and extrapulmonary findings [^117Rg7yc]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue involvement

The frequency of primary soft tissue involvement is 0.5–4.7% of cases. Isolated muscular HC is very rare. Muscular involvement is usually seen with extension from other organs. The growth of the HC within a muscle is difficult due to the contractility of the muscles and the presence of lactic acid. In addition to muscular involvement, HC can also be seen in subcutaneous soft tissue, where it may have various appearances including unilocular cyst, multiloculated cyst with daughter cyst, and complex cystic lesion with or without calcification. Multiple HCs can be seen following cyst rupture of the cyst, which can also cause edema and acute inflammation.

The radiological differential diagnosis of soft tissue involvement can be listed as follows: abscess, chronic hematoma, synovial cyst, necrotic soft tissue tumors, lymphangioma, and necrotic lymphadenopathy (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12
Hydatid cysts in thoracic soft tissues and differential diagnosis. a Axial CT image shows left paraspinal muscle involvement of HC (red arrow). b Pectoral hematoma as a differential diagnosis of HC seen on CT image (red arrow). c HC with daughter cysts located in the right axilla seen on the axial CT image (red arrow). d Necrotic lymphadenopathy secondary to lung cancer is seen in the right axilla

Pleural cavity and fissures

As stated above in respect to the rupture of pulmonary HC, HC can perforate into the pleural cavity and cause pleural effusions, hydropneumothorax, simple and tension pneumothorax, and empyema. Although pleural hydatid disease is usually secondary to lung involvement, it may occasionally be primary. HC can be seen as unilocular or multilocular cysts in the pleural cavity. The pleural layers are avascular, and HC may occur and grow in this area due to the permeability of the cyst membrane to calcium, chloride, potassium, water, and urea. Most HCs located in the pleural cavity are attached to the visceral pleura with a thin pedicle. HCs in the pleural cavity can be located in both the subpleural region and fissures. The differential diagnosis of pleural HC should include empyema, dermoid cyst in the pleural cavity, mesothelioma, synovial sarcoma, bronchogenic cyst, lymphoma, and pleural metastases (Fig. 13).

### Pediatric teratoma and dermoid cysts [^1147TajA]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Teratomas and dermoid cysts are germ cell neoplasms. This article focuses on cervical and craniofacial teratomas. Presentation of these neoplasms varies in degree of severity, from cosmetic deformities to airway distress requiring emergent intervention. Nasal lesions (particularly if suspicious for a nasal dermoid) require imaging before biopsy to assess for intracranial extension. Treatment consists of airway management if respiratory distress is present, and early surgical intervention. Postoperative follow-up is required to monitor for recurrence.

### Struma ovarii: role of imaging? [^111ZBpL8]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound

Whilst a mature teratoma or dermoid cyst presents on ultrasound as a cystic lesion with a densely echogenic tubercle (termed a Rokitansky nodule or nidus), which projects into the cystic lumen, as well as associated sound attenuation due to sebaceous material and hair within the cyst cavity or recognisable fluid–fluid levels from the sebum floating above aqueous material, the ultrasound features of a struma ovarii are quite indistinct (Fig. 3). As struma ovarii presents with a variety of non-specific appearances and usually manifests as a multilocular cystic ovarian mass with solid components of various amounts, the ultrasound typically demonstrates these non-specific heterogeneous solid cystic features.

### Intraorbital cystic lesions: an imaging spectrum [^115VTxDg]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Presence of a cyst or a cystic component in an intraorbital mass often narrows the list of differential diagnoses to specific entities. Such a lesion in the orbit may arise from structures within the orbit, globe, and lacrimal system or from neighboring paranasal sinuses or meninges. Common congenital and developmental lesions encountered within the orbit include dermoids and epidermoids, and infrequently coloboma. Parasitic cysts (cysticercus), orbital abscess, mucocele, and vascular lesions are the most common acquired pathologies giving rise to fluid-containing lesions within the orbit. The role of a radiologist is crucial in expediting the diagnosis of orbital lesions with the help of characteristic imaging features on ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. It also helps in identifying complications in others where formulation of an early and effective management strategy is vital for preserving vision.

Orbital pathologies can be broadly classified as ocular, extraocular soft-tissue (non-neoplastic and neoplastic), osseous, and traumatic. In this paper, we discuss the key imaging features and differential diagnoses of congenital and developmental lesions (dermoid cyst, dermolipoma), infective and inflammatory pathologies (pre-septal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, optic neuritis, chalazion, thyroid ophthalmopathy, orbital pseudotumor), and non-neoplastic vascular anomalies (venous malformation, lymphatic malformation, carotid-cavernous fistula), emphasizing the key role of CT and MRI in the imaging work-up. In addition, we highlight the adjunctive role of ocular ultrasound in the diagnosis of dermoid cyst and chalazion, and discuss the primary role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of vascular malformations.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

Intracranial dermoid cysts have characteristic CT and MR imaging findings that generally make preoperative diagnosis straightforward. Enhancement of uncomplicated intradural dermoid cysts on CT or MR studies has been reported but is rare. We present a case of a posterior fossa dermoid cyst that was not only hyperattenuating on CT scans but also contained a mural nodule with clear evidence of enhancement on MR images.

### Angiomyomatous hamartoma of the inguinal lymph nodes with localized lymphedema presenting as a soft subcutaneous mass [^116omQhV]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angiomyomatous hamartoma of the lymph nodes (AMH-LNs) usually develops in the inguinal or femoral lymph nodes. Although its pathologic findings have been well described in the literature, there have been few reports on detailed clinical and imaging features of AMH-LNs. Moreover, most of these reported cases required excisional biopsy to make a precise diagnosis. Herein, we report a case of AMH-LNs with localized lymphedema manifesting as a subcutaneous mass. In this case, we also describe in detail the clinical and imaging findings to help dermatologists establish an accurate diagnosis without unnecessary surgical intervention.

### Thyroid tissue outside the thyroid gland: differential diagnosis and associated diagnostic challenges [^114X7UcR]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

The presence of thyroid tissue outside of the thyroid gland may occur in various clinical settings and anatomic locations and includes both benign and malignant differential diagnoses. Some of these entities include thyroglossal duct cyst, lingual thyroid, parasitic nodule, thyroid tissue within a lymph node and struma ovarii. In routine daily practice, these entities do pose diagnostic challenges for the pathologists. Differential diagnostic considerations depend largely on the location of lesion and the histologic features. A definitive diagnosis may remain unclear in some cases while knowledge is still evolving in others i.e., incidentally detected bland appearing thyroid follicles in a lateral neck lymph node. This article aims to elaborate on the various entities characterized by thyroid tissue outside of the thyroid gland, both benign and malignant, and the relevant differential diagnostic considerations.

### Dermoid cysts on the floor of the mouth [^113wbwyc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors analyzed the clinical features and treatment results of surgical patients with a final diagnosis of dermoid cyst on the floor of the mouth over 14 years at our hospital.

Patients and Methods

A total of 5 patients with a final diagnosis of dermoid cyst of the floor of the mouth from January 2010 to December 2023 were enrolled.

Results

All patients complained of swelling in the submentum or floor of the mouth. The mean tumor size was 4.2 ± 1.0 cm. All patients underwent complete surgical resection. A transcervical approach was performed in 3 patients, and an intraoral approach was implemented in 2 patients. There were no major complications after surgery with either method. The follow-up period was 71.4 ± 75.7 months. There was no disease recurrence during follow-up.

Conclusion

Dermoid cysts rarely occur on the floor of the mouth but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other oral cavity tumors. Dermoid cysts on the floor of the mouth can be safely removed using the current transoral approach without scarring or recurrence.

### Incidental detection of radiotracer uptake in intracranial dermoid cyst on 18F-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET / CT during staging for prostate carcinoma [^1149mp6t]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 68-year-old man underwent 18F-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT for staging of a newly diagnosed prostate adenocarcinoma. Unexpectedly, PET/CT revealed high focal 18F-PSMA brain uptake, which initially was suspected for a brain metastasis. Corresponding CT and MRI scans revealed characteristic imaging features of an intracranial dermoid cyst at this site. This is an exceptional location for a dermoid cyst, which had been followed up conservatively with no substantial changes. This case shows that dermoid cyst should be added to the reported list of benign neoplasms that shows "false-positive" PSMA uptake during evaluation of patients with prostate carcinoma, representing a potential interpretative pitfall.

### Angiomyomatous hamartoma in a postauricular lymph node: a rare entity masquerading as a cyst [^1115Ahmo]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 33-year-old healthy man presented for evaluation of two subcutaneous nodules on his vertex scalp and right side of the postauricular neck. He reported that both lesions arose in adolescence and grew over time. The lesion on the vertex scalp had been excised several years previously but had recently recurred. The postauricular lesion had no prior treatment. Both lesions were asymptomatic without a history of inflammation or fluid drainage. Review of systems was negative. On physical examination, there were a 7-mm, firm, nontender, mobile subcutaneous nodule on the vertex scalp and a 9-mm, firm, nontender, partially mobile subcutaneous nodule on the right postauricular neck, both without overlying punctum or skin discoloration (Fig 1).

Fig 1

The patient underwent excision of both lesions with local anesthesia. Grossly, the excised specimen from the scalp was firm, round, and pearly in color, consistent with a cyst, and histologic evaluation confirmed a diagnosis of pilar cyst. The postauricular neck specimen, however, was irregularly shaped, inelastic, and yellow to violaceous in color. Histopathologic evaluation of this specimen revealed a circumscribed collection of lymphoid tissue surrounding a prominent proliferation of irregularly distributed thick-walled blood vessels and smooth muscle cells within a dense collagenous stroma (Fig 2).

### Thoracic duct cysts: a rare differential diagnosis [^1134UrPv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Cysts of the thoracic duct located in the supraclavicular region are uncommon. To date only 12 cases in this topographic area have been described in the literature. Between 1998 and 2002, 5 patients presented to our department with the primary symptom of a palpable soft left-supracavicular swelling that could be displaced relative to adjacent structures.

Setting

In each case, sonography showed a hypoechogenic, almost echo-free, distinctly outlined polycyclic structure with distal echo enhancement at the junction of the left internal jugular vein and the subclavian vein. All 5 patients underwent surgery, the cysts were extirpated, and the numerous communicating lymph vessels localized and meticulously ligated. Pathohistologic analysis of the milky, yellowish fluid obtained by intraoperative puncture confirmed the initial suspicion of a thoracic duct cyst in all patients.

Conclusion

In the case of left supraclavicular masses, the rare differential diagnosis of a thoracic duct cyst must be considered as a possibility. Sonography as the imaging method of choice is sufficient for primary diagnosis. In addition, a thorax x-ray should be performed in order to exclude an intrathoracic involvement. Surgical extirpation marks the therapy of choice in treating such cysts.

### Lacrimal fossa lesions: a review of 146 cases in Egypt [^111csBB5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

The study included 146 patients of lacrimal fossa lesions. The mean age of patients was 40.43 years, 96 (65.75%) females and 50 (34.25%) males. Sixty-three patients (43.15%) had inflammatory lacrimal gland lesions, 39 (26.71%) had lymphoproliferative lesions, and 32 (21.92%) had epithelial lesions, while 12 (8.22%) had miscellaneous rare lesions (5.48% were dacryops, and 2.74% had hemangioma). Collectively, the study included 105 (71.92%) benign lesions and 41 (28.08%) malignant lesions, which were distributed between 28 (19.18%) malignant lymphoma and 13 (8.9%) malignant epithelial tumors. According to the pathological origin of the lesions, they may be classified into 78.08% (114 patients) nonepithelial lesions and 21.92% (32 patients) epithelial lesions (16.44% epithelial tumors and 5.48% dermoid cysts) (Table 1, Figure 1).

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: a pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^116s1SAb]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma

The vast majority of mucoepidermoid carcinomas arise within the major or minor salivary glands. Primary intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma is an extremely rare tumour constituting less than 2% of all mucoepidermoid carcinomas. It arises centrally within the angle or posterior mandible. Its aetiopathogenesis is not yet completely understood. Due to the paucity of cases reported in the literature, little is known regarding age of presentation and sex distribution. Clinical features include swelling and pain, as well as trismus. Imaging features are unilocular or multilocular, well-defined lesions with sclerotic borders, mimicking a benign cyst, a keratocyst or an ameloblastoma on OPT, CT and CBCT. On MRI, the cystic tumour components display a low signal on T1, a high signal on T2 and no enhancement, whereas the nodular solid tumour components present a low signal on T2 and contrast material enhancement. Extension into the muscles of mastication is common, as well as loco-regional lymph node metastases. MRI essential to narrow the differential diagnosis, as OPT and CT are non-specific. The presence of a destructive, infiltrative pattern with enhancing nodules within the cyst wall, as well as the presence of metastatic lymph nodes strongly suggests a malignant tumour, thus making biopsy mandatory.

### Retinoblastoma and beyond: pediatric orbital mass lesions [^112CKnx9]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dermoids (dermoid cysts) are the most common orbital cystic tumor of childhood, accounting for up to 46% of all childhood orbital tumors. They are choristomas (histologically normal cells occurring in an abnormal location) that arise from ectoderm trapped in bony sutures during embryogenic migration. They consist of keratinized epithelium and adnexal structures such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Epidermoid cysts are similar but lack the adnexal dermal elements and are thought to develop later in embryonic life, after the ectodermal cells become committed to a single cell type. The cysts slowly grow and are usually noticed by the parents during the first year of life as a painless nodule or swelling along the orbital rim but may infrequently arise deeper in the orbit and cause proptosis. Dermoids are characteristically located subcutaneously at the superolateral orbital rim, adjacent to the frontozygomatic suture (Fig. 34), followed by superonasal location. In rare instances they may extend into the orbit (dumbbell-shaped), while other periorbital locations are much less common. Purely intraorbital dermoids are typically found in the superotemporal quadrant (lacrimal fossa). A well-defined, oval or lobulated lesion in the typical location is consistent with dermoid, and imaging is performed when there is any clinical doubt or concern for intraorbital extension. Treatment is surgical en bloc resection.

Fig. 34
Nonenhanced axial CT image in soft tissue window (a) reveals a right periorbital slightly hyperdense oval subcutaneous mass with central hypodensity (arrow). Coronal CT image in bone window (b) reveals that the lateral periorbital swelling is adjacent to the right frontozygomatic suture (arrow) in this patient with dermoid

In contrast to their intracranial counterparts, fat-like high T1 signal/CT hypodensity is not a consistent feature of orbital dermoids (Figs. 34 and 35), although it is very frequent. When present, the high T1 signal will be suppressed with fat saturation and STIR sequences (Fig. 36). There is no contrast enhancement of intact dermoid, while rim calcifications and thin wall enhancement may occasionally be present. Bony remodeling of the orbital wall is a common finding with larger lesions. The cysts are sometimes bilateral.

### Craniofacial epidermoid and dermoid cysts [^115eC4Lv]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Clinical features and surgical considerations of epidermoid and dermoid cysts in the craniofacial region were described according to anatomic location in clinical cases.

Scalp

Because epidermoid and dermoid cysts in the scalp can erode cranial bone, early excision is recommended. Dermoid cysts are usually confined to an extracranial location and can be treated with simple surgical enucleation. However, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be needed to rule out the possibility of intracranial extension. The risk of invasion into deeper structures is variable and depends on the anatomic location. Dermoid cysts located in more lateral areas are rarely associated with intracranial extension, but lesions along the midline of the scalp have a higher potential to extend intracranially.

A 37-year-old man presented at the Outpatient Department of Brong Ahafo Regional Hospital, Sunyani, Ghana, with superficial swelling on the right parietal area of the scalp. The cystic mass was excised en bloc with preservation of the overlying skin (Fig. 1 A, B). Histopathology of the surgical specimen revealed the cyst was lined with thin squamous epithelium and involved no atypical cellular change (Fig. 1 C). The pathologic diagnosis was consistent with an epidermoid cyst.

The approach to treating common (cystic) lymphatic malformations (LMs) has evolved significantly over the last decade due to clinical research and recent developments in molecular biology. Surgery, sclerosing agents, and medical drugs with specific targets for biological therapy have been reported for the management of LMs. We will discuss the importance to standardize the location and imaging characterization of LMs to improve the knowledge about the outcome of the different therapeutic options. Our goal is to help the reader understand the different options for the management of LMs with the balance between risk and benefit for the patients.

### Unusual presentation of angiomyomatous hamartoma in an eight-month-old infant: case report and literature review [^1122LjYt]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation of palpable neck masses may be a diagnostic problem in pediatric patients, with differential diagnosis including congenital, inflammatory, tumoral and traumatic lesions. Ultrasonography is usually a satisfactory method to make a correct pre-operative evaluation of neck masses, although diagnosis is often challenging for the surgeon and the radiologist and sometimes only possible after a histopathological examination of the resected lesion.

Case Presentation

We report an 8-month-old patient with a cervical, anterior midline mass. Ultrasonographic images showed features suggesting a partly cystic lesion, with a preoperative suspect of thyroglossal duct cyst. Histological examination, performed after surgical removal of the mass, led to a diagnosis of lymph node angiomyomatous hamartoma (AH).

Conclusions

AH, a rarely occurring benign lymph node lesion, has been reported in the neck lateral region only twice. This case, presenting as a palpable neck midline mass, is the first reported case occurring in infancy. Although rare, AH should be included in the differential diagnosis of head and neck masses.

### Important radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for the recurrence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after surgical resection [^112dJm73]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

With respect to lymph nodes, several studies have indicated that lymph node metastasis increases the risk of recurrence, which aligns with our findings. However, little attention has been given to whether lymphadenopathy observed on imaging independently increases the risk of recurrence. In our study, lymphadenopathy was determined based on size (short diameter ≥ 1 cm). Therefore, our finding that lymphadenopathy on imaging is an independent risk factor can be partially explained by the hypothesis that the size of metastatic lymph nodes influences prognosis. However, not all enlarged lymph nodes are metastatic; further research through radiologic‒pathologic correlation is needed to determine whether enlarged lymph nodes increase the risk of recurrence regardless of metastasis.

Among the clinical features, history of pancreatitis was identified as a significant factor increasing the risk of recurrence. Previous studies have also reported that pancreatitis is associated with IPMN recurrence, and recent research has shown that the presence of symptoms is linked to an increase in both intra- and extrapancreatic recurrence, which is consistent with our findings. Finally, adjuvant treatment is known to improve survival in patients with invasive IPMN, especially those with metastatic lymph nodes. In our study, it was also found to reduce early postoperative recurrence, which aligns with previous reports.

As mentioned, even noninvasive IPMNs can lead to the development of clinically significant remnant pancreatic lesions after surgical resection. Some studies have even reported cases of extrapancreatic recurrence in patients initially diagnosed with noninvasive IPMN, including IPMN with LGD. However, many patients do not experience recurrence (10-year disease-free survival, 70–78%), and a recent study reported a low recurrence rate for patients with IPMN with LGD (10-year recurrence rate, 3.7%). Therefore, predicting the risk of recurrence for individual IPMN patients and establishing an appropriate surveillance strategy are crucial. Our study results suggest that preoperative imaging not only aids in the differential diagnosis of cysts and the determination of surgical candidates but also has the potential to help predict postoperative prognosis and inform surveillance strategies. For example, extending the follow-up interval after surgical resection in patients without risk factors might be a practical approach, although further research is needed to validate risk factors across multiple institutions and to establish a specific follow-up strategy.

Abstract

As congenital lymphatic malformations, lymphangiomas commonly occur in the neck, tongue, and extremities, whereas scrotum is one of the least frequent sites. For this lymphatic flow disease, lymphoscintigraphy is regarded as a useful imaging method. Herein, in a child with scrotal cysts, scrotal region activity was detected in lymphoscintigraphy, consistent with likely lymphatic disorder. The postsurgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis of lymphangioma.

### Somatic activatingvariants cause isolated lymphatic malformations [^116DjYMG]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

All three individuals with BRAF p. Val600Glu substitutions in our study had similar clinical phenotypes — large, macrocystic lesions of the neck or body that resolved spontaneously or were treated very early in life. Under the surgical staging system for LMs (de Serres staging), these three individuals would be classified as having stage 1 lesions (unilateral and below the hyoid). Stage 1 lesions make up only ∼31% of total LMs in recent studies, suggesting that the LMs with BRAF mutations may represent a milder phenotype than LMs with PIK3CA mutations. Although our cohort of LMs with BRAF mutations (n = 3) is too small for genotype-phenotype correlations, we speculate that there may be enrichment for BRAF mutations in individuals with milder, non-surgical LMs, as genetic diagnosis in most LMs to date has required surgically resected tissue. Additional studies of more LMs with BRAF variants, perhaps using non-invasive diagnostic methods, such as cyst-fluid-based cfDNA, will be needed to provide a more balanced view of the genetic spectrum among LMs. The presence of pathogenic BRAF variants within the cyst fluid of macrocystic LMs is consistent with our previous study identifying pathogenic PIK3CA variants within this compartment. Further studies are needed to assess the relative yield of cyst fluid versus tissue as a diagnostic analyte.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^112TUvrC]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Dermoid and epidermoid cysts

True dermoid cysts (also known as benign cystic teratomas), epidermoid cysts and teratoid cysts represent a spectrum of congenital and acquired cystic malformations sharing the common characteristic of a squamous epithelial lining. Dermoid cysts as a term refers to three histologically distinct processes classified based on whether they are lined with simple squamous epithelium (epidermoid), skin appendages (dermoid) or tissues of other major organs (teratoid). Dermoids and epidermoids arise from dermal elements of the first and second branchial arches. It is important to distinguish dermoid and epidermoid cysts apart from teratoid cysts, as the former harbour a lower risk of malignant degeneration. Although rare within the head and neck, dermoid and epidermoid cysts have a predilection for the oral cavity, specifically the floor of the mouth. Dermoid cysts typically present in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life as a slowly enlarging midline neck mass, which may progress to cause dysphagia, while epidermoid cysts manifest earlier in life, becoming evident in infancy.

On imaging, dermoid and epidermoid cysts can have a similar appearance. Some of the distinguishing features are derived from their unique histological composition. While both behave as cystic lesions on CT and MRI, dermoid cysts will demonstrate the hallmark finding of coalesced globules of fat resembling a "sac of marbles" in a medium (mixture of accessory dermal contents such as sebum and calcification) of low CT attenuation and variable signal on T1-weighted images (Figs. 3 and 4). Epidermoid cysts will distinctively show diffusion restriction on MRI. The relationship of these cystic lesions to the mylohyoid muscle is important in guiding surgical intervention, as cysts superior to the mylohyoid muscle are removed preferably with an intraoral approach, while inferior lesions are excised through an external submandibular approach.

Dermoid cysts

Although rare, together with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), dermoid cysts (DCs) are the most common lesions of the paediatric skull. They result from epithelial sequestration during midline union of the embryonic first and second branchial arches. The generic term "dermoid cysts" comprises three entities: (1) epidermoid cyst (stratified keratinised epithelial lining without skin appendages), (2) true dermoid cyst (stratified keratinised epithelial lining with skin appendages) and (3) teratoma (showing tissues derived from the primitive germ layers). Only about 7% of DCs are found in the head and neck region, mainly in the supraorbital region, followed by the floor of the mouth, nose, orbit and cheek. Common locations of intraosseous DCs include the frontal bone (Fig. 7), maxilla and mandible.

### Angiomyomatous hamartoma of the inguinal lymph nodes with localized lymphedema presenting as a soft subcutaneous mass [^111MEGs4]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old woman without any remarkable medical or family health history was referred to our clinic with a complaint of a right femoral subcutaneous soft mass measuring 10 cm × 10 cm in size (Fig 1). Ultrasonography revealed a subcutaneous mass, including a few hypoechoic lesions in the subcutaneous tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed several swollen lymph nodes in the right inguinal region. Lymph nodes showed homogenous iso-signal intensity on transverse T1-weighted imaging (Fig 2, A) and slightly high heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (Fig 2, B). Transverse fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI (Fig 2, C) and an apparent diffusion coefficient map (Fig 2, D and E) showed slightly swollen lymph nodes surrounded by edema. Excisional biopsy of 1 of the lymph nodes from the mass demonstrated partial replacement of lymph node parenchyma by proliferated thick-walled vessels distributed in the hilum, extending into the lymph node cortex (Fig 3, A and B). Irregularly arranged smooth muscle cells were observed in the dense fibrocollagenous stroma. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the stromal cells were positive for desmin (Fig 3, C). On the basis of these findings, we established a diagnosis of AMH-LNs with localized lymphedema. During the 4-month follow-up period after diagnosis and without any treatment, the mass was not enlarged.

Outcomes were assessed by physical exam and imaging in all patients but three for whom only phone follow-up could be obtained. Follow-up times ranged from 3 months to 78 months, with a mean of 22 months. While an attempt was made to have follow-up clinic appointments between 3 and 6 months, many times this was not achieved and the follow-up times reflect when the patients could be contacted. US was used at all clinical follow-up appointments. Usually a small fibrous scar or nothing can be seen with US in the area of a treated dermoid. CT and MRI were also used for patients with intraosseous extension. If the dermoid recurred during the follow-up time period, the treatment was repeated a second time using identical procedural technique. When recurrent, a dermoid is easily palpable and visible as a cyst by US. When a cyst recurred, a second treatment was scheduled at the next convenient time for the patient. Success was defined as complete clinical and imaging resolution during the follow-up time period. Failure was defined as recurrence of any part of the cyst after two treatments. Any complications were recorded.

### Microcystic lymphatic malformation following a double mastectomy [^112wbsA6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case history

A 59-year-old female presented to dermatology with a reported ten-year history of abdominal blisters, starting several months after a double mastectomy for breast cancer. She had never received chemotherapy or radiation. The blisters were asymptomatic, but occasionally drained blood. She had been prescribed multiple topical steroids and antifungals empirically without any improvement. She had no history of autoimmune diseases. Her history was negative for any temporal associations with any topical or oral medication.

On physical examination, there were small, translucent vesicles primarily on the central abdomen (Fig 1, A). The vesicles did not rupture with light or firm palpation. The dermoscopic evaluation revealed yellow lacunae surrounded by pale septae and vascular structures (Fig 1, B). A skin biopsy demonstrated cystically dilated lymph vessels lined by simple endothelium containing proteinaceous fluid in the superficial dermis, with the dilated vessels impinging on and contained by the epidermis. These findings are consistent with MLM (Fig 1, C).

C, Hematoxylin and eosin stain of a skin biopsy at 20× magnification demonstrating ectatic lymphatic vessels filled with proteinaceous fluid impinging on and enclosed by the lower epidermis.

Six weeks later, she presented to the emergency department with a fever and changes in her skin findings. Her exam revealed grouped pustules with underlying/background erythema at the same locations as her prior translucent vesicles (Fig 2). She was diagnosed with bacterial cellulitis as a complication of MLM, a complication the patient notes having suffered from four years earlier. After five days of treatment with cephalexin 500 mg four times daily and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800–160 mg twice daily, the patient became afebrile and returned to her baseline skin findings.

### Neuroimaging findings in a child with dumbbell-shaped frontosphenoidal dermoid cyst presenting as preseptal cellulitis [^113FxiZ8]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

We report the CT and MRI findings in a 5-year-old girl with histologically proven frontosphenoidal dumbbell-shaped dermoid cyst with sinus tracts in the frontal bone extending to the dura. Although the most common location for dermoid cyst in the head and neck is at the frontosphenoidal region, presentation with a tract extending deep to underlying bone or the intracranium is rare for this location. Complete surgical excision has been widely accepted as the basic treatment for dermoid cyst. However, the relatively extensive nature of such surgical interventions may be associated with serious risks to both visual acuity and cosmesis. From a clinical viewpoint, even if these are rare cases, radiological imaging is crucial for orienting the deeper extension of the lesion for presurgical planning.

### Broad, recurrent nasal dermoid cyst: a challenging task [^112bnVQC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Nasal dermoid sinus cyst is a rare congenital midline anomaly. The embryological origin is different from the dermoid cysts seen in other parts of the face. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts constitute 1% to 3% of all dermoid cysts and 11% to 12% of head and neck dermoid cysts. While most lesions are detected in the first 3 years, in some cases they may not be noticed until later years. Delay in diagnosis increases recurrent infections, airway obstruction and intracranial complications. The authors present a 34-year-old patient with a broad nasal dermoid cyst who had previously undergone external rhinoplasty for a nasal dermoid cyst but relapsed after 5 months.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^113oj3fv]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Tumours of the mediastinum represent a wide diversity of disease state. The location and composition of a mass is critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of mediastinal masses can range from being asymptomatic to producing compressive symptoms. Although many of these masses have similar imaging appearances, clinical history, anatomical position and certain details seen at CT and MRI imaging allow correct diagnosis in many cases.

### Struma ovarii: role of imaging? [^117RcTWV]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging findings in struma ovarii

Struma ovarii is a rare type of mature teratoma, but its imaging features are rather distinct. Whilst immature teratomas are known to be predominantly solid with small foci of fat, mature cystic teratomas or dermoid cysts are known to be predominantly cystic, present as a fat-containing mass and are often associated with calcifications as well as an enhancing nodule-forming soft-tissue component. Diagnosis of uncomplicated teratomas using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is fairly straightforward because both techniques are highly sensitive in the detection of fat within the tumour, presenting as negative attenuation on CT. On MRI, three methods have been used to distinguish the fatty contents of the mature cystic teratoma from those of endometriomas or other haemorrhagic cysts. First, chemical shift artefact in the frequency encoding direction can be used to detect fat and to distinguish fat from haemorrhage. Second, gradient-echo imaging, using an echo time in which fat and water are in opposed phases, can demonstrate fat–water interfaces and mixtures of fat and water. Third, sequences with frequency-selective fat saturation will suppress the high signal of the intralesional fat in teratomas and help distinguish them from haemorrhagic lesions. MR imaging with this latter technique allows accurate differentiation between teratomas and haemorrhagic cysts and is preferable to the other techniques. The key features of a mature teratoma using water-only and fat-only T1 technique and diffusion-weighted imaging are demonstrated in Fig. 1. Of note is the restricted diffusion present in the sebaceous material within the cyst (Fig. 1).

### Radiological review of skull lesions [^113tFScy]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Dermoid cysts are lined by thick squamous epithelium and contain epidermal appendages such as sebaceous glands, sweat glands and hair follicles. They usually present in the first 3 decades of life. These lesions typically involve the midline of the skull near the anterior fontanelle, but may also occur along the posterior and middle cranial fossae.

On CT, dermoids appear as expansile, osteolytic midline lesions with a soft-tissue component extending into the adjacent soft tissues and intracranially. They have attenuation of lipid material because of their sebaceous secretions. Intralesional calcifications can be present.

On MRI, they have a heterogeneous appearance with fatty signal intensity on T1-weighted images, variable signal on T2-weighted images and thick peripheral enhancement after contrast administration (Fig. 14).

Patient 2: Axial bone window (b) and coronal soft tissue window head CT (c) show a dermoid cyst in the left frontal bone involving the outer table (dashed arrows). Patient 3: Axial CT (d) and coronal head CT portray a fat-containing lesion in the left grater wing of the sphenoid (arrowheads)

Treatment of both epidermoid and dermoid cysts is surgical resection; recurrence is uncommon.

### Definition of dermoid cyst-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^115FEN3e]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

dermoid cystListen to pronunciationA type of tumor that contains a cyst filled with tissues that are normally found in the outer layers of the skin, including sweat and oil glands. These may also contain elements of hair and teeth. Dermoid cysts can form anywhere in the body, but they usually form in the ovary, testes, the skin of the head, neck, face, or lower back, or in the central nervous system. Dermoid cysts are benign and tend to grow slowly. They are present at birth but may not be found until later in life. Dermoid cysts are a type of germ cell tumor called a mature teratoma.

### Subcutaneous dermoid cysts… [^111EE72e]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical and pathologic features of 50 subcutaneous dermoid cysts were analyzed. The lesions were usually noted at birth and occurred along lines of embryonic fusion. Forty-one cysts were located in the region of the head, mainly about the eyes; nine were in the neck. Pilar elements were found in all 50 cysts, sebaceous glands in 48, eccrine glands in 18, apocrine glands in 9, keratinizing epithelium in 48, and smooth muscle fibers in 13. Subcutaneous dermoids may be the result of the sequestration of cutaneous tissues along lines of embryonic closure. They should be distinguished from other types of cutaneous and subcutaneous cysts and from the more complex ovarian "dermoids. " The latter are benign cystic teratomas and contain structures not normally found in skin. Brownstein MH, Helwig EB. Subcutaneous Dermoid Cysts. Arch Dermatol. 1973; 107: 237–239.

### Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma treatment-national cancer institute… [^115Wbnoy]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points
- Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph system.
- The two main types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are classic and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.
- Epstein-Barr virus infection and a family history of Hodgkin lymphoma can increase the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph system. The lymph system is part of the immune system. It helps protect the body from infection and disease. The lymph system is made up of:

- **Lymph nodes**: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, mediastinum, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.

Hodgkin lymphoma most commonly forms in the lymph nodes above the diaphragm. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphomais less common than classic Hodgkin lymphoma. It most often occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs as a swollen lymph node in the neck, underarm, or groin. Most children do not have any other signs or symptoms of cancer at diagnosis. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, the cancer cells are shaped like popcorn. Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. The signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma depend on where the cancer forms in the body and the size of the cancer. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has:

- painless, swollen lymph nodes near the collarbone or in the neck, chest, underarm, or groin
- fever for no known reason
- weight loss for no known reason
- drenching night sweats
- fatigue
- anorexia
- itchy skin
- coughing
- trouble breathing, especially when lying down. Stage III In stage III, the cancer is found:

- in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm; or
- in lymph node groups above the diaphragm and in the spleen.
