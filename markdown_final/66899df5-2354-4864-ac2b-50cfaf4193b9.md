## Question

What laboratory tests are indicated for generalized abdominal pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests are indicated for generalized abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should establish a core laboratory panel for stable patients. Next, I'll consider targeted add-on tests based on suspected inflammatory, hepatobiliary, ischemic, or infectious etiologies. After that, I will account for special populations and functional versus organic pain. Finally, I will interpret labs in context, integrate with imaging decisions, and outline disposition and follow-up, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence while I continually verify assumptions against the cited sources.

> Let me first confirm priorities in triage and initial assessment because I need to ensure I am not missing life threats before ordering a broad lab battery. If the patient is unstable with hypotension, tachycardia, or altered mental status, I should initiate resuscitation and obtain targeted stat labs such as CBC, lactate, type and screen, and bedside glucose while moving toward emergent imaging, whereas a stable patient permits a more systematic laboratory workup guided by history, exam, and pain characteristics [^112BidjC]. Wait, let me verify the role of lactate in suspected ischemia and shock; guidelines emphasize early lactate as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion, supporting its inclusion in the unstable scenario [^115BjHzp].

> Next, I should establish the core laboratory panel for most stable adults with generalized abdominal pain to narrow the differential without over-testing. The American Family Physician guidance supports a standardized panel including CBC for leukocytosis or anemia, CRP as a more acute inflammatory marker, electrolytes and creatinine for dehydration or renal impairment, glucose to detect diabetic emergencies, urinalysis for urinary sources, serum lipase for pancreatitis, and pregnancy testing for all patients with the potential for pregnancy, as these results help target subsequent imaging and consultation decisions [^112BidjC]. Hold on, I should confirm that including lipase routinely is justified even when pain is generalized and not purely epigastric; pancreatitis can present with diffuse pain, so maintaining a low threshold for lipase is reasonable in undifferentiated abdominal pain [^112BidjC] [^112BidjC].

> I will now examine pancreatic testing more closely to avoid misinterpretation. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of three criteria: characteristic abdominal pain, serum lipase or amylase at least three times the upper limit of normal, or imaging findings, so an isolated mild lipase elevation does not equal pancreatitis and warrants caution, serial assessment, and clinical correlation [^1154LBGw] [^1112MVtk]. Hmm, wait a minute, persistent hyperlipasemia without a clear diagnosis may reflect non-pancreatic processes or benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, so I should not anchor on a single elevated lipase in the absence of compatible clinical findings [^113hMxVS].

> Let me consider when to add inflammatory and nutritional markers beyond the core panel, because over-ordering can create noise. In patients with a history suggestive of inflammatory or infectious etiologies such as known IBD, prolonged symptoms, or high fevers, I should add ESR as a complement to CRP, and serum albumin or prealbumin to assess nutritional status and inflammatory burden, particularly in emergency presentations of IBD [^114As69P]. I should confirm the role of procalcitonin as a supportive rather than definitive marker in bowel injury or severe intra-abdominal infection; guidelines warn that relying solely on procalcitonin can lead to false reassurance or unnecessary intervention, so it should be interpreted in context with exam and imaging [^112unVQx].

> Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions about organ sources before targeted labs are considered. If hepatobiliary disease is suspected due to right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, or abnormal core labs, I should obtain AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters while favoring ultrasound as the first-line imaging, since this pairing improves specificity and limits radiation as I correlate lab derangements with ductal or parenchymal pathology [^112BidjC] [^115XDdSy] [^1115ZyaN]. I need to ensure I do not miss choledocholithiasis or cholangitis, in which case early recognition via cholestatic pattern and appropriate imaging is crucial to expedite definitive management [^115XDdSy] [^1115ZyaN].

> For patients in whom mesenteric ischemia or severe sepsis is on the table, I should double-check that lactate and, when indicated, an arterial blood gas are obtained early, especially with pain out of proportion to exam, as delayed recognition worsens outcomes and lactate elevation can guide urgency and resuscitation intensity, albeit with imperfect sensitivity [^115BjHzp]. Let me verify that these markers complement, not replace, imaging and clinical assessment; they raise suspicion and help trend response to therapy but do not localize pathology [^112BidjC].

> I need to check indications for an infectious workup, since indiscriminate testing adds little value. When fever, diarrhea, immunosuppression, recent antibiotics, or travel is present, stool cultures and C. difficile testing should be prioritized, with blood cultures obtained if bacteremia is suspected, and CMV PCR considered in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in IBD flares where infection must be excluded before escalation of immunosuppression [^114As69P] [^117NmNr4]. Let me verify that clinical triggers such as jaundice with systemic toxicity and travel may re-focus suspicion toward biliary sepsis and enteric pathogens, serving as a reminder that pattern recognition and analytic reasoning must be balanced in atypical presentations.

> Next, I should review special populations so I do not under or over-test. In children, initial labs mirror adults but with greater emphasis on pregnancy testing in adolescents, CRP or ESR when appendicitis is suspected, and early ultrasound to limit radiation exposure, with lactate obtained if ill-appearing or unstable, aligning with pediatric guidance favoring ultrasound-first strategies for common etiologies including appendicitis and biliary disease [^114RHyy1] [^115iWwmA]. In older or immunocompromised patients, I should maintain a lower threshold to add albumin and selected infection markers given atypical presentations and blunted inflammatory responses, integrating objective data to avoid missed pathology [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture fits functional abdominal pain without red flags; I should avoid over-testing. In clearly functional presentations consistent with Rome IV and without alarm features such as weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, anemia, or GI bleeding, selective testing is appropriate, whereas red flags justify targeted labs like iron studies for anemia, celiac serology for weight loss or malabsorption, and inflammatory markers or fecal calprotectin if IBD is suspected, keeping the testing proportional to pretest probability [^116qok39] [^112BidjC]. I should double-check that my restraint does not delay care; any evolution of alarm features should prompt escalation of testing and imaging [^112QDC5r].

> I will now examine how to interpret labs alongside bedside findings to stratify risk and disposition safely. Multivariate data suggest that the absence of guarding, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and vomiting is associated with a low likelihood of significant intra-abdominal pathology, supporting observation or outpatient management if serial exams and labs remain reassuring, which I should document carefully to justify deferring advanced imaging [^114MmVDy] [^1111Jzaz]. Hold on, I should verify that these are aids, not absolutes; clinical judgment and shared decision-making remain central, with re-evaluation plans mitigating the risk of delayed diagnoses [^113ZqdX9].

> Next, I should review how labs guide imaging modality selection so I do not default to CT unnecessarily. When hepatobiliary involvement is suspected from labs or exam, ultrasound is first-line; when gynecologic pathology is plausible, transvaginal ultrasound is appropriate; for persistent generalized pain with abnormal inflammatory markers or concerning features, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is often appropriate, especially when ultrasound is nondiagnostic, with conditional strategies of CT after negative or inconclusive ultrasound improving sensitivity while limiting radiation [^112TdBTm] [^115XDdSy] [^112EpQGz] [^112BidjC]. I should confirm that negative labs do not rule out surgical disease such as early appendicitis, reinforcing that imaging often provides definitive clarification when pretest probability is not low [^112BidjC] [^111mMYUn].

> I need to ensure complete documentation of results, interpretation, and disposition with clear return precautions, because safe discharge hinges on communication and timely follow-up. For patients discharged after negative or nonactionable labs and reassuring exams, I should provide explicit instructions to return for worsening pain, new fever, vomiting, or syncope and arrange re-evaluation within 24 to 48 hours when symptoms persist, as structured follow-up reduces missed evolving diagnoses in nonspecific abdominal pain [^113ZqdX9] [^111FXtYL]. Let me reconsider whether additional imaging at the initial visit would change outcomes; while imaging can reduce misses, judicious use informed by labs, exam, and risk factors is key to balancing benefit and resource use [^11118GHx].

> Final check and clinical pearl before I conclude: laboratories refine the differential by answering whether there is inflammation or infection and which organ systems are implicated, but many time-sensitive diagnoses still require imaging for confirmation and management planning, so I should use the lab results to guide the right test at the right time rather than as stand-alone arbiters of disease [^112BidjC] [^112TdBTm]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if discordance persists between the clinical picture and laboratory data, I should escalate to imaging or consultation rather than relying on normal labs to reassure prematurely [^112BidjC].

For generalized abdominal pain [^112BidjC], order a **CBC, CMP, lipas**e** [^1154LBGw], **urinalysis, and pregnancy test** (if applicable) as the core labs to screen for infection, inflammation, metabolic derangements, pancreatitis, urinary, and gynecologic causes. Add **CRP/ESR** [^114As69P], **lactate** [^115BjHzp], and **blood cultures if sepsis or ischemia is suspected, and consider LFTs, amylase [^1112MVtk], and stool studies [^114As69P] based on clinical context. These labs help triage severity, guide imaging [^112BidjC], and narrow the differential, but imaging is often required for definitive diagnosis [^112TdBTm].

## Core laboratory tests for generalized abdominal pain

The following laboratory tests are **considered essential** in the initial evaluation of generalized abdominal pain:

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | - Detects infection [^112BidjC], inflammation [^114As69P], anemia, or bleeding |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | - Assesses electrolytes [^112BidjC], renal function [^116BE929], liver enzymes [^114As69P], and metabolic derangements |
| Lipase | - Screens for pancreatitis [^1154LBGw], a common cause of abdominal pain [^112BidjC] |
| Urinalysis | - Identifies urinary tract infections [^112BidjC], hematuria [^1111Jzaz], or renal calculi |
| Pregnancy test (β-hCG) | - Essential in women of reproductive age [^112BidjC] to rule out ectopic pregnancy [^112ftAh3] or other gynecologic causes |

---

## Additional laboratory tests based on clinical suspicion

Depending on the clinical scenario, **additional laboratory tests may be indicated**:

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|
| C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | - Inflammatory markers useful in suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [^114As69P] or systemic inflammation [^116Wjddp] |
| Lactate | - Indicates tissue hypoperfusion or ischemia [^115BjHzp], useful in suspected mesenteric ischemia or sepsis [^112BidjC] |
| Blood cultures | - Recommended if sepsis or systemic infection is suspected |
| Liver function tests (LFTs) | - Useful in suspected hepatic or biliary pathology |
| Amylase | - Additional pancreatic enzyme, though less specific than lipase [^1112MVtk] |
| Stool studies (occult blood, fecal calprotectin, stool cultures) | - Indicated in suspected gastrointestinal bleeding or inflammatory bowel disease [^114As69P] |

## Laboratory tests in special populations

Certain populations require **specific laboratory considerations**:

- **Pediatric patients**: CBC, urinalysis [^115iWwmA], pregnancy test (if applicable), and comprehensive metabolic profile are recommended [^114RHyy1].
- **Elderly patients**: CBC, urinalysis, and metabolic panel are essential due to higher risk of serious pathology [^111kDKdj].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: CBC, urinalysis, and metabolic panel are critical due to atypical presentations and higher risk of infection [^115JAmDF].

---

## Laboratory tests for chronic generalized abdominal pain

In chronic generalized abdominal pain, laboratory testing is **more selective and guided by clinical suspicion** [^114HA7ey]. CBC, ESR, CRP, and fecal calprotectin are useful when inflammatory bowel disease is suspected. Celiac serology, thyroid function tests, and a metabolic panel may be obtained as clinically indicated [^113RCF6L].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Laboratory tests alone **rarely provide a definitive diagnosis** in generalized abdominal pain [^112BidjC]. Clinical judgment, history, physical examination, and imaging are essential to the diagnostic process [^112TdBTm]. Over-reliance on laboratory tests without clinical correlation can lead to diagnostic errors [^113NoZTN] and unnecessary interventions.

---

Laboratory evaluation for generalized abdominal pain should include CBC, CMP, lipase, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing [^112BidjC], with additional tests based on clinical suspicion. These tests help identify serious conditions and guide further diagnostic steps, but **clinical judgment and imaging are essential** for accurate diagnosis and management [^113NoZTN].

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing.

Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^114As69P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically in the context of an emergency laboratory workup, the AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests to assess acute abdomen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):

- **CBC**: Complete blood count.
- **Electrolytes**: Important for evaluating metabolic imbalances.
- **Liver enzymes**: Critical for assessing liver function and potential complications.
- **Inflammatory markers**: Including ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) to determine inflammation levels.
- **Serum albumin and pre-albumin**: Used to assess nutritional status and the degree of inflammation in the patient.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^117NmNr4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected complicated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), various biochemical investigations are required.

- **Diagnosis approach**: In clinical practice, the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) relies on a set of modalities, including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics, rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

- **Laboratory assessments**: For assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests are mandatory. These include a full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin to evaluate nutritional status and the degree of inflammation (QoE moderate B).

- **Infectious causes**: In cases of suspected IBD flare, it is crucial to rule out infectious causes, particularly Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus infections (QoE low C).

- **Recommendation**: We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis activity in urgent clinical situations by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzyme levels; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level when possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by conducting blood cultures, stool cultures, and a toxin test for Clostridium difficile. This is a strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence (1B).

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^111KDfRy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Health care providers are likely to encounter patients with unexplained abdominal pain. Because hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease, it may not be part of the differential diagnosis, especially for patients who do not have concurrent skin swelling in addition to abdominal symptoms. Abdominal pain is very common in patients with HAE, occurring in up to 93% of patients, with recurrent abdominal pain reported in up to 80% of patients. In 49% of HAE attacks with abdominal symptoms, isolated abdominal pain was the only symptom.

Other abdominal symptoms that commonly present in patients with HAE include distension, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 6 to 23 years. Under-recognition of HAE in patients presenting with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms is a key factor contributing to the delay in diagnosis. This increases the likelihood of unnecessary or exploratory surgeries or procedures and the potential risk of related complications.

HAE should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with unexplained abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea who have complete resolution of symptoms between episodes. As highly effective targeted therapies for HAE exist, recognition and diagnosis of HAE in patients presenting with isolated abdominal pain may significantly improve morbidity and mortality for these individuals.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^113ZqdX9]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Subgroup analysis was performed for sex, age, additional radiological imaging on the day of evaluation, the diagnosis of "nonspecific abdominal pain" (NSAP) after initial evaluation (D1 or CD1), and the resident's degree of certainty for the initial clinical diagnosis. Female patients had more strategy changes than male patients (P < 0.05), and patients older than 16 years had significantly more strategy changes than children (P < 0.0001). When patients underwent additional imaging (US and/or CT) on the day of initial evaluation, they had fewer diagnostic changes compared to those who did not (P = 0.0002). This, however, did not lead to a significant change in management (P = 0.106). Patients whose abdominal complaints could not be differentiated and were given the diagnosis of "nonspecific abdominal pain" (NSAP) after initial evaluation (n = 90) had more diagnostic changes at re-evaluation (P = 0.006), irrespective of whether they underwent additional radiological imaging on the day of initial evaluation.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach relying on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis.

Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful; for example, constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction, whereas others are of little value, such as anorexia having little predictive value for appendicitis. The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain.

It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### WSES guidelines on blunt and penetrating bowel injury: diagnosis, investigations, and treatment [^112unVQx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blunt abdominal trauma, specifically in the initial evaluation, the WSES 2022 guidelines recommend considering the use of serum procalcitonin and CRP as supportive biomarkers to help exclude bowel injuries. However, reliance on these markers should be cautious, as it may lead to non-therapeutic laparotomy or missed bowel injury.

### Abdominal pain in special populations [^115JAmDF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation and management of acute abdominal pain in special populations can be challenging for the emergency physician. This article focuses on two specific populations: patients with altered immunologic function and postprocedural patients.

- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Recognition of life-threatening abdominal diseases may be delayed in these patients because of atypical presentations of these conditions.

- **Postprocedural patients**: Evaluation of acute abdominal symptoms requires an understanding of complications from procedures often performed by others.

The unique characteristics of abdominal pain in these two populations, including the specific diseases to consider and how to use appropriate testing to detect life-threatening conditions, are discussed.

### Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women [^112ftAh3]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as noncyclic, intense pain localized to the lower abdomen and/or pelvis, with a duration of less than three months. Signs and symptoms are often nonspecific. The differential diagnosis is broad, based on the patient's age, pregnancy status, and gynecologic vs. nongynecologic etiology.

- **Nongynecologic etiologies**: Include gastrointestinal, urinary, and musculoskeletal conditions. Urgent nongynecologic conditions include appendicitis and pyelonephritis.

- **Urgent gynecologic conditions**: Include ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, adnexal torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Approximately 40% of ectopic pregnancies are misdiagnosed at the presenting visit.

- **Less urgent etiologies**: Include sexually transmitted infections, pelvic floor myofascial pain, dysmenorrhea, and muscle strain. Approximately 15% of untreated chlamydia infections lead to pelvic inflammatory disease.

History and physical examination findings guide laboratory testing. Questions should focus on the type, onset, location, and radiation of pain; timing and duration of symptoms; aggravating and relieving factors; and associated symptoms. Performing a urine pregnancy test or beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an important first step for sexually active, premenopausal patients.

Imaging options should be considered, with transvaginal ultrasonography first, followed by computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be useful if ultrasonography and computed tomography are nondiagnostic.

### The NSW pathology atlas of variation: Part I-identifying emergency departments with outlying laboratory test-ordering practices [^116TPcPJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The study objective was to investigate emergency departments (EDs) with outlying laboratory ordering practices for patients presenting with undifferentiated abdominal pain and chest pain. Abdominal pain and chest pain are leading reasons for ED presentations, and laboratory tests are frequently ordered to aid the diagnostic process.

Methods involved a retrospective observational study of 519,597 patients who presented with abdominal or chest pain at 44 major hospital EDs across New South Wales, Australia, from January 2017 to September 2018. For each condition, the risk-adjusted rate of ordering at least one laboratory test and each of the top 15 ordered tests was evaluated. Funnel plots were used to illustrate variations in test ordering and identify EDs with outlying test-ordering practices. EDs exceeding the 99.8% funnel control limits were regarded as outliers.

The results indicated that, from 3,360,152 unplanned presentations, abdominal pain and chest pain represented 8.8% (n = 296,809) and 6.6% (n = 222,788) of all cases, respectively. No major outliers were observed for ordering at least one laboratory test; however, variations were noted for individual tests. For abdominal pain, the top three tests with the highest ordering variation were glucose (20 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (10 outliers), and calcium-magnesium-phosphate (7 outliers). For chest pain, the top three tests with the highest ordering variation were glucose (21 outlier EDs), C-reactive protein (17 outliers), and liver function tests (14 outliers).

The study concludes that identifying EDs with outlying laboratory test-ordering practices is essential for optimizing patient care and resource utilization.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonlocalized abdominal pain [^112TdBTm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intra-abdominal abscess, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis in patients with nonlocalized abdominal pain not otherwise specified. Obtain a CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast in patients unable to receive IV contrast. Consider obtaining an MRI as another imaging modality to provide clinically useful information in this clinical setting.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^1132RVti]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Given the rising prevalence of cannabis use in youth, cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) should be included in the differential diagnosis. When a patient presents with symptoms of acute pancreatitis, especially if no clear etiology emerges from initial investigations, a lipase level assessment is recommended. A comprehensive history of cannabis use should be obtained, incorporating details on consumption patterns in the days and weeks prior to acute pancreatitis and the method of consumption.

### Multi-detector computed tomography of acute abdomen [^116w2ht4]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common causes for referrals to the emergency department. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain characterizing the "acute abdomen" requires rapid and accurate identification of a potentially life-threatening abdominal pathology to ensure timely referral to the appropriate physician. While physical examinations and laboratory investigations are often non-specific, computed tomography (CT) has evolved as the first-line imaging modality for patients with an acute abdomen. The new multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner generations provide increased speed, greater volume coverage, and thinner slices, which have led to a rapid increase in the acceptance of CT for abdominal imaging. This article discusses the role of MDCT in the diagnostic work-up of acute abdominal pain.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP — pain with cramping characteristics — generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction.

To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is the exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations, conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin.

For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation.

### Clinical policy: Critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute blunt trauma [^111F9wy5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blunt abdominal trauma, particularly during the initial evaluation, the ACEP 2024 guidelines recommend using clinical judgment and hospital-specific protocols to decide between selective CT and whole-body CT in hemodynamically stable adult patients with blunt trauma.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging, as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed, treated symptomatically, or if this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide, and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit.

We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Man with epigastric pain and persistently elevated serum lipase [^113hMxVS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain for investigation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymemia is not specific to acute pancreatitis, as it can occur in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. Where persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs in the absence of a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before a diagnosis of benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia can be made.

We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated, but no pancreatic disease was detected. He is asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### The management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^1155sUBW]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend excluding other causes of the symptoms in patients presenting with severe abdominal pain or pyrexia. It is advised to consult with clinicians experienced in the management of OHSS for such cases.

### Paediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction: Evidence and consensus-based recommendations from an ESPGHAN-led expert group [^113RCF6L]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the ESPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction:

- **CBC**: Complete blood count should be assessed to determine any hematological abnormalities.
- **Electrolytes and renal function tests**: These are crucial for evaluating electrolyte imbalances and kidney function.
- **LFTs and albumin**: Liver function tests and albumin levels should be checked to assess liver health.
- **Inflammatory indices (ESR and CRP)**: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein can indicate inflammation.
- **Celiac serology**: Testing for celiac disease should be included in the workup.
- **Fasting cortisol**: This test can help evaluate adrenal function.
- **Thyroid function tests**: To assess thyroid health, thyroid function tests should be included.
- **Basic metabolic panel**: This panel should include tests for ammonia, lactate, and urinary organic acids to evaluate metabolic status.

Chronic abdominal pain is a common problem seen by pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists alike. There should not be evidence of underlying organic pathology, with diagnosis based upon the Rome IV criteria. Although it frequently occurs, routine diagnostic testing is not always necessary. Providing assurance and helpful coping strategies is key in the management of chronic abdominal pain. Sometimes other expertise is needed when developing these strategies.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

When evaluating functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) in primary care, the first step is to rule out "red flags" (alarm signals) of structural organic disease that necessitate referral to a specialist.

- **Ruling out organic pathology**: When a patient first presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, it is crucial to exclude potentially serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease are summarized in a dedicated table (not included). Patients presenting with any indicators of organic disease require referral to a specialist for further investigation.

- **Investigations and diagnosis**: A detailed evaluation of family history, medication, characteristics of pain, and eating/bowel habits should be undertaken in all patients presenting to primary care with FACP symptoms. In selected cases, and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be appropriate. Abdominal ultrasound investigations may be helpful.

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis.

- **Psoas sign**: An irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, which is a classic finding of acute appendicitis. It can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient lying on their left side.

- **Rovsing's sign**: Observed in acute appendicitis when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant.

Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Figure 1: Acute appendicitis management.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood cell count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis. A urine analysis would also be conducted.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^112Jwsgd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

After applying exclusion criteria, we analyzed 23,364 emergency department visits for abdominal pain, which, after weighting, represented an estimated 123,022,141 visits nationally across 13 years (mean 9.46 million visits per year). The number of visits increased significantly for the age groups 18–45 (p < 0.001), 46–64 (p < 0.001), and 65+ (p = 0.049) from 2007 to 2019 (Figure 1A). The percentage of visits with a primary reason for visit (RFV) of abdominal pain trended from 9.4% in 2007 to 11.6% in 2019 for ages 18–45, and from 7.8% to 9.0% for ages 46–64. For those aged 65 and over, the percentage increased from 6.0% to 6.5%.

### Why is there variation in test ordering practices for patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain? A qualitative study [^114b2r2B]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Up to one-third of laboratory tests ordered in the ED for adults presenting with undifferentiated chest pain are generally not indicated by Australian guidelines. This study set out to undertake a qualitative investigation of clinician perceptions to identify the reasons for variations in pathology requesting.

- **Methods**: For this study, we draw on data from semistructured interviews (n = 38) conducted in the EDs and laboratories across three hospitals as part of a larger study on the test result management process from test request to result follow-up. Thematic analysis was conducted to determine what aspects of the clinical routines and environment might contribute to variations in pathology requesting. Informed by the findings from the analysis, targeted questions were developed, and further focus groups (n = 5) were held with clinicians, hospital management, and electronic medical record (eMR) analysts to investigate in more detail the reasons for requesting outside of guidelines.

- **Results**: Participants cited four main reasons for ordering outside of guidelines. Clinicians requested tests outside of guidelines and the ED scope of practice to facilitate the patient journey along the broader continuum of care, including admission to hospital or transfer to another site. Clinicians were also faced with multiple and inconsistent guidelines regarding appropriate test selection. Limited access to in-house specialty and diagnostic services also influenced ordering patterns in smaller non-referral hospitals. Finally, certain features of the electronic ordering systems contributed to this variation.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^115iWwmA]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for approximately 9% of childhood primary care office visits. Symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of a surgical cause for pain include fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, voluntary guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. The age of the child can help focus the differential diagnosis.

- **Infants and toddlers**: Clinicians should consider congenital anomalies and other causes, including malrotation, hernias, Meckel diverticulum, or intussusception.
- **School-aged children**: Constipation and infectious causes of pain, such as gastroenteritis, colitis, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections, are more common.
- **Female adolescents**: Clinicians should consider pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion.

Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test. Abdominal radiography can be used to diagnose constipation or obstruction. Ultrasonography is the initial choice in children for the diagnosis of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian or testicular torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy-related pathology, and appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery, with a peak incidence during adolescence. When the appendix is not clearly visible on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

### Is it possible to predict the severity of acute appendicitis? Reliability of predictive models based on easily available blood variables [^116LLzmF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for emergency surgical admission. In the past, a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, often but not always associated with laboratory confirmation (such as leucocytosis), led to a surgical operation of appendicectomy. Consequently, the rate of negative appendicectomies, where macroscopic or pathologic examination did not find any sign of inflammation, was quite high. The advent of laparoscopy, with its diagnostic capabilities, was expected to reduce the rate of negative appendicectomies, but this has never been definitively proven.

In some cases, symptoms suggesting acute appendicitis are due to other diseases such as tubo-ovarian inflammation, ectopic pregnancy, active ileitis, colitis, or simply mesenteric adenopathy. Even laparoscopic exploration can sometimes fail to find the cause of right iliac fossa pain. Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute pain in the right iliac fossa are not always consistent, indicating areas for further discussion. Laparoscopic exploration is now considered the gold standard for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

While the indication for appendicectomy is straightforward in cases of macroscopically confirmed acute appendicitis, it has been suggested not to remove the appendix if another possible cause for pain is detected and possibly treated. The issue remains in those cases where abdominal exploration does not reveal any abnormality in a patient with clear symptoms of appendicitis.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^114MmVDy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common cause for emergency admission. While some patients have serious abdominal pathology, a significant group of those patients have no specific cause for the pain. This study was conducted to identify those who have non-specific abdominal pain who can be either admitted short term for observation or reassured and discharged for outpatient management.

- **Patients and methods**: A prospective documentation of clinical and laboratory data was obtained on a consecutive cohort of 286 patients admitted to a surgical unit over a nine-month period with symptoms of abdominal pain regarded as severe enough for full assessment in the casualty department and admission to a surgical ward. The patients were followed until a definite diagnosis was made or the patient's condition and abdominal pain improved and the patient was discharged. The hospital where the study took place is a small peripheral general hospital serving a population of 120,000 people in a rural area in New Zealand.

- **Results**: There were 286 admissions to the emergency department. Logistic regression multivariate statistical analysis showed that guarding, raised white cell count, tachycardia, and vomiting were the only variables associated with significant pathology.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with no vomiting, no guarding, who have normal pulse rates and normal white cell counts are unlikely to have significant pathology requiring further active intervention, either medical or surgical.

### Non-specific abdominal pain, an inconclusive CT scan and an unusual and puzzling finding at exploratory laparotomy [^1116MnqC]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 71-year-old man presented to our hospital with generalized abdominal pain. Initial laboratory investigations were normal, and an abdominal CT scan was inconclusive. The following day, persisting pain, generalized tenderness, and hemodynamic instability prompted exploratory laparotomy. At laparotomy, two perforations of the proximal jejunum were identified, caused by two 3 cm pieces of wood. The pieces of wood were retrieved, and the perforations were repaired primarily.

The postoperative period was complicated by acute confusion, but the patient went on to make a full recovery. On direct questioning, the patient was unable to explain the presence of wood within his gastrointestinal tract. One hypothesis was that he may have ingested this material during a period of acute confusion following an elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 8 years previously.

### Characteristics, interventions, and outcomes for patients presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain [^116yiDtg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We sought to characterize patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with abdominal pain and to validate risk categories defined by the Guidelines for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-2) for low-risk reAbdominal pain. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting with abdominal pain between November 2019 and November 2023 across 21 EDs in Arizona, the Midwest, and Florida. Patients were categorized per GRACE-2 into reAnd non-rePain as well as low- and high-risk groups. Primary outcomes included 72-hour returns and mortality at 30 and 90 days.

The study included 162,494 visits (112,896 unique patients; median age 46 years; 61.2% female). Among these, 4.3% had low-risk reAbdominal pain. Patients with reAnd non-reLow-risk pain had similar ED length of stay and discharge rates to each other, compared to patients with high-risk pain who had longer length of stay and lower discharge rates. At 30 days after the ED encounter, patients with low-risk reAbdominal pain had similar mortality to patients with low-risk non-rePain (0.4% vs. 0.3%; adjusted RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.85–2.03), while they had significantly lower mortality than patients with high-risk reAbdominal pain (0.4% vs. 2.3%; adjusted RR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.02–4.89).

This study highlights the heterogeneity in patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain. Among these patients, those with low-risk rePain demonstrated similar lengths of stay and discharge rates compared to those with high-risk reAbdominal pain.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^114X4gDa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

EGS conditions are a useful measure of test positivity because they are captured in administrative data sets, are concrete diagnoses with clinical significance, typically require intervention, and frequently lead to morbidity or mortality. As new medical and procedural options have evolved, EGS diagnoses no longer exclusively lead to surgery. EGS conditions typically require operative or nonoperative management, which can include antibiotics, analgesia, inpatient medical or surgical management, interventional procedures, and/or surgery.

Although we interpreted our test positivity as a CT scan leading to a diagnosis, NHAMCS does not observe the timing at which the diagnosis is made. There are three potential cases for timing. Given the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans for common EGS diagnoses, diagnosis decision making based on CT scans is likely the most common scenario. In some cases, the diagnosis may be strongly suspected based on clinical signs and symptoms, with CT merely confirming a diagnosis. In others, CT could be obtained anticipating negative imaging to rule out a high-risk diagnosis. This latter use case is unlikely to vary over time, however.

There appeared to be a visual increase in EGS diagnoses in the later period. While increased CT and ultrasound utilization seems to account for a substantial portion of this rise, as shown by the individual imaging time trends, an additional potential explanation includes imaging being conducted on those with a higher probability of disease. This could arise due to improved clinical targeting of patients at risk.

### Diverticular disease: Rapid evidence review [^116Wjddp]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis should be suspected in patients with isolated left lower quadrant pain, abdominal distention or rigidity, fever, and leukocytosis. Initial laboratory workup includes a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and C-reactive protein measurement. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is the preferred imaging modality if needed to confirm diagnosis and assess for complications of diverticulitis.

Treatment decisions are based on the categorization of disease as complicated vs. uncomplicated. Selected patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis may be treated without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis is treated in the hospital with a modified diet or bowel rest, antibiotics, and pain control. Abscesses that are 3 cm or larger should be treated with percutaneous drainage. Emergent surgery is reserved for when percutaneous drainage fails or the patient's clinical condition worsens despite adequate therapy. Colonoscopy should not be performed during the flare-up but should be considered six weeks after resolution of symptoms in patients with complicated diverticulitis who have not had a high-quality colonoscopy in the past year.

Diverticulitis prevention measures include consuming a vegetarian diet or high-quality diet (high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes), limiting red meat and sweets, achieving or maintaining a body mass index of 18 to 25 kg per m², being physically active, and avoiding tobacco and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Partial colectomy is not routinely recommended for diverticulitis prevention.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^115BjHzp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination. A full panel of blood tests, including blood gas and lactate levels, is also important to look for indications of bowel ischemia. The strength of this recommendation is strong but based on low or very-low-quality evidence (Grade 1C).

Symptoms of sigmoid volvulus include abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting (a late sign). In 30–41% of cases, patients report previous episodes of abdominal distention. This symptom triad is much more common in endemic volvulus compared to the sporadic kind (88% versus 33%).

In "volvulus belt" countries, the clinical presentation may be acute with peritonitis and shock. In such fulminant cases, prognosis is poor due to potential colonic necrosis and perforation by the time the patient seeks care. Conversely, in Western countries, patients typically present 3 to 4 days after symptom onset. The classic patient is elderly, institutionalized, and on psychotropic medications that cause chronic constipation. The history should highlight these risk factors, including a personal history of previous sigmoid volvulus, which is present in 30–40% of cases.

Classically, clinical examination reveals abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds, and often an empty rectum on digital examination. However, the examination is often challenging due to the presence of abdominal distension caused by colonic obstruction.

### Common questions about the evaluation of acute pelvic pain [^1136Hdzq]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as lower abdominal or pelvic pain of less than three months' duration. It is a common presentation in primary care. Evaluation can be challenging due to a broad differential diagnosis and many associated nonspecific signs and symptoms. The most common diagnoses in reproductive-aged women with acute pelvic pain include idiopathic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute appendicitis, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, and endometriosis. Among postmenopausal women, cancer must be considered.

Findings from the history and physical examination can indicate likely diagnoses; laboratory testing and imaging can help confirm them. Women of reproductive age should take a pregnancy test. In early pregnancy, transvaginal ultrasonography and beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels can help identify ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. For nonpregnant women, ultrasonography or computed tomography is indicated, depending on the possible diagnosis (e.g. ultrasonography is preferred when ovarian pathology is suspected). If ultrasonography results are nondiagnostic, magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful, especially in pregnant women when acute appendicitis is suspected. If magnetic resonance imaging is unavailable, computed tomography may be indicated.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111svvmD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Unlike CT, hepatobiliary ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation. It represents a potentially effective diagnostic modality for upper abdominal pain or other symptoms suggesting a hepatobiliary origin. In contrast to either modality, abdominal X‐rays are poorly sensitive and poorly specific for clinically significant disease and are potentially misleading.

Prior literature has demonstrated that the utilization of imaging modalities increased as they have become more available. The rate of abdominal CT scans for all indications increased 17.5‐fold from 1990 to 2009. Additionally, abdominal pain grew to become the leading chief complaint among those who underwent a CT scan in United States EDs from 1995 to 2007. The probability of obtaining a specific diagnosis via CT scan increases with age; yet for older adults with abdominal pain, nearly one in six ED visits has been shown to receive an X‐ray without ultrasound or CT, a potentially ineffective test in older adults, and this occurs more often for older women. Little evidence is available from the past decade to understand whether the rapid initial growth of these modalities used to assess abdominal pain has continued, whether changes in utilization are differential across age groups, and whether increased imaging rates have resulted in greater rates of clinically significant diagnoses.

We hypothesized prior to the time of writing that a continuous increase in CT and ultrasound imaging modalities and a decrease in X‐ray use occurred from 2007 to 2019. To test these hypotheses, we used nationally representative ED data to describe trends.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If a patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in those where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are twofold:

- **Converted-to-open cases**: These have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy.

- **Management of common pathologies**: Many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^116oZzjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Early diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment result in accurate, prompt, and efficient management of acute abdominal pain. This technique reduces the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and right iliac fossa gridiron incisions and increases diagnostic accuracy in these patients; however, this approach is expensive with significant use of resources and potential morbidity. Diagnostic laparoscopy also avoids extensive preoperative investigations and averts delays in operative management. Morino et al. assessed the role of diagnostic laparoscopy and concluded that, compared with clinical observation, early laparoscopy did not show a clear benefit in women with non-specific abdominal pain. They reported a higher number of diagnoses and a shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopy group.

In another study, patients who have no evidence of guarding, normal temperature, and normal white cell count were observed; a practice that has been proven to reduce the rate of negative appendectomy. Non-specific abdominal pain is the most common diagnosis in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain, accounting for 25–35% of all patients, and only a quarter of those patients need surgical intervention. Clinical scores that were developed to recognize acute appendicitis are useful, but these scores should only be used with clinical judgment. If there is any suspicion of serious pathology, the patient should undergo diagnostic laparoscopy.

The study shows that the likely groups of patients with non-specific abdominal pain are those with normal white cell count, no history of vomiting, and absent signs of guarding.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^1168bZoS]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Eligible patients gave written informed consent before inclusion. A flow chart of the study protocol was completed for all 1021 patients. Included patients had a medical history, physical examination, and initial laboratory investigations. A diagnosis based on clinical evaluation and laboratory investigation was recorded.

- **Diagnostic protocol and observer experience**: Thereafter, patients were investigated with a full structured imaging protocol, including upright chest and supine abdominal plain radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and CT. After the physician in the emergency department assessed the plain radiographs, a new diagnosis was recorded. Ultrasonography and CT were each read without disclosure of any results of the other investigation, but clinical information was available to the readers of ultrasonography and CT. The reader recorded the radiological diagnosis from the same list of diagnoses that was used by the physicians in the emergency department.

A general survey of the abdomen was done with ultrasonography, using the graded compression technique. CT images were obtained from the diaphragm to the groins. CT protocols were based on the following protocol: effective mAs level of 165, 120 kV, maximum 2.5 mm collimation, maximum 3 mm slice width, and 0.5 s rotation time, with injection of 125 mL intravenous contrast following a 60-second delay with 3 ml/s; no oral or rectal contrast agents were used. CT done after office hours was re-evaluated blindly the next day by a radiologist.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a very common presentation in the emergency department. It is vital that the physician understands and is familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost-effectiveness, it would be beneficial to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra-abdominal pathology, thereby encouraging early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, and most do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis and show no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history, physical examination, initial imaging, and laboratory findings helps determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1136EALE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

There were 286 patients over the three-month period of the study, with 201 (70%) being female. The median age was 37 years. Non-specific abdominal pain was the diagnosis in 98 patients (34% of total). Of these, 72 (73%) were females. This non-specific nature of the pain was resolved either clinically or through diagnostic laparoscopy. None of the patients with non-specific pain exhibited guarding or vomiting, and only five had a raised white cell count. A non-surgical cause was identified in 47 patients.

- **Surgical and non-surgical causes of pain**: Univariate analysis revealed that important factors predicting acute surgical pathology included guarding (p < 0.0001), raised white blood cell count (WBC) (p < 0.0001), tachycardia (pulse rate greater than 100 per minute) (p < 0.0001), temperature (p < 0.0001), rigors (p = 0.0008), lack of appetite (p < 0.0001), and vomiting (p < 0.0001).

- **Multivariate analysis**: conducted using logistic regression, indicated that the only significant predictors for an acute surgical diagnosis were heart rate (p = 0.048), guarding (p = 0.0009), WBC (p = 0.016), and vomiting (p = 0.008).

### Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women [^112mvivj]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of pelvic pain in women can be challenging because many symptoms and signs are insensitive and nonspecific. As the first priority, urgent life-threatening conditions (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, ruptured ovarian cyst) and fertility-threatening conditions (e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion) must be considered. A careful history focusing on pain characteristics, review of systems, and gynecologic, sexual, and social history, in addition to a physical examination helps narrow the differential diagnosis. The most common urgent causes of pelvic pain are pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian cyst, and appendicitis; however, many other diagnoses in the differential may mimic these conditions, and imaging is often needed. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be the initial imaging test because of its sensitivities across most etiologies and its lack of radiation exposure. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for pelvic inflammatory disease when other etiologies are ruled out, because the presentation is variable and the prevalence is high. Multiple studies have shown that 20 to 50 percent of women presenting with pelvic pain have pelvic inflammatory disease. Adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women require unique considerations.

### Episodic abdominal pain — an unexpected cause for a common clinical problem [^1118jyLJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 55-year-old male patient presented repeatedly to the emergency department with severe episodic periumbilical abdominal pain. After an extensive diagnostic work-up and subsequent clinical deterioration, appendiceal diverticulitis was diagnosed. We identified a correlation of white blood cell counts and possibly fecal calprotectin with the clinical presentation. We suggest that appendiceal diverticulitis should be considered in middle-aged patients with episodes of abdominal pain that correlate with laboratory markers of inflammation.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and ensuring efficient patient throughput. Decision-making based solely on clinical and laboratory evaluation can result in unnecessary interventions or delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, particularly ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), can assist in clinical decision-making. Imaging has been shown to have positive effects on the accuracy of clinical diagnoses, lead to changes in management decisions, and increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in these patients has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has contributed to increasing hospital costs, with CT being a growing source of radiation exposure in adult patients. This calls for a rational and evidence-based approach to imaging for patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology provides guidelines for imaging based on the specific location of abdominal tenderness. However, such patient-tailored guidelines may not adequately cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy would lead to the timely identification of urgent conditions in patients with abdominal pain.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: Missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. It is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The Emergency Medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation, including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination are necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113z6sUS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Whether outcomes for abdominal pain patients have changed with additional imaging requires additional study using data sets other than NHAMCS, which does not record outcomes after the ED visit and any subsequent hospitalization. For pulmonary embolisms, increased use of CT angiography yielded additional diagnoses, but those diagnoses were less severe and of unclear clinical significance. The impact of additional diagnoses on population health depends on the natural history of untreated compared to treated disease. For instance, patients with small gallstones diagnosed by CT or ultrasound might be over-intervened upon once diagnosed, perpetuating overutilization of health care, whereas early appendicitis diagnoses allow for successful antibiotic treatment or laparoscopic surgery before a perforation can occur.

The distribution of diagnosis categories within EGS conditions varied across age groups. Appendicitis was a top 10 diagnosis for all age groups, contrary to clinical guidelines that suggest it is more prevalent at younger ages, although in absolute terms, it remains more common at younger ages. Colitis was in the top 10 diagnoses for younger adults but not for older ages; these acute colitis diagnoses may represent overdiagnosis, where viral or other benign infectious or inflammatory causes of colitis are being uncovered by CT, resulting in potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Biliary disease, primarily calculi and cholecystitis, were prevalent in all ages, but ultrasound — a methodology well suited to these diagnoses — was used approximately twice as much in young demographics.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113T9h7b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination, or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm³ (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dL, MCV 75 µm³, platelet count 88,000/mm³, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/L, AST 334 U/L, ALT 133 U/L, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dL, albumin 2.3 g/dL, and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium, and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field, and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: 50 years on [^11752d88]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Emergency Department (ED) patients with abdominal pain continue to represent a diagnostic challenge. This study of demographics, evaluation, and outcomes provides a look at stability and change over a 50-year span at a single institution.

- **Methods**: The study is the fourth version of this exercise, marking the 50th anniversary of the first examination. The charts of 1,000 adult patients presenting to a tertiary care ED in 2022 with a chief complaint of abdominal pain were reviewed. Data extracted included demographics, diagnosis, disposition, and use of imaging and laboratory testing. Where possible, comparison between this study and the previous studies was performed.

- **Results**: The results demonstrated considerably increased use of computed tomography (CT) (+69%) and ultrasound (+32%) and a reduction in abdominal radiographs (-68%) over the past 15 years. Prolonged evaluation time, length of stay, and higher charges accompanied this pattern of increased imaging. Notable findings included continued low frequency of missed surgical illness relative to 1972, but minimal change in the number of patients (~29%) hospitalized.

- **Conclusions**: Over a 50-year span, ED evaluation of abdominal pain has become more effective at diagnosing acute surgical illness, but less efficient and more costly. The percentage of patients hospitalized has been remarkably stable.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1112MVtk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis**: Severe acute pancreatitis is identified through several criteria. Key questions arise regarding the criteria necessary for diagnosis, the appropriate imaging work-up in suspected cases, and the roles of MRI, CT scans, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests. The diagnostic process involves evaluating laboratory parameters and understanding how different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup. Risk assessment scores and the timing for follow-up imaging are also crucial in the diagnosis.

- **Severity grading**: Severe acute pancreatitis is linked to persistent organ failure, which may include cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal failure, and is associated with a high mortality rate. The Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity offer similar frameworks for diagnosis and severity assessment. Patients with persistent organ failure and infected necrosis face the highest risk of death and should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

- **Discussion**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and the histological destruction of acinar cells. To diagnose AP, at least two of the following three criteria must be present: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease; (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis, such as serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain without vomiting, guarding, or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology and can be considered for early discharge back to the community. An abnormal liver function test can indicate the possibility of biliary colic, and microscopic hematuria may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common in emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illnesses without a clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with pain in that area. However, high white blood cell counts and a left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. Indeed, for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, the most common diagnosis with an elevated white blood cell count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease. Patients with pelvic inflammatory disease tend to have raised white cell counts and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make clinical differentiation between the two diagnoses difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and commonly, patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging, such as ultrasound, is helpful.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is necessary to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article discusses some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain, and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most suitable imaging study.

- **Right upper quadrant pain**: Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain.

- **Right or left lower quadrant pain**: Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain.

- **Limited value of conventional radiography**: Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in assessing most patients with abdominal pain.

The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT, and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### WSES guidelines on blunt and penetrating bowel injury: Diagnosis, investigations, and treatment [^111LhvXb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blunt abdominal trauma, specifically concerning the initial evaluation, the WSES 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a primary survey and conducting an eFAST. This should be followed by performing a physical examination, acquiring a secondary survey, conducting blood chemistry tests, and checking vital signs. Finally, a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT is advised for awake and oriented patients with blunt abdominal trauma.

### Laboratory tests in the patient with abdominal pain [^116BE929]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^11118GHx]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

To identify an optimal imaging strategy for the accurate detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain, a fully paired multicentre diagnostic accuracy study was conducted with prospective data collection. The study was set in the emergency departments of two university hospitals and four large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 1021 patients with non-traumatic abdominal pain of more than two hours and less than five days' duration participated. Exclusion criteria included discharge from the emergency department with no imaging considered warranted by the treating physician, pregnancy, and haemorrhagic shock.

All patients underwent plain radiographs (upright chest and supine abdominal), ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) following clinical and laboratory examination. A panel of experienced physicians assigned a final diagnosis after six months, categorizing the condition as urgent or non-urgent. The main outcome measures included sensitivity and specificity for urgent conditions, the percentage of missed cases and false positives, and exposure to radiation for single imaging strategies, conditional imaging strategies (CT after initial ultrasonography), and strategies driven by body mass index and age or by location of pain.

Out of the participants, 661 (65%) were given a final diagnosis classified as urgent. The initial clinical diagnosis resulted in a high number of false positive urgent diagnoses, which were significantly reduced following ultrasonography or CT. CT detected more urgent diagnoses than ultrasonography, with sensitivity at 89% (95% confidence interval, 87% to 92%) for CT and 70% (67% to 74%) for ultrasonography.

### Acute abdominal pain in children: Evaluation and management [^114RHyy1]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in clinic and emergency department settings, accounting for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, varies by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited.

- **Symptoms and signs**: Indications for referral for surgery include severe and localized pain that increases in intensity, pain preceding vomiting, bilious vomiting, hematochezia, guarding, and rigidity.
- **Physical examination findings**: Suggestive signs of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness.
- **Initial laboratory evaluation**: This may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile.
- **Imaging**: Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, is the preferred initial imaging modality for evaluating acute abdominal pain in children due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation.

In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can aid in evaluation.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^112EpQGz]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: In this study, relying on the clinical diagnosis would have led to a high number of false positive urgent diagnoses, whereas the use of ultrasonography as the only imaging investigation would have given an unacceptably high number of missed urgent conditions. In comparison, computed tomography (CT) after clinical evaluation had better accuracy. The use of CT conditional on a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result had the highest sensitivity for urgent conditions and would result in the lowest overall exposure to radiation. Use of imaging driven by patients' characteristics or location of pain would have led to a loss in accuracy compared with the conditional CT strategy.

- **Potential limitations**: We acknowledge several potential limitations of this analysis. The study design, with its full diagnostic investigation in all enrolled patients, carefully collected data, and a diagnosis assigned after each step, allowed us to make the comparisons presented here without doing a randomized clinical trial with 11 groups. Our approach allowed a comparison of imaging strategies but no direct evaluation of the effects of imaging on patients' management and outcome. In this study, management after completion of the diagnostic protocol was always based on the result of all diagnostic tests.

This study had a pre-imaging selection of patients, which should be kept in mind when attempting to generalize the results. Most patients were referred to the emergency department by general practitioners, and patients discharged from the emergency department without imaging were not included in this analysis.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113voqZd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

A potential explanation for the observed increase in imaging is that ED clinicians utilize their expertise to sort patients into a continuum of risk of clinically significant, intervenable intra-abdominal diagnoses, and then respond to increasing availability of CT over this period by lowering the testing threshold to include patients at a lower but still clinically meaningful risk of making such a diagnosis on CT. For example, in the case of renal colic, consensus recommendations from multiple specialty experts favor imaging as presentations become higher risk and as symptoms become less typical and the risk of diagnoses other than kidney stones becomes more likely. If this were the case for other high-risk conditions, we would anticipate that the proportion of patients diagnosed with an EGS condition at the end of an ED visit during which a CT was performed (test positivity) would decline as the rate of imaging increased.

Instead, we found that increases in test positivity occurred for every age group, suggesting increased EGS diagnosis in the population or improved funneling of patients experiencing symptoms of EGS to the ED. This increased test positivity with CT scans also provides a partial explanation for the increasing proportion of abdominal pain ED visits diagnosed with EGS conditions overall: greater CT utilization means more EGS conditions are being found, resulting in fewer missed diagnoses. This may be particularly important for older adults, who are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality for a given diagnosis. However, especially in younger ages, the importance of these findings could vary significantly.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^1171Yge1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

CT scan rates increased consistently over time, with 26.2% of all patients with abdominal pain visits receiving a CT scan in 2007, rising to 42.6% in 2019 (p < 0.001, Figure 1; Data S2). The relative percentage change in abdominal CT scans, calculated as the change each year compared to the number of CTs in 2007, was greatest for older adults, with a 30.3% change from 2007 to 2019. This is compared to a 24.0% change for adults aged 46 to 64 and a 15.0% change for adults aged 18 to 45 (p < 0.01 for all age groups, Data S3). From 2007 to 2012, only two variables were recorded for CT scans: head CT and nonhead CT. From 2013 to 2019, a third variable for abdominal CT was added, with 98% of the nonhead CT scans among patients with abdominal pain chief complaints administered for the abdominal region, and 100% of abdominal CTs captured within the nonhead CT category.

Ultrasound use increased for all age groups from 2007 to 2019. For adults 18–45 years old, 17.4% of abdominal pain visits included an ultrasound in 2007, compared to 25.0% in 2019. For ages 46–64, ultrasound use increased from 9.8% to 17.4%, and for adults 65+, it increased from 5.5% to 12.2%. X‐ray use decreased for young and middle-aged adults by 46.2% and 25.2%, respectively, but remained more consistent for older adults, decreasing by only 8.6%. Specifically, 16.7% of the youngest adults received an X‐ray in 2007, compared to 9.0% in 2019; for middle-aged adults, the decrease was from 31.3% to 23.4%; and for older adults, from 39.6% to 36.2% (Figure 2). Across all ages and all years, it was found that only 3.6% of the visits were assigned diagnoses that would…
