## Question

What clinical signs and symptoms are associated with stage 6 chronic lymphocytic leukemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical signs and symptoms associated with "stage 6" chronic lymphocytic leukemia and what that stage entails. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether a "stage 6" category actually exists in CLL staging. Then, I should verify the correct staging frameworks (Rai and Binet) and identify what corresponds to the most advanced disease. Next, I will review the specific clinical features and quantitative thresholds that define advanced CLL. After that, I should check guideline-based indications for treatment since these overlap with symptomatic advanced disease. Finally, I will reconcile the "stage 6" phrasing by mapping it to the appropriate Rai/Binet stages and summarize the expected symptom profile with supporting references [^112xoDid] [^114dpJF9] [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6].

> Let me first confirm the staging systems. Hold on, I need to be precise: CLL uses two clinical systems, Rai (stages 0, I, II, III, IV) and Binet (stages A, B, C), and there is no "stage 6" in either system. Wait, I should verify the likely source of confusion: Rai stage IV uses the Roman numeral "IV", which can be misread as "6", but it actually means stage 4. Therefore, any mention of "stage 6 CLL" most likely refers to Rai stage IV or, equivalently in risk terms, Binet stage C, which are the highest-risk categories in these frameworks [^112xoDid] [^114dpJF9].

> Now, I need to delineate what constitutes these advanced stages. In the Rai system, high-risk disease includes stage III, defined by disease-related anemia, and stage IV, defined by thrombocytopenia; I should double-check the thresholds. Hmm, wait a minute — my first instinct is hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL for anemia, and platelets less than 100 × 10^9/L for thrombocytopenia, which is correct for Rai III and IV, respectively; but iwCLL treatment criteria use hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, not 11 g/dL, as an intervention threshold. Right, so to be clear: Rai stage III is anemia with hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL, Rai stage IV is platelets less than 100 × 10^9/L, while Binet stage C is defined by the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia, typically hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or platelets less than 100 × 10^9/L, aligning with treatment indications rather than pure staging semantics [^112xoDid] [^114dpJF9] [^1117ubjx].

> Next, I should review the symptom complex associated with advanced CLL. Let me think through the hematologic manifestations first: anemia commonly produces fatigue, pallor, and exertional dyspnea, while thrombocytopenia can lead to easy bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, or more serious hemorrhage; these cytopenias reflect progressive marrow failure in advanced disease. I need to ensure I cover constitutional symptoms as well: unintentional weight loss of at least 10% over 6 months, fevers 38.0 °C or higher for at least 2 weeks without infection, drenching night sweats for at least 1 month, and significant fatigue affecting activities of daily living are key disease-related symptoms that often co-occur in advanced stages and are also formal indications for treatment initiation. Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly are common: nodes may be massive (10 cm or greater) or symptomatic, and splenomegaly may be massive or symptomatic; wait, was "massive splenomegaly" defined at 5 or 6 cm below the left costal margin in the guidelines? Let me verify — iwCLL specifies massive splenomegaly as at least 6 cm below the left costal margin, and symptomatic or progressive splenomegaly also qualifies as clinically significant. Together, these features — cytopenias, bulky nodes, organomegaly, and B symptoms — typify advanced CLL physiology and presentation [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6] [^114dpJF9].

> I will now examine disease kinetics and other drivers of symptom burden that signal advanced or active disease. Progressive lymphocytosis, such as a 50% or greater increase over 2 months or a lymphocyte doubling time less than 6 months, reflects aggressive disease biology and often precedes symptomatic progression; I should confirm that guideline cutoffs remain unchanged — yes, these thresholds are unchanged in iwCLL 2018. Autoimmune cytopenias, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia that are refractory to corticosteroids, also mark active disease. Extranodal involvement can be symptomatic depending on the organ, and recurrent infections are common due to hypogammaglobulinemia and immune dysfunction inherent to CLL, contributing to fevers and general malaise in advanced stages. I need to ensure I emphasize that these features are also triggers for initiating therapy in symptomatic patients, which aligns with the JAMA review and iwCLL criteria [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6].

> But wait, what about real-world presentations in resource-limited settings — do they align with these advanced features? Let me check the reported cohort with predominantly advanced disease at presentation. In a Nigerian series, approximately 89% presented with Binet C or Rai III/IV; splenomegaly occurred in over 90%, anemia in more than 80%, and lymphadenopathy in about three-quarters, confirming that the triad of cytopenias, organomegaly, and lymphadenopathy dominates advanced-stage presentations and aligns with the clinical profile I just outlined. This real-world pattern supports the notion that what some might call "stage 6" is essentially advanced CLL with prominent cytopenias and bulky disease [^117DMCg7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without mapping the user's term to the correct stage. If by "stage 6" the user means the most severe Rai category, that corresponds to Rai stage IV characterized by thrombocytopenia; if the user means the most severe Binet category, that is Binet stage C characterized by anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Clinically, patients at these stages often have symptomatic cytopenias (fatigue, dyspnea, bleeding), bulky lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly (fullness, early satiety, abdominal discomfort), and disease-related constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fevers, night sweats), with many meeting iwCLL indications to initiate therapy. Let me reiterate to avoid ambiguity: there is no "stage 6" in CLL, but the symptom constellation the user likely seeks corresponds to Rai III/IV or Binet C disease as summarized above [^112xoDid] [^114dpJF9] [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6].

> Finally, I should confirm management implications so the framing is complete. Advanced-stage, symptomatic disease as defined by iwCLL should prompt therapy rather than observation, whereas asymptomatic early-stage disease is managed with watchful waiting; this is well established across iwCLL and ESMO guidance, and reinforced in contemporary overviews. As a quick self-check, imaging is not required for clinical staging or routine follow-up in most cases, and treatment selection in symptomatic patients commonly involves a covalent BTK inhibitor or venetoclax-based therapy, tailored to patient- and disease-specific risk features. This closes the loop: clarify the staging misnomer, identify the correct advanced categories, enumerate the expected symptoms and thresholds, and tie them to treatment indications supported by current guidelines and reviews [^1117ubjx] [^114dpJF9] [^113fHEh6] [^1168vQ5S].

There is **no recognized stage 6** in standard Rai or Binet systems [^112xoDid]; the highest stages are Rai IV and Binet C [^114dpJF9], defined by **anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100×10⁹/L)** [^113HBxgF]. Advanced CLL presents with **fatigue, dyspnea, pallor, bleeding, infections, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^113fHEh6] [^114dpJF9] [^1117ubjx]. Laboratory findings include **anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis [^114CN7bG], elevated LDH [^115RGWCp], and hypogammaglobulinemia** [^114dpJF9]. Use Rai or Binet staging [^114dpJF9] to guide management.

## Clinical staging systems in CLL

Two primary clinical staging systems classify CLL. The **Rai staging system** [^112xoDid] is commonly used in the United States and categorizes disease into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia [^113HBxgF]; the **Binet staging system** is widely used in Europe and classifies CLL into stages A, B, and C based on the number of involved lymphoid areas and the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia [^114dpJF9]. Neither system includes a stage 6 [^112xoDid]; the highest stages are **Rai stage IV and Binet stage C**, both indicating advanced disease with significant cytopenias.

---

## Clinical features of advanced CLL (Rai stage IV/Binet stage C)

Advanced CLL is characterized by **significant bone marrow infiltration**, leading to anemia and thrombocytopenia [^113fHEh6]. The following **signs and symptoms** are common:

---

### Hematological abnormalities

- **Anemia**: Hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dL [^112xoDid], causing fatigue, pallor, and dyspnea [^113HBxgF].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet counts below 100×10⁹/L [^112xoDid], leading to easy bruising, petechiae, and increased bleeding risk.

- **Lymphocytosis**: Elevated lymphocyte counts, often exceeding 5×10⁹/L [^114CN7bG].

---

### Constitutional symptoms ("B symptoms")

- **Fatigue**: Persistent and significant, impacting daily activities [^113fHEh6].

- **Fever**: Unexplained fevers ≥ 38.0°C lasting ≥ 2 weeks without infection [^1117ubjx].

- **Night sweats**: Profuse sweating, often drenching, lasting ≥ 1 month without infection [^114dpJF9].

- **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within 6 months [^1117ubjx].

---

### Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly

Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly are characterized by **enlarged lymph nodes** that may be massive (≥ 10 cm), progressive, or symptomatic [^1117ubjx]. Splenomegaly can be **massive** (≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin) [^1117ubjx] and cause abdominal discomfort or early satiety, and hepatomegaly is less common but can occur [^113WsP4Z].

---

### Immune dysfunction and infections

Immune dysfunction includes **hypogammaglobulinemia**, with reduced immunoglobulin levels that increase susceptibility to infection [^115RGWCp] [^114dpJF9], and **recurrent infections** — frequent bacterial, viral, or fungal infections due to immune suppression [^113fHEh6].

---

### Autoimmune complications

Autoimmune complications include **autoimmune hemolytic anemia**, immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells that worsens anemia [^1117ubjx], and **immune thrombocytopenia**, immune-mediated platelet destruction that exacerbates thrombocytopenia [^116TSXJf].

---

### Laboratory findings

Key laboratory abnormalities include **elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**, indicating high tumor burden and cell turnover [^115RGWCp], and **elevated beta-2 microglobulin**, a marker of disease activity and prognosis [^1163esLn].

---

## Prognostic implications

Advanced CLL (Rai stage IV/Binet stage C) is associated with a **poorer prognosis** than earlier stages [^113fHEh6]. Median survival is significantly shorter, often **2 to 5 years**, depending on patient factors and treatment response [^113S2Ytz].

---

## Management considerations

Treatment initiation in **advanced CLL** is guided by active disease, significant cytopenias, symptomatic lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, and constitutional symptoms [^1117ubjx]. Current **therapeutic options** include:

- **Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors**: Ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib [^113fHEh6] [^114dpJF9].

- **B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors**: Venetoclax [^113fHEh6], often combined with anti-CD20 antibodies (obinutuzumab, rituximab) [^114dpJF9].

- **Chemoimmunotherapy**: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) for selected patients [^112xqsbh] [^114dpJF9].

- **Supportive care**: Management of infections, autoimmune complications, and symptomatic relief [^116CGfyj].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no recognized stage 6** in CLL staging systems [^112xoDid]. Advanced CLL (Rai stage IV/Binet stage C) features significant anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, immune dysfunction, and heightened infection risk. Management involves **targeted therapies**, chemoimmunotherapy, and supportive care tailored to patient-specific factors [^113fHEh6].

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^113HBxgF]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Two widely accepted clinical staging systems co‐exist for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Rai classification was later modified to reduce the number of prognostic groups from five to three. Both systems describe three major prognostic groups with discrete clinical outcomes. These two staging systems are simple, inexpensive, and rely on a physical examination and standard laboratory tests. They do not require ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

The Rai staging system defines low-risk disease as patients who have lymphocytosis with leukemia cells in the blood and/or marrow, with lymphoid cells greater than 30% (formerly Rai Stage 0). Patients with lymphocytosis, enlarged nodes in any site, and splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly (with lymph nodes being palpable or not) are defined as having intermediate-risk disease (formerly considered Rai stage I or II). High-risk disease includes patients with disease-related anemia, as defined by a hemoglobin level less than 11 g/dL (formerly Stage III), or thrombocytopenia, as defined by a platelet count of less than 100 × 10^9/L (formerly Stage IV).

The Binet staging system is based on the number of involved areas, as defined by the presence of enlarged lymph nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter or organomegaly, and on whether there is anemia or thrombocytopenia. The areas of involvement considered are:

- **Neck and head**: Including the Waldeyer ring (this counts as one area, even if more than one group of nodes is enlarged).
- **Axillae**: Involvement of both axillae counts as one area.

### iWCLL guidelines for diagnosis, indications for treatment, response assessment, and supportive management of CLL [^1117ubjx]. Blood (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend initiating therapy in patients with CLL in whom active disease is clearly documented and at least one of the following criteria are met:

- **Progressive marrow failure**: Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development or worsening of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Cutoff levels of hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L are generally regarded as indications for treatment. However, in some patients, platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L may remain stable over a long period; this situation does not automatically require therapeutic intervention.

- **Splenomegaly**: Massive splenomegaly, such as ≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin, or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly.

- **Lymphadenopathy**: Massive nodes ≥ 10 cm in longest diameter, or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy.

- **Progressive lymphocytosis**: Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of ≥ 50% over a 2-month period, or lymphocyte doubling time < 6 months. Factors contributing to lymphocytosis, other than CLL, should be excluded.

- **Autoimmune complications**: Autoimmune complications, including anemia or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroids.

- **Extranodal involvement**: Symptomatic or functional extranodal involvement.

- **Disease-related symptoms**: Disease-related symptoms as defined by any of the following criteria:
	- Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months.
	- Significant fatigue.
	- Fevers ≥ 100.5 °F or 38.0 °C for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection.
	- Night sweats for ≥ 1 month without evidence of infection.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, dyspnoea and "tree-in-bud" sign on chest CT scan [^1147ZGr1]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a common disorder. Patients typically present with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and marked lymphocytosis, often exceeding 100,000/μl. Although pulmonary involvement from CLL can be detected in more than one third of patients on autopsy, respiratory symptoms directly caused by the disease are not frequently reported. Pulmonary involvement mainly includes parenchymal infiltrates, peribronchial and perivascular infiltration, bacterial pneumonia, oedema or infarction, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy. Occasionally, patients may present with a dry cough and progressive dyspnoea, even with a low peripheral white blood cell count.

We report a case of CLL and dyspnoea at rest, with a predominant "tree-in-bud" sign on the chest computed tomography scan, and biopsy-proven bronchiolar infiltration with monoclonal lymphocytes. With bronchoalveolar lavage alone, the diagnosis would have been missed. Chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine phosphate led to prompt clinical and radiological improvement, with an increase in 6-minute walking distance from 60 to 210 meters.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^117VXsqv]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common form of leukaemia in Europe and North America, primarily affecting older individuals, although not exclusively. The disease exhibits a highly variable course, with patient survival ranging from months to decades. Significant progress has been made in the identification of molecular and cellular markers that could predict disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. Of particular importance are the mutational profiles of immunoglobulin genes and certain cytogenetic abnormalities, which are critical predictors of prognosis.

However, these advancements have also introduced new questions concerning the biology, prognosis, and management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This discussion particularly focuses on the impact of a better understanding of B-cell receptor functions, the nature of genetic lesions, and the balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis on prognosis assessment and disease management.

While current treatments typically induce remission, nearly all patients experience relapse, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia remains incurable. Advances in molecular biology have deepened our understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and, combined with the development of novel therapeutic agents, have rendered the management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia more rational and effective than in the past. Unfortunately, no preventive measures are known for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although early detection is widely practised, it appears to have no impact on the patient's ultimate outcome.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^111VgTua]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

A system for predicting the time to first treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with early, asymptomatic disease, the International Prognostic Score for Early-stage CLL (IPS‐E), uses three covariates: unmutated IGHV gene, absolute lymphocyte count higher than 15 × 10^9/L, and presence of palpable lymph nodes, to separate low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, with a 5-year cumulative risk for treatment start of 8.4%, 28.4%, and 61.2%, respectively. The IPS-E will be helpful to counsel patients with early-stage CLL.

Criteria for the initiation of therapy as proposed by the iwCLL guidelines remain unchanged. The decision to initiate treatment depends on the presence of active/symptomatic disease. Asymptomatic patients with early-stage disease (Rai 0, Binet A) should be monitored without therapy unless they have evidence of rapid disease progression or until the disease becomes symptomatic. This conservative approach of a watch-and-wait strategy is strongly supported by evidence, as multiple controlled, prospective studies on treating patients with early-stage disease have not shown a survival benefit so far, regardless of the type of therapy, whether chemotherapy alone, chemoimmunotherapy, or BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib. Therefore, an early therapeutic intervention in asymptomatic CLL is currently not recommended.

In an attempt to generate a prognostic tool for patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib, Ahn et al. identified four relevant factors: TP53 aberration, pri…

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115eQvmA]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

In the training, composite and two out of the four validation cohorts, the proposed prognostic score approached or exceeded C-index values of 0.7, a threshold necessary to confer utility at the individual patient level. In this regard, however, a more precise evaluation of the individual predictive potential may require the application of complex statistical methods, as recently proposed.

This study raises questions regarding the appropriate timing of immunocytogenetic analysis in early-stage disease, which today is often postponed until the time of disease progression and first treatment. We appreciate the cost-effectiveness of a 'watch-and-wait' approach, particularly since studies investigating the early use of chlorambucil and fludarabine monotherapy, as well as FCR regimens (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide + rituximab), have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in CLL patients. However, the role of the novel inhibitors in this setting remains to be elucidated, and the results of this study support the notion that early testing can aid risk-adapted treatment strategies and early intervention, particularly in the modern chemo-free era.

In this regard, the CLL12 trial (a phase III clinical study currently underway in Germany) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib compared to a 'watch-and-wait' approach in Binet A CLL using a similar comprehensive scoring system to identify high-risk patients. Another randomized phase II study currently underway at the Mayo Clinic is comparing the efficacy of the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib alone and in combination with the anti-

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^113S2Ytz]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with a white blood cell (WBC) count and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) exhibited a median overall survival (OS) of 150 months in stage 0, 101 months in stage I, 71 months in stage II, and 19 months each in stages III and IV. Patients in Binet stage A had a longer median OS of 100 months; those in stage B survived a median of 55 months, while stage C patients had a median OS of 45 months. Our study identified that patients with Rai stages II, III, and IV had median survival times of 41, 26, and 11 months, respectively. Although none of our patients presented in Binet stage A, those in Binet stage B had a better median survival compared to those in stage C.

### Spontaneous clinical regression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^113aDJMq]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a B-cell disorder which has a median survival of over 10 years from diagnosis for stage A disease. The natural history of stage A disease is generally indolent or only slowly progressive. It is less well known that CLL may undergo spontaneous regression. We report a series of 10 such cases (eight stage A and two stage B) followed at our institutions.

### Prognostic nomogram and index for overall survival in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^1163esLn]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical course for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is extremely heterogeneous. The Rai and Binet staging systems have been used to risk-stratify patients; most patients present with early-stage disease. We evaluated a group of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at initial presentation to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center to identify independent characteristics that predict overall survival. Clinical and routine laboratory characteristics for 1,674 previously untreated patients who presented for evaluation of CLL from 1981 to 2004 were included.

Univariate and multivariate analyses identified several patient characteristics at presentation that predicted overall survival in previously untreated patients with CLL. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was developed, including the following independent characteristics: age, beta-2 microglobulin, absolute lymphocyte count, sex, Rai stage, and number of involved lymph node groups. The inclusion of patients from a single institution and the proportion of patients younger than 65 years may limit this model. A weighted prognostic model, or nomogram, predictive for overall survival was constructed using these six characteristics for 5- and 10-year survival probability and estimated median survival time. This prognostic model may help patients and clinicians in clinical decision-making as well as in clinical research and clinical trial design.

### Cll biology and prognosis [^114sDjof]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology: Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) follows an extremely variable course with survival ranging from months to decades. Recently, there has been major progress in the identification of molecular and cellular markers that may predict the tendency for disease progression in CLL patients. In particular, the mutational profile of Ig genes and some cytogenetic abnormalities have been found to be important predictors of prognosis in CLL. However, this progress has raised new questions about the biology and prognosis of the disease, some of which are addressed here.

- **Key questions**:
	1. What is the role of the B-cell receptor (BCR) in CLL pathogenesis?
	2. Is CLL one disease?
	3. Is CLL an accumulative disease?
	4. What is the normal counterpart of the CLL B lymphocyte?
	5. Have the Rai and Binet staging systems become obsolete?
	6. Which is the best surrogate for Ig mutational profiles?

### Cause of death in patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stratified by the CLL-International Prognostic Index [^113joYFk]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that is considered incurable. The clinical presentation of CLL is heterogeneous, and the rate of progression is variable. Many patients have an indolent disease course and can be observed for years, while a subset of patients experience rapid disease progression with symptoms and/or bone marrow failure requiring treatment.

A recent advancement in risk stratification has been the CLL-International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI), which integrates major clinical and molecular prognostic factors into a single risk score. Specifically, CLL-IPI uses age, Binet or Rai stage, beta-2 microglobulin, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene variable region (IGHV) mutation status, and TP53 disruption status (17p deletion or somatic TP53 mutation) to stratify patients with newly diagnosed CLL into four risk groups with distinct prognoses. Subsequent studies have shown that CLL-IPI can predict time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed CLL.

Although CLL primarily affects older adults, in whom comorbidities can be competing causes of mortality, we previously showed that CLL progression and CLL-related complications (including infections and second malignancies) were the leading causes of death in patients with newly diagnosed CLL, regardless of age and comorbidities. In this study, we sought to investigate if the causes of death in patients with newly diagnosed CLL would differ according to the CLL-IPI risk group.

### Early treatment with FCR versus watch and wait in patients with stage Binet A high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): a randomized phase 3 trial [^114hD1vA]. Leukemia (2020). High credibility.

The data presented here demonstrate that an early application of FCR was able to postpone events of disease progression and the need for therapy in stage Binet A high-risk CLL, but despite this effect, there was no overall survival (OS) benefit in the long run.

FCR was highly effective in reducing the tumor load in treated patients, as demonstrated by a high overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) rates. Moreover, while the significance of the minimal residual disease (MRD) data set is limited by a relatively low number of assessments, the frequency of achieved MRD negativity (peripheral blood: 75.5%, bone marrow: 67.9%) compares favorably to the respective data from the FCR arm of the CLL8 trial (63% and 44%, respectively). Patients who achieved a MRD-negative status (at a threshold of 10−4 in peripheral blood) appeared to enjoy a better prognosis (median event-free survival not reached) than previously reported for MRD-negative patients with active disease treated within the CLL8 trial (median progression-free survival 64 months).

These findings underline not only the important ability but also potentially higher likelihood of disease-eradicating activity by treatment regimens applied at an early disease stage.

### Limited clinical relevance of imaging techniques in the follow-up of patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Results of a meta-analysis [^1125RtCp]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical value of imaging is well-established for the follow-up of many lymphoid malignancies, but not for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A meta-analysis was conducted using data from three German CLL Study Group phase 3 trials (CLL4, CLL5, and CLL8), which included 1,372 patients receiving first-line therapy for CLL. Response and progression during follow-up were reassessed according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group 1996 criteria.

A total of 481 events were categorized as progressive disease during treatment or follow-up. Of these, 372 progressions (77%) were detected by clinical symptoms or blood counts. Computed tomography (CT) scans or ultrasound were relevant in 44 and 29 cases (9% and 6%), respectively. The decision for relapse treatment was determined by CT scan or ultrasound results in only 2 of 176 patients (1%). CT scan results impacted the prognosis of patients in complete remission only after the administration of conventional chemotherapy, but not after chemoimmunotherapy.

In conclusion, physical examination and blood count remain the methods of choice for the staging and clinical follow-up of patients with CLL, as recommended by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 guidelines. These trials are registered at http://www.isrctn.org as ISRCTN 75653261 and ISRCTN 36294212, and at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00281918.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^117DMCg7]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Determining chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prognosis using the International Prognostic Index markers, such as TP53 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation, in a resource-limited setting is difficult due to cost and equipment unavailability. The aim of this study is to determine prognostic factors readily available to hematologists in low- or medium-income countries.

This was a retrospective study conducted at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data were retrieved from CLL patient records from January 2004 to December 2019 (15 years). Data collected were analyzed using SPSS software version 25.

A total of 46 records were reviewed, with a median age of 55 years and a male:female ratio of 1:1.2. All patients were symptomatic at presentation, with splenomegaly (91.3%), anemia (82.6%), and lymphadenopathy (76.1%) predominating. About 89.1% of the patients presented at Binet stage C and/or high-risk Rai (Rai stages III and IV), with 10.9% presenting at Binet stage B and/or intermediate-risk Rai (Rai stage II). Only 13% of the patients had immunophenotyping done, with 6.5% being done for the Matutes CLL score. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 15.7%, with a median survival of 26 months. White blood cell (WBC) count and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) > 100 × 10⁹/L were significant poor prognostic markers (P = .013 and .021, respectively). Thirty-five patients (76.1%) received chemotherapy, and they had a better median survival than those who did not (26 vs. 17.5 months). The most common regimen used was…

### Narrative review: Initial management of newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115x2tKU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is one of the most common malignant lymphoid diseases in the Western world and is frequently diagnosed by internists. Over the past two decades, there have been clinically significant changes in diagnosis methods, prognostic tools, supportive care, and treatment. Most patients present with Rai stage 0 or I disease at diagnosis. Patients with early-stage disease form a heterogeneous group: approximately 30% to 50% will experience accelerated disease progression, while the remainder may live for decades and possibly never require therapy.

Recent insights into the biological characteristics of leukemic B cells have led to the discovery of new prognostic tools that can identify high-risk patients. These tools include immunoglobulin variable-region heavy chain gene mutation status, cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and Z-chain-associated protein kinase-70 protein expression. This information enables physicians to individualize counseling, follow-up, and management based on disease risk.

New treatments developed over the past two decades — such as purine nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies, and combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens — have dramatically improved response rates and appear to prolong survival. In this review, the authors discuss the work-up of lymphocytosis and highlight how to use recently identified prognostic tools to stratify risk in patients with newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2015 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment [^1135vT2j]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries. The disease typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B-cells.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as B-cell markers.

- **Prognosis**: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) predict resistance to available chemotherapies. Comprehensive prognostic scores are currently being developed.

- **Therapy**: Patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. For physically fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the standard therapy. For unfit patients, treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab, rituximab, or ofatumumab) plus a milder chemotherapy (chlorambucil) may be applied. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated if the treatment-free interval exceeds two to three years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using alternative agents such as bendamustine (plus rituximab), alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, ofatumumab, ibrutinib, or idelalisib.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2022 [^111CGXT6]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Management of the patient with previously untreated CLL is crucial. The vast majority of CLL patients have an early-stage asymptomatic disease at diagnosis. Only those patients who meet the 2018 iwCLL criteria for initiation of therapy should be offered treatment.

- **2018 iwCLL guidelines on indications for treatment**:
	1. Autoimmune complications, including autoimmune cytopenias, that are poorly responsive to corticosteroids; treatment may represent an additional indication for change in therapy.
	2. Unintentional weight loss of ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months; significant fatigue (ECOG performance scale ≥ 2), fevers (38.0 °C) for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection; or night sweats for ≥ 1 month without evidence of infection.
	3. Non-CLL factors that may contribute to lymphocytosis (e.g. infections and corticosteroids) should be excluded.
	4. Hemoglobin and platelet count cutoffs require consideration of the rate of decline. In certain patients, counts slightly below these levels may remain stable for an extended period and not require treatment initiation.

Management is guided by risk stratification. Including supportive care is necessary for all patients with a CLL diagnosis.

### iWCLL guidelines for diagnosis, indications for treatment, response assessment, and supportive management of CLL [^116CGfyj]. Blood (2018). High credibility.

The previous edition of the consensus guidelines of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL), published in 2008, found broad acceptance among physicians and investigators caring for patients with CLL. Recent advances, including the discovery of the genomic landscape of the disease, the development of genetic tests with prognostic relevance, and the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), alongside the increased availability of novel targeted agents with impressive efficacy, prompted an international panel to provide updated evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations. These recommendations include a revised version of the iwCLL response criteria, an update on the use of MRD status for clinical evaluation, and recommendations regarding the assessment and prophylaxis of viral diseases during the management of CLL.

### Early treatment with FCR versus watch and wait in patients with stage Binet A high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): A randomized phase 3 trial [^111B616y]. Leukemia (2020). High credibility.

We present data from a phase 3 trial (CLL7), which successfully implemented molecular genetic disease characteristics into a risk-tailored treatment allocation strategy for patients with stage Binet A CLL. Twenty-five percent of our intention-to-treat study population exhibited a "high risk" disease type according to our four-factor risk assessment, and these patients clearly segregated from the low-risk group regarding all time-to-event parameters investigated, illustrated by event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS) (Supplementary Fig. 3), and overall survival (OS).

All four risk parameters used for our study design were chosen due to their confirmed value as prognostic factors for PFS/OS in multivariate analyses performed in the first 147 patients registered in the preceding CLL1 trial (phase 3 comparison of fludarabine vs. watch and wait in Binet A CLL) in 2004. In particular, we found serum levels of thymidine kinase (TK) (cutoff 10 U/L) rather than beta-2-microglobulin (3.5 mg/L) as a preferred independent prognostic factor for time-to-event outcomes in our test set analysis, and therefore implemented serum TK in our study design. The parameter lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) reflects disease dynamics and is recommended by guidelines to determine the right time a patient requires therapy. Particularly at an early disease stage, an LDT < 12 months has been identified as an independent indicator of an unfavorable prognosis. Although easily assessable in clinical practice, this parameter is not commonly documented in large trial datasets and therefore not considered in the latest CLL scoring systems, such as the CLL-IPI.

### Early treatment with FCR versus watch and wait in patients with stage Binet A high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): A randomized phase 3 trial [^115m9mqn]. Leukemia (2020). High credibility.

Clinical observation without therapy — defined as "watch and wait" (W&W) — has been the gold standard for the management of early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This principle is based on the repeated failure of previous attempts to improve the clinical outcome of CLL patients by early therapeutic intervention. Moreover, a reasonable subset of patients with CLL experience an indolent disease course with neither compromising morbidity nor an elevated risk of premature death caused by the leukemia. Such patients have a life expectancy comparable with the normal population, and there is no justification to expose these cases to any potentially harmful antileukemic therapy.

However, there has still been a debate whether cases with a more aggressive disease course could benefit from earlier treatment, particularly with the recent advent of targeted drugs. At the time of writing, reported trials that address the role of immediate therapy at an early disease stage have only tested single-agent chemotherapies (i.e. chlorambucil and fludarabine), but not modern treatment options, such as combined chemoimmunotherapy or novel small-molecule inhibitors.

The study presented here (named "CLL7" trial) was aimed at testing whether chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) would improve the outcome of patients with unfavorable prognosis when administered at an early stage. FCR has been the first regimen to prolong survival of advanced-stage CLL and represents a standard of care option for first-line treatment of physically fit CLL patients.

### Prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia-what do we need to know [^115xg2YR]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Of all leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) shows the highest variability in its clinical presentation and course. CLL can present as an aggressive and life-threatening leukemia or as an indolent form that will not require treatment over decades. The currently available clinical staging systems for CLL are simple and inexpensive but lack accuracy in predicting disease progression and survival on an individual basis.

The increased understanding of the key events of molecular pathogenesis has provided a plethora of novel molecular and biological factors that correlate with the outcome of CLL. This review provides a concise discussion of the most important discoveries and gives guidance on how to implement novel prognostic tools in the clinical management of CLL by applying the criteria of evidence, relevance, and simplicity to the selection of prognostic markers.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2020: The future has arrived [^116JgFsh]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to diagnostic criteria, the iwCLL guidelines dictate when to initiate treatment based on patients' symptoms, full blood counts, and physical examination. The presence of constitutional symptoms, progressive lymphocytosis, a doubling time of less than 6 months, an Hb of less than 100 g/L, or a platelet count of less than 100 x 10^9/L, as well as progressive or symptomatic bulky lymphadenopathy/organomegaly or treatment-resistant autoimmune thrombocytopaenia or anaemia, are indications to start treatment. In some circumstances, treatment may be initiated at diagnosis, but it is much more common for patients to be monitored for signs of increasing disease activity, often over many years.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^116aL61V]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

The iwCLL guidelines provide a detailed description of the assessment of treatment response. Although a comprehensive overview of these response criteria is beyond the scope of this manuscript, the response categories can be broadly classified into complete remission, partial remission, stable disease, progression, and refractory disease. Additionally, the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) is an increasingly important aspect of response evaluation, resulting in these distinct categories.

- **Definition of response in clinical trials**: As proposed by the iwCLL, the assessment of MRD is not always routine practice but may be utilized to determine the duration of therapy with targeted agents. MRD, minimal residual disease; CR, complete remission; PR, partial remission; MRD−, undetectable MRD; MRD+, detectable MRD.

Eradicating MRD is supported by the use of sensitive multicolor flow cytometry, PCR, or next-generation sequencing, which can detect MRD in many patients who achieve a complete clinical response. Prospective clinical trials have shown that therapies resulting in undetectable MRD (uMRD) often lead to improved long-term clinical outcomes. The importance of MRD assessments is highlighted by a comparison with the evaluation of clinical response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) among 554 patients treated in two German CLL Study Group trials (CLL8 and CLL10). Patients with uMRD in complete remission (CR), uMRD in partial remission (PR), detectable MRD (dMRD) in CR, and dMRD in PR experienced a median progression-free survival.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: From molecular pathogenesis to novel therapeutic strategies [^117SHNCq]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

The clinical and prognostic implications of novel discoveries are significant in the course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The clinical progression of CLL is notably heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic cases that may regress spontaneously to progressive disease leading to the patient's death. This variability has sparked considerable interest in determining individual patient prognosis.

Over recent decades, numerous prognostic markers have been identified, although only a few remain prevalent. Historically, CLL patient prognosis was defined using clinical parameters, including the Rai and Binet staging systems, IGHV mutational status, and numerical aberrations determined by FISH. The development of next-generation sequencing has led to the discovery of novel drivers such as NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3, which have been incorporated into existing prognostic systems. Despite this, none of these markers has attained standard care status. Current International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) guidelines recommend evaluating only the IGHV status and the presence or absence of TP53 aberrations in routine practice.

The recent CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) integrates both clinical and cytogenetic/genomic data, including age, clinical staging, β2-microglobulin serum concentration, IGHV mutation status, and TP53 aberrations into one prognostic score. Developed in cohorts of patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), the CLL-IPI has been validated in retrospective series. Among the five indices, TP53 and IGHV exert the strongest impact on patient outcomes, explaining the development of simplified versions of the CLL-IPI.

Standardized criteria for diagnosis and response assessment are needed to interpret and compare clinical trials and for approval of new therapeutic agents by regulatory agencies. Therefore, a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) published guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials for patients with CLL in 1988, which were updated in 1996.

During the past decade, considerable progress has been achieved in defining new prognostic markers, diagnostic parameters, and treatment options. This prompted the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iWCLL) to provide updated recommendations for the management of CLL in clinical trials and general practice.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia presenting with localized gynecologic symptoms [^116wp5mP]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Although no cure exists for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treatment can reduce morbidity and/or improve survival in advanced disease. Identification of patients in an early disease state allows monitoring and treatment as soon as appropriate. We were unable to find previous reports of early CLL disease presenting with gynecologic symptoms. This report seeks to alert gynecologists of their potential role in identifying CLL patients.

- **Case**: A 76-year-old woman presented with rectovaginal pressure. Cervical cone biopsy showed a lymphoproliferative process. Peripheral blood flow cytometry confirmed a diagnosis of early-stage CLL. The patient remains asymptomatic and is currently monitored for disease progression.

- **Conclusion**: Early CLL can present with localized gynecologic symptoms or cervical lesions. The recognition of early disease can assure optimal treatment.

### Prognostication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the era of new agents [^117WCkMq]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is very heterogeneous. Therefore, a plethora of prognostic factors has been identified to allow a better prediction of the individual prognosis of a given patient. The clinical staging systems by Rai and Binet have been the backbone of clinical management for several decades. The advent of genetic and biochemical markers, as well as next-generation sequencing, has provided several markers that can predict the prognosis of patients with CLL.

Using this knowledge, several scores have been created to improve predicting overall survival and/or treatment-free survival. These prognostic scores were developed in the era of chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy. Therefore, they now need to be tested with novel agents. However, despite tremendously improved therapeutic options, CLL patients with TP53 dysfunction or a complex karyotype remain at very high risk and seem to have a shorter treatment-free survival. The recently published international prognostic index (CLL IPI) incorporates most of these factors and provides a tool to analyze outcomes in the modern era of targeted therapies.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^1176TSAY]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Management of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily involves patients diagnosed with early-stage asymptomatic disease. Only those patients who meet the 2018 International Workshop on CLL (iWCLL) criteria for initiation of therapy should be offered treatment.

- **Risk stratification and monitoring**:
	- Figure 1 illustrates a suggested approach for managing patients who do not meet the 2018 iWCLL criteria for therapy. At diagnosis, all patients should undergo risk stratification according to the CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI). Patients categorized as low- and intermediate-risk (approximately 75% of patients, with a median time to first therapy of about 7 years) should be monitored for disease progression every 6–12 months. Patients in the high- and very high-risk CLL-IPI group (approximately 25% of patients, with a median time to first therapy of about 2 years) should be monitored every 3–6 months.

- **Counseling**:
	- Regardless of the CLL-IPI score, all patients should be counseled on the increased risk of infections, emphasizing the importance of appropriate vaccinations as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. There is also an increased risk of non-hematologic malignancy; hence, recommendations for age-appropriate cancer screening should be followed. Additionally, patients face an increased risk of skin cancers and should have an annual full-body skin examination by a dermatologist.

- **Early intervention clinical trials**:
	- Patients with high- and very high-risk CLL may be considered for early intervention through clinical trials. The German CLL Study Group is conducting a phase 3 study (CLL12 trial) that randomizes patients for this purpose.

### Should IGHV status and FISH testing be performed in all CLL patients at diagnosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111j3pPe]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Since the first description of the natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by David Galton in 1966, the considerable heterogeneity in the disease course has been well recognized. The Rai and Binet staging systems, described approximately 40 years ago, have proven to be robust prognostic tools. Over the past two decades, several novel biological, genetic, and molecular markers have been shown to be useful adjuncts to the Rai and Binet staging systems.

In this systematic review, we examined the role of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutation status and genetic abnormalities determined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. The cumulative evidence presented in this systematic review is sufficient to recommend that FISH and IGHV be performed as standard clinical tests for all patients with newly diagnosed CLL in those countries with the resources to do so. In addition to clinical stage, these parameters could represent the minimal standard initial prognostic evaluation for patients with CLL. This approach will allow the application of powerful, recently developed prognostic indices (all of which are dependent on IGHV and FISH results) to all patients with newly diagnosed CLL.

### High-risk subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are detectable as early as 16 years prior to diagnosis [^112AVjnA]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Characterization of prediagnostic and diagnostic samples:

- **IGHV mutational status determination**: All samples from patients with future CLL with a dominant clonotype frequency > 2% were analyzed. If no clonotype > 2% dominant clonotype frequency was present in the earliest sample of a patient, dominant clonotypes from any later measurements were used. Mutated clonotypes are shown as red circles, whereas unmutated clonotypes (IGHV mutational status > 98% germline sequence identity) are shown as blue triangles. A Kaplan-Meier (survival) curve for the time until CLL diagnosis, stratified by IGHV mutational status, indicates that the log-rank test does not find any significant difference.

- **Overview of CLL subsets**: All CLL subsets identified in the data were analyzed, with major subsets divided by those associated with aggressive or indolent disease courses. Minor subsets are shown separately in light green. Samples in which the K16 and YDSD motifs and the R110 mutation of light chain subset 2L were confirmed are shown as purple triangles. Patients with repeated samples are connected by a black line. A Kaplan-Meier (survival) curve for the time to CLL diagnosis from prediagnostic sample collection, stratified by BcR stereotyped CLL subsets, indicates that the log-rank test does not find any significant difference.

- **Cumulative frequency of clonotypes**: The cumulative frequency of clonotypes detected at CLL diagnosis for both the prediagnostic sample(s) and diagnostic sample was assessed. Cumulative indicates that if more than one clonotype was shared in the prediagnostic and diagnostic sample (e.g. patient 1), it was included in the analysis.

### Spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: an unanticipated complication of an undiagnosed disease [^111GB9s2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The patient fulfilled all four laboratory and two clinical criteria of tumour lysis syndrome according to the modified Cairo and Bishop classification system. Although the case also fulfills criteria proposed exclusively for spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome (STLS) by Weeks and Kimple, the lack of international recognition necessitates authors to follow the Cairo-Bishop classification instead. The typical constellation of metabolic abnormalities in the absence of primary renal pathology, along with the presence of bulky chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), makes STLS the most probable diagnosis.

- **Diagnosis confirmation**: Although lymphocytosis, smudge cells, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics established the diagnosis, considering the rare occurrence of STLS in a low-grade malignancy like CLL, bone marrow aspiration/biopsy and lymph node biopsy were performed in the second week after the patient's condition was stabilized.
	- The absence of immunoblast- or centroblast-like large B cell morphology.
	- Absence of Reid-Sternberg cell morphology and negative MUM1/IRF4 immunohistochemistry.
	- Relatively low Ki67 index.
	- Absence of classical B symptoms and extranodal features.
	- Presence of symptomatic hypocalcemia.
	- Lack of TP53, NOTCH1, MYC, and CDKN2A mutations, which ruled out Richter transformation.
	- The lack of t(11;14) and cyclin D1 expression excluded the possibility of mantle cell lymphoma.

Malignant lymphocyte infiltration with suppression of erythrocytic and megakaryocytic series in the bone marrow biopsy suggested CLL as a cause of anemia and thrombocytopenia according to iWCLL guidelines. Lymphocytosis in the periphery supported this diagnosis.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^111xVtfi]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical staging systems for CLL, described by Rai and Binet approximately 40 years ago, are still used in clinical practice today to inform prognosis and guide treatment decisions. However, their predictive powers are limited. For example, Pflug et al. reported C-indices of 0.56 and 0.58 for Rai and Binet systems, respectively, when applied to a cohort of 1,948 patients. Novel model scoring systems developed in recent years have significantly improved the accuracy of prognostication by incorporating new biomarkers and hold the potential for the development of more individualized treatment strategies, especially in the age of increasing sophistication of novel agents alone or in combination. In this regard, the CLL-IPI was developed as an integrative tool to evaluate overall survival for all clinical stages of disease. Although it demonstrated consistency in subgroup analyses circumscribed to early-stage disease, it was not developed specifically to predict TFS.

To our knowledge, this study represents one of the largest attempts to integrate novel biomarkers with traditional clinical factors, with the specific aim of predicting TFS in the setting of Rai 0 CLL. Given the multiplicity of new biomarkers, our goals were:

	- **Identify individual biomarker influence on TFS**: Determine which ones individually influence TFS.
	- **Develop a scoring system**: Stratify risk in patients traditionally thought to harbor indolent disease.

Our training cohort was selected from a consecutive series of 1,201 CLL cases referred to a single center for immunocytogenetic analyses between 2006 and 2017.

### Tailored approaches grounded on immunogenetic features for refined prognostication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^114yA2wT]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Despite mounting evidence for the existence of distinct biological variants of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the 2016 update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification still considers CLL as a single, homogeneous entity. This is in contrast to other hematologic malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which are segregated into different subgroups based on the integration of genetic, morphological, immunophenotypic, and clinical features.

Since the introduction of the Rai and Binet clinical staging systems in the 1970s, it has become increasingly evident that the clinical heterogeneity in CLL is linked to and reflects the underlying biological heterogeneity. Hence, several initiatives have focused on identifying biomarkers that would refine prognostication, especially for cases presenting with early-stage disease, which nowadays represent the majority of patients (80–85%). Consequently, numerous prognostic indices have been proposed; however, none has been adopted in everyday clinical practice. This is partly due to different variables being assessed in each evaluated cohort, while the actual routine diagnostic and monitoring practices vary between institutions. Moreover, most reported cohorts were rather small, inherently limiting their capacity to encompass the remarkable clinico-biological heterogeneity of CLL and reveal possible interactions and interdependencies among the evaluated prognosticators.

The clonotypic B-cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) is a unique molecular signature…

- **Lymphatic system**: lymphadenopathy, axillary lymphadenopathy, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, cervical lymphadenopathy
- **Skin manifestations**: skin wounds, skin nodules, skin papules, skin plaques, leukemia cutis
- **Systemic symptoms**: fever, night sweats (particularly in elderly patients), weight loss, fatigue
- **Organ-related symptoms**: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly
- **Serological findings**: hypogammaglobulinemia, increased serum β-2 microglobulin, increased serum LDH, elevated serum transaminases
- **Other characteristics**: smudge cells

These symptoms and conditions highlight the complexity and variability of chronic lymphocytic leukemia's presentation.

### Prognostic models for newly-diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QKa6F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system in Western countries. Several clinical and biological factors for CLL have been identified; however, it remains unclear which of the available prognostic models combining those factors can be used in clinical practice to predict long-term outcomes in people newly diagnosed with CLL.

- **Objectives**: To identify, describe, and appraise all prognostic models developed to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or treatment-free survival (TFS) in newly-diagnosed (previously untreated) adults with CLL, and meta-analyse their predictive performances.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE (from January 1950 to June 2019 via Ovid), Embase (from 1974 to June 2019), and registries of ongoing trials (up to 5 March 2020) for development and validation studies of prognostic models for untreated adults with CLL. In addition, we screened the reference lists and citation indices of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all prognostic models developed for CLL that predict OS, PFS, or TFS, provided they combined prognostic factors known before treatment initiation, and any studies that tested the performance of these models in individuals other than the ones included in model development (i.e. 'external model validation studies'). We included studies of adults with confirmed B-cell CLL who had not received treatment prior to the start of the study. We did not restrict the search based on study design.

Data collection and analysis efforts were also part of the research methodology, though specific details were not expanded in the available text.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^116TVc2F]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Determining chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prognosis using International Prognostic Index markers, such as TP53 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation, in a resource-limited setting is challenging due to cost and equipment unavailability. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors that are readily accessible to hematologists in low- or medium-income countries.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective study was conducted at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data were retrieved from CLL patient records spanning January 2004 to December 2019, covering 15 years. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software version 25.

- **Results**: A total of 46 records were reviewed, with a median age of 55 years and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.2. All patients were symptomatic at presentation, with splenomegaly (91.3%), anemia (82.6%), and lymphadenopathy (76.1%) predominating. Approximately 89.1% of the patients presented at Binet stage C and/or high-risk Rai (Rai stages III and IV), while 10.9% presented at Binet stage B and/or intermediate-risk Rai (Rai stage II). Only 13% of the patients had immunophenotyping conducted, with 6.5% performed for the Matutes CLL score. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 15.7%, with a median survival of 26 months. White blood cell count and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) > 100 × 10^9 /L were significant poor prognostic markers (P = .013 and .021, respectively). Thirty-five patients (76.1%) received chemotherapy and had a better median survival than those who did not (26 vs. 17.5 months). The most common regimen used was cy.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115g1N1j]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

We applied a training-validation strategy using 1,879 cases of phenotypically confirmed Rai 0 CLL collected in the context of an international effort from Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The training cohort included 478 Rai 0 cases identified from a consecutive series of Italian multicenter patients (1,201 cases) referred to a single center (Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit of the Centro Riferimento Oncologico in Aviano, Italy) for immunocytogenetic analyses between 2006 and 2017.

- **External validation**: Four independent Rai 0 cohorts were used for external validation made up of three 'real world' cohorts from single centers:
	1. Gemelli Hospital in Rome, Italy (144 cases, Gemelli cohort).
	2. Cardiff University Hospital in Wales, UK (395 cases, Cardiff cohort).
	3. Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA (540 cases, Mayo cohort).

Additionally, one investigational cohort from the multicenter O-CLL1-GISL Italian prospective observational study (O-CLL cohort; identifier: 00917540; 322 cases) was included. Cases of monoclonal B lymphocytosis were excluded, and the TFS was defined as time from diagnosis to treatment, according to the revised 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iWCLL) guidelines.

Patient information was obtained from the participating centers in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local ethics committee approvals.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^115RGWCp]. Annals of Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, specifically with respect to laboratory testing, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serum chemistry, including LDH, bilirubin, serum immunoglobulins, direct antiglobulin test, and haptoglobin, as well as liver and kidney function tests before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or symptomatic stage disease. It is advised to consider obtaining other tests to exclude other reasons for anemia before initiating treatment in such patients.

### Comparison of Rai and Binet classifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112xoDid]. Hematology (1997). High credibility.

The Rai Staging System for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a clinical tool used to classify and stage patients with CLL, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer. This system is specifically applicable to patients diagnosed with CLL and helps predict disease progression and survival outcomes.

The Rai Staging System stratifies patients into three risk groups: low (Stage 0), intermediate (Stages I and II), and high risk (Stages III and IV), based on the presence of lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and anemia or thrombocytopenia. The clinical utility of this calculator is to guide treatment decisions and prognosis. For instance, patients in the low-risk group may not require immediate treatment and can be closely monitored, while those in the high-risk group may require aggressive treatment.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Rai Staging System; however, it may not be as applicable or accurate in patients with atypical presentations of CLL or in those with co-existing hematological disorders. The Rai Staging System for CLL calculator assesses the risk group classification based on five clinical input parameters: enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, enlarged liver, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Based on the patient's responses to these parameters, the calculator determines the risk group and the associated overall survival expectation.

### Development of a comprehensive prognostic index for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^116NFGq2]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to clinical staging, a number of biomarkers predicting overall survival (OS) have been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The multiplicity of markers, limited information on their independent prognostic value, and a lack of understanding of how to interpret discordant markers are major barriers to use in routine clinical practice. We therefore performed an analysis of 23 prognostic markers based on prospectively collected data from 1948 CLL patients participating in phase 3 trials of the German CLL Study Group to develop a comprehensive prognostic index.

A multivariable Cox regression model identified 8 independent predictors of OS: sex, age, ECOG status, del(17p), del(11q), IGHV mutation status, serum β2-microglobulin, and serum thymidine kinase. Using a weighted grading system, a prognostic index was derived that separated 4 risk categories with 5-year OS ranges from 18.7% to 95.2% and has a C-statistic of 0.75. The index stratified OS within all analyzed subgroups, including all Rai/Binet stages.

The validity of the index was externally confirmed in a series of 676 newly diagnosed CLL patients from Mayo Clinic. Through this multistep process, including external validation, we developed a comprehensive prognostic index with high discriminatory power and prognostic significance on the individual patient level. The studies were registered as follows: CLL1 trial (NCT00262782, http://clinicaltrials.gov), CLL4 trial (ISRCTN 75653261, http://www.controlled-trials.com), and CLL8 trial (NCT00281918, http://clinicaltrials.gov).

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^114wuEeK]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 46 patients (making up 21.1% of 218 hematological malignancies) were diagnosed with CLL from January 2004 to December 2019 (15 years). There were 21 (45.7%) males and 25 (54.3%) females, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.2. The median age at presentation for all cases was 55 years (range, 39–83 years). Twenty-four patients (52.2%) were ≤ 55 years at presentation. Females had a lower median age at presentation (55 years) compared to males (58 years); however, this was not statistically significant (P = .35).

There was no asymptomatic case, and the median duration of symptoms was 5 months (range, 3 weeks to 168 months). The most common symptoms were splenomegaly, seen in 42 (91.3%) of the cases, followed by anemia (n = 38, 82.6%) and lymphadenopathy (n = 35, 76.1%). A little over a quarter of them (n = 12, 26.1%) had fever. The mean spleen size was 14 cm (± 6.7 cm). Of the 42 patients with splenomegaly, 6 (14.3%) had a spleen size > 20 cm (massive splenomegaly). One patient presented with asplenia following splenectomy for hypersplenism.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A review [^113fHEh6]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), defined by a minimum of 5×10^9/L monoclonal B cells in the blood, affects more than 200,000 people and is associated with approximately 4,410 deaths in the US annually. CLL is associated with an immunocompromised state and an increased rate of complications from infections.

- **Observations**: At the time of diagnosis, the median age of patients with CLL is 70 years, and an estimated 95% of patients have at least one medical comorbidity. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with CLL are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and one-third will never require treatment for CLL. Prognostic models have been developed to estimate the time to first treatment and the overall survival; however, for patients who are asymptomatic, irrespective of disease risk category, clinical observation is the standard of care.

Patients with symptomatic disease who have bulky or progressive lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly and those with a low neutrophil count, anemia, or thrombocytopenia and/or symptoms of fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss (B symptoms) should be offered treatment. For these patients, first-line treatment consists of a regimen containing either a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, or ibrutinib) or a B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor (venetoclax). There is no evidence that starting either class before the other improves outcomes. The covalent BTK inhibitors are typically used indefinitely. Survival rates are approximately 88% at 4 years for acalabrutinib, 94% at 2 years for zanubrutinib, and data on survival metrics continues to evolve.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^114mgo7z]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Clinical features at presentation**: The median packed cell volume (PCV), total white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and platelet count were 24% (range, 8.7%-39%), 101.0 × 10^9 /L (range, 26.3–642.0 × 10^9 /L), 88.7 × 10^9 /L (range, 21.3–622.7 × 10^9 /L), and 131.5 × 10^9 /L (range, 12–392 × 10^9 /L), respectively.

Using the PCV and platelet count cutoff from the Rai staging criteria, 33 patients (71.7%) had anemia and 18 patients (39.1%) had thrombocytopenia. Eighteen patients (39.1%) presented at Rai stage 4, whereas 23 (50%) presented at Rai stage 3 and 5 (10.9%) at Rai stage 2. None of the patients presented at Rai stage 0 or 1 or Binet stage A; 41 patients (89.1%) presented at Binet stage C, and 5 (10.9%) at Binet stage B.

### Binet's staging system and VH genes are independent but complementary prognostic indicators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112ZTSup]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Rai's and Binet's staging systems have significantly contributed to identifying major prognostic groups in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, they fail to accurately predict disease progression at the individual level. Biologic factors, such as the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable genes (VH), cytogenetics, CD38 expression, and some serum markers, have recently improved prognostic assessment in CLL. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic value of VH mutational status within the different stages of Binet's classification in 145 patients.

Our series consisted of 83 VH mutated (MT) and 62 VH unmutated (UM) patients. MT cases predominated within Binet's stage A (70%), whereas UM cases predominated among stages B and C (62%).

Median overall survival (OS) was 84 months for UM patients and was not achieved for the MT group (70% 12-year survival, P < 0.0001). Concerning Binet's stage A, both median OS and progression-free survival were significantly shorter for UM patients compared to MT patients (97 months vs. not achieved, P = .0017; and 42 vs. 156 months, P < 0.0001), which compared favorably with the classical A' and A" substaging. The VH mutational profile could also segregate stage B and C patients into two groups with different survival patterns (median OS: 78 vs. 120 months for UM and MT patients, respectively, P = .002).

The significant survival differences observed between the VH mutational groups, among stage A and stage B and C patients, indicate that Binet's classification provides valuable prognostic insights in combination with VH gene status.

### Clinical presentation, progression, and outcome of patients with clonal B-cell counts of less than 5 × 10(9)/l, 5 to 10 × 10(9)/l, and more than 10 × 10(9)/l and chronic lymphocytic leukemia immunophenotype [^112hGoib]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study focused on the flow cytometric evaluation of peripheral lymphocytosis, which has led to a significant increase in the diagnosis of early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). However, few studies exist to delineate the natural history and differences between MBL and CLL.

- **Methods**: Applying the recently updated B-lymphocyte threshold of 5 × 10(9) B lymphocytes/L for the diagnosis of CLL, the study evaluated the differences in initial presentation, disease progression, time to treatment (TTT), and 10-year overall survival rates between patients with less than 5 × 10(9)/L, 5 to 10 × 10(9)/L, and more than 10 × 10(9)/L B cells. These clinical and treatment parameters were compared among the MBL, 5 to 10 CLL Rai stage 0, and more than 10 CLL Rai stage 0 groups.

- **Results**: A total of 310 patients were included in the study, with 67 in the less than 5 group, 75 in the 5 to 10 group, and 168 in the more than 10 B-cell groups. Statistically significant differences were observed when comparing the 5 to 10 and more than 10 B-cell groups in terms of anemia (P = .021 for median hemoglobin; p = 0.028 for anemia < 11 g/dL), platelet count (P = .041 for median platelet count), splenomegaly (P = .013), initial management plan (P = .012 for observation; p = 0.0021 for treatment with chemotherapy), and TTT (P = .0033). No statistically significant difference was seen among the MBL, 5 to 10, and more than 10 CLL Rai stage 0 groups regarding TTT and 10-year overall survival.

- **Conclusions**: The findings suggest that patients with B-cell counts of 5 to 10 × 10(9)/L behave clinically more similarly to patients with higher B-cell counts, highlighting the need for careful differentiation and management of these conditions.

### Total body computed tomography scan in the initial work-up of Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients: Results of the prospective, multicenter O-CLL1-GISL study [^112VWsD3]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Total body computed tomography (TB-CT) scan is not mandatory in the diagnostic/staging algorithm of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The aim of this study was to determine the value and prognostic significance of the TB-CT scan in early-stage CLL patients. Baseline TB-CT scans were performed in 240 Binet stage A CLL patients (179 Rai low- and 61 Rai intermediate-risk) included in a prospective multicenter observational study (clinicaltrial.gov ID: NCT00917549). The cohort included 69 clinical monoclonal B lymphocytosis (cMBLs).

Patients were restaged considering only radiological data. Following TB-CT scans, 20% of cases were reclassified as radiologic Binet (r-Binet) stage B. r-Binet B patients showed a higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.027), as well as a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.001). At multivariate analysis, the r-Binet stage [HR = 2.48; P = 0.004] and IGHV mutational status [HR = 3.01; P = 0.002] retained an independent predictive value for PFS.

Among 179 Rai low-risk cases, 100 were redefined as r-Rai intermediate-risk based upon TB-CT scan data, showing a higher rate of cases with higher ZAP-70 (P = 0.033) and CD38 expression (P = 0.029) and β2-microglobulin levels (P < 0.0001), as well as a shorter PFS than those with r-Rai low-risk (P = 0.008). r-Rai stage [HR = 2.78; P = 0.046] and IGHV mutational status [HR = 4.25; P = 0.009] retained a significant predictive value for PFS at multivariate analysis.

Forty-two percent of cMBL patients were reclassified as r-small lymphocytic lymphomas (r-SLLs) by TB-CT scan. TB-CT scan appears to provide relevant information in early-stage CLL.

However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (peripheral blood clonal lymphocytosis that does not meet other criteria for CLL). Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are [text cut off].

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^116PDiTT]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal B cell malignant disease characterized by lymphocytosis, which involves the progressive accumulation of clonal B cells in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, permitting easy diagnosis from the peripheral blood. The clinical features of CLL at presentation are related to the accumulation of these leukemic cells.

CLL predominantly affects the elderly, with a median age of 65–72 years at diagnosis. It is a slowly progressive disease, with an 81.7% five-year survival rate. It accounts for 17%-20% of all hematologic malignancies in Nigeria, with 2–6 per 100,000 new cases diagnosed annually. CLL accounts for one-quarter of the new cases of leukemia, with an age-adjusted incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States. The incidence varies widely across geographical locations, with Asia having a 5–10-fold lower prevalence. It is more common in males and is mostly seen in the elderly (age > 65 years), with some familial tendency being alleged.

Diagnosis requires peripheral blood lymphocytosis, an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of ≥ 5 × 10^9, and clonality confirmed by immunophenotyping (IMPT). Staging of the tumor is usually done at diagnosis using Rai or Binet staging, both of which are used for prognosis and decision on the commencement of therapy. The system uses lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and cytopenias (anemia and thrombocytopenia) to establish prognostic groups that can be used to predict median survival. The Rai and Binet staging systems were the first prognostic markers to affect disease management.

### International prognostic score for asymptomatic early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^111mMx9k]. Blood (2020). High credibility.

Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are diagnosed with early-stage disease and managed with active surveillance. The individual course of patients with early-stage CLL is heterogeneous, and their probability of needing treatment is hardly anticipated at diagnosis. We aimed at developing an international prognostic score to predict time to first treatment (TTFT) in patients with CLL with early, asymptomatic disease (International Prognostic Score for Early-stage CLL [IPS-E]).

Individual patient data from 11 international cohorts of patients with early-stage CLL (n = 4933) were analyzed to build and validate the prognostic score. Three covariates were consistently and independently correlated with TTFT: unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable gene (IGHV), absolute lymphocyte count higher than 15 × 10^9/L, and presence of palpable lymph nodes. The IPS-E was the sum of the covariates (1 point each) and separated low-risk (score 0), intermediate-risk (score 1), and high-risk (score 2–3) patients, showing a distinct TTFT. The score accuracy was validated in 9 cohorts staged by the Binet system and 1 cohort staged by the Rai system. The C-index was 0.74 in the training series and 0.70 in the aggregate of validation series.

By meta-analysis of the training and validation cohorts, the 5-year cumulative risk for treatment start was 8.4%, 28.4%, and 61.2% among low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively. The IPS-E is a simple and robust prognostic model that predicts the likelihood of treatment requirement in patients with early-stage CLL.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115k4sFT]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

We have not overlooked the uniqueness of including WBC count as a prognostic biomarker in this study. More commonly, B-cell lymphocyte count is employed in the diagnosis and response to therapy in CLL. However, we demonstrate here that, commensurate with previously published studies, WBC count may deserve consideration as a clinically useful surrogate marker of disease burden, particularly in the setting of untreated disease where, alongside del17p and unmutated IGHV gene status, it appears to demonstrate prognostic significance. This observation is consistent with previous data demonstrating WBC count, along with IGHV, as independent predictors of TFS in Binet A CLL.

Finally, CD49d, a well-proven independent prognosticator in CLL, including in cases of early-stage disease, failed, perhaps surprisingly, to emerge in multivariable analysis as an independent factor in our Rai 0 training cohort. We hypothesize that the dropout of CD49d in multivariate analysis was due to the close relationship between CD49d and tris12, the latter maintained in the final multivariable model; this idea is supported by bivariate analysis of these two variables wherein CD49d lost significance (data not shown).

In conclusion, we present here a novel laboratory-based scoring system for Rai 0 CLL to aid clinical decision-making in cases of early-stage disease. These findings advocate a role for immunocytogenetic analysis in Rai 0 CLL at the time of diagnosis to aid prognosis, particularly in today's chemo-free era where early intervention is acquiring momentum in the investigative setting.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment [^1171sgXn]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a low-grade B-lineage lymphoid malignancy but may have more heterogeneity than previously thought. Many cases require no treatment at all because of an indolent course, while other patients become symptomatic or develop signs of rapid progression. Treatment is usually noncurative and is directed at reducing the symptoms. Some molecular risk features may help delineate, at initial diagnosis, which patients will have a more aggressive course. Newer CLL treatment regimens incorporating purine nucleoside analogues and monoclonal antibodies have increased the rate of molecular complete remissions, which may lead to better survival times. Reduced intensity allogeneic transplant conditioning regimens have made the potentially curative modality more widely available. All these treatments have significant risks for infectious complications, which must be carefully weighed against the risks posed by the underlying disease. A proposed risk-based treatment algorithm is discussed.
