## Question

Is clomiphene effective at increasing serum testosterone in men

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clomiphene citrate is effective at increasing serum testosterone in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action to ensure the pharmacology plausibly supports a testosterone-raising effect. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence from randomized and controlled studies. Next, I will review large observational cohorts for durability and generalizability. After that, I need to check guideline positions to understand how authoritative bodies weigh the evidence. I will then examine predictors of response to refine patient selection. Finally, I should assess safety, including hematologic and thrombotic risks, and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats about off-label status and monitoring needs [^111BQEis] [^112hv3eS].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if clomiphene does not plausibly increase gonadotropins, it is unlikely to raise testosterone meaningfully in men. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that blocks estrogen feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary, which disinhibits GnRH pulsatility and increases LH and FSH, thereby stimulating Leydig cell testosterone production and supporting spermatogenesis; this mechanistic framework predicts an increase in endogenous testosterone without the suppression seen with exogenous testosterone, which I should keep in mind as I interpret clinical data [^112Z9yEk] [^112hv3eS].

> Next, I should review randomized and controlled data to avoid overinterpreting observational signals. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of men with obesity-associated secondary hypogonadism, 12 weeks of clomiphene 50 mg daily significantly increased total testosterone, free testosterone, LH, and FSH versus placebo, with improvements in body composition, which directly supports efficacy in at least one well-defined phenotype of secondary hypogonadism [^1112UQ3S]. Wait, let me verify comparative data as well: a randomized prospective trial in hypogonadal infertile men showed clomiphene raised testosterone more than anastrozole over 12 weeks, reinforcing a robust biochemical effect, though semen parameters did not change in that short interval, which tempers fertility expectations in the near term [^114jQkx3]. I should also note that enclomiphene, the trans-isomer, has phase II data showing testosterone increases comparable to testosterone gel while preserving or increasing sperm counts, aligning with the expected SERM mechanism, though this is not definitive regulatory-grade evidence for clomiphene itself [^117UQXuQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from small RCTs; I need to check larger real-world cohorts for consistency and durability. Multiple retrospective series of 153–400 men with hypogonadism report that approximately 73–89% achieve a clinically meaningful biochemical response, with mean total testosterone rising from roughly 9–10 nmol/L to 16–19 nmol/L and sustained increases documented up to 8 years in some cohorts, which strengthens confidence in external validity and long-term biochemical efficacy when appropriately selected patients are treated and monitored [^114T1LiJ] [^113err84] [^113aaYDt]. Let me double-check the magnitude of change: across studies, increases on the order of 200–350 ng/dL are typical, consistent with the RCT signal and with guideline summaries noting testosterone rises similar to gel formulations in some contexts [^112hv3eS].

> I should confirm how guidelines position this therapy, because regulatory and professional guidance frames both expectations and counseling. The Endocrine Society notes that SERMs, including clomiphene, have been used empirically in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism but emphasizes that neither efficacy nor safety has been definitively established in large randomized trials, which means use remains off-label and evidence-informed rather than guideline-endorsed as first-line therapy [^111BQEis]. The AUA guideline, in contrast, reports that clomiphene can increase testosterone to levels similar to testosterone gel with a favorable side effect profile and lower cost, and highlights preservation of spermatogenesis relative to exogenous testosterone, which is clinically pivotal for men who desire fertility [^112hv3eS]. But wait, I should verify the FDA status: clomiphene is not FDA-approved for male hypogonadism, so prescribing is off-label and should be accompanied by informed consent and appropriate monitoring plans [^1111AmGS].

> Let me consider predictors of response, because patient selection likely influences biochemical and symptomatic outcomes. Lower-normal baseline LH and larger testicular volume have been associated with greater testosterone rises, suggesting that men with more functional secondary hypogonadism and preserved testicular reserve respond best, whereas hypergonadotropic primary testicular failure responds less often, though not never; I should be cautious here, as some cohorts show mixed predictive value for gonadotropins, underscoring heterogeneity and the need for individualized trials with early reassessment [^11749747] [^116QVJiK] [^113aaYDt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought baseline gonadotropins would consistently predict response, but at least one analysis did not find LH/FSH to be strong linear predictors, so I should avoid overgeneralization and instead use early on-therapy labs to gauge response and tolerability [^116QVJiK].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed, especially hematologic and thrombotic risks that sometimes drive monitoring decisions. Compared with testosterone replacement, clomiphene is associated with a substantially lower prevalence of secondary polycythemia in multi-institutional data, which is a meaningful advantage in men at risk for erythrocytosis or thrombotic events, though vigilance remains prudent [^113AL6JT]. I should confirm ocular and neurovascular signals: visual disturbances and rare thromboembolic events, including intracranial venous thrombosis, have been reported in men on clomiphene, so new visual symptoms or neurologic complaints warrant prompt evaluation and dose interruption while alternative causes are excluded [^114myNVE]. Let me reconsider the overall tolerability: pooled series suggest adverse effects in roughly 4–11% and are often mild, with mood changes, hot flashes, and nipple tenderness predominating, but I should counsel patients explicitly about visual symptoms and thrombotic red flags given case-level signals [^114psMf5] [^116yyRHj].

> Next, I should review how clomiphene compares clinically with exogenous testosterone, because men often ask about trade-offs in symptom relief versus fertility preservation. Satisfaction with symptom control appears broadly similar across modalities despite lower achieved total testosterone with clomiphene compared with injections, and clomiphene preserves or increases intratesticular testosterone and spermatogenesis, whereas exogenous testosterone suppresses gonadotropins and can cause azoospermia; this mechanistic and clinical distinction is central when fertility is a priority [^112F2xpT] [^113dATTE] [^113ErgG2]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with fertility guidelines: the AUA/ASRM guidance advises avoiding testosterone monotherapy in men desiring fertility and supports considering SERMs, including clomiphene, as part of a fertility-sparing approach, which reinforces the practical role of clomiphene in that niche [^113ErgG2].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases to avoid overpromising. In obesity-associated secondary hypogonadism, clomiphene improved testosterone and body composition in a placebo-controlled RCT, suggesting utility where reversible functional suppression is prominent, though lifestyle modification remains foundational and should be addressed in parallel [^1112UQ3S]. For men with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, response rates are lower but not zero; case series and cohorts document biochemical responders even among men with primary testicular disorders, so a time-limited therapeutic trial with early reassessment is reasonable when fertility preservation is paramount, while counseling about lower likelihood of benefit [^113aaYDt]. But wait, what if the patient is on or transitioning from exogenous testosterone? Combination strategies using hCG with or without clomiphene can aid spermatogenesis recovery after testosterone-induced suppression, and emerging data suggest nasal testosterone may allow symptom control with less gonadotropin suppression when switching from clomiphene, though close monitoring of gonadotropins and semen parameters is essential during such transitions [^1138RVFj] [^11568PEz] [^115v4kRV].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overstating certainty. The weight of evidence indicates that clomiphene citrate is effective at increasing serum testosterone in a substantial proportion of appropriately selected men, particularly those with functional secondary hypogonadism, with typical increases of 200–350 ng/dL and biochemical response rates around 70–90% in observational cohorts and corroborated by randomized data in obesity-related hypogonadism; durability up to several years is reported, though high-quality long-term randomized trials remain limited [^1112UQ3S] [^114T1LiJ] [^113err84]. I should confirm the practical implications: use is off-label, requires informed consent, and should be accompanied by structured monitoring of testosterone, gonadotropins, estradiol, hematocrit, and symptom trajectories, with dose titration and discontinuation if goals are not met or adverse effects emerge; in men prioritizing fertility, clomiphene offers a compelling alternative to exogenous testosterone, whereas in men without fertility goals, shared decision-making should weigh modest symptom data, convenience, and cost against the robust evidence base supporting testosterone therapy [^1111AmGS] [^112hv3eS] [^111BQEis].

Clomiphene citrate is effective at increasing serum testosterone in men with **secondary hypogonadism** [^117KQMh3], with typical increases of 100–300 ng/dL within 4–6 weeks [^113aaYDt] and sustained normalization in most patients [^113err84]. It is less effective in **primary hypogonadism** due to testicular failure [^113aaYDt] and is not FDA-approved for male hypogonadism [^1111AmGS]; use is off-label and should be individualized [^11783YRU]. Clomiphene preserves spermatogenesis [^112hv3eS], making it a preferred option for men who desire fertility [^1161uZrP], but it can cause mood changes, visual disturbances, and gynecomastia [^1111AmGS]; regular monitoring is recommended [^116ksMPB].

---

## Mechanism of action

Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that **blocks estrogen receptors** in the hypothalamus and pituitary, reducing negative feedback and increasing GnRH, LH, and FSH [^113qEfHe]. This stimulates testicular Leydig cells to produce testosterone and supports spermatogenesis [^113qEfHe].

---

## Clinical evidence of efficacy

Multiple studies and reviews show clomiphene effectively **raises testosterone** in men with secondary hypogonadism:

- **Short-term effects**: In a prospective study of 36 men with hypogonadism, 25 mg/day increased testosterone from 247.6 ± 39.8 ng/dL to 610.0 ± 178.6 ng/dL within 4–6 weeks (P < 0.00001) [^112KWwjx].
- **Long-term effects**: A retrospective study of 400 men (mean treatment 25.5 months) found 88% achieved eugonadal testosterone (> 300 ng/dL), with sustained increases up to 8 years in some cases [^113err84] [^114T1LiJ].
- **Comparison with testosterone therapy**: Clomiphene increases testosterone comparably to testosterone gels, with the advantage of preserving spermatogenesis [^112hv3eS] [^112F2xpT].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from clomiphene therapy

Clomiphene is **most effective in men with secondary hypogonadism** (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), in whom the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is intact but underactive [^11783YRU]. It is less effective in **primary hypogonadism** due to testicular failure [^113aaYDt].

---

## Factors influencing response to clomiphene therapy

Several factors influence **response to clomiphene**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on response** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger men respond better; response declines with age [^117KQMh3] |
| Baseline LH/FSH | Low-normal gonadotropins predict better response [^115NE2db] |
| Testicular volume | Larger testicular volume correlates with better response [^11749747] |
| Comorbidities | Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease reduce response [^117KQMh3] |

---

## Safety and side effects

Clomiphene is **generally well tolerated**, but adverse effects include:

- **Common side effects**: Mood changes, visual disturbances, gynecomastia, hot flashes, headache, and dizziness [^1111AmGS] [^116yyRHj].
- **Rare side effects**: Thromboembolic events (e.g. intracranial venous thrombosis) have been reported [^114myNVE].
- **Comparison with testosterone therapy**: Clomiphene has a lower risk of polycythemia than testosterone replacement therapy [^113AL6JT].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **FDA approval**: Clomiphene is not FDA-approved for male hypogonadism; use is off-label [^1111AmGS].
- **Individual response**: Not all men respond; some may require alternative therapies (e.g. hCG, testosterone replacement) [^113ErgG2].
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of testosterone, LH, FSH, and estradiol is recommended to optimize therapy and minimize side effects [^notfound].

---

Clomiphene citrate is effective at increasing serum testosterone in men with secondary hypogonadism, with **sustained normalization in most patients** [^113err84]. It is particularly useful for men who desire fertility, as it preserves spermatogenesis [^112hv3eS]. However, it is not FDA-approved for male hypogonadism [^1111AmGS], and individual response varies; careful patient selection and monitoring are essential [^11749747].

Purpose

Clomiphene citrate may be used as an off label treatment of hypogonadism. There are few long-term data on clomiphene citrate efficacy and safety when administered for more than 3 years. We assessed improvements in testosterone and hypogonadal symptoms while on clomiphene citrate for extended periods.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective review to identify patients treated with clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism (baseline testosterone less than 300 ng/dl) at a total of 2 institutions from 2010 to 2018. We assessed the duration of clomiphene citrate therapy, serum testosterone levels, symptom improvement and clomiphene citrate side effects.

Results

A total of 400 patients underwent clomiphene citrate treatment for a mean ± SD of 25.5 ± 20.48 months (range 0 to 84). Of the patients 280 received clomiphene citrate for 3 years or less (mean 12.75 ± 9.52 months) and 120 received it for more than 3 years (mean 51.93 ± 10.52 months). Of men on clomiphene citrate for more than 3 years 88% achieved eugonadism, 77% reported improved symptoms and 8% reported side effects. Estradiol was significantly increased following clomiphene citrate treatment. Results did not significantly differ between patients treated for more than 3, or 3 or fewer years. The most common side effects reported by patients treated more than 3 years included changes in mood in 5, blurred vision in 3 and breast tenderness in 2. There was no significant adverse event in any patient treated with clomiphene citrate.

Conclusions

Clomiphene citrate is not typically offered as primary treatment of hypogonadism in men who do not desire fertility preservation. These data demonstrate that clomiphene citrate is safe and effective with few side effects when used as long-term treatment of hypogonadism.

### Predicting biochemical response to clomiphene citrate in men with hypogonadism [^11749747]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clomiphene citrate (CC) is as an effective treatment for men with hypogonadism (HG). Identifying the ideal candidate for this strategy has to date largely relied upon a patient's interest in preservation of testicular volume and spermatogenesis.

Aim

This analysis was undertaken to define if predictors existed of robust elevation in serum testosterone (T) levels in response to CC.

Methods

Seventy-six men with a diagnosis of HG (two separate early morning total T levels < 300ng/dL) opting for CC therapy constituted the study population. Demographic, comorbidity data, and physical and laboratory characteristics were recorded. Laboratory tests were conducted 4 weeks after commencement and every 6 months thereafter. Multivariable analysis was conducted to define if predictors of biochemical response could be identified. Parameters included in the model were patient age, mean testicular volume, varicocele presence, and baseline total T, free T, and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.

Main Outcome Measure

Successful biochemical response to CC, defined as an increase of ≥ 200ng/dL in total T level at ≥ 6 months after commencing CC, was the main outcome measure.

Results

Mean age was 46 ± 22 years. Mean pretreatment testicular volume was 16 ± 8mL. Mean baseline T and LH levels were 179 ± 72ng/dL and 7.2 ± 5.6IU/mL, respectively. Mean total T on CC was 467 ± 190ng/dL. Forty-seven patients (62%) met the responder definition, with a mean increase in total T levels of 302 ± 76 (204–464) ng/dL. In CC responders, the mean LH rise was 5.6 ± 3.1IU/mL. On multivariable analysis, factors predictive of CC response included: mean testicular volume (adjusted [adj.] r = 0.32, P < 0.01), mean testicular volume ≥ 14mL (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, P < 0.01), LH level (adj. r = 0.48, P < 0.001), and LH level ≤ 6IU/mL (HR 3.5, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data indicate that two thirds of men with HG meet a robust responder definition and that pretreatment testicular volume and LH levels (in continuous and dichotomized fashions) are predictors of response.

### Clomiphene increases free testosterone levels in men with both secondary hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction: who does and does not benefit? [^117KQMh3]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Secondary hypogonadism is more common than primary gonadal failure and is seen in chronic and acute illnesses. Although testosterone has a role in erections, its importance in erectile dysfunction (ED) has been controversial. Hypogonadism produced by functional suppression of pituitary gonadotropins has been shown to correct with clomiphene citrate, but with a modest effect on sexual function. We wondered if longer treatment would produce improved results. A total of 178 men with secondary hypogonadism and ED received clomiphene citrate for 4 months. Sexual function improved in 75%, with no change in 25%, while significant increases in luteinizing hormone (P < 0.001) and free testosterone (P < 0.001) occurred in all patients. Multivariable analysis showed that responses decreased significantly with aging (P < 0.05). Decreased responses also occurred in men with diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and multiple medication use. Since these conditions are more prevalent with aging, chronic disease may be a more important determinant of sexual dysfunction. Men with anxiety-related disorders responded better to normalization of testosterone. Assessment of androgen status should be accomplished in all men with ED. For those with lower than normal age-matched levels of testosterone treatment directed at normalizing testosterone with clomiphene citrate is a viable alternative to giving androgen supplements.

5 CONCLUSION

Clomiphene citrate therapy for hypogonadal males shows promising effect on both clinical symptoms and the biochemical testosterone insufficiency with few reported side effects and good safety aspects compared with TTh. Therefore, it is worth to be considered especially in males presenting with symptoms of hypogonadism and low testosterone who wish to preserve their testicular function and are not eligible for TTh. Low to normal LH at baseline seems to predict biochemical and clinical effectiveness. Further research with clear inclusion criteria, adequate measurement of hormonal levels and registration of symptoms and side effects is recommended.

Testosterone therapy — indication and regimen selection — We recommend testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of testosterone deficiency. Clinicians can initiate testosterone therapy with any of the therapeutic regimens described in Tables 5 and 6, based on the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost, and clomiphene citrate has been used empirically in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; however, neither its efficacy nor its safety has been demonstrated in randomized trials.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114T1LiJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypogonadism is a worldwide problem among men causing sexual, physical and mental problems. Testosterone therapy is the first-choice treatment for male hypogonadism, with several side effects, that is, subfertility. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off-label therapy for a certain group of hypogonadal males, especially for those with an active or future child wish. There is scarce literature in usage of CC for men with hypogonadism. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC for hypogonadal males.

Methods

In this single-centre study, men treated with CC for hypogonadism were evaluated retrospectively. Primary outcome was hormonal evaluation including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary outcomes were hypogonadal symptoms, metabolic and lipid parameters, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), prostate specific antigen (PSA), side effects, the effect of a trial without medication and potential predictors for biochemical and clinical response.

Results

In total, 153 hypogonadal men were treated with CC. Mean TT, FT, LH and FSH increased during treatment. TT increased from 9 to 16nmol/L, with a biochemical increase in 89% of the patients. In patients who continued CC treatment, an increased level of TT persisted after 8years of treatment. With CC treatment, 74% of the patients experienced hypogonadal symptom improvement. LH at the lower normal range before CC treatment was predictive for better TT response. During CC therapy, few side effects were reported and no clinical important changes in PSA, Hb and Ht were found.

Conclusion

Clomiphene citrate is an effective therapy on short and long term, improving both clinical symptoms and biochemical markers of male hypogonadism with few side effects and good safety aspects.

### Clomiphene citrate effects on testosterone / estrogen ratio in male hypogonadism [^112KWwjx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

Symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism is associated not only with a decline in serum testosterone, but also with a rise in serum estradiol. These endocrine changes negatively affect libido, sexual function, mood, behavior, lean body mass, and bone density. Currently, the most common treatment is exogenous testosterone therapy. This treatment can be associated with skin irritation, gynecomastia, nipple tenderness, testicular atrophy, and decline in sperm counts. In this study we investigated the efficacy of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of hypogonadism with the objectives of raising endogenous serum testosterone (T) and improving the testosterone/estrogen (T/E) ratio.

Methods

Our cohort consisted of 36 Caucasian men with hypogonadism defined as serum testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL. Each patient was treated with a daily dose of 25 mg clomiphene citrate and followed prospectively. Analysis of baseline and follow-up serum levels of testosterone and estradiol levels were performed.

Results

The mean age was 39 years, and the mean pretreatment testosterone and estrogen levels were 247.6 ± 39.8 ng/dL and 32.3 ± 10.9, respectively. By the first follow-up visit (4–6 weeks), the mean testosterone level rose to 610.0 ± 178.6 ng/dL (P < 0.00001). Moreover, the T/E ratio improved from 8.7 to 14.2 (P < 0.001). There were no side effects reported by the patients.

Conclusions

Low dose clomiphene citrate is effective in elevating serum testosterone levels and improving the testosterone/estradiol ratio in men with hypogonadism. This therapy represents an alternative to testosterone therapy by stimulating the endogenous androgen production pathway.

### Baseline gonadotropin levels and testosterone response in hypogonadal men treated with clomiphene citrate [^116QVJiK]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the role of baseline gonadotropins in predicting the biochemical response to clomiphene citrate (CC) treatment.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of data from hypogonadal men treated with CC in 2 high-volume fertility centers between 2013 and 2018. Patient age, body mass index, and baseline hormones (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], and total testosterone [TT]) were obtained. Response to treatment was measured as changes in TT levels within 6 months of initiating CC treatment. Linear regression models adjusted for age, body mass index, and time on CC therapy were fitted to assess the associations between baseline LH and FSH levels with treatment response.

Results

A total of 332 men with mean ± standard deviation age of 36.2 ± 8.2 years were included. Median time to initial follow-up was 6 weeks (25th-75th interquartile range [IQR]: 4–9 weeks). TT levels increased significantly on CC treatment (mean change: 329.2 ng/dL, 95% CI: 307.4–351.0) with 73% of men having at least 200 ng/dL increase over baseline TT levels. In univariable linear regression models, only age was significantly associated with TT response. Neither the baseline LH nor FSH significantly predicted TT response in linear regression models.

Conclusion

CC treatment results in significant increases in testosterone levels in most men. Baseline gonadotropins are not strong predictors for treatment response to CC. Adequate biochemical response with CC trial can be expected in most patients with normal or slightly elevated baseline gonadotropin levels.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^115TzjwF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Male hypogonadism is a biochemical and clinical testosterone deficiency syndrome with a prevalence of symptomatic hypogonadism ranging between 2.1% and 5.7% in males aged above 30 years of age.,

Prevalence increases with age and certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity and malignancies. Decreased libido, lack of energy, mood changes, decreased muscle mass, and erectile dysfunction are common hypogonadal symptoms. Testosterone therapy (TTh) is the treatment of first choice for male hypogonadism. However, exogenous testosterone leads to negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis, causing suppression of endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Other side effects are, changed lipid serum, polycythaemia and gynecomastia.

Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off‐label pharmacological treatment for a certain group of males with hypogonadism. CC is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, occupying oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and so, stimulating testicular endogenous testosterone production and preserving spermatogenesis.

Since the 1960s, CC has been often used for ovulation induction in females. For males, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not approve the medicine with reason of unclear clinical effect because of the lack of well‐controlled and well‐powered controlled trials. However, CC is described over more than 30 years off‐label to hypogonadal men, especially those with an active or future child wish, or hypogonadal males who do not want to use TTh. Compared to TTh, CC is easy in usage and comes with little costs. For example, in our country, costs of CC are about 12 times lower than regular TTh.

To support the outcomes in the scarce literature on the efficacy of CC therapy, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC therapy for male hypogonadism.

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis effects and urinary detection following clomiphene administration in males [^116WCeDt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Clomiphene is a performance-enhancing drug commonly abused by males in sport, but the extent to which testosterone increases in healthy males following its use is unknown. In addition, evidence suggests that clomiphene, a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers zuclomiphene and enclomiphene, is detectable in urine for months following use; the isomer-specific urinary detection window has yet to be characterized in a controlled study.

Objective

To determine the effect of once-daily, 30-day clomiphene treatment on serum testosterone and gonadotropin levels in the subject population studied and the urinary clearance and detection window of clomiphene isomers following administration for antidoping purposes.

Participants and Design

Twelve healthy males aged 25 to 38 years, representing a recreational athlete population, participated in this open-label, single-arm study.

Intervention

Oral clomiphene citrate (50 mg) was self-administered once daily for 30 days. Serum and urine samples were collected at baseline and at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37, 44, 51, and 58; urine collections continued periodically up to day 261.

Results

Mean testosterone, LH, and FSH levels increased 146% (SEM, ± 23%), 177% (± 34%), and 170% (± 33%), respectively, during treatment compared with baseline. Serum drug concentrations and urinary excretion were nonuniform among individuals as isomeric concentrations varied. The zuclomiphene urinary detection window ranged from 121 to > 261 days.

Conclusions

Clomiphene significantly raised serum testosterone and gonadotropin levels in healthy men and thus can be abused as a performance-enhancing drug. Such abuse is detectable in urine for ≥ 4 months following short-term use.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111Gbvjr]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Male factor infertility affect up to 50% of couples unable to conceive spontaneously. Several non-hormonal pharmacological treatments have been proposed to boost spermatogenesis and increase chances of conception in men with infertility. Still, no clear evidence exists on the most effective treatment strategy.

Objective

We aimed to compare the effectiveness of non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for men with infertility using a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until October 2023 for randomised/quasi-randomised trials that evaluated any non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for men with idiopathic semen abnormalities or those with hypogonadism. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses using a random effect model. We assessed risk of bias, heterogeneity, and network inconsistency. We calculated the mean rank and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each intervention the maximum likelihood to achieve each of reported outcomes. We reported primarily on sperm concentration and other important semen and biochemical outcomes using standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence-intervals(CI).

Results

We included 14 randomised trials evaluating four treatments (Clomiphene citrate, Tamoxifen, Aromatase inhibitors, anti-oxidants) and their combinations in 1342 men. The overall quality of included trials was low. Sperm concentration improved with clomiphene compared to anti-oxidants (SMD 2.15, 95%CI 0.78–3.52), aromatase inhibitor (SMD 2.93, 95%CI 1.23–4.62), tamoxifen (SMD − 1.96, 95%CI -3.57; -0.36) but not compared to placebo (SMD − 1.53, 95%CI -3.52–0.47). Clomiphene had the highest likelihood to achieve the maximum change in sperm concentration (SUCRA 97.4). All treatments showed similar effect for sperm motility, semen volume, and normal sperm morphology. FSH levels showed significant improvement with clomiphene vs.anti-oxidant (SMD 1.48, 95%CI 0.44–2.51) but not compared to placebo. The evidence networks for LH and testosterone suffered from significant inconsistency (p = 0.01) with similar trend of improvement with clomiphene compared to other treatments but not compared to placebo.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Clomiphene, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors to optimise semen parameters in men with infertility. Future randomised trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of clomiphene in improving fertility outcomes in men.

### Testosterone supplementation versus clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism: an age matched comparison of satisfaction and efficacy [^112F2xpT]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared satisfaction and treatment efficacy in men with symptomatic hypogonadism who received clomiphene citrate or testosterone supplementation therapy.

Materials and Methods

Men treated with clomiphene citrate, or testosterone injections or gels for symptomatic hypogonadism (total testosterone less than 300 ng/dl) reported satisfaction with the current treatment regimen using the qADAM questionnaire.

Results

A total of 93 men on testosterone injections (31) or gels (31), or clomiphene citrate (31) were age matched from a retrospective cohort of 1,150 on testosterone supplementation therapy. We compared men who received testosterone supplementation therapy to 31 not on such therapy, who served as controls. Median serum testosterone increased from pretreatment levels in all men regardless of therapy with clomiphene citrate, and testosterone injections and gels (from 247 to 504, 224 to 1,104 and 230 to 412 ng/dl, respectively, p < 0.05). Final median serum total testosterone in men on clomiphene citrate (504 ng/dl) was lower than in men receiving testosterone injections (1,014 ng/dl, p < 0.01) but similar to that in men on testosterone gels (412 ng/dl, p = 0.31). Despite different serum testosterone levels men on all 3 therapies reported similar satisfaction on qADAM, including a score of 35 for clomiphene citrate, 39 for testosterone injections, 36 for testosterone gels and 34 for control treatment (p > 0.05). Men receiving testosterone injections reported greater libido than men on clomiphene citrate (4 vs 3, p = 0.04) or testosterone gels (4 vs 3, p = 0.04), or controls (4 vs 3, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Testosterone supplementation regimens and clomiphene citrate are efficacious for improving serum total testosterone. No difference in overall hypogonadal symptoms was noted among men on any testosterone supplementation therapy. Despite lower serum total testosterone, men on clomiphene citrate and testosterone gels reported satisfaction similar to that of men treated with testosterone injections.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113nGTLb]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Future research need

Clomiphene consistently ranked as the most likely treatment to improve clinical outcomes in men with infertility over other treatment options, however, it did not demonstrate significant efficacy compared to placebo. Due to suboptimal trial methodology, none of the included trials reported sufficient longitudinal outcomes to enable adequate evaluation of the mechanistic effect of clomiphene in the trial cohort compared to placebo. There is a need for an adequately powered randomised trial to confirm the true efficacy of clomiphene on the semen parameters, biochemical, hormonal, and clinical outcomes of men with infertility. Specifically, there is a need for an extended evaluation of the longterm reproductive outcomes with the use of clomiphene, especially regarding its safety and tolerability.

There is a need to explore the effect of potential effect modifiers (e.g. age, BMI, dose, and adherence). Given the paucity of trials and limited reporting, prospective individual participant meta-analysis of future trial is required to achieve this objective. Future IPD meta-analyses using individual data from both randomised and observational studies with adequate adjustment for key confounders could also offer higher quality evidence and inform the design of future randomised trials.

None of the included trials sought input from lay consumers on study design or the choice of outcome reporting. Beyond conception, these pharmacological treatments could have a significant impact on men's quality of life which was reported only in one trial. Incorporating patient reported outcomes measures is critical in future trials as well as adopting established core outcome sets.

### WITHDRAWN: clomiphene or tamoxifen for idiopathic oligo / asthenospermia [^113qEfHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Oligo-astheno-teratospermia (sperm of low concentration, reduced motility and increased abnormal morphology) of unknown cause is common and the need for treatment is felt by patients and doctors alike. As a result, a variety of empirical, non-specific treatments have been used in an attempt to improve semen characteristics and fertility. The administration of anti-oestrogens is a common treatment because anti oestrogens interfere with the normal negative feedback of sex steroids at hypothalamic and pituitary levels in order to increase endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion directly from the pituitary. In turn, FSH and LH stimulate Leydig cells in the testes, and this has been claimed to lead to increased local testosterone production, thereby boosting spermatogenesis with a possible improvement in fertility. There may also be a direct effect of anti-oestrogens on testicular spermatogenesis or steroidogenesis. This review considers the available evidence of the effect of both Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen, both of which have a predominant anti-oestrogenic effect, for idiopathic oligo and/or asthenospermia.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the effects of treating subfertile men with anti-oestrogens (clomiphene or tamoxifen) on pregnancy rates among couples where subfertility has been attributed to idiopathic oligo- and/or asthenospermia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Subfertility Review Group specialised register of controlled trials was searched".

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of anti-oestrogen therapy for 3 months or more compared to placebo or no placebo for subfertile males among couples where subfertility is attributed to male factor.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Any differences were resolved with a third reviewer.

Main Results

Ten studies involving 738 men were included. Five of the trials did not specify method of randomisation. Anti-oestrogens had a positive effect on endocrinal outcomes, such as serum testosterone levels. In trials with secure randomisation there was no difference in the pregnancy rate between the anti-oestrogen groups and the control groups (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.56). The overall pregnancy rate for these five trials was 15.4% compared to the spontaneous rate of 12.5% in the control groups. These odds increased to 1.56 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 2.19) when all 10 trials were included, but this result is likely to be artificially inflated.

Authors' Conclusions

Anti-oestrogens appear to have a beneficial effect on endocrinal outcomes, but there is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of anti-oestrogens for increasing the fertility of males with idiopathic oligo-asthenospermia [This abstract was prepared centrally.].

### A new look at the medical management of infertility [^111m861X]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Effective therapies are available for the treatment of infertility owing to specific causes. Most hormonal imbalances can be readily identified and successfully treated. The treatment of men with unexplained idiopathic infertility remains difficult. The availability of a multitude of agents ranging from hormones to nutritional supplements emphasizes the fact that none are consistently effective. There is no good way to predict which patients will respond to a specific treatment. Idiopathic infertility may result from multiple discrete defects in sperm generation and maturation that are as yet unidentified. A better understanding of these defects will yield more effective treatment options and appropriate triage of patients to specific therapeutic regimens. Assisted reproductive techniques remain an option for patients with idiopathic male infertility; however, they are expensive and treat the female partner for a male problem. Multiple gestations and other complications are not infrequent. Initial management should be directed at improving the quality of semen to facilitate natural conception. Specific abnormalities should be corrected. If empiric pharmacologic therapy is to be used, treatment should last at least 3 to 6 months to incorporate a full 74-day spermatogenic cycle. The infertile couple should be advised of the inconsistent response to therapy and the low conception rate that may follow when compared with the results of ART. When empiric therapy is decided upon, antiestrogens may be used and are effective in a subset of patients. The authors prefer to use clomiphene citrate, 25 mg per day. The dose may be increased to 50 or 75 mg to raise testosterone levels to the upper normal range. Lack of a significant improvement in semen parameters or of a pregnancy after a 3- to 6-month treatment period may be an indication to proceed with ART.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^112xZxPf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study is supporting evidence for the long‐term efficacy of CC in hypogonadal males with increases in total testosterone, free testosterone and gonadotrophins and a total biochemical increase in TT in 89% of the patients. Therewithal, in 74% of patients, a clinical effect was observed as described as an improvement of hypogonadal symptoms with CC therapy. In total 81% of the patients had both a biochemical and clinical response. This study is, to our knowledge, the first large retrospective cohort study on both clinical and biochemical effect of CC in hypogonadal males with long follow‐up and identification of potential predictors for success.

Levels of TT, FT, LH, FSH and SHBG increased after start treatment. Increased testosterone levels lasted with ongoing treatment until 8 years of FU. This improvement of hormone levels has been described in previous studies, showing TT at baseline ranging between 7 and 11 nmol/L and at first measurement during treatment ranging between 16 and 24 nmol/L (n = 34–400). The results of testosterone and gonadotrophins show that CC is effective in increasing endogenous testosterone secretion by stimulating the HPG axis in hypogonadal men. Only 10% of our study population was biochemical non‐responder, all these patients stopped CC therapy during the first 6 months. In the study, mean LH before treatment was 4.7 IU/L in the responder group and 13.7 IU/L in the non‐responder group. Of the 16 patients with hypergonadotropic patients, six were biochemical responders. Of which, the patient with Klinefelter who showed a biochemical and symptomatic improvement.

For further research and practice it is important to be critical who to include or to prescribe CC therapy. However with these results, it could be considered to try CC therapy also in hypergonadotropic patients. Although, it could be recommended then to do an early testosterone measurement, to evaluate the biochemical response and for early detection of a potential reversed effect. Furthermore, it is debatable if patients with TT levels > 12 nmol/L and < 15 nmol/L should be included. However, in all these eight patients there was a biochemical improvement and in six of them (75%) there was clinical improvement (increased libido). Considering of inclusion of these patients is supported by the study of Zitzmann (2006), showing that testosterone deficiency symptoms may also be seen with TT levels as high as 15 nmol/L.

### A randomized prospective double-blind comparison trial of clomiphene citrate and anastrozole in raising testosterone in hypogonadal infertile men [^114jQkx3]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

Clomiphene citrate (CC) and anastrozole (AZ) have been used off label to increase testosterone (T) in hypogonadal infertile men (HIM). Both medications have been shown to increase T with different effects on estradiol (E2) and T-to-E2 ratios. There are no reported randomized trials comparing CC and AZ to improve T levels in HIM. We aimed to establish equivalence of CC vs. AZ with respect to improvement in T levels in HIM.

Methods

We randomized 26 HIM (T less than 350ng/dL and normal luteinizing hormone [LH]). Patients were randomized to CC (25mg/day) or AZ (1mg/day) for 12 weeks. Hormones assayed were total T, free T, E2, LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Patient-reported outcomes were the International Index of Erectile Function, Erection Hardness Scale, and the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male questionnaires. Blood tests and questionnaires were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Semen analyses were performed at baseline and 12 weeks.

Results

T increased significantly from baseline in both groups at 6 and 12 weeks. There was a significantly larger increase in T and mean increase from baseline in CC vs. AZ (571 vs. 408ng/dL, respectively). Whereas E-2 levels increased in the CC group, they decreased in the AZ group. Though both groups demonstrated an increase in T-to-E-2 ratio from baseline, statistic significance at 6 and 12 weeks was only achieved with AZ. Neither group demonstrated significant changes in seminal parameters or patient-reported outcomes.

Conclusions

We failed to demonstrate equivalence of CC vs. AZ. CC resulted in significantly higher T levels than AZ. AZ resulted in a significantly larger increase in T/E-2 ratio than CC. No significant differences between CC and AZ on seminal parameters or patient-reported outcomes were demonstrated.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^112hv3eS]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for testosterone deficiency — in men with testosterone deficiency, SERMs are described as oral agents that block estradiol (E2) feedback resulting in increased luteinizing hormone (LH), and clomiphene citrate showed increases in serum testosterone similar to testosterone gel with a favorable side effect profile and lower cost; two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found sperm concentration was maintained with SERMs (comparable to placebo) but significantly decreased with exogenous testosterone; in a prospective, double-blind RCT in infertile males with testosterone deficiency, clomiphene resulted in significantly higher serum testosterone than anastrozole, whereas anastrozole resulted in significantly higher testosterone-to-estradiol (T:E) ratios, and neither treatment changed semen parameters; clinicians are advised that benefits of exogenous testosterone therapy cannot be extrapolated to these alternative therapies.

### Clomiphene citrate in the treatment of idiopathic or functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men: a case series and review of the literature [^113Z7SqM]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Late-onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (LOH) is a complex, heterogeneous entity. Whenever treatment is indicated, the endocrine literature has recommend testosterone replacement. We present our experience with clomiphene citrate treatment in patients with LOH and a review of the literature.

Methods

This retrospective case series included 18 male patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, roughly according to the European Male Aging Study criteria for LOH, attended at an academic hospital outpatient clinic. Data were retrieved from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results

The patients' mean age (± SD) was 44.3 ± 6.3 years (range 21–67 years) referred for evaluation of low testosterone together with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue or tiredness, anxiety, and osteoporosis. Clomiphene was initially prescribed at doses between 25 mg 3 times a week and 50 mg/day. At 6 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment, mean basal total-testosterone increased from 7.6 ± 2.6 to 19.3 ± 5.2 nmol/L (P < .0001). Mean basal luteinizing hormone (LH) increased from 2.7 ± 2.1 to 8.3 ± 3.5 nmol/L (P < .0001). Mean basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increased from 4.2 ± 3.6 to 8.6 ± 6.2 nmol/L (P = 0.007). Testosterone and LH responses were invariably observed, including 2 patients with history of nonpituitary cranial pathologies, 2 with somewhat elevated FSH, and 1 with an eating disorder. Twelve (67%) patients reported improvement in symptoms. Side effects included transient nipple tenderness in 1 patient.

Conclusion

Available data suggest that clomiphene is an efficient and convenient alternative to testosterone replacement therapy in a substantial subset of patients with LOH. Additional long-term controlled studies should further establish the role of clomiphene in LOH.

### Select patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may respond to treatment with clomiphene citrate [^116FkYwL]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the management of male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and evaluate the efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC).

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Two university-based urology clinics.

Patient(S)

Ten patients referred for male infertility evaluation.

Intervention(S)

Patients were treated with either clomiphene citrate or injectable gonadotropins.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Changes in seminal parameters, gonadotropin levels, serum testosterone, and pregnancy.

Result(S)

Ten men who were evaluated for infertility were diagnosed with HH. Four had Kallmann's syndrome, four idiopathic HH, and two panhypopituitarism. Eight patients were azoospermic, and two were oligospermic on presentation. Three of the four men with adult-onset idiopathic HH responded to CC alone with increases in testosterone, FSH, and LH. Semen parameters in this group also improved, and two of the three men achieved pregnancies with CC alone. Out of the ten men actively attempting conception, four pregnancies were achieved. Three pregnancies (two with CC and one with gonadotropins) were in men diagnosed with adult-onset idiopathic forms of HH.

Conclusion(S)

Select patients with adult-onset idiopathic forms of HH may benefit from a trial of clomiphene citrate.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1111AmGS]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) — clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen — are detailed for dosing, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms, adverse effects, and regulatory status. Clomiphene citrate dosing is 25–50 mg orally every 1–2 days with T Max = 5 hours and T 1/2 = 5–7 days; it reduces negative feedback on pit gonadotropin release with a resultant increase in gonadotropins (LH, FSH), and adverse effects include visual symptoms, flushing, headache, and abdominal discomfort. Tamoxifen dosing is 20 mg orally daily and lists T Max = 5 hours and T 1/2 = 5–7 days; it inhibits hypothalamic and pituitary estrogen receptors blocking estrogen negative feedback on gonadotropin release, increasing hypothalamic pituitarygonadal gonadotropin release, and adverse effects include liver abnormalities, liver enzyme changes, ocular disturbances including cataracts, and thromboembolic events including deep venous thrombosis and stroke. Both agents are noted as not FDA-approved for use in males.

### The treatment of hypogonadism in men of reproductive age [^1161uZrP]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the mechanisms of T replacement therapy's inhibition of spermatogenesis and current therapeutic approaches in reproductive aged men.

Design

Review of published literature.

Setting

PubMed search from 1990–2012.

Patient(S)

PubMed search from 1990–2012.

Intervention(S)

A literature review was performed.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen analysis and pregnancy outcomes, time to recovery of spermatogenesis, serum and intratesticular T levels.

Result(S)

Exogenous T suppresses intratesticular T production, which is an absolute prerequisite for normal spermatogenesis. Therapies that protect the testis involve hCG therapy or selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators, but may also include low-dose hCG with exogenous T. Off-label use of selective ER modulators, such as clomiphene citrate (CC), are effective for maintaining T production long term and offer the convenience of representing a safe, oral therapy. At present, routine use of aromatase inhibitors is not recommended based on a lack of long-term data.

Conclusion(S)

Exogenous T supplementation decreases sperm production. Studies of hormonal contraception indicate that most men have a return of normal sperm production within 1 year after discontinuation. Clomiphene citrate is a safe and effective therapy for men who desire to maintain future potential fertility. Although less frequently used in the general population, hCG therapy with or without T supplementation represents an alternative treatment.

### The safety and efficacy of clomiphene citrate in hypoandrogenic and subfertile men [^1119Eqhd]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2015). Low credibility.

Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC) in infertile and hypoandrogenic men through a retrospective study between September 2013 and May 2014. We identified 47 men between 18 and 55 years placed on 50mg CC every other day. We evaluated the effect of CC on testosterone after 2 weeks, rates of adverse effects and predictors of CC response. Mean baseline testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and estradiol were 246.8ngdl(-1), 125.5ngdl(-1) and 20.8pgdl(-1), respectively. At 2 weeks, mean testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and estradiol increased to 527.6ngdl(-1), 281.8ngdl(-1) and 32.0pgdl(-1) (all P < 0.001). Two patients at 2 weeks and one patient at 3 months had a paradoxical decrease in testosterone. Mean total motile count (TMC) and concentration increased from 59.7 million (s.e.m.: 16.5) and 50.7 millionsml(-1) (s.e.m.: 11.1) at baseline to 90.9 million (s.e.m.: 25.9) and 72.5millionsml(-1) (s.e.m.: 17.5), respectively, at 3 months, although this was nonsignificant (P = 0.09, 0.09). No patient on CC experienced a paradoxical decrease in TMC or sperm concentration. On age-adjusted regression analysis, age, BMI, longitudinal testis axis, baseline follicle-stimulating hormone, LH and estradiol did not correlate with improvement in bioavailable testosterone at 2 weeks. CC improves testosterone and may improve semen parameters, although a small percentage of men may not demonstrate improvement in testosterone.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114uZQ6L]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A reversed effect of CC on testosterone levels was found in two young hypergonadotropic patients (< 1%). Although this phenomenon has been described before in the literature, the physiology of this paradoxical effect of CC is unclear.

There are several limitations to address for this study. First, it has a retrospective character, with data obtained manually from patient files. There were no strict inclusion criteria with predefined baseline and outcome measurements. No validated instrument for reporting hypogonadal symptoms could be used because there does not exist a Dutch validated hypogonadism questionnaire, but self‐reported hypogonadal symptoms and subjective symptom improvement was evaluated during follow‐up. Second, because this was not a placebo controlled trial, it is difficult to conclude if clinical improvement is the result of CC therapy. Third, in 130 patients, the presence of side effects was not reported, and side effects were not systematically classified. This may have caused an underestimation of the actual prevalence of side effects. Fourth, dosage at start of therapy was chosen based on weight, based on expert opinion in 2012. For future research and for clinical practice it is recommended with this gap in knowledge to start with the minimal dosage not depending on weight and to titrate dosage up if there is no sufficient effect. As last to mention, the included patients had different origins of hypogonadism. This is causing heterogeneity and does not imply that the effect of the study do count for all different subgroups. Nevertheless, with the encouraging outcomes of this study, we believe it is very valuable to execute a prospective study, especially for young hypogonadal males with an active or potential future child wish who are not eligible for TTh, with clear inclusion criteria, adequate measurement of hormonal levels, symptomatology with the usage of a validated questionnaire and registration of side effects.

### Men converting from clomiphene citrate to natesto with a desire to maintain spermatogenesis should be followed closely [^11568PEz]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a testosterone deficient man desiring maintenance of spermatogenesis converting from clomiphene citrate (CC) to Natesto, who had a decrease in gonadotropins and semen parameter values after making this medication change. The data on men maintaining gonadotropins and semen parameter values after converting from CC to Natesto is also reported.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed. Baseline hormones prior to treatment, and again on CC and Natesto, as well as semen parameters on CC and on Natesto were assessed.

Results

A 32-year-old testosterone deficient man desiring to maintain future fertility potential who had a poor symptomatic response to CC despite an adequate serum testosterone response was converted to Natesto 11 mg twice daily. His gonadotropins diminished as did his semen parameter values but with dose titration of Natesto to 11 mg in the morning and 5.5 mg in the evening he had normalization of gonadotropins and a rise in semen parameter values back towards his values on CC with a continued satisfactory symptomatic response. The remainder of the 49 men to date converting from CC to Natesto revealed stability in gonadotropins and semen parameter values.

Conclusion

Testosterone deficient men interested in maintaining spermatogenesis who convert from CC to Natesto seeking a more robust symptomatic response should be followed closely with repeat serum gonadotropins and semen parameters to confirm that spermatogenesis is not being suppressed. Dose titration of Natesto may be effective at optimizing gonadotropins, semen parameter values, testosterone levels, and symptomatic response to treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism in men seeking to preserve fertility-what are the options? [^113eYZKn]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results in low testosterone levels and frequently leads to infertility. The syndrome occurs due to disruption at one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is the most common treatment utilised for male hypogonadism. However, long-acting forms of TRT leads to infertility and so is inappropriate for patients wishing to conceive. For patients who wish to remain fertile, nasal TRT, clomiphene citrate, exogenous gonadotropins, gonadotropin releasing hormone and aromatase inhibitors have been used as alternative treatment options with different degrees of success. A review of the literature was performed to identify the safety and efficacy of alternative treatment options. Gonadotropin releasing hormone can successfully induce spermatogenesis but is impractical to administer. Likewise, aromatase inhibitors have limited use due to inducing osteopenia. Nasal TRT may be a good treatment option for these patients, but its efficacy has so far only been demonstrated in small sample sizes. However, clomiphene citrate and exogenous gonadotropins are safe, offer good symptom control and can successfully induce fertility in hypogonadism patients.

3.2 Hormonal evaluation

Data of hormonal levels are provided in Table 2. The first measurement during treatment was at a median of 1.5 months (range, 1–12). Levels of TT, FT, LH, FSH and SHBG increased, and albumin decreased at first measurement during treatment and annually thereafter till 8 years of FU (p ≤ .05) (Figures 1. and 2). All eight patients with TT levels > 12.1 nmol/L and < 15 nmol/L showed increased levels of TT and FT. At first measurement during treatment, median TT increased from 9 to 16 nmol/L, with a biochemical increase in 136 patients (89%) during CC treatment (Table 3). Fifteen patients (10%) were biochemical non‐responders, these patients stopped treatment between 1 and 6 months after starting CC therapy. In this non‐responder group, mean LH before treatment was 13.7 IU/L (range, 4.6–29), compared with a mean of 4.7 IU/L (range, 0.6–25) in the responder group.

Biochemical and clinical response of CC therapy and hypogonadal symptom improvement.

Sixteen patients (10%) were classified before treatment as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. In this hypergonadotropic hypogonadism group 6/16 were biochemical responders (38%), of which the patient with Klinefelter. The Klinefelter patient showed an increase in TT of 6 nmol/L tot 14 nmol/L and FT from 140 pmol/L to 280 pmol/L during CC treatment. In the orchiectomy patient group, 11/41 patients were hypergonadotropic, and 9/11 patients hypergonadotropic hypogonadal orchiectomy patients were biochemical non‐responders. Two hypergonadotropic patients (1%) had a reversed response of TT after start of CC therapy (see section 4.8).

### Complete reversal of adult-onset isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with clomiphene citrate [^113vvvCR]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion in men by T is principally mediated by aromatization to estrogen (E), which inhibits hypothalamic secretion of GnRH. We hypothesized that adult-onset isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) might result from an altered central set-point for E-mediated negative feedback.

Design and Setting

Longitudinal clinical investigation unit-based evaluation of the clinical and biochemical response to E-receptor blockade.

Patient(S)

A 31-year-old man presenting with an 18-month history of sexual dysfunction resulting from severe adult-onset IHH (LH 1.7 U/L, FSH 2.0 U/L, T 3.5 nmol/L).

Intervention(S)

Initial therapy with 50 mg of clomiphene citrate (CC) three times a day for 7 days, with overnight LH pulse profiling and 9 am T levels evaluated at baseline and on completion. A 2-month washout period, followed by low-dose maintenance therapy (25–50 mg/d) for 4 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Baseline and stimulated T levels and LH pulsatility; effect on sexual function.

Result(S)

Clomiphene therapy resulted in complete normalization of pulsatile gonadotropin secretion, serum T level, and sexual function.

Conclusion(S)

Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may result from an acquired defect of enhanced hypothalamic sensitivity to E-mediated negative feedback. Whereas direct T replacement therapy can further suppress endogenous gonadotropin secretion, treating IHH men with gonadotropins can stimulate endogenous T secretion and enhance fertility potential. On theoretical grounds, reversal of gonadotropin deficiency with CC might be expected to have a similar biological effect.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^116TscLt]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

It is unknown whether CC is effective on the long term. In our study, there was a sustained biochemical effect of CC, with the longest long‐term FU of 8 years. Three earlier studies (n = 29–120) indicated that after 24–52 months of CC use, hormone levels were stable. It is worth focusing on the 52 patients who underwent a TWM to gain further insight in this long‐term effect. In the current study, there was a decrease in TT levels < 15 nmol/L after stopping CC in 94% of the patients and in 65% of the patients < 12.1 nmol/L. This effect was also seen by Marconi et al. (2016) (n = 27) demonstrating during trial without CC therapy that 78% of the patients had decreased TT levels of < 10 nmol/ after 3 months, and all patients had decreased TT levels of < 10 nmol/L after 6 months. Remarkably, only 38% of patients in the current study reported worsening of hypogonadal symptoms while on TWM and only 32% of the TWM patients continued CC therapy after TWM. Furthermore, in the current study, 33% of patients ceased CC treatment in the first year and almost half of them by the end of the study, with no correlation between discontinuation in the first year and pre‐treatment TT levels, age or hypogonadism aetiology. Despite improvement of TT levels, most mentioned reason for stopping was that patients did not experience enough effects of CC treatment. A possible explanation for not continuing CC therapy after TWM is that the symptoms were not impeding them as much as they did before treatment start and during the first time of treatment. Either, the symptoms were mild or patients life or relational situation changed and the hypogonadal symptoms hindered them less than before and not enough to take long‐term medication. Further studies should consider stricter inclusion criteria such as low testosterone levels (< 12.1 nmol/L) and use validated symptom questionnaires to objective symptom severity.

### Converting men from clomiphene citrate to natesto for hypogonadism improves libido, maintains semen parameters, and reduces estradiol [^115v4kRV]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate outcomes including libido, semen parameters, testosterone, estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone when converting men with low libido on Clomiphene Citrate (CC) to Natesto.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed. Baseline hormones prior to treatment, and again on CC and Natesto, as well as semen parameters on CC and on Natesto were assessed.

Results

In 41 men, there was no difference in serum testosterone levels on CC vs Natesto, however; there was a significantly higher E2 on CC than on Natesto. Although FSH levels were significantly lower on Natesto than at baseline, the mean FSH level on Natesto remained in the normal reference range. There was no difference in luteinizing hormone levels at baseline vs on Natesto. There was not a significant difference in semen parameter values when men were on CC vs when they were on Natesto for 3 months. At 3 months after changing to Natesto, 38 of 41 (92.7%) men reported significantly improved libido on Natesto when compared to CC.

Conclusion

Men on CC and Natesto reach eugonadal testosterone levels, however; on CC the E2 level nearly doubled from baseline, and converting men from CC to Natesto returned E2 to nearly baseline levels. There was not a detrimental effect on semen parameters, and there was subjective reporting of improved libido after converting from CC to Natesto in this cohort, but further long-term studies are needed prior to Natesto being established as a definitive treatment for hypogonadism for men desiring to maintain fertility.

2.5 Data analysis

Data were recorded and tabulated with Microsoft Excel® software. Values were presented as number (%), mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (25th–75th percentile interquartile range [IQR]) if data were not normally distributed. Normality of continuous variables was tested with the Shapiro–Wilk‐test, histograms and normality‐quantile plots. Paired sample t‐test was used to compare before‐ and during treatment hormonal levels, safety aspects, serum lipids, BMI. The Wilcoxon signed ranked test was used if the data did not meet the assumptions for normality. Assumptions for correlation analysis were normality, homoscedasticity and linearity. The Pearson test was used for bivariate correlation, if data did not meet the assumption for normality the Spearman test was used. A p ‐value ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ksMPB]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Empirical pharmacological treatment for men with hypogonadism and/or idiopathic infertility have featured in the medical literature for more than five decades, however, evidence on effective and safe treatment strategy remains inconclusive. In contrast to previously published pairwise meta-analysis of observational and randomised evidence, our network meta-analysis showed limited efficacy for all evaluated treatment options over placebo. The decision to start such treatments depends on the underpinning cause of infertility, patient characteristics, and overall treatment objectives.

Most of the included trials evaluated these treatments in men with idiopathic infertility. However, it is important to distinguish the perceived benefit among men with hypogonadism compared to those with normal testosterone levels. Specifically, men with a reduced testosterone/estradiol ratio may see more benefit associated with clomiphene and aromatase inhibitor therapy. Similarly, men with high BMI or advanced age may also demonstrate more benefit following SERMs/AIs therapy compared to those with no other predisposing factors.

The magnitude of benefit may also vary depending on the degree of semen abnormality. While most of the included trial in our review demonstrated some improvement in sperm concentration, the magnitude of changes was smaller among men with very low sperm count. Due to limited reporting, were unable to further explore the mechanistic effect of evaluated treatment on varied semen abnormalities (e.g. low vs. very low sperm count).

The desired benefit should, therefore, be considered within the overall treatment strategy. Adopting non-hormonal pharmacological treatments could help to boost the chances of natural conception in couple with mild male factor infertility. It could also be adopted as intermediate treatment to increase the chances of surgically retrieving good quality sperm in men with very low sperm count and maximise the chance of conception with assisted conception.

Finally, most of the included trials introduced the treatment for a short period of time (3–6 months) with limited reporting on longterm clinical and reproductive outcomes. Both SERMS and AI are well tolerated with limited profile of side effects, however, careful monitoring and surveillance is recommended for prolonged use beyond what is reported in our meta-analysis.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112J4RCs]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

The network for evaluating the impact on Testosterone suffered from significant inconsistency (p = 0.01) and we therefore employed an inconsistency model(Supplementary Fig. 1 0). Clomiphene significantly increased Testosterone compared to other treatments (clomiphene vs. anti-oxidants (SMD 2.06 95%CI 1.34 to -2.79); clomiphene vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD 2.57 95%CI 1.25 to 3.89); tamoxifen vs. clomiphene (SMD − 1.16 95%CI -2.03 to -0.30) but not compared to placebo (SMD 0.04 95%CI -0.85 to 0.93)). All of the other active treatments did not show significant effect compared to placebo (placebo vs. anti-oxidants (SMD 2.10 95%CI 1.33 to 2.87); placebo vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD 2.61 95%CI 1.23 to 3.98); tamoxifen vs. placebo (SMD − 1.20 95%CI -2.18 to -0.22); tamoxifen + anti-oxidants vs. placebo (SMD − 0.60 95%CI -1.99 to 0.79) (Supplementary Fig. 1 0b). Clomiphene had the highest likelihood of achieving an increase in Testosterone (SUCRA 82.3) followed by Tamoxifen + Anti-oxidant (SUCRA 76.9) (Supplementary Fig. 1 0c).

We explored sources of inconsistency with a sidesplit approach. Significant inconsistency emerged from trials that include a placebo or anti-oxidants comparison arm (Supplementary Table 3).

Reproductive outcomes

Only three trials reported on clinical pregnancy and we were unable to capture any of the other planned reproductive outcomes in our protocol. A meta-analysis was not possible although there was a reported increase in pregnancy with the use of clomiphene vs. placebo in two trials and with tamoxifen vs. placebo in one trial (Supplementary Table 4).

### A comparison of secondary polycythemia in hypogonadal men Treated with clomiphene citrate versus testosterone replacement: a multi-institutional study [^113AL6JT]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the relative prevalence of secondary polycythemia in hypogonadal men treated with clomiphene citrate or testosterone replacement therapy.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective, multi-institutional study, we included 188 men who received clomiphene citrate and 175 who received testosterone replacement therapy with symptomatic hypogonadism. The overall prevalence and ORs of secondary polycythemia for clomiphene citrate treatment vs testosterone replacement were primarily measured, as were baseline characteristics. Subset analysis included polycythemia rates for different types of testosterone replacement therapy.

Results

Overall, men on testosterone replacement therapy were older than clomiphene citrate treated men (age 51.5 vs 38 years). Men on testosterone replacement had longer treatment duration than clomiphene citrate treated men (19.6 vs 9.2 months). For testosterone replacement therapy and clomiphene citrate the mean change in hematocrit was 3.0% and 0.6%, and the mean change in serum testosterone was 333.1 and 367.6 ng/dl, respectively. The prevalence of polycythemia in men on testosterone replacement was 11.2% vs 1.7% in men on clomiphene citrate (p = 0.0003). This significance remained on logistic regression after correcting for age, site, smoking history and pretreatment hematocrit.

Conclusions

The prevalence of polycythemia in men treated with clomiphene citrate was markedly lower than that in men on testosterone replacement therapy. The improvement in absolute serum testosterone levels was similar to that in men on testosterone replacement. There is no significant risk of polycythemia in men treated with clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism.

### Effects of clomiphene citrate on male obesity-associated hypogonadism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1112UQ3S]. International Journal of Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity causes secondary hypogonadism (HG) in men. Standard testosterone (T) replacement therapy improves metabolic parameters but leads to infertility.

Objective

To evaluate clomiphene citrate (CC) treatment of adult men with male obesity-associated secondary hypogonadism (MOSH).

Design

Single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Participants

Seventy-eight men aged 36.5 ± 7.8years with a body mass index (BMI) > 30kg/m 2, total testosterone (TT) ≤ 300ng/dL, and symptoms in the ADAM questionnaire.

Intervention

Random allocation to receive 50mg CC or placebo (PLB) for 12 weeks.

Outcomes

(1) Clinical features: ADAM and sexual behavior questionnaires; (2) hormonal profile: serum TT, free T, estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); (3) body composition: BMI, waist circumference, and bioelectric impedance analysis; (4) metabolic profile: blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, and lipid profile; (5) endothelial function: flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, quantitative assessment of endothelial progenitor cells and serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and selectin-sE levels; (6) safety aspects: hematocrit, serum prostate-specific antigen, International Prostate Symptom Score, and self-reported adverse effects.

Results

There was an improvement in one sexual complaint (weaker erections; P < 0.001); increases (P < 0.001) in TT, free T, E2, LH, FSH, and SHBG; and improvements in lean mass (P < 0.001), fat-free mass (P = 0.004), and muscle mass (P < 0.001) in the CC group. CC reduced HDL (P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were seen in endothelial function.

Conclusions

CC appeared to effectively improve the hormonal profile and body composition. CC may be an alternative treatment for MOSH in adult men.

### On-label and off-label drugs used in the treatment of male infertility [^115WjMK2]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Infertility affects 6.1 million U.S. couples-representing 10% of reproductive-age adults and 15% of all couples trying to conceive. Half of the time, infertility is the result of an abnormal semen analysis or other male factors, with 40%-50% of these infertile men diagnosed with idiopathic or nonclassifiable infertility. While the role of hormone therapy for men with an identified abnormality is well defined, the literature remains inconclusive and controversial regarding hormone manipulation using empirical (off-label) medical therapies for men with idiopathic infertility. This manuscript reviews the commonly used off-label medications used to treat idiopathic male factor infertility: clomiphene citrate, letrozole/anastrozole, exogenous androgens, and pentoxifylline.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115wLFAM]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infertility is a common disease affecting 8–12% of the world's population with 1 in 7 heterosexual couples seeking fertility treatments. Male factor infertility defined by abnormal semen parameters affects up to 50% of couples (either as sole factor in 20% or joint male/female in 30% of cases). The commonest presentation for male infertility is with a combination of reduced sperm concentration, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology all of which correlate with reduced ability for natural conception. Male infertility and abnormal spermatogenesis have been attributed to several causes including genetic disorders, environmental factors, chronic illness and neoplasm. Still, more than half of all cases are considered idiopathic or are attributed to subclinical hypogonadism. While common, effective medical treatments for men with hypogonadism or idiopathic infertility remains limited with an over reliance on the use of expensive assisted reproductive technology.

Inadequate stimulation of the testes through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis commonly results in impaired testicular function and abnormal spermatogenesis. Interventions aimed at boosting testicular function could help to resolve male infertility, increase the chances of natural conception, and reduce the need for assisted conception.

Several pharmacological hormonal and non-hormonal interventions have been proposed to boost spermatogenesis. Specifically, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g. Clomiphene citrate and Tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (e.g. letrozole and anastrozole) are commonly used as off-license treatments for men with idiopathic infertility. Several interventional and observational studies suggested an improvement by using these non-hormonal treatments to increase sperm concentration and circulating Testosterone. However, current evidence remains limited to pair-wise comparisons across studies with varied methodological limitations.

We aimed to leverage both direct and mixed evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of these non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options compared to placebo and to each other in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114vmYBK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

A retrospective, single‐centre study was conducted in the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht. Hypogonadal men, who wanted to preserve their endogenous testicular function or men who had other reasons for not willing to use TTh and therefore treated with CC within the time frame from January 2012 to January 2021 were included. Ethical approval for this retrospective study was obtained from the local Research Ethics Committee, UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands (WAG/mb/20/500309). All patients were informed that CC is used as an off‐label therapy.

2.2 Patient population

Men aged above 18 years with low (< 12.1 nmol/L, defined by the EAU guidelines)or relatively low TT in combination with clear hypogonadal symptoms, wherefore treatment with CC, were included. Relatively low testosterone was defined as testosterone < 15 nmol/L in combination with, (1) low free testosterone < 243 pmol/L or (2) young adult males with a history of orchiectomy and clear complaints of hypogonadism. No upper cut‐off values for FSH nor LH levels were used for inclusion. Patients with LH levels > 10 IU/L were classified as hypergonadotropic hypogonadal males.

Hypogonadal symptoms were scored by the experienced treating physicians, no validated questionnaires were used. Patients were excluded in case: hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, no assessment of TT/FT was done before or during treatment, CC was used in combination with TTh, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) or if these therapies were used within 12 months of CC initiation.

With the clinical knowledge in 2012 based on expert opinion at that time, men received CC, with a starting dosage of 25 mg every other day, or 25 mg a day in case of bodyweight above 100 kg. Dosage was raised to 50 mg daily when there was little biochemical response. Data of duration of CC therapy, patient characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m)) 2, testicular volume, medical history (HIV, testicular surgery, DM, cardiovascular disease, diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome, malignancies, polycythaemia) and additional medication for erectile dysfunction during treatment were obtained manually from patient files.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^113ErgG2]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) management and endocrine therapy considerations: Patients with HH present with deficient luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH secretion, and referral to an endocrinologist or male reproductive specialist is encouraged; spermatogenesis can be initiated and pregnancies achieved in many men with idiopathic HH when treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH. With gonadotropin treatment for HH, hCG injections are typically initiated with serum testosterone monitored, and after normalization of testosterone, FSH or FSH analogues may be added to optimize sperm production. Exogenous testosterone administration provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that can inhibit gonadotropins such that spermatogenesis may decrease or cease altogether, resulting in azoospermia, supporting avoidance of testosterone monotherapy in men desiring fertility. Although not currently FDA-approved for use in men, SERMs such as clomiphene or tamoxifen are often prescribed to attempt improvement in semen parameters and fertility outcomes. While exogenous FSH may be used as an adjunct for HH with good results, in idiopathic infertile men without HH its fertility benefits are measurable but limited; the cost-to-benefit ratio is questionable because men are typically treated for 3 months or more and the incremental increase in pregnancy rates is small. There are no clear, reliable data to support use of supplements (vitamins, antioxidants, nutritional formulations) for men attempting conception; current data suggest they are likely not harmful but of questionable value in improving fertility outcomes.

### Use of clomiphene citrate to reverse premature andropause secondary to steroid abuse [^1122nu6d]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of symptomatic hypogonadism induced by the abuse of multiple steroid preparations that was subsequently reversed by clomiphene.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University-affiliated andrology practice within family practice clinic.

Patient(S)

A 30-year-old male.

Intervention(S)

Clomiphene citrate, 100-mg challenge for 5 days, followed by treatment at same dose for 2 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical symptoms, androgen decline in aging male questionnaire, total T, FSH, LH.

Result(S)

Reversal of symptoms, normalization of T levels with LH surge, restoration of pituitary-gonadal axis.

Conclusion(S)

Clomiphene citrate is used typically in helping to restore fertility in females. This represents the first case report of the successful use of clomiphene to restore T levels and the pituitary-gonadal axis in a male patient. The axis was previously shut off with multiple anabolic steroid abuse.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^116FerLa]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study population

In total, 173 male patients treated with CC were screened for inclusion. Twenty patients were excluded with reason; four used CC combined with TTh or hCG, six had no wash‐out period longer than 12 months between TTh and before start of CC therapy, two had no before treatment TT and/or FT measurement and eight were lost to FU before any hormonal evaluation. Finally, 153 patients were included for analysis. Data on patient characteristics, comorbidities and dosage at start of treatment, are provided in Table 1. Forty‐one patients had an orchiectomy in the past, 22/41 patients (54%) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of both. Median duration of CC therapy was 10 months (range, 1–96). During the first year of CC, 21 patients (14%) were lost to FU and 50 patients (33%) stopped treatment. At the end‐point of this study (January 2021), 43 patients (28%) were still in FU, 26 patients (17%) were lost to FU, 71 patients (46%) stopped CC therapy and 14 patients (9%) stopped CC and switched to TTh. There was no correlation between discontinuation in the first year and pre‐treatment TT levels, age or hypogonadism aetiology. Dosage was increased (n = 22, 14%) in case of minimal TT response or decreased in case of side effects within the first year (n = 10, 7%). In 145 patients (95%) pre‐treatment TT levels were < 12.1 nmol/L. Two patients (1%) had TT level < 15 nmol/L, but FT levels < 243 pmol/L. Six patients (4%) had TT levels < 15 nmol/L and FT levels < 280 pmol/L. All of these eight patients with TT levels > 12 nmol/L and < 15 nmol/L had clear hypogonadal symptoms.

### Clomiphene citrate for treatment of acromegaly not controlled by conventional therapies [^111NuZk9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Oral estrogens, alone or in combination with somatostatin receptor ligands, have been shown to control acromegaly in women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators resulted in similar effects in both genders. Clomiphene citrate (CC), a selective estrogen receptor modulator that increases LH and FSH secretion, improves hypogonadism and fertility outcomes.

Objective

To assess the impact of CC on serum IGF-1 and T levels in male acromegalic patients not controlled by surgery, radiotherapy, and/or medical treatment.

Study Design

In this prospective, open-label, single-center trial, CC (50 mg/d) was added to previous medical treatment for 3 months. Hormonal assessment was performed before and during the intervention.

Patients

Sixteen male patients (median age, 52.8 y; range, 36–79 y) met the following criteria: IGF-1 above the upper limit of normal range for at least 1 year despite the use of available medical therapies, and T levels within or below the third inferior tertile of normality.

Results

Serum IGF-1 levels decreased by 41% (mean ± SD, 424 ± 108 to 250 ± 83 ng/mL; P < .0004), leading 44% (seven of 16) of the patients to achieve normal IGF-1 levels. Total serum T levels increased by 209% (282 ± 201 to 497 ± 310 ng/dL), reaching normal levels in 67% (four of six) of those patients considered hypogonadal.

Conclusions

Addition of CC should be considered an option in male acromegaly patients not controlled by current available options, with a considerable cost-saving benefit. Furthermore, improvement of T levels can be obtained in those patients with concurrent central hypogonadism.

### Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is a potential biomarker for evaluating intratesticular testosterone [^113dATTE]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intratesticular testosterone is essential for spermatogenesis and can only be reliably measured with invasive testicular sampling. Previous studies have demonstrated good correlation between intratesticular testosterone and serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in men treated with human chorionic gonadotropin. Based on this observation we hypothesized that we can use serum 17-OHP as a serum biomarker for evaluating intratesticular testosterone in men receiving medications that alter serum testosterone.

Materials and Methods

Initially, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of men with a single serum 17-OHP evaluation from July 2018 to March 2019. We followed this with a prospective analysis from July 2018 to October 2019 with evaluation of 140 men including fertile controls, and those receiving treatments that alter serum testosterone at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. According to the data distribution, we reported the median and interquartile ranges, and used the Mann Whitney U or Wilcoxon tests.

Results

In the initial cross-sectional analysis of 93 men, a total of 30 men received treatments that increase or maintain intratesticular testosterone concentrations, such as clomiphene citrate and/or human chorionic gonadotropin; 21 men received treatments that suppress intratesticular testosterone concentrations (various exogenous testosterone replacement therapy formulations) and 42 fertile men with normal serum testosterone (greater than 300 ng/dl) were used as control. We demonstrated that serum testosterone levels were within normal range among men receiving the various therapies. In contrast, we found that serum 17-OHP was undetectable in men who received exogenous testosterone replacement therapy, as opposed to men receiving human chorionic gonadotropin and/or clomiphene citrate or fertile controls (p < 0.05). In the prospective evaluation that ensued, 17-OHP values decreased in the 21 men who received testosterone replacement therapy (47.5 [21–70] to 13.5 [10–23] ng/dl, p < 0.05). Conversely, 17-OHP increased in the 55 men who received human chorionic gonadotropin and/or clomiphene citrate when compared to their baseline levels (42 [24–72] to 88 [61–135] ng/dl, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Serum 17-OHP appears to be a reliable serum marker for intratesticular testosterone levels and could potentially be used to titrate or change medications that alter intratesticular testosterone.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116dfy6L]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this network meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of available non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for men with infertility across a total of fourteen randomised/quasi-randomised trials. While clomiphene seems to outperform other treatment options to achieve an improvement in both semen parameters as well as biochemical outcomes, there was no significant improvement with its use compared to placebo. The use of several anti-oxidants seemed to not yield any significant difference alone or when combined with other active treatments (e.g. clomiphene and tamoxifen). The use of aromatase inhibitors may alter some hormonal function (namely LH), but this did not translate to improvement in semen parameters across included trials. Overall, none of the evaluated treatment options demonstrated efficacy across reported outcomes compared to placebo, and therefore, their clinical value remains uncertain.

3.7 Correlations

A correlation was found between symptom improvement during treatment and a higher increase in TT at first measurement during treatment (p = .000, r = .34). A second correlation was found between a lower range of normal LH and FSH before treatment and a higher increase in TT at first measurement during treatment (p = .000, r = −.37 and p = .000, r = −.40, respectively). A third correlation was found between a low‐normal LH before treatment and improvement of symptoms with CC therapy (p = .02, r = −.21). Further, a correlation was found between a lower increase in TT at first measurement and an orchiectomy in the medical history (p = 0.009, r = −0.21). No correlations were found between first measurement during TT treatment and age, BMI, testis volume, and different subgroups of patients with a presence/history of overweight, cardiovascular disease, chemo‐ and/or radiation therapy, DM, Klinefelter, other malignancies.

3.8 Reversed effect of

Two patients had a reversed biochemical effect within the first 3 months of CC treatment. Patients were 30 and 40 years old, both with a history of orchiectomy for seminoma. The patients used CC therapy 25 mg every other day. TT levels before treatment were 3.7 and 6.1 nmol/L, respectively and during CC treatment 0.5 and 1.3 nmol/L, respectively. LH levels before treatment were 26 and 27 IU/L, respectively and during CC treatment 8.6 and 9.0 IU/L respectively. Before treatment, both patients had fatigue and decreased libido, one patient had erectile dysfunction. Neither improvement nor worsening of symptoms occurred during CC treatment. Treatment was stopped after a second blood test confirmed this reversed effect. After stopping CC therapy, both patients had restoration to before treatment levels of testosterone.

Furthermore, this retrospective study is the first study showing that a better early response of TT is correlated with a better clinical response. The study also shows that low‐normal LH before treatment predicted symptom improvement and a higher increase in TT during CC treatment. This potential predictor was also seen in the study of Mazzola et al. (2014). Without any confirmed mechanism, it is hypothesized that low normal range LH levels demonstrate a better potential for stimulating Leydig cells by CC. Further predictors were demonstrated by Guay et al. (2003) (n = 178) who showed that younger age (< 55 years) and absence of diabetes is a predictor for better TT response. This was not seen in our study. In another study specific enzymes like CYP450 D26 were suggested as predictors for TT response. In our study those enzymes were not measured. Also in earlier studies on CC, CYP450 D26 was not measured.

Symptoms at baseline were reported in 151 patients, in two patients there was, besides a low testosterone, no clarity in the presence of symptoms before treatment. During treatment, 74% of the patients had subjective symptom improvement, with a median duration till improvement of 3 months (range, 1–24). Symptom improvement was noticed in 81% of the biochemical responder patients, and in 27% of the biochemical non‐responder patients. Six of eight patients with TT levels > 12 nmol/L but < 15 nmol/L showed improvement of hypogonadal symptoms during CC therapy. The patient with Klinefelter described an improvement of fatigue during CC treatment. In the orchiectomy patient group with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (n = 11) only the two biochemical responders described symptom improvement.

3.4 Metabolic and lipid parameters

Total cholesterol, LDL‐, HDL‐ and non‐HDL cholesterol decreased during treatment (p < .05). However, it is unclear if all the values were based on fasting blood tests. BMI and triglycerides did not change before and during treatment. Data are available in of the Appendix S1–S2.

3.5 Safety aspects and side effects

There were no changes in Ht, Hb, thrombocytes, liver enzymes and PSA (in Appendix S2). Two patients had marginally elevated Ht during treatment (0.51 L/L), without availability of baseline Ht levels. In one patient, CC therapy was stopped after detecting this elevated Ht (0.51). In the other patient with Ht 0.50, CC therapy was continued and Ht values were monitored. One patient, who had a history of lower extremity thrombosis, developed a lung embolus in the fourth year of FU. In 16 patients (10%) side effect were present, hot flushes (n = 5), agitation (n = 4), visual changes (n = 2), nipple tenderness (n = 2), mood change (n = 1), weight gain (n = 1), blurred vision (n = 1), headache (n = 1), dizziness (n = 1).

3.6 Trial without medication

Fifty‐two patients had a trial without CC therapy (34%), with a median duration of 3 months (range, 1–12). Reasons for TWM were; physician‐initiated testing of CC effect (n = 44, 85%), presence of side effects (hot flushes, agitation, mood disorder) (n = 4, 8%), run out of medication (n = 3, 6%), or extremely elevated estradiol (n = 1, 2%). During TWM, TT decreased significant in 48 of these 52 patients (94%), with a mean TT during CC treatment of 19.1 nmol/L(5.6) and during TWM of 10.8 nmol/L (3.1) (p = .000). Of these patients in whom TT decreased during TWM, 22 patients were obese and 16 patients had an orchiectomy in the past of which two were hyperchonadotropic. The 4/52 patients in whom TT did not decreased, three of them had an orchiectomy in the past, two patients had TT levels between > 12 nmol/L and 15 nmol/L before start treatment and LH levels before start of treatment were in all patients not available. Mean FT during CC therapy was 373.2 pmol/L (126.6) and during TWM 203.3 pmol/L (63.5) (p = .000). Clinically, 20/52 patients noticed a worsening of symptoms during TWM (38%), fatigue (n = 12), libido (n = 8), depressive thoughts (n = 3), erectile dysfunction (n = 2), agitation (n = 2). Eighteen /52 patients (35%) restarted CC therapy after the TWM, three of them were the patients with side effects. In 44% of the patients without noticing a difference in symptoms during TWM, TT levels were > 12 nmol/L during TWM. Eight/35 patients (25%) who did not restart CC after TWM had TT levels before initiating CC treatment of > 12 nmol/L. There was no correlation between discontinuation CC therapy and pre‐treatment TT levels, age or hypogonadism aetiology. Only 14/35 (32%) of the physician‐initiated TWM patients continued CC therapy after TWM.

### Early pharmacologic approaches to avert anabolic steroid-induced male infertility: a narrative review [^116ktyxr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review the impact of testosterone and other androgenic-anabolic steroids (AASs) on male fertility, exploring potential drugs that can be used to preserve or restore male fertility upon AAS use or prior contact.

Methods

A review was performed to provide a unifying clinical link between drugs used to preserve or restore male fertility (ie, clomiphene citrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulators, recombinant luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, and human menopausal gonadotrophin) in the context of AAS-induced infertility and related aspects.

Findings

Human chorionic gonadotropin (125–500 IU every other day), clomiphene citrate (12.5–50 mg/d), recombinant luteinizing hormone (125–500 IU every other day), recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (75–150 IU 1–3×/wk), and human menopausal gonadotrophin (75–150 IU 1–3×/wk) are promising early pharmacologic approaches to avert AAS-induced male infertility. Additionally, a full partner assessment is crucial to the success of a couple planning to have children. The partner's age and gynecopathies must be considered. Egg or sperm cryopreservation can also be alternatives for future fertility. Reinforcing AAS cessation is imperative to achieving better success in misusers.

Implications

The exponential increase in AAS misuse raises concerns about the impact on male fertility. This review suggests that gonadotropin analogs and selective androgen receptor modulators (clomiphene citrate) are viable approaches to early preserve or restore fertility in men on AAS use or with previous contact. However, proper standardization of doses and combinations is required and hence physicians should also be aware of patients' and partners' fertility.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114psMf5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Side effects were reported in 10% of our population and included agitation, hot flushes, nipple tenderness, mood changes, weight gain, visual changes, headache and dizziness. These side effects were also reported in the literature, with a prevalence between 4% and 11%. Most patients with side effects continued CC after the TWM, suggesting that CC's benefits outweighed side effects. Because of the off‐label usage of CC, there are no existing guidelines for monitoring adverse events. Therefore, recommendations are based on experience with exogenous testosterone therapy. Literature shows that TTh can lead to an increase in PSA, Hb and Ht. In our study we found no increase in PSA and Hb, only two patients showed marginal elevated Ht (0.50 and 0.51) during treatment. Baseline Ht levels were not available in these patients, so it is unclear if this elevated Ht was pre‐existent. This was supported by Chandrapal et al. (2016) who demonstrated no increase in PSA, Hb and Ht during CC therapy (n = 77). This was further supported by Krzastek et al. (2019) (n = 76), who found only one patient with increased Ht (0.51) during CC therapy. Wheeler et al. (2017) demonstrated a difference in prevalence of increased Ht with CC and TTh of 2% and 11%, respectively (n = 363). A hypothesis is, that rapid peak increases in TT and overdosing of TT, especially in TTh injections, can lead to treatment‐induced increase in Hb and Ht. Thus, this does not apply for CC therapy, with slow increase in endogenous TT. However, CC can have an oestrogen agonistic activity, leading to activation of clotting factors, leading to an increased coaguliability, with increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although, with this theoretical risk in mind, Kavoussi et al. (2019) showed that the risk of deep venous thrombosis was not increased with CC compared to the general population (n = 1180)It could be considered that patients should be counselled that there are some described cases of thromboembolic events without the knowledge of this was caused by CC. Furthermore, it could be considered that an elevated haematocrit before treatment or thromboembolic events in the past are contraindications. In our study an increase in estradiol was only seen in (1/13) patient where estradiol was measured before and during treatment, in contrast with previous studies. A possible explanation could be that estradiol was measured in only a small number of our study population (n = 13).

### Testosterone treatment in hypogonadal men: prostate-specific antigen level and risk of prostate cancer [^112J47aM]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in hypogonadal men after testosterone replacement by three different methods and attempt to determine any possible relationship between hypogonadism and prostate cancer in this study population.

Methods

A total of 90 consecutive men who had erectile dysfunction and were found to have hypogonadism were monitored with digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of PSA levels before and after testosterone replacement therapy. The patients were treated with one of three options: (1) testosterone enanthate by intramuscular injections, 200 or 300 mg every 2 or 3 weeks (N = 25); (2) testosterone nonscrotal patches, 5 mg daily (N = 16); or (3) clomiphene citrate, 50 mg orally three times a week, in patients with functional secondary hypogonadism (N = 49). Treatment was continued for 2 to 3 months, after which PSA levels were reassessed. Patients with suspicious results on DRE and increased PSA levels before or after treatment with testosterone underwent prostate biopsy. For statistical analysis, patients were categorized into two age-groups — 40 to 60 years old and 61 to 80 years old.

Results

With all methods of testosterone replacement, PSA levels increased in both age-groups. Endogenous testosterone elevation from clomiphene stimulation raised PSA levels the highest, and testosterone patches yielded the least PSA response. Ten men underwent biopsy of the prostate. In one patient, a nodule was found on DRE; the other nine men underwent biopsy because of suspicious PSA levels. Of these patients, two were found to have adenocarcinoma, and a third man who underwent rebiopsy was also found to have cancer. Therefore, 3 of the 90 patients (3.3%) had prostate cancer.

Conclusions

PSA levels increased in response to all types of testosterone replacement, regardless of whether the testosterone level was raised endogenously or exogenously. PSA levels are inappropriately low in hypogonadal men and may mask an underlying cancer. Determining PSA levels before and after testosterone treatment is recommended. Elevated PSA levels before or after testosterone therapy should prompt performance of a urologic evaluation for possible prostate biopsy.

Further considerations

Long-term management of classical hypogonadism

Approximately 10–20% of men with CHH experience reversal of hypogonadism, albeit with risk of relapse. Otherwise, the vast majority of men with organic HH would require lifelong physiological testosterone replacement to avoid androgen deficiency-related end-organ deficits, including anaemia, osteoporosis and muscle wasting. Among the formulations available, long-acting testosterone undecanoate depot injection and transdermal applications are preferred because of their favourable pharmacokinetics in providing stable circulating testosterone concentrations. Once appropriate dosing has been established, annual monitoring of testosterone, haematocrit/haemoglobin for testosterone-induced erythrocytosis, as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men aged ⩾55 years (40 years if high risk) is recommended. In addition, baseline bone mineral density (BMD) measurements is useful to identify patients with low bone mass; testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men has been shown to be effective in improving BMD, and thus antiresorptive agents should be deferred until later life, unless the patient has already sustained a fragility fracture.

Alternative treatment for functional HH: aromatase inhibitors and selective oestrogen receptor modulators

In recent years, there is increasing interest in the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) as alternative modalities in the treatment of male hypogonadism and subfertility. It is crucial to recognize that, in order for these agents to work, hypothalamic–pituitary function must be intact because these act by decreasing oestradiol-mediated negative feedback inhibition. Therefore, AIs/SERMs are only potentially viable in patients with functional, but not organic, causes of HH. Some common scenarios include severe obesity, chronic opiate use, and withdrawal from AASs. But in the absence of robust data on the safety and efficacy of these agents, measures to address the underlying cause and avoidance of testosterone treatment are preferred instead. However, if aetiological factors cannot be resolved satisfactorily, or recovery of spermatogenesis does not occur within a reasonable timeframe, an off-label trial of AIs/SERMs for a limited course (e.g. clomiphene 25 mg, three times per week to 50 mg daily, anastrozole 1 mg, three times per week)might be considered for selected patients before embarking on definitive fertility-induction treatment with gonadotrophins.

Biochemical outcomes

There was limited reporting for other planned secondary outcomes and a direct pairwise meta-analysis was not possible for any of the reported biochemical outcomes.

Network meta-analysis for changes in FSH levels showed significant improvement with clomiphene vs. anti-oxidant (SMD 1.48 95%CI 0.44 to 2.51) but with no significant difference for clomiphene vs. placebo (SMD − 1.13 95%CI -2.40 to 0.15) (Supplementary Fig. 8 b). All other treatments showed similar effect with clomiphene (SUCRA 80.6) and tamoxifen (SUCRA 82.7) showing the highest likelihood for an increase in FSH. There was no significant inconsistency in this network (p = 0.73) (Supplementary Fig. 8 c).

The network for evaluating the impact on LH suffered from significant inconsistency (p = 0.01) and we therefore applied an inconsistency model(Supplementary Fig. 9). Overall, aromatase inhibitors significantly increased LH levels compared to all other treatments (aromatase-inhibitors vs. anti-oxidant (SMD 3.20 95%CI 1.94 to 4.45); clomiphene vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.65 95%CI -3.31 to 0.02); placebo vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.58 95%CI -3.08 to -0.08); tamoxifen vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.34 95%CI -2.47 to -0.21); tamoxifen + anti-oxidant vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.26 95%CI -2.39 to -0.13)) (Supplementary Fig. 9 b) and had the highest likelihood for improving LH (SUCRA 98.8) (Supplementary Fig. 9 c). Similarly, tamoxifen + anti-oxidant showed significant improvements compared to anti-oxidants only (SMD 1.62 95%CI 0.80 to -2.44) and placebo was more effective than anti-oxidants only (SMD 1.55 95%CI 0.46 to -2.64) (Supplementary Fig. 9 b).

### Oral enclomiphene citrate stimulates the endogenous production of testosterone and sperm counts in men with low testosterone: comparison with testosterone gel [^117UQXuQ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clomiphene citrate is employed off-label in men who have low testosterone and for the restoration of sperm counts in men who have used exogenous testosterone. Clomiphene is a mixture of two diastereoisomers: zuclomiphene and enclomiphene. We evaluated enclomiphene citrate in men with secondary hypogonadism.

Aim

Our aim was to compare oral enclomiphene citrate as an alternative to topical testosterone.

Main Outcome Measures

Blood levels of total testosterone (TT), estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone binding globulin, thyroid stimulation hormone, prolactin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 IGF-1 were measured at certain times after treatment with each agent. Sperm parameters were determined at the same visits. Free testosterone (FT) was calculated.

Methods

This was a proof-of-principle, randomized, open-label, fixed dose, active-control, two-center phase IIB study in 12 men with secondary hypogonadism treated previously with topical testosterone.

Results

After discontinuation of topical testosterone, morning TT values averaged 165 ± 66 pg/dL. After 3 months, there was a significant rise in men receiving enclomiphene citrate and gel that was sustained for 3 months. At 6 months, TT levels were 545 ± 268 and 525 ± 256 pg/dL for groups receiving the gel and enclomiphene citrate, respectively. Only men in the enclomiphene citrate group demonstrated increased LH and FSH. TT decreased one month posttreatment to pretreatment values. Enclomiphene citrate elevated sperm counts in seven out of seven men at 3 months and six out of six men at 6 months with sperm concentrations in the 75–334 × 10⁶ /mL range. The gel was ineffective in raising sperm counts above 20 × 10⁶ /mL for all five men at 3 months and raised counts in only two or five men at 6 months. At follow-up, only enclomiphene citrate treatment was associated with elevated sperm counts.

Conclusions

Enclomiphene citrate increased testosterone and sperm counts. Concomitant changes in LH and FSH suggest normalization of endogenous testosterone production and restoration of sperm counts through the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113uCqPt]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We conducted this review following a prospectively registered protocol (CRD42023430179) and reported the findings as per established guidelines.

Eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy

We searched the following electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL) for randomised trials evaluating any treatment option for tubal ectopic pregnancy (from inception till October 2023). We used MeSh headings and keywords combined using Boolean operators (AND, OR) to conduct our searches and adjusted the strategy for each database (Supplementary Appendix 1). We conducted supplementary searches in Google Scholar and Scopus to identify any missing evidence. No search filters or language limitations were employed, articles in non-English language were obtained and translated if deemed relevant. We manually screened bibliographies of potentially relevant articles and published systematic reviews on the topic to identify any additional relevant trials. We did not include any unpublished data in the analysis or studies made available online that were not peer-reviewed.

Study selection

We performed the study selection and data extraction processes in duplicate by three reviewers (JJT, SCM, and OFA) and double checked by two independent reviewers (MPR and BHA). Inconsistencies and disagreement were resolved by discussion and consensus. We included all randomised trials that evaluated the effectiveness of any non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for more than 3 months in men diagnosed with abnormal semen parameters as per the WHO criteria. We included studies with multiple comparison arms, and those evaluating a combination of treatment options (e.g. clomiphene citrate + anti-oxidants). For this review, we considered the use of placebo and no active treatment to be equal. We also considered the use of any herbal or active medical treatment option aimed at reducing oxidative stress and improving sperm quality as an anti-oxidant (Supplementary Table 1). We excluded studies that evaluated a hormonal treatment (e.g. exogenous testosterone) alone or in combination with a non-hormonal treatment option (e.g. tamoxifen). We also excluded studies of non-randomised design, cross over trials, those not reporting on any semen parameters or biochemical outcomes post treatment, those that evaluated the intervention after less than 3 months of active treatment, and studies in animals.

### Clomiphene citrate [^114G4Uhf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:

Estrogen Levels. Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.
Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure. Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.
Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma. The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.
Other Impediments to Pregnancy. Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.
Uterine Fibroids. Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction in vitro fertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.

### Clomiphene citrate [^112Z9yEk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Action

Clomiphene citrate is a drug of considerable pharmacologic potency. With careful selection and proper management of the patient, clomiphene citrate has been demonstrated to be a useful therapy for the anovulatory patient desiring pregnancy.

Clomiphene citrate is capable of interacting with estrogen-receptor-containing tissues, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. It may compete with estrogen for estrogen-receptor-binding sites and may delay replenishment of intracellular estrogen receptors. Clomiphene citrate initiates a series of endocrine events culminating in a preovulatory gonadotropin surge and subsequent follicular rupture. The first endocrine event in response to a course of clomiphene therapy is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. This initiates steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis, resulting in growth of the ovarian follicle and an increase in the circulating level of estradiol. Following ovulation, plasma progesterone and estradiol rise and fall as they would in a normal ovulatory cycle.

Available data suggest that both the estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of clomiphene may participate in the initiation of ovulation. The two clomiphene isomers have been found to have mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects, which may vary from one species to another. Some data suggest that zuclomiphene has greater estrogenic activity than enclomiphene.

Clomiphene citrate has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antiandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function.

Although there is no evidence of a "carryover effect" of clomiphene citrate, spontaneous ovulatory menses have been noted in some patients after clomiphene citrate therapy.

Although there is no evidence of a "carryover effect" of clomiphene citrate, spontaneous ovulatory menses have been noted in some patients after clomiphene citrate therapy.

Pharmacokinetics

Based on early studies with¹⁴C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the¹⁴C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.

Some¹⁴C label was still present in the feces 6 weeks after administration. Subsequent single-dose studies in normal volunteers showed that zuclomiphene (cis) has a longer half-life than enclomiphene (trans). Detectable levels of zuclomiphene persisted for longer than a month in these subjects. This may be suggestive of stereo-specific enterohepatic recycling or sequestering of the zuclomiphene. Thus, it is possible that some active drug may remain in the body during early pregnancy in women who conceive in the menstrual cycle during clomiphene citrate therapy.

### Testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men [^1131YaVb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

All approved testosterone replacement methods, when used according to recommendations, can restore normal serum testosterone concentrations, and relieve symptoms in most hypogonadal men. Selection of the method depends on the patient's preference with advice from the physician. Dose adjustment is possible with most delivery methods but may not be necessary in all hypogonadal men. The use of hepatotoxic androgens must be avoided. Testosterone treatment induces reversible suppression of spermatogenesis; if fertility is desired in the near future, human chronic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulator, estrogen antagonist, or an aromatase inhibitor that stimulates endogenous testosterone production may be used.

### The use of HCG-based combination therapy for recovery of spermatogenesis after testosterone use [^1138RVFj]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Aim

About 3 million men take testosterone in the United States with many reproductive-age men unaware of the negative impact of testosterone supplementation on fertility. Addressing this population, we provide an early report on the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)-based combination therapy in the treatment of a series of men with likely testosterone-related azoospermia or severe oligospermia.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed charts from two tertiary care infertility clinics to identify men presenting with azoospermia or severe oligospermia (< 1 million sperm/mL) while taking exogenous testosterone. All were noted to have been placed on combination therapy, which included 3,000 units HCG subcutaneously every other day supplemented with clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen, anastrozole, or recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (or combination) according to physician preference.

Main Outcome Measure

Clinical outcomes, including hormone values, semen analyses, and clinical pregnancies, were tracked.

Results

Forty-nine men were included in this case series. Return of spermatogenesis for azoospermic men or improved counts for men with severe oligospermia was documented in 47 men (95.9%), with one additional man (2.1%) having a documented pregnancy without follow-up semen analysis. The average time to return of spermatogenesis was 4.6 months with a mean first density of 22.6 million/mL. There was no significant difference in recovery by type of testosterone administered or supplemental therapy. No men stopped HCG or supplemental medications because of adverse events.

Conclusions

We here provide an early report of the feasibility of using combination therapy with HCG and supplemental medications in treating men with testosterone-related infertility. Future discussion and studies are needed to further characterize this therapeutic approach and document the presumed improved tolerability and speed of recovery compared with unaided withdrawal of exogenous testosterone.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations

The workup and treatment of candidates for clomiphene citrate therapy should be supervised by physicians experienced in management of gynecologic or endocrine disorders. Patients should be chosen for therapy with clomiphene citrate only after careful diagnostic evaluation (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). The plan of therapy should be outlined in advance. Impediments to achieving the goal of therapy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate. The therapeutic objective should be balanced with potential risks and discussed with the patient and others involved in the achievement of a pregnancy.

Ovulation most often occurs from 5 to 10 days after a course of clomiphene citrate. Coitus should be timed to coincide with the expected time of ovulation. Appropriate tests to determine ovulation may be useful during this time.

Recommended Dosage

Treatment of the selected patient should begin with a low dose, 50 mg daily (1 tablet) for 5 days. The dose should be increased only in those patients who do not ovulate in response to cyclic 50 mg clomiphene citrate. A low dosage or duration of treatment course is particularly recommended if unusual sensitivity to pituitary gonadotropin is suspected, such as in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see WARNINGS; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome).

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114pChTS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — testosterone thresholds for skeletal risk and intervention: Skeletal health may be compromised when serum testosterone levels fall below 200–250 ng/dl (6.9–8.7 nmol/liter). In cohort data, the odds of having osteoporosis at the hip tripled, as did the odds of experiencing rapid hip bone loss, in men with baseline testosterone levels below 200 ng/dl (6.9 nmol/liter) vs. men with testosterone levels above 200 ng/dl (6.9 nmol/liter), and the risk of low-trauma fracture was higher in men with baseline testosterone levels in the lowest quartile [median level of 227 ng/dl (7.9 nmol/liter)]. In experimental suppression, in healthy men given a GnRH agonist with testosterone for 16 wk, bone resorption increased when serum testosterone levels fell below 200 ng/dl (6.9 nmol/liter), although there did not appear to be a distinct threshold. Thus, men whose serum testosterone level is 200–300 ng/dl (6.9–10.4 nmol/liter) or below appear to be at higher risk for bone loss and fracture and are more likely to have a favorable response to testosterone therapy, and because the benefits of testosterone therapy are not well established and the risks of therapy are not clear, we feel that a more conservative level [i.e. 200 ng/dl (6.9 nmol/liter)] should be used for intervention until further data are available.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

This patient might have had a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after ∼ 6 months. Sense of well-being and sexual function are complex, and both depend upon multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the HPT axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men. The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism after attempts to treat reversible causes are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less. An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by restoration of normal HPT axis function by weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their current regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### Outcomes of anastrozole in oligozoospermic hypoandrogenic subfertile men [^115ei8we]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the change in sperm parameters in subfertile hypoandrogenic men treated with anastrozole is correlated to the magnitude of increase in testosterone (T) to estrogen ratio in men responding to treatment.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Male fertility clinic.

Patient(S)

The study group consisted of 86 subfertile hypoandrogenic men with low T/estradiol (E 2) ratio (n = 78) or a prior aversive reaction to clomiphene citrate (n = 8).

Intervention(S)

All patients were treated with 1 mg anastrozole daily, administered orally.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Hormone analysis and semen analysis before and after treatment were performed. Hormone analysis included measurements of total T, E 2, sex-hormone binding globulin, albumin, FSH, and LH, and bioavailable T was calculated. Total motile sperm count was calculated from the semen analysis.

Result(S)

In all, 95.3% of patients had an increased serum T and decreased serum E 2 after treatment with anastrozole. Sperm concentration and total motile counts improved in 18 of 21 subfertile hypoandrogenic oligozoospermic men treated with anastrozole. In these men the magnitude of total motile count increase was significantly correlated with the change in the T/E 2 ratio. No improvement was seen in semen parameters of men with azoospermia, cryptozoospermia, or normozoospermia at presentation.

Conclusion(S)

Approximately 95% of men with hypoandrogenism responded with improved endocrine parameters, and a subset of oligozoospermic men (approximately 25% of all patients) displayed significantly improved sperm parameters. In that subset, increase in sperm parameters was correlated with the change in the T/E 2 ratio, which argues for a physiologic effect of treatment.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113dj8vX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

### Intracranial venous thrombosis in a man taking clomiphene citrate [^114myNVE]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Clomiphene citrate is widely used by the female population for the management of a wide array of medical conditions especially those related to ovulation, but its use in male population remains controversial. Efficacy of clomiphene is not well established in male hypogonadism and infertility. Its side effects and complications are also poorly studied or reported. We present a case of a man with infertility issues for which he started receiving clomiphene citrate 3weeks before presenting with progressive symptoms of headache, vomiting, transient blurred vision and diplopia, which eventually turned out to be the symptoms of intracranial venous thrombosis. After excluding the common causes of intracranial venous thrombosis and hypercoagulable state, clomiphene citrate seems the most likely culprit.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115gPnhC]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Study selection and study characteristics

Our electronic search yielded 671 potentially relevant citations out of which we screened 53 in full and included 14 randomised/quasi-randomised trials in our review (Fig. 1). Ten of the included trials had a two groups parallel design, three had three groups and one compared four groups. Majority of the trials were single centre (11/14, 78.6%) and only three were multi-centre (3/14, 21.4%). Most of the trials were conducted in Asia (6/14, 42.9%) followed by four in Europe (4/14, 28.6%), and two in each of the United States and Egypt (2/14, 14.3%).

Fig. 1
Study selection and inclusion process of randomised trials evaluating non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for male infertility

The majority of the trials included men with low sperm count (< 15 × 10⁶/ml) with only two trials including men with very low sperm count (< 5 × 10⁶/ml) (Supplementary Table 1). Only three trials included men with hypogonadism and one trial provided the intervention for 12 months with eleven reporting outcomes between three and six months from recruitment (11/14, 78.6%).

We compared four pharmacological treatment options in our network meta-analysis (n = 1342) including Clomiphene citrate; Tamoxifen; Aromatase inhibitors (1 RCT for anastrazole, 2 RCTs for letrozole); anti-oxidants; and their combinations (Clomifene + Anti-oxidant; Tamoxifen + Anti-oxidant) (Supplementary Table 1).

Risk of bias of included studies

The overall quality of included trials was low. Half of the included trials (7/14, 50%) showed high risk of bias for randomisation and half showed some concern for allocation to intervention groups (7/14, 50%). Two trials were published as randomised trials, but the reported methods of randomisation were more consistent with quasi-randomisation. Seven trials showed high risk for outcome assessment (7/14, 50%) and eleven selective reporting bias (11/14, 79%). Two trials (2/14, 14%) had high loss to follow-up and data incompleteness (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). We assessed the risk of publication bias in included trials visually using a funnel plot which suggested no significant small study effect (Supplementary Fig. 3).

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1125nzJs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

What Is the Evidence for Optimization of Relevant Comorbidities?

Relevant comorbidities in this case include obstructive sleep apnea and suboptimally controlled T2D. Obstructive sleep apnea is commonly associated with a low serum testosterone concentration. Although some studies suggest that obesity that is common in men with obstructive sleep apnea might be the primary determinant of reduced testosterone, other studies refute this conclusion. Whether CPAP therapy is associated with changes in serum testosterone remains unresolved, due to the lack of definitive studies. Effective and regular use of CPAP, however, improves daytime somnolence, quality of life, and may improve erectile dysfunction.

Observational studies suggest that about 50% of men with T2D have modest reductions in serum total testosterone concentrations (mean concentrations typically ∼230–288 ng/dL [∼8–10 nmol/L]), and serum total testosterone concentrations are inversely associated with insulin resistance independently of BMI. Given his suboptimal glycemic control and increased cardiovascular risk, initiation of agents with proven cardiovascular benefits is indicated, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and these agents also promote weight loss. Moreover, there is some evidence that (perhaps due to weight loss effects) GLP-1 agonists may increase serum total testosterone by 20% to 30% and lower the incidence of moderate or severe erectile dysfunction. Although there are no published studies that have examined the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the HPT axis, anecdotal evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors might increase the risk of erythrocytosis during concomitant testosterone treatment (via reduced plasma volume and possible indirect effects on erythropoietin).

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1125z4sg]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Semen parameters

A direct meta-analysis was only possible for clomid vs. placebo from three RCTs as all other treatment comparisons came from less than three trials each. Overall, there was no significant improvement in sperm concentration (SMD 0.71 95%CI -0.18 to 1.61, I 2 91%) with some improvement in sperm motility (SMD 0.44 95%CI 0.21 to 0.66, I 2 0) (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Our network meta-analysis (Fig. 2) showed significant improvement in sperm concentration with clomiphene compared to other treatment options (clomiphene vs. anti-oxidant (SMD 2.15 95%CI 0.78 to 3.52), clomiphene vs. aromatase inhibitor (SMD 2.93 95%CI 1.23 to 4.62), tamoxifen vs. clomiphene (SMD − 1.96 95%CI -3.57 to -0.36) although there was no significant difference for placebo vs. clomiphene (SMD − 1.53 95%CI -3.52 to 0.47) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4 b). All other treatment comparisons showed no significant difference compared to placebo (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4 b). The network did not suffer from significant inconsistency (p = 0.178). Clomiphene had the highest likelihood to achieve the maximum change in sperm concentration (SUCRA 97.4) followed by Clomifene + Anti-oxidant (SUCRA 67.1) (Fig. 4). Aromatase-inhibitor had the lowest likelihood of demonstrating maximum improvement in sperm concentration with a SUCRA of 4.9 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 4 c).

Distinguishing between primary or secondary hypogonadism — in men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations. This recommendation is graded (1|⊕⊕⊕○). Measuring LH and FSH concentrations can help distinguish between primary and secondary hypogonadism.

### Therapeutic management in women with a diminished ovarian reserve: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116DMP6J]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

The clinical management of women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is a challenge in the field of medically assisted reproduction. Several therapeutic strategies have been proposed, but with mixed results, mainly because the definition of DOR used was inconsistent among trials.

Objective

To investigate adjuvant treatments and protocols involving only women with DOR according to POSEIDON (Patient-Oriented Strategies Encompassing IndividualizeD Oocyte Number) criteria.

Data Sources

We conducted a systematic search using the MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases to identify relevant studies published up to June 2024. The review protocol was registered at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (registration number: CRD42022346117).

Study Selection and Synthesis

After duplication removal, the titles and abstracts of 4,806 articles were scrutinized, and 124 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. In total, 38 randomized controlled trials were included in the qualitative/quantitative analysis. The following interventions were evaluated: dehydroepiandrosterone (n = 1,336); testosterone (n = 418); high- vs. low-dose gonadotropin (n = 957); delayed-start protocol with gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone antagonist (n = 398); letrozole (n = 612); clomiphene citrate (1,113); growth hormone (311); luteal phase stimulation (n = 57); dual triggering (n = 139); dual stimulation (168); luteinizing hormone (979); oestradiol pretreatment (n = 552); and corifollitropin alfa (n = 561).

Main Outcomes

The primary outcome was live birth rate or ongoing pregnancy if data on live birth were unavailable. Secondary outcomes were number of oocytes retrieved, number of metaphase II oocytes, clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate.

Results

Testosterone supplementation is associated with higher live birth rates compared with nonsupplemented women among all interventions evaluated (odds ratio: 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11–4.32, four studies, 368 patients). Testosterone (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.88, 95% CI: 0.03–1.72; 4 studies, n = 368 patients), dehydroepiandrosterone (WMD 0.60, 95% CI: 0.07–1.13; 4 studies, n = 418 patients), and delayed started protocol (WMD 1.32, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.89; 3 studies, n = 398 patients) significantly improved the total number of eggs collected. Lower number of oocytes retrieved is achieved in women undergoing low dose gonadotropin regimen vs high dose (WMD: -1.57, 95% CI: -2.12 to -1.17; 2 studies, n = 905 patients), The other interventions did not produce significant improvements.

Conclusion and Relevance

Specific interventions such as testosterone seem to correlate with a better live birth rate in women with DOR; these findings should be further explored in randomized trials.

Clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) for unexplained infertility — Ovarian stimulation (OS) with IUI is a mainstay of fertility treatment, and this guideline includes 19 randomized trials, 4 systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, and 3 cohort studies assessing clomiphene citrate with IUI. Two randomized trials versus expectant management showed benefit: in 201 couples treated over 3 cycles, live-birth rate was 31% vs. 9%, respectively, P = 0.0003, and a strict per-protocol analysis showed 24% vs. 7%, P = 0.05. An intermediate-quality randomized controlled trial found a higher pregnancy rate versus untreated cycles (9.7% vs. 3.3%, respectively, P = 0.049), although live-birth outcome by diagnosis was not reported.

### Clomiphene citrate for the treatment of low testosterone associated with chronic opioid pain medication administration… [^116ac2Qr]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Clomiphene Citrate for the Treatment of Low Testosterone Associated With Chronic Opioid Pain Medication AdministrationClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Identification Study Status Sponsor/Collaborators Oversight Study Description The purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of clomiphene citrate compared to placebo in men who are taking pain medication for chronic pain conditions and who have low blood testosterone levels. The condition of men having low testosterone with long-term pain medication usage is called opioid-induced androgen deficiency. Low testosterone can be caused by pain medication effects on part of the brain which ultimately result in decreased testosterone production by the testes.

Typical symptoms of low testosterone may include decreased muscle mass, increased fat, osteoporosis, anemia, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation. In addition, men with low testosterone may experience decreased attention, and decreased libido, fatigue, and depressed mood. Few studies have looked at hormonal changes caused by long-term opioid usage in men. Clomiphene citrate, a selective estrogen receptor modulator oral medication which inhibits estrogen effects on the brain, has been identified by prior studies to raise testosterone in men with low testosterone. Clomiphene citrate is also known to lead to increased sperm production in men with low testosterone unlike testosterone topical or injection medications.

Although clomiphene citrate has been studied in hypogonadal men with beneficial outcomes and minimal side effects, no group has previously studied clomiphene citrate as treatment in patients with OPIAD. Outcome Measures
- Serum total testosterone Morning venipuncture of serum total testosterone to assess change over time.
- BMI
- Presence of clear secondary hypogonadism with hypogonadal symptoms and low total testosterone level or total testosterone ≤ 200 ng/dl. Additionally LH should be < 15 mIU/mL. Symptoms of hypogonadism include fatigue, decreased energy level/endurance, depressed mood, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction.
