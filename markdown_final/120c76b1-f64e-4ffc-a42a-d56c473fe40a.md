## Question

Tenecteplase in AIS due to large vessel occlusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, including mechanism, dose, efficacy, safety, guideline positioning, special populations, and practical implementation considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale and why tenecteplase might outperform alteplase in LVO. Then, I should verify the optimal dose and whether higher dosing helps or harms. Next, I will examine randomized trial efficacy data, followed by safety signals and meta-analytic summaries. After that, I need to check contemporary guideline recommendations and how they differ by region. I will then consider special populations and time windows, including the elderly and extended imaging-selected windows. Finally, I should review practical workflow advantages, cost-effectiveness, and the current evidence gaps that still need resolution, before synthesizing a bottom-line clinical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale. Tenecteplase is a genetically modified tPA with higher fibrin specificity, greater resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and a longer half-life enabling single-bolus administration, which theoretically improves clot penetration and speeds reperfusion while simplifying workflow in acute stroke care, especially when rapid transfer for thrombectomy is needed [^116W8LZM] [^112LL8c9].

> Wait, let me verify the dose question before jumping to conclusions. Multiple randomized data sets converge on 0.25 mg/kg as the optimal dose for LVO, with no efficacy advantage to 0.40 mg/kg and a signal toward more bleeding at the higher dose. EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2 showed identical early reperfusion rates between 0.40 and 0.25 mg/kg but numerically higher symptomatic ICH with 0.40 mg/kg, and pooled analyses of EXTEND-IA TNK trials demonstrated better functional outcomes with 0.25 mg/kg in patients over 80 years, reinforcing the lower dose as preferred in routine practice [^1139vxYA] [^1175gsTk]. I should also note that NOR-TEST 2 was stopped early for harm with 0.40 mg/kg in moderate-to-severe strokes, further cautioning against the higher dose in this population [^112VzTDK]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment: ESO 2023 explicitly recommends 0.25 mg/kg and advises against 0.40 mg/kg, which aligns with these safety and efficacy signals [^112pF2QV].

> Next, I should review randomized efficacy data in LVO. EXTEND-IA TNK demonstrated superior early reperfusion and better 90-day functional outcomes with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg versus alteplase before thrombectomy, with similar sICH rates, supporting a clinically meaningful advantage in LVO bridging therapy [^1139gpU4]. Let me consider broader confirmation: meta-analyses focused on LVO patients show roughly twofold higher odds of excellent functional outcomes and about threefold higher odds of successful recanalization with tenecteplase versus alteplase, which is consistent with the pharmacologic rationale and the EXTEND-IA findings [^1147qeGX]. But wait, what about the role of bridging itself versus thrombectomy alone? BRIDGE-TNK, published in 2025, showed that tenecteplase plus thrombectomy improved functional independence at 90 days compared with thrombectomy alone, with higher pre-thrombectomy reperfusion and no excess sICH, providing direct randomized support for bridging with tenecteplase in early-window LVO [^1143wwNR] [^117WT3vy].

> I need to ensure safety is truly comparable. Across randomized and observational datasets, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg has rates of symptomatic ICH similar to alteplase, with some analyses suggesting lower mortality, which is reassuring for routine use when standard eligibility criteria are applied [^111v3r7v] [^113DLvpQ]. Hold on, I should verify the dose-related bleeding signal again: the consistent trend toward more sICH with 0.40 mg/kg reinforces the dose selection of 0.25 mg/kg as the safer, equally effective option in LVO [^1139vxYA] [^112VzTDK].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to avoid overstatement. ESO 2023 issues a strong recommendation for tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as a safe and effective alternative to alteplase in eligible AIS within 4.5 hours, with explicit preference in LVO eligible for thrombectomy and a strong recommendation against 0.40 mg/kg, reflecting the LVO-specific benefit signal and safety profile [^112pF2QV] [^114kdkMc]. AHA/ASA 2019 suggests tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg may be reasonable in mechanical thrombectomy candidates, acknowledging the EXTEND-IA TNK data and classifying this as a Class IIb, B-R recommendation, which is more cautious but directionally concordant [^112DGYXR] [^114YVcGa]. I should double-check UK guidance as well: the 2023 National Clinical Guideline for Stroke recommends either alteplase or tenecteplase for eligible AIS within 4.5 hours, aligning with international practice trends [^115LQcam].

> Let me consider special populations and time windows. In patients older than 80 years with LVO, pooled EXTEND-IA TNK analyses show improved 90-day mRS and lower mortality with 0.25 mg/kg compared with both 0.40 mg/kg tenecteplase and alteplase, with no sICH observed at 0.25 mg/kg in that subgroup, which is compelling for geriatric practice patterns [^1175gsTk]. For extended windows, TRACE III demonstrated that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg improved excellent functional outcomes in LVO patients selected with perfusion imaging between 4.5 and 24 hours, expanding the role of IV thrombolysis in imaging-positive penumbral profiles, though this remains a distinct, carefully selected population [^1124VNVv]. I should confirm that ESO advises against tenecteplase in wake-up or unknown-onset stroke selected only by noncontrast CT, emphasizing the need for advanced imaging in extended windows, which aligns with TRACE III's imaging strategy [^1133MTDE].

> Now, I will examine practical implementation advantages. Single-bolus administration facilitates faster door-to-needle times, reduces medication errors, and simplifies interfacility transfers for thrombectomy, all of which can translate into earlier reperfusion and better outcomes in time-sensitive stroke care [^112LL8c9]. Let me verify cost implications: economic analyses from the Netherlands and Australia suggest tenecteplase is cost-saving or cost-effective compared with alteplase, largely due to lower administration costs and improved early reperfusion reducing downstream resource use, which supports system-level adoption [^114h2ogc] [^116aC5fd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal replacement. I should review the remaining uncertainties. For non-LVO strokes, tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase in phase 3 trials like AcT and TRACE-2, but superiority has not been demonstrated consistently across mixed populations, so equipoise remains in non-LVO settings despite practical advantages [^117BTcs5] [^113xVz2c]. Regarding bridging versus thrombectomy alone, while BRIDGE-TNK supports bridging with tenecteplase, earlier alteplase-based meta-analyses were neutral, and ongoing trials like DIRECT-TNK will further clarify this question; thus, center-specific protocols and transfer logistics still matter [^1143wwNR] [^1157BrxA]. I should also confirm that adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion has not yet shown definitive benefit in phase 3 trials such as POST-TNK, so this strategy remains investigational pending larger studies [^113tpmXP].

> Let me synthesize the clinical bottom line. For acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 4.5 hours, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus is a preferred intravenous thrombolytic option that increases early reperfusion and improves functional independence when used as bridging therapy before thrombectomy, with a safety profile comparable to alteplase and operational advantages that can shorten treatment times and reduce costs [^1139gpU4] [^1143wwNR] [^112pF2QV]. I should emphasize again to avoid 0.40 mg/kg due to higher bleeding risk without added benefit, and to consider tenecteplase in patients over 80 years where data suggest particular benefit, while reserving extended-window use for carefully imaging-selected patients in ongoing or published trials like TRACE III [^1139vxYA] [^1175gsTk] [^1124VNVv].

Tenecteplase is a **single-bolus thrombolytic** [^116AUXPm] with higher fibrin specificity and a longer half-life than alteplase, enabling faster administration and earlier reperfusion [^1139gpU4]. In LVO AIS within 4.5 hours, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is **non-inferior to alteplase** [^117BTcs5] and achieves higher early recanalization [^1139gpU4], with similar safety [^113xVz2c]. ESO 2023 and AHA/ASA 2019 recommend tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as an alternative to alteplase for LVO patients eligible for thrombectomy [^114kdkMc] [^114YVcGa]. For 4.5–24 hours, tenecteplase is under study [^1124VNVv] and not standard care outside trials. Intra-arterial tenecteplase after EVT has not shown benefit [^113tpmXP] and is not recommended. Tenecteplase is favored for its ease and speed, but alteplase remains the only FDA-approved IV thrombolytic for AIS [^113drZYw].

## Pharmacological properties and mechanism of action

Tenecteplase is a **genetically modified tPA** with three amino acid changes that increase fibrin specificity, resistance to PAI-1, and plasma half-life (~20 min vs ~4 min for alteplase) [^116W8LZM]. These properties enable single-bolus dosing and faster administration, which can shorten door-to-needle times and facilitate rapid transfer for thrombectomy [^112LL8c9].

## Clinical evidence for tenecteplase in LVO AIS

### Randomized controlled trials

- **EXTEND-IA TNK**: In 202 patients with LVO within 4.5 hours, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg increased early reperfusion (22% vs 10%) and improved 90-day functional outcomes versus alteplase, with similar sICH rates (1% vs 1%) [^1139gpU4].

- **EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2**: In 300 LVO patients, 0.25 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg had similar early reperfusion (~19%), but 0.4 mg/kg had higher sICH (4.7% vs 1.3%), supporting 0.25 mg/kg as optimal [^1139vxYA].

- **AcT and TRACE-2**: In 3,200+ patients within 4.5 hours, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was non-inferior to alteplase for excellent functional outcomes, with similar safety [^117BTcs5] [^113xVz2c].

- **BRIDGE-TNK**: In 550 LVO patients within 4.5 hours, tenecteplase plus thrombectomy improved functional independence versus thrombectomy alone (52.9% vs 44.1%), with higher pre-thrombectomy reperfusion and no excess sICH [^1143wwNR].

---

### Meta-analyses

Meta-analyses show tenecteplase achieves **higher early recanalization** [^1147qeGX] and better functional outcomes than alteplase in LVO, with similar sICH and mortality [^1147qeGX].

---

## Safety profile

Tenecteplase has a **safety profile comparable to alteplase**, with similar sICH and mortality in major trials [^1147qeGX]. The 0.4 mg/kg dose shows higher sICH without added benefit, so 0.25 mg/kg is preferred [^1139vxYA].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for tenecteplase in lvo ais** |
|-|-|
| ESO 2023 | Strong recommendation for tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as alternative to alteplase in LVO patients eligible for thrombectomy [^114kdkMc] |
| AHA/ASA 2019 | Consider tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg in patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (Class IIb, Level B-R) [^112CokVE] |

---

## Practical advantages

- **Single-bolus dosing**: Enables faster administration, shorter door-to-needle times, and fewer dosing errors than alteplase [^112LL8c9].

- **Facilitates rapid transfer**: Simplifies interfacility transport for thrombectomy without ongoing infusion [^112LL8c9].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Lower administration costs and improved efficiency suggest favorable cost profiles versus alteplase [^114h2ogc].

---

## Limitations and ongoing research

- **Regulatory status**: Tenecteplase is not FDA-approved for AIS; use is off-label in many regions [^113drZYw].

- **Extended window**: Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is being studied for 4.5–24 hours with perfusion imaging (e.g. TRACE III) [^1124VNVv].

- **Intra-arterial use**: Adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after EVT has not shown benefit in RCTs (e.g. POST-TNK) and is not recommended [^113tpmXP].

---

## Comparison with alteplase

| **Parameter** | **Tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg)** | **Alteplase (0.9 mg/kg)** |
|-|-|-|
| Administration | Single bolus | 1-hour infusion |
| Early recanalization | Higher | Lower |
| Functional outcomes | Non-inferior/superior in LVO | Standard |
| Safety (sICH) | Similar | Similar |
| Regulatory approval | Off-label for AIS | FDA-approved for AIS |

---

Tenecteplase is a **viable alternative to alteplase** for LVO AIS within 4.5 hours, offering faster administration, higher early recanalization, and similar safety. It is recommended by ESO and AHA/ASA for eligible LVO patients, but alteplase remains the only FDA-approved IV thrombolytic for AIS [^112pF2QV] [^114YVcGa] [^113drZYw].

### Tenecteplase thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke [^116AUXPm]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase is a fibrinolytic drug with higher fibrin specificity and longer half-life than the standard stroke thrombolytic, alteplase, permitting the convenience of single bolus administration. Tenecteplase, at 0.5 mg/kg, has regulatory approval to treat ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, for which it has equivalent 30-day mortality and fewer systemic hemorrhages. Investigated as a thrombolytic for ischemic stroke over the past 15 years, tenecteplase is currently being studied in several phase 3 trials. Based on a systematic literature search, we provide a qualitative synthesis of published stroke clinical trials of tenecteplase that (1) performed randomized comparisons with alteplase, (2) compared different doses of tenecteplase, or (3) provided unique quantitative meta-analyses. Four phase 2 and one phase 3 study performed randomized comparisons with alteplase. These and other phase 2 studies compared different tenecteplase doses and effects on early outcomes of recanalization, reperfusion, and substantial neurological improvement, as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 3-month disability on the modified Rankin Scale. Although no single trial prospectively demonstrated superiority or noninferiority of tenecteplase on clinical outcome, meta-analyses of these trials (1585 patients randomized) point to tenecteplase superiority in recanalization of large vessel occlusions and noninferiority in disability-free 3-month outcome, without increases in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or mortality. Doses of 0.25 and 0.4 mg/kg have been tested, but no advantage of the higher dose has been suggested by the results. Current clinical practice guidelines for stroke include intravenous tenecteplase at either dose as a second-tier option, with the 0.25 mg/kg dose recommended for large vessel occlusions, based on a phase 2 trial that demonstrated superior recanalization and improved 3-month outcome relative to alteplase. Ongoing randomized phase 3 trials may better define the comparative risks and benefits of tenecteplase and alteplase for stroke thrombolysis and answer questions of tenecteplase efficacy in the > 4.5-hour time window, in wake-up stroke, and in combination with endovascular thrombectomy.

### Optimizing acute ischemic stroke outcomes: the role of tenecteplase before mechanical thrombectomy [^112C1C5R]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a life-threatening condition demanding prompt reperfusion to salvage brain tissue. Thrombolytic drugs, like tenecteplase (TNK), offer clot dissolution, but time constraints and contraindications limit their use. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) revolutionized AIS treatment, especially for large vessel occlusions (LVO). Recent evidence suggests that administering TNK before MT improves recanalization and outcomes, challenging the dominance of alteplase.

Methods

Relevant articles focusing on TNK before MT were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, looking for randomized controlled trials (RCT), clinical trials, and meta-analyses in humans until 2024.

Findings

TNK, a genetically engineered thrombolytic, exhibits superior fibrin specificity and a longer half-life than alteplase. Clinical trials comparing TNK and alteplase before MT showcase enhanced recanalization, functional outcomes, and safety with TNK. Advanced neuroimaging aids patient selection, though its cost-effectiveness warrants consideration. Dosing studies favor a 0.25 mg/kg dose for efficacy and reduced complications. Clinical guidelines from various associations acknowledge TNK's potential as an alteplase alternative for AIS treatment, particularly for LVOs eligible for thrombectomy.

Implications

In conclusion, TNK emerges as a promising option for bridging therapy in AIS, displaying efficacy and safety benefits, especially when administered before MT. Its fibrin specificity, longer half-life, and potential for improved outcomes position TNK as a viable alternative to alteplase, potentially transforming the landscape of AIS treatment strategies. While limitations like small sample sizes and variations in protocols exist, future research should focus on large-scale RCT, subgroup analyses, and cost-effectiveness evaluations to further elucidate TNK's role in optimizing AIS management.

### Advances in treatments for acute ischemic stroke [^113VYrZj]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is a leading global cause of death and disability. Intravenous thrombolysis was the first acute treatment developed for ischemic strokes. First with alteplase and now with tenecteplase, intravenous thrombolysis has remained a cornerstone of acute ischemic stroke management. In large vessel occlusions, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care in acute stroke management for anterior and posterior circulation strokes. The boundaries for these treatments have expanded, which has improved outcomes in patients who were previously ineligible. This review summarizes the latest advances in interventions for acute ischemic stroke, extending beyond existing guidelines and review articles to explore emerging strategies and treatments currently under investigation.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular reperfusion for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the POST-TNK randomized clinical trial [^113tpmXP]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study POST-TNK was published by Jiacheng Huang and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the POST-TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after endovascular reperfusion in patients with AIS? In the POST-TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the POST-TNK study, the population was: 539 patients (220 female, 319 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after endovascular thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were prestroke disability; treatment with intravenous thrombolysis before endovascular thrombectomy. In the POST-TNK study, the interventions were: n = 269 intra-arterial tenecteplase (receipt of endovascular treatment plus infusion of intra-arterial tenecteplase 0.0625 mg/kg, maximum dose 6.25 mg, for 10–15 minutes) n = 270 standard treatment (receipt of endovascular treatment without intra-arterial thrombolysis). In the POST-TNK study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in freedom from disability at day 90 (49.1% vs. 44.1%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.36). In the POST-TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (61.3% vs. 58.9%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) No significant difference in improvement in NIHSS score at 5–7 days or discharge if earlier (53.2% vs. 43.1%; WR 1.19, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.46) No significant difference in European QoL Five-Dimension Five-Level score at day 90 (43.6% vs. 37.7%; WR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.52). In the POST-TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death within day 90, symptomatic ICH within 48 hours. significant difference in any radiologic ICH within 48 hours (36.6% vs. 27.3%). In the POST-TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after endovascular thrombectomy, intra-arterial tenecteplase was not superior to standard treatment with respect to freedom from disability at day 90.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^114kdkMc]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Within the last year, four randomised-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have been published comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase and alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients with a non-inferiority design for three of them. An expedited recommendation process was initiated by the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and conducted according to ESO standard operating procedure based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. We identified three relevant Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions, performed systematic reviews of the literature and meta-analyses, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote evidence-based recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided if insufficient evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. For patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration who are eligible for IVT, tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg can be used as a safe and effective alternative to alteplase 0.9mg/kg (moderate evidence, strong recommendation). For patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration who are eligible for IVT, we recommend against using tenecteplase at a dose of 0.40mg/kg (low evidence, strong recommendation). For patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration with prehospital management with a mobile stroke unit who are eligible for IVT, we suggest tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg over alteplase 0.90mg/kg (low evidence, weak recommendation). For patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) AIS of < 4.5h duration who are eligible for IVT, we recommend tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg over alteplase 0.9mg/kg (moderate evidence, strong recommendation). For patients with AIS on awakening from sleep or AIS of unknown onset who are selected with non-contrast CT, we recommend against IVT with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg (low evidence, strong recommendation). Expert consensus statements are also provided. Tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg may be favoured over alteplase 0.9mg/kg for patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration in view of comparable safety and efficacy data and easier administration. For patients with LVO AIS of < 4.5h duration who are IVT-eligible, IVT with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg is preferable over skipping IVT before MT, even in the setting of a direct admission to a thrombectomy-capable centre. IVT with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg may be a reasonable alternative to alteplase 0.9mg/kg for patients with AIS on awakening from sleep or AIS of unknown onset and who are IVT-eligible after selection with advanced imaging.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^1145XZV7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Although intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase remains the primary treatment for acute ischemic stroke, tenecteplase has shown potential advantages over alteplase. Animal studies have demonstrated the favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tenecteplase. Moreover, it is easier to administer. Clinical trials have demonstrated that tenecteplase is not inferior to alteplase and may even be superior in cases of acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion. Current evidence supports the time and cost benefits of tenecteplase, suggesting that it could potentially replace alteplase as the main option for thrombolytic therapy, especially in patients with large vessel occlusion.

### Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusions: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147qeGX]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Accumulating evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials suggests that tenecteplase may represent an effective treatment alternative to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of intravenous tenecteplase to intravenous alteplase administration for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and Scopus for published randomized controlled clinical trials providing outcomes of acute ischemic stroke with confirmed LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase at different doses or alteplase at a standard dose of 0.9 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the odds of modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months.

Results

We included 4 randomized controlled clinical trials including a total of 433 patients. Patients with confirmed LVO receiving tenecteplase had higher odds of modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2 (odds ratio, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.15–3.69]), successful recanalization (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.73–5.40]), and functional improvement defined as 1-point decrease across all modified Rankin Scale grades (common odds ratio, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.18–2.87]) at 3 months compared with patients with confirmed LVO receiving alteplase. There was little or no heterogeneity between the results provided from included studies regarding the aforementioned outcomes (I 2 ≤ 20%). No difference in the outcomes of early neurological improvement, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, any intracranial hemorrhage, and the rates of modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 or all-cause mortality at 3 months was detected between patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase or alteplase.

Conclusions

Acute ischemic stroke patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase have significantly better recanalization and clinical outcomes compared with patients receiving intravenous alteplase.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular reperfusion for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the POST-TNK randomized clinical trial [^115WeeWc]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The impact of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase administration following near-complete to complete reperfusion by endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke is unknown.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion (defined as a score on the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] scale of 2c to 3) after EVT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, blinded outcome assessment trial implemented at 34 hospitals in China among 540 patients with stroke due to proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion within 24 hours of the time they were last known to be well, with an eTICI score of 2c to 3 after EVT, and without prior intravenous thrombolysis. Recruitment took place between October 26, 2022, and March 1, 2024, with final follow-up on June 3, 2024.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase (n = 269) at 0.0625 mg/kg or no intra-arterial thrombolysis (control group; n = 271).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was freedom from disability, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. The primary safety outcomes were death at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours.

Results

A total of 539 participants (99.8%) completed the trial (median age, 69 years; 221 female [40.9%]). The proportion with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 49.1% (132/269) in the intra-arterial tenecteplase group and 44.1% (119/270) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.97–1.36]; p = 0.11). Ninety-day mortality was 16.0% and 19.3% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.50–1.13]; p = 0.16), respectively. The proportions of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 6.3% and 4.4% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.68–2.99]; p = 0.35), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well and who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after EVT, adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase did not significantly increase the likelihood of freedom from disability at 90 days.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^115LQcam]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase has been suggested to improve recanalization and reperfusion without increasing the risk of hemorrhage and may lyse large vessel clots more effectively. Based on these findings, some national guideline committees have endorsed tenecteplase in lieu of alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis in patients with intracranial large vessel occlusions (LVOS) eligible for thrombectomy, while grading these recommendations as being of weak strength and low quality of evidence.

Studies about tenecteplase are emerging and, globally, more than 20 trials have been completed or are ongoing. The phase 3 trials AcT (Intravenous Tenecteplase Compared With Alteplase for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in Canada), TRACE‐2 (Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase in Acute Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events‐2), and ATTEST‐2 (Alteplase‐Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis‐2)recently provided robust results that 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase was not inferior to alteplase with a similar safety profile within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The latest 2023 European Stroke Organisation guidelinestrongly recommended that 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase can be used as an alternative to 0.9 mg/kg alteplase for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or stroke due to LVO within 4.5 hours of onset. The 2023 edition of the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke for the United Kingdom and Ireland also recommended that thrombolysis with alteplase or tenecteplase should be considered for patients with AIS within 4.5 hours of known onset. In the real‐world setting, many centers have switched from alteplase to the off‐label use of tenecteplase based on the clinical trial data and guideline recommendations.

This review provides a comprehensive summary of the recent advancements in the use of tenecteplase for AIS.

### Intravenous tenecteplase before thrombectomy in stroke [^1143wwNR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study BRIDGE-TNK was published by Zhongming Qiu and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous tenecteplase in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion? In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the population was: 550 patients (230 female, 320 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion who had presented within 4.5 hours after onset. The key exclusion criteria were contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis; receipt of intravenous thrombolysis before screening; ICH; any terminal disease with a life expectancy < 6 months; intravenous AVM or aneurysm; pregnancy or lactation. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the interventions were: n = 278 tenecteplase plus thrombectomy (intravenous tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg, maximum dose of 25 mg, followed by endovascular thrombectomy) n = 272 thrombectomy alone (endovascular thrombectomy alone). In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving functional independence at day 90 (52.9% vs. 44.1%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39). In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score at day 90 (44.9% vs. 39.4%; OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.43) No significant difference in mRS score of 0 or 1 at day 90 (34.9% vs. 27.9%; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.57) Significant increase in successful reperfusion before thrombectomy (6.1% vs. 1.1%; RR 5.19, 95% CI 1.51 to 17.84). In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death within 90 days, symptomatic ICH within 48 hours. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion who had presented within 4.5 hours after onset, tenecteplase plus thrombectomy was superior to thrombectomy alone with respect to the percentage of patients achieving functional independence at day 90.

### Tenecteplase for ischemic stroke at 4.5 to 24 hours without thrombectomy [^1124VNVv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study TRACE III was published by Yunyun Xiong and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the TRACE III study, the trial question was: what is the role of tenecteplase in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion? In the TRACE III study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TRACE III study, the population was: 516 patients (166 female, 350 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery within 4.5–24 hours from last known to be well. The key exclusion criteria were planned endovascular thrombectomy; guideline-based contraindications to thrombolytic agents; persistent BP elevation; active internal bleeding or at high risk of bleeding. In the TRACE III study, the interventions were: n = 264 tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, maximum dose of 25 mg) n = 252 standard medical treatment (antiplatelet therapy at the discretion of the investigators). In the TRACE III study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mRS score ≤ 1 at day 90 (33% vs. 24.2%; RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.81). In the TRACE III study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in functional independence at day 90 (43.6% vs. 33.3%; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.63) Significant increase in major neurologic improvement at 72 hours (16% vs. 6%; RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.69) Significant increase in reperfusion at 24 hours (20.1% vs. 11.8%; RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.64). In the TRACE III study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death within 90 days, adverse and severe adverse events. In the TRACE III study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery within 4.5–24 hours from last known to be well, tenecteplase was superior to standard medical treatment with respect to mRS score ≤ 1 at day 90.

### Effect of intravenous tenecteplase dose on cerebral reperfusion before thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke: the EXTEND-IA TNK part 2 randomized clinical trial [^1139vxYA]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase improves reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke compared with alteplase.

Objective

To determine whether 0.40 mg/kg of tenecteplase safely improves reperfusion before endovascular thrombectomy vs 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial at 27 hospitals in Australia and 1 in New Zealand using open-label treatment and blinded assessment of radiological and clinical outcomes. Patients were enrolled from December 2017 to July 2019 with follow-up until October 2019. Adult patients (N = 300) with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, \basilar, or middle cerebral artery were included less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset using standard intravenous thrombolysis eligibility criteria.

Interventions

Open-label tenecteplase at 0.40 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg; n = 150) or 0.25 mg/kg (maximum, 25 mg; n = 150) given as a bolus before endovascular thrombectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory prior to thrombectomy, assessed by consensus of 2 blinded neuroradiologists. Prespecified secondary outcomes were level of disability at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score; range, 0–6); mRS score of 0 to 1 (freedom from disability) or no change from baseline at 90 days; mRS score of 0 to 2 (functional independence) or no change from baseline at 90 days; substantial neurological improvement at 3 days; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours; and all-cause death.

Results

All 300 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.7 years; 141 [47%] women) completed the trial. The number of participants with greater than 50% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory was 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group vs 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (unadjusted risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -8.9% to -8.9%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.66–1.61]; p = 0.89). Among the 6 secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences in any of the 4 functional outcomes between the 0.40 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg groups nor in all-cause deaths (26 [17%] vs 22 [15%]; unadjusted risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -5.6% to 11.0%]) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7 [4.7%] vs 2 [1.3%]; unadjusted risk difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -0.5% to 7.2%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke, a dose of 0.40 mg/kg, compared with 0.25 mg/kg, of tenecteplase did not significantly improve cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggest that the 0.40-mg/kg dose of tenecteplase does not confer an advantage over the 0.25-mg/kg dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke in whom endovascular thrombectomy is planned.

### Advances in the management of acute ischemic stroke [^111cVPRY]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize the therapeutic advances and evidence in the medical management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Recent evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase (TNK) with alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in AIS will be highlighted. Recent advances and evidence on improving micro-circulation following endovascular procedures and neuroprotection will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

A significant number of randomized control studies now support the use of tenecteplase for IVT in AIS. TNK 0.25mg/kg single bolus is as effective and well tolerated as alteplase 0.9mg/kg infusion for IVT in AIS. Evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) has shown effective and well tolerated expansion of the therapeutic window of IVT in the wake-up stroke and up to 9h after last seen well, using advanced neuroimaging with computed tomography perfusion/MRI. Early evidence suggests that intra-arterial alteplase may help improve microcirculation in patients with large vessel occlusion following successful thrombectomy. However, more trials are required to confirm the results. Similarly, early evidence from a recent RCT showed that remote ischemic conditioning confers potential neuroprotection and improves outcomes in AIS.

Summary

Converging evidence has demonstrated that for patients with ischemic stroke presenting at under 4.5h from the onset, TNK is comparable to alteplase. These data along with the practical advantages of TNK have resulted in a shift to replace intravenous TNK as the standard for thrombolysis. Ongoing studies of IVT with TNK are focussed on defining the optimal dose, expanding the time window with multimodal imaging and defining the role of thrombolysis for bridging patients with stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

### Tenecteplase: expanding horizons in thrombolytic therapy across various clinical indications [^112eE52F]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics remain the mainstay of treatment for ischaemic stroke and retain importance for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacological and practical advantages of the fibrinolytic tenecteplase have recently led to a widespread shift in ischaemic stroke management. Meta-analysis of randomised trials demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcome after stroke (no disability). Trials have also extended the time window for thrombolytics in stroke to 24hours, provided imaging demonstrates salvageable brain tissue. Although endovascular therapy is the most effective treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke, access remains limited to major metropolitan centres in developed nations. Trials suggest that thrombolytics add value, even in patients receiving endovascular therapy, and for many patients globally, intravenous thrombolytics are the only accessible reperfusion treatment. Tenecteplase is established as the preferred thrombolytic for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, generally reserved for patients who cannot rapidly access percutaneous intervention following first medical contact. Notably, the dose used is twice that for stroke. Pre-hospital delivery of tenecteplase by paramedics is an important strategy in rural and remote areas. While patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism benefit from systemic thrombolysis, adjunctive tenecteplase in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism has been associated with increased risk of major bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke. The practical advantages of bolus administration and having a single thrombolytic on formulary for all relevant indications have positioned tenecteplase as the leading thrombolytic agent in current practice. This review discusses the current evidence and treatment guidelines in this rapidly evolving field.

### Off-label use of tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116WNkdS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Tenecteplase seems to achieve fast recanalization in patients with large-vessel occlusion at a consistent rate of 20%, which is independent of whether the patients are secondarily transferred or directly admitted to a center capable of performing endovascular procedures. This analysis also shows that intravenous tenecteplase treatment was associated with an increased likelihood of early neurologic improvement in both crude and adjusted analyses — an association that has been reported in a previous meta-analysis of RCTs. Compelling evidence for tenecteplase superiority as a thrombolytic agent compared with alteplase has been provided to date only for patients with confirmed large-vessel occlusions. Studies that have included all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of AIS did not prove the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase. This disparity on the outcomes associated with tenecteplase in different study populations has been reflected in the current guidelines from the European Stroke Organizationand American Heart Association/American Stroke Associationsuggesting that tenecteplase treatment may be considered only for patients with confirmed acute large-vessel occlusion who are eligible for both intravenous thrombolysis and subsequent endovascular thrombectomy.

In the present meta-analysis, no difference in the likelihood of 3-month excellent functional outcome was detected between patients receiving intravenous tenecteplase or intravenous alteplase. However, in our analysis, the risk difference between intravenous tenecteplase and intravenous alteplase in the pooled crude analysis was 10% with the lower bound of the 95% CI (−5% to 26%) for treatment effect difference at −5%. This noninferiority margin of −5% for treatment effect difference has been suggested as the minimal clinically important difference for acute stroke therapies by a previous survey of stroke experts and used in a previous meta-analysis comparing intravenous tenecteplase with intravenous alteplase for the treatment of AIS within the setting of RCTs.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^114GDxqM]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

These phase 1 and 2 randomized clinical trials found that administering tenecteplase at doses of 0.0313 mg/kg or 0.0625 mg/kg after successful EVT within 24 hours of onset in patients with anterior circulation LVO acute ischemic stroke is adequately safe to advance to larger trials. However, due to the study's limitations, particularly in size and scope, the efficacy of these doses could not be conclusively established. Therefore, further validation through a larger phase 2b or phase 3 studies is necessary to assess the potential therapeutic benefits and to refine the optimal dosing strategy for improving clinical outcomes in this patient population.

### Off-label use of tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fYWKu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Tenecteplase has a well-characterized mechanism of action with important practical advantages in administration and superior clinical efficacy for patients with large-vessel occlusion, as demonstrated by randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Despite the advantages of tenecteplase and the recent endorsement of its use in national and international guidelines, alteplase remains the only regulatory-approved intravenous thrombolytic agent for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Although the use of intravenous tenecteplase for acute stroke treatment is still considered off-label, intravenous tenecteplase is increasingly being used for the treatment of AIS, particularly in countries where tenecteplase has a lower cost than alteplase.

Because several stroke centers around the world have published their local experience with the off-label use of intravenous tenecteplase for AIS, we decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the available evidence on the association of intravenous tenecteplase compared with intravenous alteplase with the outcomes provided by these nonrandomized studies.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: the multicenter, randomized, BRIDGE-TNK trial protocol [^114sq6HB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Six randomized trials have not detected a difference between intravenous alteplase plus endovascular thrombectomy and endovascular thrombectomy alone in stroke. Tenecteplase, a recombinant human tenecteplase tissue-type plasminogen activator, is a genetically modified variant of alteplase. It is unclear whether the outcomes are different if alteplase is replaced with tenecteplase. This trial aims to determine whether intravenous tenecteplase within 4.5 hours of time last known well confers benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion who undergo endovascular thrombectomy.

Methods

BRIDGE-TNK (Thrombectomy With Versus Without rhTNK-tPA in Stroke) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded end point evaluation conducted at 40 thrombectomy-capable centers in China. This trial will randomize 544 patients with intravenous thrombolysis-eligible stroke (272 in each arm) with large-vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours of last known well to receive bridging intravenous tenecteplase with endovascular thrombectomy (tenecteplase-plus-thrombectomy group) or endovascular thrombectomy alone (thrombectomy-alone group). The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving functional independence, defined as a score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin Scale, at 90days. Safety will be assessed via symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 48 hours and death at 90days.

Conclusions

BRIDGE-TNK will provide important data on the role of intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion who can be treated within 4.5 hours of last known well.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke [^116iLv3P]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study EXTEND-IA TNK was published by Bruce C V Campbell and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of tenecteplase among patients with ischemic stroke who are eligible to undergo thrombectomy? In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the population was: 202 patients (92 female, 110 male). The inclusion criteria were patients within 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were severe preexisting disability with mRS score > 3, pregnancy, ICH, rapidly improving symptoms at the discretion of the investigator. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the interventions were: n = 101 tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg of body weight with a maximum dose of 25 mg) n = 101 alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 90 mg). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reperfusion of > 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment (22% vs. 10%; IR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.4). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median mRS score at 90 days (2 points vs. 3 points; OR 1.7, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in incidence of recovery to independent function; mRS score of 0–2 at 90 days (64% vs. 51%; IR 1.2, 95% CI 1 to 1.5) No significant difference in early neurologic improvement at 72 hours (71% vs. 68%; IR 1, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.2). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma. significant difference in death (10% vs. 18%). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients within 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy, tenecteplase was superior to alteplase with respect to reperfusion of > 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment.

### Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke [^113DLvpQ]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase has been associated with better clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with confirmed large vessel occlusions compared to IVT with alteplase. However, the utility of tenecteplase for the treatment of all AIS patients eligible for IVT has not been established.

Methods

We compared the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase versus alteplase in AIS patients by analyzing propensity score matched data from 20 centers participating in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register. Patients receiving IVT with tenecteplase were matched with up to 3 patients receiving alteplase from the same center. The primary outcome of interest was the distribution of 3-month functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the rates of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) in the first 24 hours, excellent (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score = 0–1) or good (mRS score = 0–2) functional outcome, and all-cause mortality at 3months.

Results

A total of 331 tenecteplase-treated AIS patients were matched to 797 patients treated with alteplase (median age = 70years, 43.9% women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 11, interquartile range = 6–17). Patients treated with tenecteplase had better 3-month functional outcomes (common odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–2.00) with higher odds of good functional outcome (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.45–2.77) and a lower likelihood of all-cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27–0.67) at 3 months, compared to alteplase-treated patients. No difference was found in the likelihood of the 3-month excellent functional outcomes (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.96–1.78) and 24-hour SICH (1.0% vs 1.3%, OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.20–2.64).

Interpretation

IVT with tenecteplase was associated with better 3-month clinical outcomes compared to IVT with alteplase in AIS patients, with no increased risk of symptomatic intracranial bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:349–357.

### Advances in acute ischemic stroke therapy [^114cfn65]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute ischemic stroke continues to advance. The mainstay of treatment remains intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase. Recent studies demonstrated that later treatment with alteplase is beneficial in patients selected with advanced imaging techniques. Tenecteplase has been evaluated as an alternative thrombolytic drug and evidence suggests that it is as least as effective as alteplase and may lyse large vessel clots more effectively. Endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy has now been shown to be beneficial up to 24 hours after stroke onset in carefully selected patients with proximal, large vessel occlusions. Ongoing studies are evaluating the effectiveness of thrombectomy in patients with more distal vessel occlusions and patients with proximal large vessel occlusions with larger ischemic core volumes and also in patients with milder neurological deficits. Cytoprotection is another potential acute stroke therapy that has not demonstrated efficacy in prior clinical trials. It should be reconsidered as an adjunct to reperfusion and a variety of new clinical trials can be envisioned to evaluate the potential benefits of cytoprotection in patients before and after reperfusion.

### Off-label use of tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114J6x5w]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, the present study is the first meta-analysis of nonrandomized evidence on the comparison between tenecteplase and alteplase in the treatment of AIS using data from different clinical settings. The results are similar to a meta-analysis of RCT data on this same issue. Tenecteplase use as an intravenous thrombolytic agent for patients with AIS (with and without an underlying large-vessel occlusion) was associated with higher odds of early neurologic improvement and good functional outcome compared with intravenous alteplase. Tenecteplase administration was also associated with a 2-fold higher likelihood of successful recanalization in patients with acute intracranial vessel occlusions compared with intravenous alteplase. No significant difference in the risk of intracranial bleeding between the 2 intravenous thrombolytic agents was noted.

Our findings are in line with evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs, suggesting that patients with confirmed large-vessel occlusions receiving intravenous tenecteplase have a 3-fold higher odds of successful recanalization (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.73–5.40) and 2-fold higher odds of favorable functional outcome (mRS score, 0–2) at 3 months (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.15–3.69), with no significant increase in the risk of intracranial bleeding, compared with those receiving intravenous alteplase. Consistent with our findings, to our knowledge, neither individual RCTs nor other meta-analyses published to date have suggested any safety concerns with the use of tenecteplase compared with alteplase on the risks of intracranial hemorrhage and all-cause mortality.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^1129d2rJ]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Current trials, such as Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke (POST-TNK), Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase After Successful Endovascular Therapy (ANGEL-TNK), and Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Mechanical Thrombectomy (ALLY), explored various dosing regimens of intra-arterial tenecteplase, specifically 0.0625 mg/kg, 0.1250 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg to 4.5 mg, respectively. These doses were selected based on established fractions of the intravenous alteplase dose used in previous studies like the CHOICE trial, or through recommendations from trial steering committees, rather than through systematic dose-escalation studies. The insights gained from the DATE study accordingly provide important data for empirically defining the optimal dose to enhance patient safety and patient outcomes and refine stroke treatment protocols. This systematic approach may ultimately contribute to a more effective management of acute ischemic stroke in the context of EVT.

The advent of studies of dosing strategies for intra-arterial lytic agents after successful EVT highlights a gap in our pharmacologic understanding of optimal dosing for intra-arterial administration. Unlike intravenous thrombolytic administration of drug, where dosing has been extensively studied and standardized, intra-arterial administration requires careful consideration of distinct pharmacokinetics, local drug concentration at the site of occlusion, and patient-specific factors. The intricacies of intra-arterial drug delivery may necessitate a more tailored approach to determine the most effective and safe dose.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, included studies were nonrandomized; thus, imbalances in patient characteristics are expected between the intravenous tenecteplase and intravenous alteplase groups. For this reason, we also report the adjusted treatment associations with the outcomes of interest. Most of the studies provided adjusted associations for the outcomes of interest using multivariable regression models, with confounders selected either a priori, or from univariable associations. In one study, the process for the selection of covariates included in the multivariable analysis was not provided. Another study used propensity score matching to address imbalances in baseline characteristics, using a priori confounders to estimate the propensity score for each patient (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Despite the differences in the methods used for adjustment and the selection process for confounders between included studies, no evidence of heterogeneity was evident in the adjusted analyses for the efficacy end points (Table 2). However, the number of studies included in the adjusted analyses is low because some of the eligible studies provided only crude associations for the outcomes of interest. Second, as highlighted in our bias assessment, the selection of the overall population and alteplase control groups in some of the studies raises concerns about unmeasured confounding owing to the different time periods and institutions in which patients in the case and control groups were treated. Third, although in all studies the standard intravenous alteplase dose (0.9 mg/kg) was used, the intravenous tenecteplase dose varied both within and between studies, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg, with most studies using the 0.25-mg/kg dose (Table 1). In patients with AIS due to a large-vessel occlusion, no significant differences in clinical and radiologic end points were documented between the 0.40- and 0.25-mg/kg doses, with the exception of a numerically higher intracranial bleeding risk with the 0.4-mg/kg dose. Fourth, there was no central adjudication of the symptomatic intracranial bleeding and successful recanalization events or blinding of the clinical outcome assessors for the majority of included studies.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^112CokVE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase Thrombolysis Followed by Endovascular Therapy

The EXTEND‐IA TNK study (Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase Before Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke)compared the efficacy of tenecteplase (administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg) to alteplase in thrombectomy candidates with occlusion of the internal carotid artery, basilar artery, or middle cerebral artery within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The results of the study showed that tenecteplase significantly increased the absolute rate of successful recanalization of large vessels by 12% compared with alteplase. The subsequent EXTEND‐IA TNK part 2 trialis the first substantial head‐to‐head comparison of the 2 candidate doses of tenecteplase for ischemic stroke and showed a similar percentage (19.3%) in > 50% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory comparing tenecteplase doses of 0.4 and 0.25 mg/kg. There were no significant differences in functional outcomes, all‐cause deaths, and sICH between the 2 groups. These findings suggested that the higher dose of 0.4 mg/kg of tenecteplase did not provide any advantage over the lower dose of 0.25 mg/kg in patients with major vessel occlusion who were scheduled for endovascular thrombectomy. In the 2019 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association acute stroke guidelines, it was suggested that choosing tenecteplase (administered as a single intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 25 mg) for bridging therapy patients may be a reasonable option over alteplase (class of recommendation IIb, level of evidence B‐R [moderate level of evidence from randomized clinical trials]).

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: the multicenter, randomized, BRIDGE-TNK trial protocol [^116W8LZM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Combined intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) are recommended for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large‐vessel occlusion (LVO) in American and Chinese guidelines. Intravenous thrombolysis is a double‐edged sword with both potential benefits and risks. Six randomized controlled trials since 2018 have assessed the role of intravenous thrombolysis before EVT in patients with thrombolysis‐eligible stroke presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. An individual‐level pooled analysis of these 6 trials, the Improving Reperfusion Strategies in Acute Ischemic Stroke collaboration, included 2313 patients with acute ischemic stroke with LVO within 4.5 hours of last known well. However, it established neither noninferiority nor superiority of EVT alone compared with intravenous thrombolysis plus EVT. The design of these trials was not identical, but all trials used alteplase, and only 2.2% (25/2313) received tenecteplase, which was insufficient for any analysis to study the treatment effect of tenecteplase. Moreover, the Improving Reperfusion Strategies in Acute Ischemic Stroke meta‐analysis showed that the benefit of bridging thrombolysis was time dependent, with earlier treatment associated with better outcome.

Tenecteplase, a recombinant human tenecteplase tissue‐type plasminogen activator, is a new generation of fibrinolytic that has 3 amino acids modifications versus alteplase. Compared with alteplase, tenecteplase has a longer plasma half‐life, higher fibrin specificity, greater resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1, and higher speed of thrombolysis, making it more likely that tenecteplase can achieve successful reperfusion with a single intravenous bolus. A randomized controlled trial comparing tenecteplase with alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke showed that tenecteplase was associated with a higher rate of recanalization and lower disability level than alteplase. It is uncertain whether tenecteplase bridging thrombectomy may yield more favorable outcomes than thrombectomy alone.

Therefore, we designed the BRIDGE‐TNK (Randomized Trial of Thrombectomy With Versus Without rhTNK‐tPA in Stroke), to test the hypothesis that intravenous tenecteplase before EVT will improve clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to LVO who are treatable within 4.5 hours of last known well and will not increase the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or death.

### Short-term safety and effectiveness for tenecteplase and alteplase in acute ischemic stroke [^112LL8c9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide as of 2021 with opportunities for improvement in the quality of acute care. Tenecteplase is an alternative to alteplase for intravenous thrombolytic treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Emerging evidence from randomized clinical trials supports that tenecteplase is at least noninferior to alteplase for thrombolytic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and potentially superior for treating stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO).,

There is a biological basis for these clinical trial findings. Tenecteplase has greater fibrin specificity and a longer half-life than alteplase, permitting more simple preparation and administration with a single bolus for 5 to 10 seconds, whereas alteplase requires an initial bolus immediately followed by a 60-minute infusion. These differences are associated with other process-related advantages of tenecteplase over alteplase in acute ischemic stroke, in which earlier initiation of treatment is associated with better outcomes. Delays or interruptions may occur in starting alteplase infusion after bolus or during infusion of alteplase, which may lead to diminished efficacy of alteplase. In addition, alteplase may lead to delays in interfacility transfers for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) because the 1-hour infusion associated with alteplase may need to be completed before ambulance transport when advanced life support transport is not available. There is also evidence that tenecteplase is associated with fewer dosing errors, given the relatively simple administration, compared with alteplase.

However, clinical effectiveness and safety outcomes with tenecteplase vs alteplase are not well understood across diverse clinical settings and populations in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of tenecteplase and alteplase using data from the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)–Stroke nationwide registry in the US. The GWTG-Stroke program enables the evaluation of clinical outcomes for tenecteplase vs alteplase over a wide range of stroke severity, prestroke disability, comorbidities, and hospital size and volume that exists in clinical practice.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^111iPm2Z]. European Stroke Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous tenecteplase, ESO 2023 guidelines recommend to administer tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in patients with large vessel occlusion AIS of < 4.5 hours duration eligible for IV thrombolysis while not should delaying mechanical thrombectomy.
Consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg over skipping IV thrombolysis in these patients directly admitted to a thrombectomy-capable center. Consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg followed by rapid transfer to a thrombectomy-capable center in patients admitted to a center without mechanical thrombectomy capability.

### Routine use of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^114wDrSV]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

In ischemic stroke, intravenous tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase in selected patients and has some practical advantages. Several stroke centers in New Zealand changed to routine off-label intravenous tenecteplase due to improved early recanalization in large vessel occlusion, inconsistent access to thrombectomy within stroke networks, and for consistency in treatment protocols between patients with and without large vessel occlusion. We report the feasibility and safety outcomes in tenecteplase-treated patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients thrombolyzed with intravenous tenecteplase at 1 comprehensive and 2 regional stroke centers from July 14, 2018, to February 29, 2020. We report the baseline clinical characteristics, rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and angioedema. These were then compared with patient outcomes with those treated with intravenous alteplase at 2 other comprehensive stroke centers. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models were performed assessing the association of tenecteplase with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and independent outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2) at day 90.

Results

There were 165 patients treated with tenecteplase and 254 with alteplase. Age (75 versus 74 years), sex (56% versus 60% male), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (8 versus 10), median door-to-needle times (47 versus 48 minutes), or onset-to-needle time (129 versus 130 minutes) were similar between the groups. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3 (1.8% [95% CI, 0.4–5.3]) tenecteplase patients compared with 7 (2.7% [95% CI, 1.1–5.7]) alteplase patients (P = 0.75). There were no differences between tenecteplase and alteplase in the rates of angioedema (4 [2.4%; 95% CI, 0.7–6.2] versus 1 [0.4%; 95% CI, 0.01–2.2], P = 0.08) or 90-day functional independence (100 [61%] versus 140 [57%], P = 0.47), respectively. In mixed-effects logistic regression models, there was no significant association between thrombolytic choice and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio tenecteplase, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.14–2.80], P = 0.53) or functional independence (odds ratio tenecteplase, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.74–1.95], P = 0.46).

Conclusions

Routine use of tenecteplase for stroke thrombolysis was feasible and had comparable safety profile and outcome to alteplase.

### Safety and efficacy of tenecteplase in older patients with large vessel occlusion: a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK trials [^1175gsTk]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Detailed study of tenecteplase (TNK) in patients older than 80 years is limited. The objective of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of TNK at 0.25 and 0.40 mg/kg doses in patients older than 80 years with large vessel occlusion.

Methods

We performed a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK randomized controlled trials (n = 502). Patients were adults presenting with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral, or basilar artery presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. We compared the treatment effect of TNK 0.25 mg/kg, TNK 0.40 mg/kg, and alteplase 0.90 mg/kg, stratifying for patient age (> 80 years). Outcomes evaluated include 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, all-cause mortality, and symptomatic ICH. Treatment effect was adjusted for baseline NIH Stroke Score, age, and time from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects proportional odds and logistic regression models.

Results

In patients > 80 years (n = 137), TNK 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day mRS (median 3 vs 4, adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) 2.70, 95% CI 1.23–5.94) and reduced mortality (acOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13–0.91) vs 0.40 mg/kg. TNK 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day mRS (median 3 vs 4, acOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.03–5.05) vs alteplase. No difference in 90-day mRS or mortality was detected between alteplase and TNK 0.40 mg/kg. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 4 patients treated with TNK 0.40 mg/kg, 1 patient treated with alteplase, and 0 patients treated with TNK 0.25 mg/kg. In patients ≤ 80 years, no differences in 90-day mRS, mortality, or symptomatic ICH were observed among TNK 0.25 mg/kg, alteplase, and TNK 0.40 mg/kg.

Discussion

TNK 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day mRS and lower mortality in patients older than 80 years. No differences among the doses were observed in younger patients.

Trial Registration Information

NCT02388061, NCT03340493.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg given before endovascular therapy in patients > 80 years old with large vessel occlusion stroke is associated with better functional outcomes at 90 days and reduced mortality when compared to tenecteplase 0.40 mg/kg or alteplase 0.90 mg/kg.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^112MmuXg]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose, safety, and efficacy of intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion by endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent adverse events and signals of efficacy of intra-arterial tenecteplase in LVO after successful reperfusion with thrombectomy, defined as an Extended Treatment in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b-3.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This open-label, blinded-outcome assessment trial, incorporating a 14+8 dose-escalation (phase 1b, nonrandomized) and dose-expansion (phase 2a, randomized) design, was conducted in China between 2023 and 2024, with follow-up continuing through November 2024. This was a multicenter clinical trial including patients with LVO and successful reperfusion within 24 hours of last known well.

Interventions

In phase 1b, intra-arterial tenecteplase, 0.0313, 0.0625, 0.1250, 0.1875 mg/kg; in phase 2a, intra-arterial tenecteplase 0.0313 or 0.0625 mg/kg, or control (without intra-arterial thrombolysis).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome in phase 1b was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours. The primary outcome in phase 2a was 90-day no-disability outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–1).

Results

A total of 205 patients (phase 1b: 48, phase 2a: 157) were enrolled and analyzed. The median (IQR) age was 71 (60–77) years, and 113 (55.1%) were male. In phase 1b, 1 of 14 and 2 of 22 patients with sICH were observed at dose tiers 0.0313 and 0.0625 mg/kg, respectively. Three of 12 patients had sICH at dose tier 0.1250 mg/kg, exceeding the prespecified safety threshold (P = 0.04). In phase 2a, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive tenecteplase, 0.0313 mg/kg (n = 46) and 0.0625 mg/kg (n = 46), and 65 patients composed the control group. The primary outcome occurred in 22 of 65 patients (33.8%) in the control group, 17 of 46 patients (37.0%) in the tenecteplase, 0.0313 mg/kg, group (adjusted risk ratio [RR] vs control, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.54–1.35; p = 0.50), and 20 of 46 patients (43.5%) in the tenecteplase, 0.0625 mg/kg, group (adjusted RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73–1.80; p = 0.55). No significant difference in the safety outcomes was observed among the 3 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this phase 1 and 2 randomized clinical trial reveal that adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase dosages of 0.0313 mg/kg or 0.0625 mg/kg after successful reperfusion in patients with anterior circulation LVO showed adequate safety to advance to larger trials to determine the potential therapeutic benefits.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^111dL4dV]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This trial has several limitations. First, the phase 1b design was a nonrandomized study, and the phase 2a study was conducted in an open-label manner. However, the outcomes were assessed by clinicians who were blinded to the treatment assignments. Second, the trial was not powered to achieve definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful EVT in improving outcomes for patients with anterior circulation LVO ischemic stroke but to identify adequately safe doses for further testing. Future larger sample size trials to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful EVT are necessary. Third, although patients in this study were randomized with stratification based on age and admission NIHSS score, there was a slight imbalance in occlusion sites between groups. To mitigate potential bias, adjusted analyses were conducted. Fourth, perfusion studies were not required to be performed to better characterize tissue-level penumbra and core status. This approach increases the pragmatic applicability of trial results but reduces explanatory insight into response mechanisms. Fifth, the trial was conducted in Asian patients with anterior LVO and small ischemic core; the findings may not be generalizable to other populations.

Other IV fibrinolytics — tenecteplase 0.4-mg/kg in minor neurological impairment — Tenecteplase administered as a 0.4-mg/kg single IV bolus has not been proven to be superior or noninferior to alteplase but might be considered as an alternative to alteplase in patients with minor neurological impairment and no major intracranial occlusion. IV tenecteplase has been compared with IV alteplase up to 6 hours after stroke onset in 3 phase II and 1 phase III superiority trials; in the largest trial of 1100 subjects, tenecteplase at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg failed to demonstrate superiority and had a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of alteplase in a population with minor neurological impairment (median NIHSS score, 4) and no major intracranial occlusion. Tenecteplase is given as a single IV bolus as opposed to the 1-hour infusion of alteplase.

### Intravenous tenecteplase before thrombectomy in stroke [^117WT3vy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The safety and efficacy of treatment with intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion remain uncertain.

Methods

In this open-label trial conducted in China, we randomly assigned patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion who had presented within 4.5 hours after onset and were eligible for thrombolysis to receive either intravenous tenecteplase followed by endovascular thrombectomy or endovascular thrombectomy alone. The primary outcome was functional independence (a score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin scale; range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included successful reperfusion before and after thrombectomy. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours and death within 90 days.

Results

A total of 278 patients were randomly assigned to the tenecteplase-thrombectomy group and 272 to the thrombectomy-alone group. Functional independence at 90 days was observed in 147 patients (52.9%) in the tenecteplase-thrombectomy group and in 120 patients (44.1%) in the thrombectomy-alone group (unadjusted risk ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.43; P = 0.04). A total of 6.1% of the patients in the tenecteplase-thrombectomy group and 1.1% of those in the thrombectomy-alone group had successful reperfusion before thrombectomy, and 91.4% and 94.1%, respectively, had successful reperfusion after thrombectomy. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours occurred in 8.5% of the patients in the tenecteplase-thrombectomy group and in 6.7% of those in the thrombectomy-alone group; mortality at 90 days was 22.3% and 19.9%, respectively.

Conclusions

Among patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion who had presented within 4.5 hours after onset, the percentage of patients with functional independence at 90 days was higher with intravenous tenecteplase plus endovascular thrombectomy than with endovascular thrombectomy alone.

### Effect of time to thrombolysis on clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with tenecteplase compared to alteplase: analysis from the AcT randomized controlled trial [^113oD8CM]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The AcT (Alteplase Compared to Tenecteplase) randomized controlled trial showed that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase in treating patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The effect of time to treatment on clinical outcomes with alteplase is well known; however, the nature of this relationship is yet to be described with tenecteplase. We assessed whether the association of time to thrombolysis treatment with clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke differs by whether they receive intravenous tenecteplase versus alteplase.

Methods

Patients included were from AcT, a pragmatic, registry-linked, phase 3 randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous tenecteplase to alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Eligible patients were > 18 years old, with disabling neurological deficits, presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and eligible for thrombolysis. Primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included 24-hour symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and 90-day mortality rates. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess the following: (a) the association of stroke symptom onset to needle time; (b) door (hospital arrival) to needle time with outcomes; and (c) if these associations were modified by type of thrombolytic administered (tenecteplase versus alteplase), after adjusting for age, sex, baseline stroke severity, and site of intracranial occlusion.

Results

Of the 1538 patients included in this analysis, 1146 (74.5%; 591 tenecteplase and 555 alteplase) presented within 3 hours versus 392 (25.5%; 196: TNK and 196 alteplase) who presented within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Baseline patient characteristics in the 0 to 3 hours versus 3- to 4.5-hour time window were similar, except patients in the 3- to 4.5-hour window had lower median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity Scale (10 versus 7, respectively) and lower proportion of patients with large vessel occlusion on baseline CT angiography (26.9% versus 18.7%, respectively). Type of thrombolytic agent (tenecteplase versus alteplase) did not modify the association between continuous onset to needle time (P interaction = 0.161) or door-to-needle time (P interaction = 0.972) and primary clinical outcome. Irrespective of the thrombolytic agent used, each 30-minute reduction in onset to needle time was associated with a 1.8% increase while every 10 minutes reduction in door-to-needle time was associated with a 0.2% increase in the probability of achieving 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1, respectively.

Conclusions

The effect of time to tenecteplase administration on clinical outcomes is like that of alteplase, with faster administration resulting in better clinical outcomes.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^1169YZfb]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The Effect of Intra-Arterial Alteplase vs Placebo Following Successful Thrombectomy on Functional Outcomes in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Acute Ischemic Stroke (CHOICE) trial, which investigated the effects of intra-arterial alteplase vs placebo after successful thrombectomy in patients with LVO acute ischemic stroke, demonstrated the potential benefit of administering intra-arterial alteplase at a dose equivalent to one-quarter of the standard intravenous thrombolytic dose. To our knowledge, studies that include a dose-escalation exploratory component are limited, leaving the optimal dose that balances efficacy and safety undetermined.

Tenecteplase is a modified form of alteplase that has been shown to have equal safety and better functional outcomes compared with alteplase. Given the differences of tenecteplase compared with alteplase, adjunctive intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase may provide greater benefit for patients with LVO stroke after successful EVT. However, the optimal dose, efficacy, and safety of intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion is unknown. The Safety and Efficacy of Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Successful Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion (DATE) trial was a phase 1b and 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion by EVT in patients with anterior circulation LVO presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis of phase III randomised trials [^113xVz2c]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

TNK has shown a higher recanalisation rate and lower risk of haemorrhagic events in several phase II trialsand has been recommended as a potential alternative to alteplase in the 2019 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines(IIb class of recommendations and B-R level of evidence). However, the latest 2023 European Stroke Organisation Guideline strongly recommended that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg can be used as a safe and effective alternative to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg for patients with AIS or large vessel occlusion AIS within 4.5 hours of onset based on a moderate quality of evidence. The latest phase III Tenecteplase in Patients With AIS (AcT)and Tenecteplase Reperfusion therapy in Acute ischaemic Cerebrovascular Events-2 (TRACE-2)trials demonstrated that IV TNK (0.25 mg/kg) was non-inferior to alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) in patients with AIS within 4.5 hours of symptom onset when comparing the efficacy defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–1 at 90 days. The phase III NOR-TEST (Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke) Trialalso showed a similar efficacy and safety profile between 0.4 mg/kg tenecteplase and 0.9 mg/kg alteplase in stroke patients with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 4 points at baseline, whereas the NOR-TEST 2 trial was terminated early when moderate or severe AIS patients treated with 0.4 mg/kg resulted in higher rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) and worse clinical outcomes than those received 0.9 mg/kg alteplase. Therefore, consensus is lacking on the non-inferiority of TNK to alteplase in treating all types of patients with AIS.

Therefore, we provided an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of phase III clinical trials in AIS patients treated with TNK, and aimed to test the non-inferiority of TNK comparing to alteplase.

### Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis [^112mufs1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to international stroke guidelines, standard care for patients presenting with a large-vessel occlusion ischaemic stroke is the administration of intravenous thrombolytic in eligible patients, alongside endovascular mechanical thrombectomy. As thrombolytics became well established before thrombectomy was proven to improve functional outcome, all participants in the positive thrombectomy trials received intravenous thrombolytic when eligible.

An individual participant data meta-analysis of six recent randomised controlled trials, comparing thrombectomy alone versus intravenous thrombolytic before thrombectomy in patients with an anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion, neither found non-inferiority nor inferiority of thrombectomy alone. In these six trials, alteplase was used almost exclusively as the thrombolytic agent and only 25 patients (2.2%) — exclusively from one trial — were treated with tenecteplase, a genetically modified variant of alteplase with greater fibrin specificity and a longer half-life that allows bolus administration. Furthermore, the EXTEND-IA-TNK trial showed that tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg) before thrombectomy was associated with a higher rate of reperfusion and better functional outcome when compared with alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg).

Randomised controlled data in patients treated with tenecteplase prior to thrombectomy versus thrombectomy alone are currently lacking. Therefore, we compared bridging thrombolytic with tenecteplase before thrombectomy to thrombectomy alone by emulating a target trial using individual patient data from three randomised controlled trials.

Sample Size Calculation

For dose escalation (phase 1b), according to the Chinese Acute Anterior Circulatory Ischemic Stroke Endovascular Treatment Registry Study, 13.8% of patients experienced sICH within 24 hours of receiving EVT. Using sample sizes typical for dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trials, we used a 14 + 8 design scheme with the occurrence of sICH within 24 hours after EVT as the dose-limiting toxic effect. At each tier, 14 patients were enrolled, beginning with the lowest prespecified dose. If fewer than 2 of 14 patients developed sICH, the trial advanced to the next tier dose. If 2 of the 14 patients developed sICH, 8 more patients were enrolled at that dose. If 0 to 1 of the additional 8 patients developed sICH, the trial advanced to the next tier dose. If 2 of the additional 8 patients developed sICH or 3 of the first 14 developed sICH, that dose was deemed not tolerated and the immediately preceding dose was the estimated maximum tolerated dose.

For dose expansion (phase 2a), patients enrolled were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: the dose A group, the dose B group, and the control group.

There were no significant differences in other prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes among groups. The results in the prespecified pooled analysis yielded similar results. The full distribution of outcomes across all 7 mRS levels is shown in Figure 2 B. No patients had major protocol violations; therefore, the planned per-protocol sensitivity analysis was not needed.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous tenecteplase, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider administering tenecteplase (single IV bolus of 0.4-mg/kg) as an alternative to alteplase in patients with minor neurological impairment and no major intracranial occlusion.

### Thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke: current status and future perspectives [^1121q7Ry]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Alteplase is currently the only approved thrombolytic agent for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, but interest is burgeoning in the development of new thrombolytic agents for systemic reperfusion with an improved safety profile, increased efficacy, and convenient delivery. Tenecteplase has emerged as a potential alternative thrombolytic agent that might be preferred over alteplase because of its ease of administration and reported efficacy in patients with large vessel occlusion. Ongoing research efforts are also looking at potential improvements in recanalisation with the use of adjunct therapies to intravenous thrombolysis. New treatment strategies are also emerging that aim to reduce the risk of vessel reocclusion after intravenous thrombolysis administration. Other research endeavors are looking at the use of intra-arterial thrombolysis after mechanical thrombectomy to induce tissue reperfusion. The growing implementation of mobile stroke units and advanced neuroimaging could boost the number of patients who can receive intravenous thrombolysis by shortening onset-to-treatment times and identifying patients with salvageable penumbra. Continued improvements in this area will be essential to facilitate the ongoing research endeavors and to improve delivery of new interventions.

### Functional outcome, recanalization, and hemorrhage rates after large vessel occlusion stroke treated with tenecteplase before thrombectomy [^1141wEXU]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To investigate in routine care the efficacy and safety of IV thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase prior to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic strokes (LVO-AIS), either secondarily transferred after IVT or directly admitted to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC).

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed clinical and procedural data of patients treated with 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase within 270 minutes of LVO-AIS who underwent brain angiography. The main outcome was 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2). Recanalization (revised Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score 2b-3) was evaluated before (pre-MT) and after MT (final).

Results

We included 588 patients (median age 75 years [interquartile range (IQR) 61–84]; 315 women [54%]; median NIH Stroke Scale score 16 [IQR 10–20]), of whom 520 (88%) were secondarily transferred after IVT. Functional independence occurred in 47% (n = 269/570; 95% confidence interval [CI] 43.0–51.4) of patients. Pre-MT recanalization occurred in 120 patients (20.4%; 95% CI 17.2–23.9), at a similar rate across treatment paradigms (direct admission, n = 14/68 [20.6%]; secondary transfer, n = 106/520 [20.4%]; p > 0.99) despite a shorter median IVT to puncture time in directly admitted patients (38 [IQR 23–55] vs 86 [IQR 70–110] minutes; p < 0.001). Final recanalization was achieved in 492 patients (83.7%; 95%CI 80.4–86.6). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 2.5% of patients (n = 14/567; 95% CI 1.4–4.1).

Discussions

Tenecteplase before MT is safe, effective, and achieves a fast recanalization in everyday practice in patients secondarily transferred or directly admitted to a CSC, in line with published results. These findings should encourage its wider use in bridging therapy.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that tenecteplase within 270 minutes of LVO-AIS increases the probability of functional independence.

### Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis [^115hcs4s]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this target trial emulation of individual patient data from three randomised controlled trials comparing tenecteplase before thrombectomy versus thrombectomy alone, we found that tenecteplase before thrombectomy did not impact functional independence at 90 days when compared with thrombectomy alone but resulted in increased rates of freedom from disability and functional improvement by at least one category in ordinal analysis of the full mRS scale at 90 days. The improvement in outcomes was most evident in patients treated early with tenecteplase (time-to-IVT ≤ 140 min). Finally, rates of reperfusion prior to thrombectomy were higher in patients receiving tenecteplase before thrombectomy, while safety outcomes did not significantly differ compared with patients treated with thrombectomy alone.

In the Improving Reperfusion Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (IRIS) collaboration meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials, thrombectomy alone was neither inferior nor non-inferior compared with bridging thrombolysis before thrombectomy in patients with stroke due to anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion. However, these findings primarily apply to bridging thrombolytic with alteplase. Randomised controlled trials investigating bridging with tenecteplase versus thrombectomy alone are underway (BRIDGE-TNK, NCT04733742; DIRECT-TNK, NCT05199194) but the estimated completion date for these trials is March 2026 and July 2027, respectively.

Outcomes

In phase 1b, the primary outcome of sICH within 24 hours occurred in 1 of 14 patients (7.1%) who received tenecteplase at a dose of 0.0313 mg/kg; 2 of 22 patients (9.1%) who received tenecteplase at a dose of 0.0625 mg/kg; and 3 of 12 patients (25.0%) who received tenecteplase at a dose of 0.1250 mg/kg (Figure 2 A). The differences in sICH among the 3 groups are statistically significant (P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in the predefined secondary clinical efficacy outcomes among the groups. The details of the outcomes are presented in eTable 3 in Supplement 3.

### Early recanalization among patients undergoing bridging therapy with tenecteplase or alteplase [^111rLdk2]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase or tenecteplase before mechanical thrombectomy is the recommended treatment for large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. There are divergent data on whether these agents differ in terms of early recanalization (ER) rates before mechanical thrombectomy, and little data on their potential differences stratified by ER predictors such as IVT to ER evaluation (IVT-to-ER eval) time, occlusion site and thrombus length.

Methods

We retrospectively compared the likelihood of ER after IVT with tenecteplase or alteplase in anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke patients from the PREDICT-RECANAL (alteplase) and Tenecteplase Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (tenecteplase) French multicenter registries. ER was defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2b-3 on the first angiographic run, or noninvasive vascular imaging in patients with early neurological improvement. Analyses were based on propensity score overlap weighting (leading to exact balance in patient history, stroke characteristics, and initial management between groups) and confirmed with adjusted logistic regression (sensitivity analysis). A stratified analysis based on pre-established ER predictors (IVT-to-ER eval time, occlusion site, and thrombus length) was conducted.

Results

Overall, 1865 patients were included. ER occurred in 156/787 (19.8%) and 199/1078 (18.5%) patients treated with tenecteplase or alteplase, respectively (odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.83–1.44]; P = 0.52). A differential effect of tenecteplase versus alteplase on the probability of ER according to thrombus length was observed (P interaction = 0.003), with tenecteplase being associated with higher odds of ER in thrombi > 10 mm (odds ratio, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.02–5.81]; P = 0.04). There was no differential effect of tenecteplase versus alteplase on the likelihood of ER according to the IVT-to-ER eval time (P interaction = 0.40) or occlusion site (P interaction = 0.80).

Conclusions

Both thrombolytics achieved ER in one-fifth of patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke without significant interaction with IVT-to-ER eval time and occlusion site. Compared with alteplase, tenecteplase was associated with a 2-fold higher likelihood of ER in larger thrombi.

### Adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke (POST-TNK): study rationale and design [^1175ML9o]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adjunct intra-arterial alteplase has been shown to potentially improve clinical outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke who have undergone successful endovascular thrombectomy. Tenecteplase, known for its enhanced fibrin specificity and extended activity duration, could potentially enhance outcomes in stroke patients after successful reperfusion when used as an adjunct intra-arterial therapy.

Aim

To explore the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients with LVO stroke.

Sample Size

To randomize 498 participants 1:1 to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase or no intra-arterial adjunctive thrombolysis therapy.

Methods and Design

An investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, blind-endpoint multicenter clinical trial. Eligible patients with anterior circulation LVO stroke presenting within 24h from symptom onset (time last known well) and excellent to complete reperfusion (expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale 2c-3) at endovascular thrombectomy are planned to be randomized.

Outcomes

The primary outcome is freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale, mRS, of 0–1) at 90days. The primary safety outcomes are mortality through 90days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48h.

Discussion

The POST-TNK trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with LVO stroke and excellent to complete reperfusion.

The results of pooled analyses, subgroup studies, and proof‐of‐concept trials in specific populations provide suggestions for patient selection for tenecteplase thrombolysis. Tenecteplase use was clearly noninferior overall and superior to alteplase in patients with LVO and target mismatch but was uncertain in patients with minor stroke, oldest patients, and extended time windows.

### Is tenecteplase ready to replace alteplase to treat acute ischaemic stroke? The knowns and unknowns [^112WnDgH]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

With limited evidence, the 2019 AIS guideline of the American Heart/Stroke Association recommended TNK 0.4 mg/kg as an alternative to tPA in selected patients with AIS of minor neurological impairments and no major intracranial occlusion, while TNK 0.25 mg/kg for LVO patients prior to thrombectomy (both with level of evidence (LOE): B-R, and class of recommendation (COR): IIb).

Current limited evidence supports no superiority of either dose over the other (0.25 mg/kg vs 0.4 mg/kg). Yet, dosage of 0.25 mg/kg is most frequently used in ongoing trials of TNK in AIS (table 1), with a support of its efficacy based on a recent network meta-analysis. In addition, TNK's efficacy when used in patient with LVO was only seen with imaging-based endpoints, while its safety is comparable to tPA. Therefore, its solid effects in treating AIS remain to be studied. TNK is likely to have its role to treat AIS, but more data are needed for it to completely replace tPA.

Table 1
Ongoing and planned clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of TNK

A series of ongoing phase III trials will further address the efficacy and safety of TNK either within early or late time windows, with or without LVO (table 1). Particularly in China, the ongoing TRACE II trial is testing the efficacy of TNK 0.25 mg/kg (single bolus, max 25 mg) as opposed to standard dose of tPA.TRACE III will study TNK in AIS due to LVO with perfusion mismatch up to 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke [^114eW5SL]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase is the standard reperfusion treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients within a time window of 4.5 h. Moreover, recent data demonstrated the benefit of IVT in patients with wake-up stroke or with stroke symptoms less than 12 h from symptom onset based on the selection with perfusion imaging. In addition to alteplase treatment, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is recommended for AIS patients due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) up to 24 h after symptom onset.

Tenecteplase, a genetically modified form of tissue plasminogen activator, is currently only approved for the treatment of myocardial infarction by the European Medicines Agency. Importantly, tenecteplase has a longer half-life compared to alteplase, leading to a major practical advantage of a single-bolus administration of tenecteplase versus a 1-h IV infusion of alteplase. A systematic review of four randomized controlled trials demonstrated that tenecteplase more frequently resulted in successful recanalization in LVO patients with an odds ratio of 3.05 (95% CI, 1.73–5.40), and better functional outcome at 90 days after stroke (odds ratio, 1.84 (95% CI, 1.18–2.87) compared to patients receiving alteplase. Currently, the European Stroke Organisation has recommended IVT with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg for LVO patients who are candidates for EVT and tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as a safe and effectiveness alternative to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg for all AIS patients eligible for IVT within 4.5 h from stroke onset. The recent AcT trial showed that tenecteplase was non-inferior to alteplase in all AIS patients who meet the standard criteria for IVT. With a similar safety profile, improved early recanalization rates, and single bolus administration, tenecteplase may be an economic alternative to alteplase for AIS patients. Our study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the two IVT treatments, tenecteplase versus alteplase, in AIS patients from a Dutch healthcare payer perspective.

### Tenecteplase thrombolysis for stroke up to 24 hours after onset with perfusion imaging selection: the umbrella phase IIa CHABLIS-T randomised clinical trial [^115Bxzvq]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombolysis with alteplase is limited by its short half-life and low recanalisation rate of large vessel occlusion. Tenecteplase — a genetically modified variant of alteplase — has gained increasing interest as an alternative for alteplase over the past decade. This is mainly due to its practical advantages (single bolus, rather than 1-hour infusion) and a number of hypothetical advantages over alteplase, including greater fibrin specificity. It has been demonstrated that tenecteplase is non-inferior to alteplase in unselected patients who had an ischaemic stroke, and may be superior to alteplase in acute large vessel occlusion. Prior tenecteplase trials have recruited acute ischaemic stroke presenting no longer than 6 hours from symptom onset. Thus, the evidence of performance of tenecteplase beyond 4.5 hours still remains scarce. Perfusion imaging selection has been shown to extend the time for thrombolysis, though increasing evidence suggests the optimal dose of tenecteplase in acute stroke of the Western population is 0.25 mg/kgand the Tenecteplase in Stroke Patients Between 4.5 and 24 Hours (TIMELESS, NCT03785678) trial has reported that 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase could improve recanalisation compared with placebo. The appropriate dose in the Chinese patients with acute large/medium vessel occlusion or severe stenosis was unknown when the trial started.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^112pF2QV]. European Stroke Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous tenecteplase, ESO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as an alternative to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in patients with AIS of < 4.5 hours duration eligible for IV thrombolysis.
Consider preferring tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in these patients in light of safety and efficacy data and because tenecteplase can be administered with a single bolus rather than a 1-hour infusion.
Do not use tenecteplase at a dose of 0.40 mg/kg.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized studies [^111v3r7v]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Alteplase is the current standard of care for acute ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase is a newer fibrinolytic agent with preferable administration and lower costs; however, its comparative effectiveness to alteplase remains uncertain. We set out to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the benefits and harms of tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to April 2023 for randomized and non-randomized studies that compared tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed both conventional meta-analyses and Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMA) with random-effects models and used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Our primary efficacy outcome was excellent functional outcome at 3 months, defined as a score of 0–1 on the modified Rankin Scale. Our primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and all-cause mortality.

Results

Thirty-six studies were eligible for review, including 12 randomized (n = 5533) and 24 non-randomized studies (n = 44,956). Moderate certainty evidence showed that there was no difference between tenecteplase and alteplase in increasing the proportion of patients achieving excellent functional outcome at 3 months (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI 0.98–1.23; risk difference [RD] 2.4%, 95% CI -0.5 to 5.2), while moderate certainty evidence from NMA suggested that 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase significantly improved excellent functional outcome at 3 months (OR, 1.16; 95% credible interval 1.02–1.32). Moderate certainty evidence showed that, compared to alteplase, tenecteplase may make little to no difference in the prevalence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.12; 95% CI 0.79–1.59; RD 0.3%, 95% CI -0.5 to 1.4), and probably reduces all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.44; 95% CI 0.30–0.64; RD -4.6%; 95% CI -5.8 to -2.9).

Conclusions

Moderate certainty evidence suggested that there was little to no difference between tenecteplase and alteplase in increasing the proportion of patients achieving excellent functional outcome at 3 months and the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, while compared to alteplase, tenecteplase probably reduce all-cause mortality. Administration of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase after acute ischemic stroke is suggestive of increasing the proportion of patients that achieve excellent functional outcome at 3 months.

### Evolving thrombolytics: from alteplase to tenecteplase [^117SRUas]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Alteplase has been the primary thrombolytic used in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke since thrombolysis was first established as an effective treatment of acute ischemic stroke in 1995. Tenecteplase, a genetically modified tissue plasminogen activator, has gained attention as an attractive alternative to alteplase given its practical workflow advantages and possible superior efficacy in large vessel recanalization. As more data is analyzed both from randomized trials and non-randomized patient registries, there is mounting support that tenecteplase appears to be at least equally, if not more, safe and potentially more effective than alteplase in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Randomized trials investigating tenecteplase in the delayed treatment window and with thrombectomy are ongoing, and their results are eagerly awaited. This paper provides an overview of completed and ongoing randomized trials and nonrandomized studies analyzing tenecteplase in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Results reviewed support the safe use of tenecteplase in clinical practice.

### Is tenecteplase ready to replace alteplase to treat acute ischaemic stroke? The knowns and unknowns [^112LSpJ7]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial (NOR-TEST) showed a similar efficacy and safety profile between the TNK (0.4 mg/kg) and tPA in patients with mild AIS within 4.5 hours of onset. In its subgroup analysis, the distribution of favourable outcome and sICH were similar between treatment groups in patients with moderate and severe stroke. However, all-cause mortality in patients with severe strokes at 90 days was increased in the TNK group (26.3% vs 9.1%; p = 0.045).

Imaging assessment has been used as a surrogate marker to compare the efficacy of TNK to that of tPA. The Alteplase-Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis (ATTEST) trial compared TNK 0.25 mg/kg to tPA 0.9 mg/kg in patients with AIS treated within 4.5 hours of onset. ATTEST failed to show a significant improvement of salvaged penumbra in the TNK group. The Australian-TNK trial required a large vessel occlusion on baseline CT angiography and substantial mismatch on baseline CT perfusion imaging to select patient for either TNK 0.1 or 0.25 mg/kg versus standard dose of tPA within 3 hours of onset. The trial showed better early neurological improvement, reperfusion and higher rates of favourable 90-day outcome in patients treated with 0.25 mg/kg of TNK. The pooled analysis of ATTEST and Australian-TNK trials showed that TNK-treated patients with a TICI (Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia Score) 0/1 occlusion had higher rate of complete recanalisation at 24 hours (71% vs 43%, p < 0.001) and had better early clinical improvement and favourable 90-day outcomes. Further analysis stressed the importance of target perfusion mismatch. The EXTEND-IA TNK study showed that TNK (0.25 mg/kg) before thrombectomy was associated with a higher rate of reperfusion and better functional outcome than the standard dose of tPA in AIS patients with an large vessel occlusion (LVO), if treated within 4.5 hours of onset.EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2 showed that TNK doses of either 0.40 or 0.25 mg/kg had no difference in improving cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. However, sICH occurred in seven patients (4.7%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group compared with two patients (1.3%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (risk ratio 3.50, 95% CI 0.74 to 16.62; p = 0.12).

### Prospective observational cohort study of tenecteplase: results from the Indian registry in ischemic stroke-tenecteplase [^115wSLBL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase has been evaluated at different doses, ranging from 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.4 mg/kg in patients with ischemic stroke. It is now established that using the high dose of 0.4 mg/kg of tenecteplase does not confer any advantage in terms of efficacy over a low dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. In fact, administration of the 0.4 mg/kg dose of tenecteplase led to premature termination of the phase‐3 clinical study, as it was associated with higher rates of mortality and symptomatic hemorrhages compared with alteplase. In India, tenecteplase is routinely being administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. One might argue that there is minimal difference between 0.2 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg but our data suggest that perhaps the lower dose may be safer without compromising efficacy. We suggest that a trial directly comparing the 2 doses is needed.

### Short-term safety and effectiveness for tenecteplase and alteplase in acute ischemic stroke [^115jAY5p]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is intravenous tenecteplase comparable to alteplase in effectiveness and safety for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke?

Findings

This comparative effectiveness study of 79 550 patients found no significant differences between tenecteplase and alteplase on effectiveness outcomes, including functional independence at discharge, freedom from disability at discharge, discharge to home, and independent ambulation at discharge; or on safety outcomes, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and combined in-hospital mortality or hospice discharge.

Meaning

These findings suggest that tenecteplase is a reasonable alternative to alteplase in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^113XyY3h]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The DATE study demonstrated that intra-arterial infusion of tenecteplase at doses of 0.0313 mg/kg or 0.0625 mg/kg, when used as an adjunct to successful reperfusion in patients with anterior circulation LVO, has an adequate safety profile to advance to further testing, whereas the next higher dose of 0.1250 mg/kg exhibited safety concerns due to a high rate of sICH. The 2 doses with an adequate safety profile did not show a statistically significant improvement in disability at 90 days, but the sample size was small, and the trial was not designed to demonstrate efficacy. The study offers valuable insights into optimizing the dosing of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase for future, larger trials.

The phase 1b findings provided a nuanced understanding of the dose-dependent safety profile of intra-arterial tenecteplase. Specifically, the tenecteplase dose, 0.1250 mg/kg, was associated with an increased risk of sICH, highlighting the delicate balance between achieving effective thrombolysis and avoiding adverse bleeding events. In contrast, the lower doses of 0.0313 mg/kg and 0.0625 mg/kg did not significantly increase bleeding risk, suggesting their potential as safer alternatives. Both of these doses continued to show acceptable sICH rates in the larger phase 2a trial stage. In addition, although the results did not reach statistical significance compared with the control group, the observed numerical trend toward efficacy suggests a potential therapeutic benefit that warrants further investigation. Continued research is crucial to fully elucidate the clinical benefits of intra-arterial tenecteplase in optimizing outcomes after EVT. Importantly, the results do not exclude the possibility of a clinically meaningful benefit from intra-arterial tenecteplase. As the dose tiers 0.0313 mg/kg and 0.0625 mg/kg were statistically comparable in phase 2a, both are candidates to advance to a larger phase 2b or phase 3 trial.

Potential Future Advances

The introduction of tenecteplase has had a significant impact on stroke thrombolysis. When administered intravenously, tenecteplase has been found to improve reperfusion and provide similar clinical effectiveness to alteplase in patients with AIS due to LVO. Importantly, the use of tenecteplase has not been associated with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. One of the major advantages of tenecteplase is its ease of administration, which could potentially lead to shorter treatment delays compared with alteplase. Recent trials have expanded the time window for tenecteplase use to 12 hours, using advanced imaging techniques for patient selection. Ongoing trials are further exploring the extension of the time window. However, there are still some unanswered questions related to tenecteplase (Table). Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the use of tenecteplase in an extended treatment window, in patients with minor strokes, in combination with endovascular therapy, and in the prehospital ambulance setting (Table S4).

Kaesmacher et al. (2024) individual participant data meta-analysis — in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion, 6 randomized clinical trials (N = 2,313; 1,160 IVT + thrombectomy; 1,153 thrombectomy alone) showed a statistically significant interaction between time from symptom onset to IVT and functional outcome (aOR per 1-h delay 0.84 [95% CI 0.72 to 0.97], P = 0.02). Median time from symptom onset to IVT administration was 2 h 28 min (interquartile range [IQR] 1 h 46 min to 3 h 17 min). After 2 h 20 min the benefit associated with IVT + thrombectomy was not significant, and the point estimate crossed the null association at 3 h 14 min; the primary outcome was disability at 90 d using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Trials were performed at thrombectomy-capable stroke centers; nearly all patients in the IVT + thrombectomy group were treated with alteplase, and results may not be generalizable to those treated with tenecteplase.

### Major bleeding postadministration of tenecteplase versus alteplase in acute ischemic stroke [^115pjSAU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tenecteplase is a genetically engineered fibrinolytic with growing interest in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Compared to alteplase, tenecteplase is effective for neurologic improvement following ischemic stroke in patients with large vessel occlusions who are eligible for thrombectomy and for mild ischemic strokes with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 0 to 5.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine if safety outcomes are different in patients receiving tenecteplase and alteplase for acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

This retrospective cohort reviewed all patients who received alteplase or tenecteplase from January 2019 to December 2020. Patients admitted before April 28, 2020, received alteplase intravenous bolus over 1 minute followed by an infusion over 1 hour, for a total of 0.9 mg/kg. Patients admitted after this date received tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as an intravenous bolus over 5 to 10 seconds. Any patient transferring from an outside facility was excluded. The primary outcome was major bleeding.

Results

There was no significant difference in major bleeding between alteplase and tenecteplase (40 [18%] vs 21 [18.1%], P = 0.985). There was no significant difference in all-cause inpatient mortality for alteplase versus tenecteplase (10 [5%] vs 5 [4%], P = 0.934) or in adverse events between the groups (22 [9%] vs 14 [12%], P = 0.541) for alteplase and tenecteplase, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Tenecteplase had similar rates of major bleeding versus alteplase and may be a reasonable alternative in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

### Tenecteplase improves reperfusion across time in large vessel stroke [^117C7Ko2]. Annals of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tenecteplase improves reperfusion compared to alteplase in patients with large vessel occlusions. To determine whether this improvement varies across the spectrum of thrombolytic agent to reperfusion assessment times, we performed a comparative analysis of tenecteplase and alteplase reperfusion rates.

Methods

Patients with large vessel occlusion and treatment with thrombolysis were pooled from the Melbourne Stroke Registry, and the EXTEND-IA and EXTEND-IA TNK trials. The primary outcome, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion, was defined as the absence of retrievable thrombus or > 50% reperfusion at imaging reassessment. We compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase and alteplase, accounting for thrombolytic to assessment exposure times, via Poisson modeling. We compared 90-day outcomes of patients who achieved reperfusion with a thrombolytic to patients who achieved reperfusion via endovascular therapy using ordinal logistic regression.

Results

Among 893 patients included in the primary analysis, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion was observed in 184 (21%) patients. Tenecteplase was associated with higher rates of reperfusion (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09–2.07, p = 0.01). Findings were consistent in patient subgroups with first segment (aIRR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.93–2.14) and second segment (aIRR = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.98–4.37) middle cerebral artery occlusions. Increased thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times were associated with reperfusion (tenecteplase: adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.08 per 15minutes, 95% CI = 1.04–1.13 vs alteplase: aRR = 1.06 per 15minutes, 95% CI = 1.00–1.13). No significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (p = 0.87). Reperfusion via thrombolysis was associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores (adjusted common odds ratio = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.54–3.01) compared to patients who achieved reperfusion following endovascular therapy.

Interpretation

Tenecteplase, compared to alteplase, increases prethrombectomy reperfusion, regardless of the time from administration to reperfusion assessment. Prethrombectomy reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:489–499.

### Off-label use of tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pNfni]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis provides supporting evidence from nonrandomized studies that intravenous tenecteplase may be a treatment option for patients with AIS that is associated with more favorable clinical outcomes compared with intravenous alteplase. This hypothesis is being evaluated in ongoing large RCTs examining the utility of intravenous tenecteplase for the treatment of patients with AIS presenting within 4.5 hours, or 24 hours, from symptom onset and in patients presenting after 4.5 hours from stroke onset or with unknown onset time. Based on the comparable safety profile of both thrombolytic agents, supported by both RCT and nonrandomized evidence, enrollment in the aforementioned ongoing RCTs appears to be appropriate.

Initial Investigation in the Optimal Dose of Tenecteplase

In 2005, a pilot dose‐escalation safety studywas conducted on 88 patients with AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset. The study evaluated the safety of tenecteplase doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg, with the primary end point being symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However, the study did not determine the optimal dose for achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months. A phase IIB/III randomized, multicenter, double‐blind trialwas conducted on 112 patients to determine the optimal dose of tenecteplase among 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 mg/kg. The study used an adaptive, sequential dose selection procedure. However, the trial was prematurely terminated as the 0.4 mg/kg dose displayed a high sICH rate. Furthermore, it was not possible to distinguish between the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg doses as neither showed clear efficacy. It should be noted that these findings represent early results that informed subsequent studies. In 2012, the Australian‐TNK (Low‐Dose Tenecteplase Versus Standard‐Dose Alteplase for Acute Ischemic Stroke) trial, another phase IIB trial based on a perfusion imaging mismatch and a proximal vessel occlusion within 6 hours after onset, demonstrated that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was superior to tenecteplase 0.1 mg/kg and alteplase 0.9 mg/kg for recanalization and 24‐hour clinical improvement, with no additional risk of hemorrhage. A longer‐term clinical benefit (0–2 score of the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] at 90 days) was also seen in the 0.25 mg/kg tier (72% versus 40%, P = 0.02). Although the sample size was very small, it was the first trial with no truncation to test the optimal dose for tenecteplase. Multimodal computed tomography (CT) imaging selection criteria in the trial resulted in exclusion of 79% (477/604) of patients who were otherwise eligible for intravenous alteplase. Instead, The ATTEST (Alteplase‐Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis) phase 2 trial, using imaging criteria as exploratory outcome measures rather than selection criteria, found a similar percentage of penumbral salvage on CT perfusion imaging when comparing 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase and standard 0.9 mg/kg alteplase (68% versus 68%) administered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. This was the first study comparing 1 dose of tenecteplase against alteplase with patients selected by criteria currently used in clinical practice to assess eligibility for thrombolysis in a 4.5‐hour window. The application of advanced imaging for outcome assessment rather than patient selection avoided restrictions of generalizability and some delay in treatment initiation. However, the use of advanced imaging did reveal some baseline imbalances, such as differences in the proportion of patients with large artery occlusion and baseline ischemic core volume. Although these imbalances were not statistically significant, they could potentially affect the interpretation of the neutral results. As a result, larger sample size phase 3 trials are warranted. The pooled analysis of these 3 trials (Haley et al, Parsons et al, and ATTEST) found that a dose of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase had the greatest odds of achieving early neurological improvement (odds ratio [OR], 3.3 [95% CI, 1.5–7.2], P = 0.093) and excellent functional outcome (mRS score 0–1) at 3 months (OR, 1.9 [95% CI, 0.8–4.4], P = 0.28), with reduced odds of ICH (OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.2–1.8], P = 0.43) compared with alteplase.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular therapy in patients with acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion: study protocol and rationale [^116NWJS2]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, a randomized controlled trial showed a beneficial effect of intra-arterial thrombolysis following successful endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. Due to differences in response to thrombolytics in occlusion of the posterior circulation, the purpose of ATTENTION IA is to explore the adjunct benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization in patients presenting with large and medium vessel occlusion of the posterior circulation.

Methods

ATTENTION-IA is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial with open-label treatment and blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE). After achieving successful recanalization (expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) 2b-3) of an occlusion of the vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral artery, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase or standard of care. The primary effect parameter is a modified Rankin Score of 0–1 at day 90.

Results

The trial recently completed enrollment, and data collection/verification is ongoing. The final results will be made available on completion of enrollment and follow-up.

Conclusions

ATTENTION-IA will provide definitive evidence for the efficacy and safety of adjunct intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful EVT in patients with an acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion stroke presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis following endovascular recanalization for large vessel occlusion stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kgqCZ]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has been proven and recommended as the preferred treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), with improved functional outcomes, while only approximately 30% of patients achieved disability-free status at 90 days after recanalization. Despite successful recanalization and apparent restoration of blood flow in large vessels, hypoperfusion after EVT, commonly referred to as the "no-reflow phenomenon", frequently occurs, indicating poor microvascular reperfusion. This phenomenon, along with early arterial re-occlusion, may contribute to suboptimal outcomes, highlighting the need for additional strategies to enhance patient recovery after endovascular recanalization.

Although intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) after endovascular recanalization has shown potential in improving functional outcomes by dissolving residual thrombi in distal arteries and the microcirculation, its overall impact remains uncertain because of conflicting findings from recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy (CHOICE) and Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase after Successful Endovascular Recanalisation in Patients with Acute Posterior Circulation Arterial Occlusion (ATTENTION) trials demonstrated that IAT improved the odds of achieving excellent outcomes without increasing the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), while the Adjunctive Intra-arterial Tenecteplase Following Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke (POST-TNK) and Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Urokinase After Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Acute Ischemic Stroke (POST-UK) trials reported no significant benefit. Furthermore, it is unclear whether patient-related treatment effect modifiers, such as age, sex, or baseline stroke severity, influence the efficacy of IAT because individual trials lacked sufficient events to provide conclusive insights. Although meta-analyses pooling observational studies have attempted to address this uncertainty, these analyses are inherently limited by study design biases and small sample sizes. Limited data exist on synthesizing data exclusively from RCTs, and evidence regarding the comprehensive impact of IAT on clinical outcomes remains inadequate.

We, therefore, performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool the results of RCTs, comparing the efficacy and safety of IAT vs control in patients with AIS due to LVO to estimate the effects of improving functional outcomes by IAT in the overall population and prespecified potential prognostic subgroups.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis [^112UgBhP]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of tenecteplase (TNK) versus alteplase (ALT) have recently been assessed in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with diverse results. Due to its high fibrin specificity and lack of excitotoxicity, TNK may have a higher efficacy and safety profile. This study aimed to evaluate the benefits and risks of TNK compared to ALT in AIS patients prior to thrombectomy.

Methods

We systematically searched four key databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library until January 27, 2024 for clinical studies evaluating the effects of TNK versus ALT in patients with large vessel occlusion undergoing MT. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Results

Ten studies involving 3722 patients receiving TNK (1266 patients) or ALT (2456 patients) were included (age: 69.05 ± 14.95 years; 55.64% male). Compared to ALT-treated patients, TNK-treated patients demonstrated significantly higher rates of early recanalization (odds ratio 2.02, 95%-confidence interval 1.20–3.38, p = 0.008) without increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (1.06, 0.64–1.76, p = 0.82) or intracerebral hemorrhage (1.21, 0.66–2.25, p = 0.54). TNK-treated patients showed similar rates of functional independence at 90 days (1.13, 0.87–1.46, p = 0.37) as ALT-treated patients, but lower rates of mortality within 90 days (0.65, 0.44–0.96, p = 0.03).

Conclusion

TNK is superior to ALT in achieving early recanalization and is associated with lower mortality within 90 days in AIS patients undergoing MT. Compared with ALT, TNK does not significantly alter functional independence at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis [^115BNfak]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and oversight

For this analysis, we emulated a hypothetical target trial according to previously published methodsin which patients with a large-vessel occlusion ischaemic stroke in the anterior circulation were treated either with bridging thrombolytic with tenecteplase prior to thrombectomy or received thrombectomy alone (without prethrombectomy bridging thrombolytic). We used data from three randomised controlled trials: the Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy Plus Intravenous t-PA vs DIRECT Solitaire StentRetriever Thrombectomy in Acute Anterior Circulation Stroke Trial (SWIFT DIRECT), the tenecteplase versus alteplase before endovascular thrombectomy trial (EXTEND-IA TNK)and the Determining the Optimal Dose of Tenecteplase Before Endovascular Therapy for Ischaemic Stroke Trial (EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2). The SWIFT DIRECT trial provided patients who received thrombectomy alone and the EXTEND-IA TNK trial and the EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2 trial provided patients who received tenecteplase before thrombectomy.

The collaborators of each trial agreed to participate in the study and the anonymised individual patient data were pooled. The characteristics of each trial are shown in online supplemental appendix eTable 1. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline (online supplemental appendix emethods 1).

Eligibility criteria

Target trial inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, diagnosis of an acute ischaemic stroke with cerebral vascular occlusion on initial CT/MRI angiography of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) or both, eligibility for intravenous thrombolytic within 4.5 hours after stroke onset and direct presentation to a centre capable of performing thrombectomy. Additionally, we defined the following exclusion criteria: mild stroke severity at onset (defined as a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) < 5 points); intention not to perform thrombectomy; prestroke functional dependence (defined as a prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score > 2); occlusions in multiple vascular territories on baseline CT/MRI angiography; pregnancy; any contraindication to intravenous thrombolytic according to international guidelines; the presence of any intracranial haemorrhage; renal failure (defined as creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL) or life expectancy < 1 year. An overview of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the target trial is presented in table 1.

### Tenecteplase, 0.4 mg / kg, in moderate and severe acute ischemic stroke: a pooled analysis of NOR-TEST and NOR-TEST 2A [^112VzTDK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Alteplase is beneficial in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in all age groups. Tenecteplase is preferable compared with alteplase in several aspects. Besides better biochemical features, including longer half‐life and higher fibrin specificity, the single‐bolus administration makes tenecteplase attractive in the acute setting, especially with the drip‐and‐ship strategy for patients with large‐vessel occlusions in need of transport for mechanical thrombectomy.

In recent years, there have been increasing research activities aiming to replace alteplase with tenecteplase for AIS. Several phase 2 trials comparing tenecteplase with alteplase, with varying inclusion criteria and tenecteplase doses, have been performed. The trials have in most cases shown similar efficacy and safety profile of the 2 thrombolytics, but data on the optimal dose have been inconclusive and based on small sample sizes or highly selected patients. Accumulated clinical trials indicated that tenecteplase may be preferable compared with alteplase in the treatment of AIS. However, the optimal dose has become a key question. NOR‐TEST (Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial) was the first phase 3 trial comparing tenecteplase, 0.4 mg/kg, with standard alteplase, 0.9 mg/kg. The cohort contained an unproportionally high number of patients with mild AIS and stroke mimics. The results were therefore difficult to apply to the general stroke population but encouraged continued research. A subanalysis of patients with moderate and severe AIS in NOR‐TEST showed similar rates of favorable outcome and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) in both treatment arms, although the mortality rate at 3 months was higher in severe AIS. On the basis of these data, closer monitoring of safety parameters in subsequent trials testing tenecteplase, 0.4 mg/kg, was recommended. NOR‐TEST 2A was designed to clarify noninferiority of tenecteplase in patients with moderate and severe AIS using the 0.4 mg/kg dose. The trial was, however, prematurely terminated when a per‐protocol safety analysis of the first 200 patients showed worse safety and functional outcomes in patients treated with tenecteplase, 0.4 mg/kg, compared with those treated with alteplase, 0.9 mg/kg. We therefore performed a pooled analysis of both NOR‐TEST trials, to illuminate efficacy and safety of tenecteplase, 0.4 mg/kg, based on a larger cohort of patients.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke in the elderly patients: a post hoc analysis of the TRACE-2 trial [^1157mH9T]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc subgroup analysis of the TRACE-2 trial including 9.6% patients with AIS within 4.5 hours of symptom onset who were > 80 years old and eligible for intravenous thrombolysis treatment without acess to thrombectomy, we found that intravenous 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase was not statistically different with 0.9 mg/kg alteplase for an excellent functional outcome without increasing risk of sICH or deaths at 90 days. Hence, increased age should not be a reason to withhold treatment with tenecteplase in AIS.

Thrombolysis in elderly patients has drawn great attention from clinicians and researchers. The benefit of intravenous alteplase was well established for adult patients with disabling stroke symptoms regardless of age and stroke severity. In clinical trials investigating tenecteplase, a potential alternative to alteplase, most studies did not employ an upper age-limit exclusion criterion. However, studies of tenecteplase in these patients are limited. The subgroup analysis from NOR-TEST (Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial) including 273 patients ≥ 80 years identified no significant differences between 0.40 mg/kg tenecteplase and 0.90 mg/kg alteplase regarding the rates mRS 0–1 at 3 months and sICH within 48 hours. Similar conclusion was drawn in the context of large vessel occlusion (LVO) and EVT in a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK trials. However, the later NOR-TEST 2 trial enrolled 24.5% (50/204) patients older than 80 years and found that a dose of 0.40 mg/kg tenecteplase did not show better mRS 0–1 after 3 months than that at 0.25 mg/kg but resulted in higher rates of sICH during the first 48 hours than with 0.9 mg/kg alteplase. In the subgroup analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK trials including 137 patients > 80 years and with LVO, a lower dose of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase was significantly associated with improved 90-day mRS compared with 0.40 mg/kg tenecteplase and alteplase after adjusting for baseline NIHSS score, age and time from symptom onset to arterial puncture, despite that there was no efficacy and safety difference of the three treatment groups (0.25 mg/kg TN, 0.4 mg/kg tenecteplase and alteplase) in the younger group. The rate of excellent functional outcome (mRS 0–1) reached 42% in the tenecteplase group compared with 17% in the alteplase group, and there was no sICH associated with tenecteplase thrombolysis. These supported that 0.25 mg/kg is the recommended dose of tenecteplase regardless of age. 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase was non-inferior to alteplase in the Intravenous tenecteplase compared with alteplase for AIS in the recent AcTand ATTEST-2trials and there was no statistical heterogeneity of tenecteplase treatment effect by age group. Consistent with these findings, our study found that tenecteplase was not statistically different with alteplase in ITT and PP patients. Moreover, elderly patients in the tenecteplase group achieved similar safety outcomes to the alteplase group. Additionally, the 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase thrombolysis was significantly economical as the median costs for thrombolysis were around 30% lower than 0.90 mg/kg alteplase in our study. The total costs in the tenecteplase group were also numerical lower. The findings further indicated that the tenecteplase thrombolysis may be beneficial in patients aged ≥ 80 years.

### Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis [^113A18LV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Whether bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase is beneficial compared with thrombectomy alone in patients who had a stroke with large-vessel occlusion remains unclear.

Methods

This is a causal inference study of observational data from the trials SWIFT DIRECT and EXTEND-IA TNK Parts 1 and 2 applying target trial emulation. We compared patients receiving thrombectomy alone to patients receiving tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg before thrombectomy. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0–2) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included improvement over the full ordinal mRS scale, freedom of disability (mRS 0–1), mortality and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. The average causal treatment effect was estimated via inverse probability of treatment weighting and G-Computation. We calculated standardised risk differences (SRDs) and adjusted (common) ORs (a(c)ORs).

Results

Of 377 patients included in the target trial, 187 received thrombectomy alone and 190 tenecteplase before thrombectomy. Tenecteplase before thrombectomy did not increase the probability of patients achieving functional independence (SRD 0.04 (95% CI –0.06 to 0.13)) but resulted in a significant improvement in the mRS overall (acOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.23)) and in a higher probability of freedom from disability (SRD 0.10 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.20)). The probability for improvement of functional outcomes was further increased in patients treated within 140 min after onset (ordinal mRS acOR 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.56)). No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed between the two groups.

Conclusion

Tenecteplase before thrombectomy compared with thrombectomy alone did not increase the probability of functional independence but resulted in significant improvement over the full mRS scale. This improvement was most evident in patients treated early.

### Intravenous tenecteplase compared with alteplase for minor ischaemic stroke: a secondary analysis of the AcT randomised clinical trial [^113yce6K]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, randomisation was not stratified by baseline NIHSS; therefore, the effect of unmeasured confounders on the analysis cannot be discounted. Second, there were baseline differences in the number of patients with vessel occlusion and utilisation of endovascular thrombectomy between the groups, both higher in the tenecteplase group. Third, due to the pragmatic nature of the trial, no screening logs were maintained, and it was left to the discretion of enrolling physicians regarding which minor strokes to enrol. Since patients were enrolled based on current Canadian guidelines for thrombolysis, most patients with minor strokes likely had disabling deficits, although this was not possible to confirm. Finally, this is a post-hoc secondary analysis that is inadequately powered to detect group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes. The results should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating.

Conclusions

In patients who had an acute stroke enrolled in the AcT Study presenting with minor deficits, safety and efficacy outcomes with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg were not significantly different from alteplase 0.9 mg/kg. In these patients, tenecteplase may be a reasonable alternative to alteplase for those meeting standard indications for thrombolysis; however, further adequately powered studies in the population who had a minor stroke are needed to confirm these results.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Other IV fibrinolytics — tenecteplase 0.25-mg/kg in mechanical thrombectomy candidates — It may be reasonable to choose tenecteplase (single IV bolus of 0.25-mg/kg, maximum 25 mg) over IV alteplase in patients without contraindications for IV fibrinolysis who are also eligible to undergo mechanical thrombectomy. IV tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg bolus, maximum 25 mg) versus IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg over 60 minutes, maximum 90 mg) in EXTEND-IA TNK randomized 202 patients presenting within 4.5 hours; the primary end point was achieved by 22% with tenecteplase versus 10% with alteplase (P = 0.002 for noninferiority and 0.03 for superiority), the mRS shift cOR was 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0–2.8]; P = 0.04, median NIHSS was 17, and sICH rates were 1% in both groups.

### Tenecteplase utility in acute ischemic stroke patients: a clinical review of current evidence [^1139jzfv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Treatment is aimed at reducing impact of cerebral clot burden and life-long disability. Traditional fibrinolytic treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has shown to be effective but at high risk of major bleeding. Multiple studies have evaluated tenecteplase as an alternative to tPA.

Objective

This review evaluates literature and utility of tenecteplase for treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Discussion

Tenecteplase is modified, third generation fibrinolytic with greater specificity for fibrin bound clots. Current data in acute myocardial infarction suggest decreased bleeding events compared to alteplase. Multiple trials have investigated superiority of tenecteplase compared to tPA for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Current guidelines designate tenecteplase as an alternative treatment for mild acute ischemic stroke patients based on recent literature.

Conclusion

Recent emerging literature and limited recommendation guidance from governing medical societies leave many emergency medicine providers to weigh benefit versus risk of fibrinolytic therapy and tenecteplase's place in therapy. This review evaluates the available literature regarding tenecteplase and its utility in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients.

### Tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy enhances 1-h recanalization and reduces disability in large-vessel occlusion [^112np61k]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tenecteplase exhibits enhanced recanalization efficacy in patients with large-vessel occlusion when the duration between intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular puncture is limited to 1 h. Furthermore, it shortens the time from hospital arrival to starting thrombolysis and thrombectomy. These findings further support the preferential use of tenecteplase to rapidly bridge mechanical thrombectomy in patients with large-vessel occlusion.

Conclusions

Our study elucidated that TNK was non-inferior to alteplase when treating AIS patients within 4.5 hours of onset and resulted in excellent functional outcomes at 90 days. Its safety profiles were also compatible to alteplase. Like alteplase, TNK can be used to treat all AIS patients presented within 4.5 hours. Therefore, the current meta-analysis strongly recommends TNK as an alternative to alteplase.

### Tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy enhances 1-h recanalization and reduces disability in large-vessel occlusion [^116avj5i]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, several large-sample randomized controlled trials have compared the efficacy of tenecteplase and alteplase in AIS, demonstrating that tenecteplase is non-inferior to alteplase. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that tenecteplase and alteplase have comparable recanalization rates prior to MT in patients with LVO. The advantages of tenecteplase can manifest in specific patient subgroups. Gerschenfeld et al. showed that tenecteplase is associated with better 3-month mRS scores and lower 3-month mortality in patients with large ischemic core compared with alteplase. Checkouri et al. found that tenecteplase has a higher ER rate compared with alteplase in patients with larger thrombi. Our study indicates that tenecteplase is more effective than alteplase in patients with LVO regarding the rapid initiation of endovascular therapy, as it is associated with a significantly higher recanalization rate and improved functional outcomes. Tenecteplase may be preferentially used for patients directly admitted to comprehensive stroke centers. Further research comparing tenecteplase with alteplase in rapid bridging mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT06658197). Patients receiving tenecteplase at primary stroke centers or mobile stroke units without MT capabilities should be directly transferred to angiography suites after hospital arrival, bypassing conventional imaging to reduce onset-to-reperfusion time and achieve a favorable outcome.

Our study has several limitations. First, it was constrained by a limited sample size and utilized retrospectively collected data, which could potentially lead to the inclusion of unmeasured confounders that might affect the outcomes. Second, we failed to measure thrombus characteristics, such as thrombus length and permeability. Furthermore, the relatively high rate of loss to follow-up (near 10% at the 3-month mRS) may have weakened the value of our mRS results.

### Cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke [^116aC5fd]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Tenecteplase improved functional outcomes and reduced the requirement for endovascular thrombectomy in ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion in the EXTEND-IA TNK randomized trial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase in this trial.

Methods

Post hoc within-trial economic analysis included costs of index emergency department and inpatient stroke hospitalization, rehabilitation/subacute care, and rehospitalization due to stroke within 90 days. Sources for cost included key study site complemented by published literature and government websites. Quality-adjusted life-years were estimated using utility scores derived from the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Long-term modeled cost-effectiveness analysis used a Markov model with 7 health states corresponding to 7 modified Rankin Scale scores. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

Within the 202 patients in the randomized controlled trial, total cost was nonsignificantly lower in the tenecteplase-treated patients (40997 Australian dollars [AUD]) compared with alteplase-treated patients (46188 AUD) for the first 90 days(P = 0.125). Tenecteplase was the dominant treatment strategy in the short term, with similar cost (5412 AUD [95% CI, -13348 to 2523]; P = 0.181) and higher benefits (0.099 quality-adjusted life-years [95% CI, 0.001–0.1967]; P = 0.048), with a 97.4% probability of being cost-effective. In the long-term, tenecteplase was associated with less additional lifetime cost (96357 versus 106304 AUD) and greater benefits (quality-adjusted life-years, 7.77 versus 6.48), and had a 100% probability of being cost-effective. Both deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Both within-trial and long-term economic analyses showed that tenecteplase was highly likely to be cost-effective for patients with acute stroke before thrombectomy. Recommending the use of tenecteplase over alteplase could lead to a cost saving to the healthcare system both in the short and long term. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in patients with minor or rapidly improving neurological deficits [^117PY9cF]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A substantial proportion of patients with ischemic stroke present with mild neurological deficits ('Stroke with mild symptoms', SMS). Treating these patients with thrombolysis or with thrombectomy is controversial and clinical practice is different. We will highlight the importance of these treatment decisions by reviewing the recent advances in this area.

Recent Findings

Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in patients with SMS showed a significant reduction in functional disability after 3 months. Treatment with tenecteplase seems to be a pharmacologically superior and possibly safer thrombolytic agent making it ideal for use in this patient group. Imaging criteria to select the profiting patients are evolving. Thrombectomy in patients with a large vessel occlusion and minor deficits are showing promising results in cohort studies so far, however, randomized controlled trials are lacking.

Summary

Patients with acute ischemic stroke and minor or rapidly improving symptoms should be carefully treated the same way as more severe strokes are treated as neurological deterioration is not infrequent. Nevertheless, treatment decisions should be individualized dependent on clinical and radiological features.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses of efficacy outcomes will be performed in the modified intention‐to‐treat data set and will be adjusted for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, occlusion site, and time from last known well to randomization. The primary analysis of BRIDGE‐TNK will compare the rate of functional independence between the 2 groups. For the primary outcome and other binary outcomes, differences between the 2 arms will be analyzed with the use of modified Poisson regression with robust error estimation. Analysis of the European Quality Five‐Dimension Five‐Level scale score and mRS shift (the full range of the mRS is considered) will be performed using linear regression and ordinal logistic regression, respectively. Analyses of safety outcomes will be conducted on the basis of the safety data set. Safety outcomes in both groups will be reported as frequency counts and percentages. Secondary analyses will be analyzed for the same primary outcome in the following subgroups: by age (using median age threshold), sex, time to randomization, stroke pathogenesis (cardioembolic versus large‐artery atherosclerosis versus unknown), site of arterial occlusion, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, and patients receiving angioplasty or stenting. Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios, mean differences, and common odds ratios will be presented with their corresponding 95% CIs. The significance level for all analyses is a 2‐sided α = 0.05. Statistical analysis will be conducted on the SAS 9.4 system with Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^113drZYw]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase, a newer thrombolytic agent with high fibrinogen specificity and long half-life, allowing it to be given as a single bolus, had promising results in recent clinical trials. The Tenecteplase versus Alteplase before Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke (EXTENT-IA-TNK) trial demonstrated that tenecteplase administration resulted in a higher reperfusion rate and a better functional outcome than alteplase in patients with AIS eligible for EVT. Tenecteplase appears to be as efficacious, with a similar side-effect profile as alteplase when used in patients without LVO. However, at this time, tenecteplase is not FDA-approved for IV thrombolysis in AIS patients and does not have the same level of recommendation by the AHA/ASA as alteplase. This could explain why many institutions have not adopted tenecteplase as a thrombolytic for AIS.

### Endovascular thrombectomy with or without intravenous alteplase for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113TjaY2]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 2.7 million people die of ischaemic stroke each year, and many who recover are left with permanent disabilities. Approximately 21% of acute ischaemic stroke are due to large vessel occlusionfor which the standard of care has historically been intravenous alteplase, a thrombolytic medication. More recently, direct mechanical reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has proven effective. Both treatments are extremely time-sensitive, and delays of 15 min in treatment initiation are associated with worse outcomes.

Among patients who had an ischaemic stroke are eligible for and can be treated with both interventions immediately, there has been uncertainty regarding the role of intravenous alteplase. Thrombolytic agents, such as alteplase, may contribute to early reperfusion of the ischaemic area and resolve residual distal thrombi after EVT. For large, proximally located thrombi, however, the rate of early recanalisation is low in the first hour following alteplase administration, and fragmentation with distal embolisation of the target thrombus can result in worsening distal perfusion, potentially complicating EVT.

In the last 18 months, six randomized trials have been completed that provide evidence to address this uncertainty. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the benefits and harms of EVT with or without intravenous alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Our findings supported the development of a clinical practice guideline (Personal communication: Ye Z, Busse J, Hill M. Endovascular thrombectomy and intravenous alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a rapid clinical practice guideline. 2022).

### Cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke [^114h2ogc]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Alteplase is widely used as an intravenous thrombolytic drug in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Recently however, tenecteplase, a modified form of tissue plasminogen activator, has been shown to increase early recanalization rate and has proven to be non-inferior with a similar safety profile compared to alteplase. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase versus 0.9 mg/kg alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis in AIS patients from the Dutch healthcare payer perspective.

Methods:

A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to assess total costs, total quality-adjusted life year (QALY), an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of two treatments at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of €50,000/QALY and €80,000/QALY over a 10-year time horizon. One-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis were conducted to test the robustness of results. Clinical data were obtained from large randomized controlled trials and real-world data.

Results:

Treatment with tenecteplase saved €21 per patient while gaining 0.05 QALYs, resulting in INMB of €2381, clearly rendering tenecteplase cost-effective compared to alteplase. Importantly, tenecteplase remained the cost-effective alternative in all scenarios, including AIS patients due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis proved tenecteplase to be cost-effective with a 71.0% probability at a WTP threshold of €50,000/QALY.

Conclusions:

Tenecteplase treatment was cost-effective for all AIS patients (including AIS patients with LVO) compared to alteplase. The finding supports the broader use of tenecteplase in acute stroke care, as health outcomes improve at acceptable costs while having practical advantages, and a similar safety profile.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke [^1139gpU4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intravenous infusion of alteplase is used for thrombolysis before endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase, which is more fibrin-specific and has longer activity than alteplase, is given as a bolus and may increase the incidence of vascular reperfusion.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy to receive tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight; maximum dose, 25 mg) or alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg per kilogram; maximum dose, 90 mg) within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment. Noninferiority of tenecteplase was tested, followed by superiority. Secondary outcomes included the modified Rankin scale score (on a scale from 0 [no neurologic deficit] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. Safety outcomes were death and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.

Results

Of 202 patients enrolled, 101 were assigned to receive tenecteplase and 101 to receive alteplase. The primary outcome occurred in 22% of the patients treated with tenecteplase versus 10% of those treated with alteplase (incidence difference, 12 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2 to 21; incidence ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.4; P = 0.002 for noninferiority; P = 0.03 for superiority). Tenecteplase resulted in a better 90-day functional outcome than alteplase (median modified Rankin scale score, 2 vs. 3; common odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8; P = 0.04). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1% of the patients in each group.

Conclusions

Tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and better functional outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.
