## Question

Pfo and stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with cryptogenic stroke, including when to recommend closure versus medical therapy and how to select patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and pathophysiology to frame pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup required to label a stroke as cryptogenic and to characterize the PFO. Next, I will review the randomized trial evidence and meta-analyses to quantify benefits and risks of closure. After that, I should apply validated selection tools (RoPE and PASCAL) to individualize decisions. Finally, I will align recommendations with contemporary guidelines and outline special populations and uncertainties, ensuring shared decision-making is emphasized throughout [^11517vQU] [^1131t8rm] [^113uAh5r].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. PFO is present in roughly 25% of adults and is overrepresented in cryptogenic stroke, especially in younger patients, suggesting a paradoxical embolism mechanism in a subset; however, many PFOs are incidental, so I need to ensure we do not over-attribute causality without careful selection and workup [^11517vQU] [^1179K7t3] [^1172zJiR].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic prerequisites before discussing closure. I should confirm that the index event is a nonlacunar, embolic-appearing cortical or multi-territory infarct on MRI, and that a comprehensive etiologic workup has excluded alternative causes such as atrial fibrillation, large-artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel disease, and hypercoagulable states; this includes prolonged rhythm monitoring, vascular imaging, and echocardiography with attention to other cardioembolic sources, because closure is inappropriate if a higher-risk alternative mechanism is identified [^113uAh5r] [^112XU1zR] [^1131t8rm].

> I will now examine how to characterize the PFO itself. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with bubble contrast and Valsalva remains the reference standard to detect and grade shunt size and to identify high-risk anatomy such as atrial septal aneurysm (ASA); transcranial Doppler can complement detection of right-to-left shunt, but I should confirm that shunt size is graded consistently across modalities to avoid misclassification that could bias benefit estimates [^111G9uM3] [^1172zJiR].

> Next, I should review the randomized evidence quantifying benefit and risk. Contemporary trials (CLOSE, REDUCE, extended RESPECT, DEFENSE-PFO) and pooled analyses consistently show that PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke compared with antiplatelet therapy, with an approximate relative risk reduction around 60% and an absolute risk reduction near 3–4% at 2–5 years; importantly, benefit is concentrated in patients with large shunts and/or ASA, whereas small shunts show little to no benefit, and closure increases new-onset atrial fibrillation, mostly transient but occasionally persistent [^115toSQg] [^112m9yGE] [^111AtQLg] [^114wjDvU] [^116pK8oB].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize patient selection at the bedside. The RoPE score uses age and vascular risk factors to estimate the probability that a PFO is pathogenic rather than incidental; higher RoPE correlates with greater benefit from closure, and the PASCAL classification integrates RoPE with high-risk anatomic features (large shunt and/or ASA) to categorize patients as probable, possible, or unlikely to have PFO-attributable stroke; patients classified as probable derive the largest absolute risk reduction, whereas those classified as unlikely do not benefit and may have more device-related adverse events [^111irv4V] [^114wjDvU] [^112RGxDt].

> Let me consider guideline-concordant recommendations and where they converge. The AAN advises that patients younger than 60 years with embolic-appearing infarct, no alternative mechanism, and a PFO may be offered closure after discussing benefits (about 3.4% absolute reduction at 5 years) and risks (procedural complications ~3.9% and nonperiprocedural AF ~0.33%/year); SCAI recommends closure over antiplatelet therapy alone in adults 18–60 with prior PFO-associated stroke; ESO recommends closure in selected 18–60-year-olds with PFO-associated stroke, emphasizing large shunt and/or ASA and multidisciplinary evaluation; BMJ Rapid Recommendations favor closure over antiplatelet alone, with a weak preference over anticoagulation given uncertainty and bleeding tradeoffs [^113uAh5r] [^116YL78x] [^1151mkcW] [^1131t8rm] [^113qWkxV].

> But wait, what if the patient is older than 60 or has vascular risk factors? I should double-check the evidence gap. RCTs largely enrolled patients ≤ 60 years, and although observational data suggest higher recurrence risk in older adults with PFO, there is no RCT-proven benefit of closure beyond 60; a dedicated RCT in patients 60–80 years is underway, and until then, decisions should be individualized with caution and transparency about uncertainty [^116QAcuf] [^111wqzzZ] [^1131t8rm].

> I need to ensure we address special populations and edge cases. In pregnancy or postpartum, management is individualized: closure is generally deferred until after delivery, with anticoagulation considered if a PFO-related stroke occurs during pregnancy; in patients with thrombophilia, some guidelines suggest closure plus lifelong anticoagulation, but the evidence is observational and very low certainty, so shared decision-making is essential; for patients with TIA and normal imaging, closure is not routinely recommended because the ischemic etiology cannot be confirmed with confidence [^1161waTn] [^111SPTGm] [^1176zedq].

> Let me reconsider the balance of benefits and harms to frame counseling. For a typical patient under 60 with embolic-appearing infarct, large shunt and/or ASA, and high RoPE, closure yields a meaningful absolute reduction in recurrent stroke with acceptable procedural and AF risks; conversely, for patients with small shunts, lacunar infarcts, or low RoPE, the absolute benefit is small or uncertain and the AF risk may tilt the balance toward medical therapy, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and multidisciplinary review [^114wjDvU] [^113uAh5r] [^113eEv4X].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details. If closure is chosen, I should confirm anatomy with TEE, select an appropriate device, and plan peri-procedural antithrombotic therapy per local protocol; if medical therapy is chosen, antiplatelet therapy is reasonable, and anticoagulation may be considered in selected patients, acknowledging low-certainty evidence and bleeding tradeoffs; importantly, a Heart-Stroke Team approach reduces unnecessary closures by ensuring rigorous etiologic workup and alignment with trial criteria [^111G9uM3] [^112HKonU] [^114LnzGp].

> In summary, I should confirm that PFO closure is best viewed as a targeted secondary prevention strategy for carefully selected patients with PFO-attributable cryptogenic stroke: younger age, embolic-appearing infarct, no alternative mechanism, and high-risk PFO anatomy predict the greatest benefit, whereas older age, small shunt, lacunar infarct, or competing mechanisms favor medical therapy; throughout, shared decision-making and multidisciplinary evaluation are critical to avoid both under- and over-treatment [^11517vQU] [^1131t8rm] [^113uAh5r].

---

PFO is present in ~25% of adults and is a recognized risk factor for cryptogenic stroke, especially in younger patients without traditional vascular risk factors [^1179K7t3] [^11517vQU]. The main mechanism is **paradoxical embolism** of venous thrombi through the PFO, with risk increased by large shunts, atrial septal aneurysm, and hypercoagulable states [^117Azza2] [^111DF5he]. PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke by ~50% in selected patients, with the greatest benefit in those aged 18–60 with embolic-appearing strokes and no other cause identified [^114wjDvU] [^115toSQg]. Closure is not indicated for primary prevention or in patients with non-embolic strokes or high bleeding risk. Antiplatelet therapy is standard; anticoagulation is reserved for specific indications, and closure decisions should be individualized using RoPE/PASCAL and multidisciplinary review [^1131t8rm] [^113uAh5r].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

PFO is present in ~25% of adults and declines with age; it is more common in cryptogenic stroke, especially in younger patients [^1179K7t3] [^11517vQU]. In patients ≤ 60 years with cryptogenic stroke, PFO prevalence is ~10–15%, suggesting a causal role in a subset [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of PFO-related stroke

The primary mechanism is **paradoxical embolism**, in which venous thrombi cross the PFO to the arterial circulation, causing cerebral embolism [^117Azza2]. Risk is higher with large right-to-left shunts, atrial septal aneurysm, and hypercoagulable states [^1173iNT2].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: Transthoracic (TTE) with bubble contrast is first-line; transesophageal (TEE) is more sensitive and defines anatomy for closure planning [^111G9uM3].
- **Transcranial Doppler (TCD)**: Highly sensitive for right-to-left shunt detection and grading [^notfound].
- **RoPE and PASCAL**: Clinical-anatomic tools to estimate the likelihood that a PFO is causally related to stroke, aiding selection for closure [^111irv4V] [^114wjDvU].

---

## Clinical evidence for PFO closure

Randomized trials (CLOSE, REDUCE, RESPECT long-term, DEFENSE-PFO) show that **PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke** versus medical therapy in selected patients [^115toSQg] [^112m9yGE] [^111AtQLg]. Meta-analyses report a ~50% relative risk reduction, with the greatest benefit in patients aged 18–60 with embolic-appearing strokes and no other identified cause [^114wjDvU] [^116pK8oB].

---

## Patient selection criteria for PFO closure

- **Age**: 18–60 years; older patients have less proven benefit and higher procedural risk [^1131t8rm] [^116QAcuf].
- **Stroke phenotype**: Embolic-appearing cortical or multi-territory infarcts on imaging [^113uAh5r].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: No atrial fibrillation, large-artery atherosclerosis, or small-vessel disease after appropriate workup [^113uAh5r].
- **High-risk PFO features**: Large shunt and/or atrial septal aneurysm increase benefit [^111DF5he] [^114wjDvU].

---

## Risks and complications of PFO closure

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Increased risk, often transient; persistent AF occurs in ~1.8% at 1 year [^113iqeYV] [^116pK8oB].
- **Procedural complications**: Device embolization, vascular injury, and pericardial effusion occur in ~3.6% [^113iqeYV].
- **Long-term risks**: Uncertain; ongoing monitoring for device integrity and arrhythmias is recommended [^112cTbuG].

---

## Medical management alternatives

Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) is **standard** for patients not undergoing closure [^113uAh5r]. Anticoagulation (warfarin or DOACs) may be considered when antiplatelet therapy is contraindicated or in hypercoagulable states, though evidence is limited [^112HKonU] [^113uAh5r].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **AAN 2020**: Recommends closure for patients < 60 with embolic-appearing stroke and no other cause, after shared decision-making [^113uAh5r].
- **ESO 2024**: Strong recommendation for closure in selected patients aged 18–60 with PFO-associated stroke, especially with large shunt and/or atrial septal aneurysm [^1131t8rm].
- **SCAI 2022**: Recommends closure over antiplatelet therapy alone in adults 18–60 with prior PFO-associated stroke [^1151mkcW].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In pregnancy, **defer closure** and use anticoagulation if stroke occurs; closure is considered postpartum [^1161waTn]. In older adults (> 60), evidence is limited; closure may be considered selectively in high-risk anatomy after careful evaluation [^116z6xqc]. For primary prevention, closure is not indicated in asymptomatic patients or those without prior stroke [^1176zedq].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research priorities include **older adults**, long-term AF outcomes, and optimal antithrombotic regimens post-closure [^111wqzzZ] [^112cTbuG]. Efforts also focus on refining selection with advanced imaging and biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from closure [^111pwwxm] [^1172zJiR].

---

PFO closure **reduces recurrent ischemic stroke** in carefully selected patients with cryptogenic stroke, particularly those aged 18–60 with embolic-appearing infarcts and high-risk PFO anatomy. Decisions should be individualized using RoPE/PASCAL and multidisciplinary review, balancing benefits against procedural risks and patient preferences [^114wjDvU] [^113uAh5r].

### Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure versus medical therapy for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with prior cryptogenic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114US6LE]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effect of closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) compared with medical therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with prior cryptogenic stroke.

Background

The role of PFO closure in reducing risk of stroke in patients with prior cryptogenic stroke has been controversial.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL for randomized trials investigating PFO closure versus medical therapy. We assessed trial bias and the quality of evidence for main outcomes was rated using GRADE. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of stroke. Estimates of effect were pooled with a random-effects model. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017081579).

Results

We included five trials, comprising data for 3,440 adults randomized to receive PFO closure (n = 1,829) or medical therapy (n = 1,611). Mean follow-up ranged from 2 years to 5.4 years across the trials. Patients treated with PFO closure had a lower risk of stroke (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18–0.88, I² = 57%, P = 0.02) compared with those treated with medical therapy. Subgroup analyses showed that the beneficial effect of PFO closure on a composite outcome of cerebrovascular events is more pronounced in patients with a large PFO shunt (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12–0.54, I² = 0%, P = 0.0004), male patients (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15–0.75, I² = 36%, P = 0.07), and those aged ≤ 45 years (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15–0.79, I² = 0%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

PFO closure reduced risk of stroke compared with medical therapy. PFO closure is a therapeutic option that should be offered to adults with cryptogenic stroke.

### Closure versus medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale and a history of cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111CB5mX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in people with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) has not been defined. The choice between medical therapy (antithrombotic treatment with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants) and transcatheter device closure has been the subject of intense debate over the past several years. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, a substantial number of people undergo transcatheter device closure (TDC) for secondary stroke prevention.

Objectives

To: 1) compare the safety and efficacy of TDC with best medical therapy alone for preventing recurrent stroke (fatal or non-fatal) or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in people with PFO and a history of cryptogenic stroke or TIA; 2) identify specific subgroups of people most likely to benefit from closure for secondary prevention; and 3) assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy, if possible.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (July 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2014). In an effort to identify unpublished and ongoing trials we searched seven trials registers and checked reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding, publication status, and language, comparing the safety and efficacy of device closure with medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke or TIA in people with PFO and a history of cryptogenic stroke or TIA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. The primary outcome measures of this analysis were the composite endpoint of ischemic stroke or TIA events as well as recurrent fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, bleeding) and procedural success and effective closure. We used the Mantel-Haenszel method to obtain pooled risk ratios (RRs) using the random-effects model regardless of the level of heterogeneity. We pooled data for the primary outcome measure with the generic inverse variance method using the random-effects model, yielding risk estimates as pooled hazard ratio (HR), which accounts for time-to-event outcomes.

Main Results

We included three RCTs involving a total of 2303 participants: 1150 participants were randomized to receive TDC and 1153 participants were randomized to receive medical therapy. Overall, the risk of bias was regarded as high. The mean follow-up period of all three included trials was less than five years. Baseline characteristics (age, sex, and vascular risk factors) were similar across trials. Intention-to-treat analyses did not show a statistically significant risk reduction in the composite endpoint of recurrent stroke or TIA in the TDC group when compared with medical therapy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.17). A time-to-event analysis combining the results of two RCTs also failed to show a significant risk reduction with TDC (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.13). When assessing stroke prevention alone, TDC still did not show a statistically significant benefit (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.27) (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.18). In a sensitivity analysis including the two studies using the Amplatzer PFO occluder, TDC showed a possible protective effect on recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02); however, it did not reach statistical significance. Safety analysis found that the overall risks for all-cause mortality and adverse events were similar in both the TDC and medical therapy groups. However, TDC increased the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.47 to 8.35) and may be associated with the type of device used.

Authors' Conclusions

The combined data from recent RCTs have shown no statistically significant differences between TDC and medical therapy in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke. TDC closure was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation but not with serious adverse events.

### Patent foramen ovale: anatomy, outcomes, and closure [^117Azza2]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a normal fetal communication between the right and left atria that persists after birth. PFO is a common finding that occurs in 20–34% of the population, although its prevalence decreases with age. In most cases, a PFO poses no threat to health. However, some PFOs have the ability to open widely under certain hemodynamic conditions, which enables any bloodborne material, such as thrombi, air, or vasoactive substances, to pass from the venous to the arterial circulation, with the potential to cause a cerebrovascular event. PFO has been linked to several conditions, including cryptogenic stroke, migraine with aura, decompression illness, and systemic arterial embolism. However, the data that support PFO closure in these conditions are mostly from nonrandomized cohort series, and are often contradictory. In this Review, we discuss the existing data on PFO closure, including results of the first randomized, controlled trial comparing device closure of PFO with medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke, and we examine controversies in the literature as well as ongoing studies. We also focus on the anatomy of a PFO and how it impacts on the procedure of PFO closure with a percutaneous device.

### Advances in the management of cardioembolic stroke associated with patent foramen ovale [^1172zJiR]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) describes a valve in the interatrial septum that permits shunting of blood or thrombotic material between the atria. PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patent foramen ovale (PFO) after stroke [^1131t8rm]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is frequently identified in young patients with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke. Potential stroke mechanisms include paradoxical embolism from a venous clot which traverses the PFO, in situ clot formation within the PFO, and atrial arrhythmias due to electrical signalling disruption. The purpose of this guideline is to provide recommendations for diagnosing, treating, and long-term managing patients with ischaemic stroke and PFO. Conversely, Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) was not considered an index event in this context because only one RCT involved TIA patients. However, this subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between TIA and stroke outcomes. The working group identified questions and outcomes, graded evidence, and developed recommendations following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure for guideline development. This document underwent peer-review by independent experts and members of the ESO Guideline Board and Executive Committee. The working group acknowledges the current evidentiary gap in delineating an unequivocal diagnostic algorithm for the detection of PFO. Although transoesophageal echocardiography is conventionally held as the most accurate diagnostic tool for PFO identification, its status as the 'gold standard' remains unsubstantiated by rigorously validated evidence. We found high-quality evidence to recommend PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy in selected patients aged 18–60years in whom no other evident cause of stroke is found but a PFO (i.e. PFO-associated stroke). The PASCAL classification system can be used to select such candidates for PFO closure. Patients with both a large right-to-left shunt and an atrial septal aneurysm benefit most from PFO closure. There is insufficient evidence to make an evidence-based recommendation on PFO closure in patients older than 60 and younger than 18years. We found low quality evidence to suggest against PFO closure in patients with unlikely PFO-related stroke according to the PASCAL classification, except in specific scenarios (Expert Consensus). We suggest against long-term anticoagulation in patients with PFO-associated stroke unless anticoagulation is indicated for other medical reasons. Regarding the long-term AF monitoring after PFO closure, the working group concluded that there remains significant uncertainty regarding the risks and benefits associated with the use of long-term cardiac monitoring, such as implantable loop recorders. This document provides additional guidance, in the form of evidence-based recommendations or expert consensus statements, on diagnostic methods for PFO detection, and medical management after PFO closure.

### Patent foramen ovale management for secondary stroke prevention: state-of-the-art appraisal of current evidence [^113p6W6m]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is frequently identified in young patients with ischemic stroke. Randomized controlled trials provide robust evidence supporting PFO closure in selected patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke; however, several questions remain unanswered. This report summarizes current knowledge on the epidemiology of PFO-associated stroke, the role of PFO as a cause of stroke, and anatomic high-risk features. We also comment on breakthrough developments in patient selection algorithms for PFO closure in relation to the PFO-associated stroke causal likelihood risk stratification system. We further highlight areas for future research in PFO-associated stroke including the efficacy and safety of PFO closure in the elderly population, incidence, and long-term consequences of atrial fibrillation post-PFO closure, generalizability of the results of clinical trials in the real world, and the need for assessing the effect of neurocardiology teams on adherence to international recommendations. Other important knowledge gaps such as sex, race/ethnicity, and regional disparities in access to diagnostic technologies, PFO closure devices, and clinical outcomes in the real world are also discussed as priority research topics.

### Is patent foramen ovale a modifiable risk factor for stroke recurrence? [^114VCmhC]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Although the prevalence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the general population is ≈25%, it is approximately doubled among cryptogenic stroke (CS) patients. This has generally been attributed to paradoxical embolism, and many physicians recommend PFO closure to prevent recurrence. However, the benefit of PFO closure in patients with stroke has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, the epidemiology of stroke recurrence in patients with CS with PFO versus without PFO and in those with large right-to-left shunts versus small right-to-left shunts has yielded results that appear difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that paradoxical embolism is an important cause of stroke recurrence. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the epidemiologic evidence that PFO is a potentially modifiable risk factor for stroke recurrence in patients with CS. The evidence suggests that many patients with CS and PFO have strokes that are PFO attributable, but many have strokes that are unrelated to their PFO. We introduce the concept of "PFO propensity", defined as the patient-specific probability of finding a PFO in a patient with CS on the basis of age and other risk factors. We show that this value is directly related to the probability that CS is PFO attributable. Because there is substantial heterogeneity in both PFO propensity and recurrence risk among patients with PFO and CS, stratification for PFO closure by these joint probabilities will likely prove crucial for appropriate patient selection.

### Patent foramen ovale [^1179K7t3]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is the most common congenital heart abnormality of fetal origin and is present in approximately ∼25% of the worldwide adult population. PFO is the consequence of failed closure of the foramen ovale, a normal structure that exists in the fetus to direct blood flow directly from the right to the left atrium, bypassing the pulmonary circulation. PFO has historically been associated with an increased risk of stroke, the mechanism of which has been attributed to the paradoxical embolism of venous thrombi that shunt through the PFO directly to the left atrium. However, several studies have failed to show an increased risk of stroke in asymptomatic patients with a PFO, and the risk of stroke recurrence is low in patients who have had a stroke that may be attributed to a PFO. With the advent of transoesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography, as well as transcranial Doppler, a PFO can be routinely detected in clinical practice. Medical treatment with either antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy is recommended. At the current time, closure of the PFO by percutaneous interventional techniques does not appear to reduce the risk of stroke compared to conventional medical treatment, as shown by three large clinical trials. Considerable controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment strategy for patients with both cryptogenic stroke and PFO. This Primer discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, management and effects on quality of life of PFO.

### Proposal for updated nomenclature and classification of potential causative mechanism in patent foramen ovale-associated stroke [^114Ria8s]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Recent epidemiologic and therapeutic advances have transformed understanding of the role of and therapeutic approach to patent foramen ovale (PFO) in ischemic stroke. Patent foramen ovale is likely responsible for approximately 5% of all ischemic strokes and 10% of those occurring in young and middle-aged adults.

Observations

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that, to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with PFO and an otherwise-cryptogenic index ischemic stroke, PFO closure is superior to antiplatelet medical therapy alone; these trials have provided some evidence that, among medical therapy options, anticoagulants may be more effective than antiplatelet agents.

Conclusions and Relevance

These new data indicate a need to update classification schemes of causative mechanisms in stroke, developed in an era in which an association between PFO and stroke was viewed as uncertain. We propose a revised general nomenclature and classification framework for PFO-associated stroke and detailed revisions for the 3 major stroke subtyping algorithms in wide use.

### Rethinking trial strategies for stroke and patent foramen ovale [^11395fcD]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The cause of stroke remains unknown in roughly one third of patients, despite extensive investigation. The prevalence of patent foramena ovale (PFOs) in the general population is around 25%, but it is doubled in cryptogenic stroke patients. This suggests a causal relationship between PFO and cryptogenic stroke. This has generally been attributed to paradoxical embolism. Regardless of mechanism, nearly 30,000 young patients each year have a cryptogenic stroke and PFO. Optimal management is uncertain.

Recent Findings

Many physicians recommend PFO closure, an intuitively attractive mechanical solution for stroke prevention. Unfortunately, the benefit of PFO closure in patients with stroke has not been demonstrated. There are ongoing clinical trials comparing the safety and efficacy of PFO closure with that of medical therapy. Interpreting these trials will be complicated by two issues: first, it is unclear whether a patient's PFO is causally related to the event ('pathogenic') or not ('incidental'); and second, recurrent strokes may be due to paradoxical embolism or another stroke mechanism.

Summary

Substantial heterogeneity of patients within trials along these two dimensions of risk may make overall trial results difficult to interpret. With appropriate analyses, the trials may be more informative than the overall data may suggest.

### Patent foramen ovale and stroke: current evidence and treatment options [^117WEEow]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent data have changed the landscape of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for secondary stroke prevention. This review synthesizes the data and provides a framework for optimal management of stroke patients with PFO.

Recent Findings

The cumulative evidence indicates that PFO closure reduces the risk of recurrent stroke in carefully selected young cryptogenic stroke patients, with an annualized risk reduction of ∼0.6%. The benefit of PFO closure is particularly evident in patients with embolic appearing strokes, large right-to-left shunt, or an associated atrial septal aneurysm. There may be little or no benefit in patients with small deep infarcts, a small PFO, or an indication for long-term anticoagulation. Closure is accompanied by a small risk of major procedural complication and atrial fibrillation.

Summary

The annual risk of stroke from PFO is low relative to other stroke mechanisms, but the life-time cumulative risk in young patients who have experienced a prior stroke may be substantial, in which case the absolute benefit of closure is likely impactful. PFO is highly prevalent in the general population, present in about one in four adults, and should not be considered to be the cause of the stroke until a thorough workup has excluded alternative mechanisms.

### Patent foramen ovale and stroke [^112WzQWk]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a highly prevalent finding in cryptogenic ischaemic stroke, particularly in young adults. A common challenge in clinical practice is to distinguish between incidental and pathogenic PFO. Some clinical features and tools such as the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism score may help determining the probability of a stroke-related PFO. Nonetheless, the best therapeutic option to reduce stroke recurrence after a cryptogenic stroke with PFO has been a matter of debate for a long time. We review the mechanisms of stroke-related PFO, together with its clinical features and diagnostic criteria. In addition, we focus on the methodological details and results from new studies in the field of secondary prevention. In contrast to prior evidence, the data from three recent clinical trials and an updated meta-analysis favour PFO closure over medical treatment after cryptogenic stroke/TIA for the prevention of stroke recurrence. The PFO closure device procedure is not associated with higher mortality or cardiovascular events, except for a small increase in the occurrence of transient atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, the benefit of PFO closure was higher among those with atrial septal aneurysm and PFO with large right-to-left shunt. Future studies should address pending issues such as the option for anticoagulants or antiplatelet in patients not undergoing closure, the duration of antiplatelet treatment after PFO closure and the role of PFO closure in patients older than 60.

### Patent foramen ovale: the known and the to be known [^115rcvya]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a normal interatrial communication during fetal life that persists after birth in approximately 1 of every 4 adults. PFO is a potential route for embolic transit from the systemic venous circulation to the brain. Though there is compelling circumstantial evidence implicating PFO, the precise role of PFO in the pathogenesis of cryptogenic stroke is not yet established. Several randomized trials of transcatheter PFO closure versus medical management are ongoing. Results of these trials may improve our ability to select the best treatment for individual patients. Further well-designed studies are necessary to address several unresolved issues related to PFO stroke and PFO migraine pathophysiology, and to identify the patients who would most likely benefit from PFO closure. The purpose of this review is to summarize contemporary understanding, discuss current treatments, and explore some of the knowledge gaps pertaining to the clinical significance of PFO.

### Patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke: diagnosis and updates in secondary stroke prevention [^114a77DE]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The patent foramen ovale (PFO), given its high prevalence in the general population and especially in patients with cryptogenic stroke, has long generated investigation and debate on its propensity for stroke by paradoxical embolism and its management for stroke prevention. The pendulum has swung for percutaneous PFO closure for secondary stroke prevention in cryptogenic stroke. Based on a review of current evidence, the benefit from PFO closure relies on careful patient selection: those under the age of 60 years with few to no vascular risk factors and embolic-appearing stroke deemed cryptogenic after thorough evaluation. As these data look towards influencing guideline statements and device approvals in the future, patient selection remains the crucial ingredient for clinical decision making and future trials.

### Stroke prevention in pregnancy and postpartum in patients with patent foramen ovale [^111Dyc5C]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and patent foramen ovale (PFO) are both stroke risk factors in young people. There are currently no guidelines for mitigating PFO-related stroke risk during pregnancy. We summarize the pathophysiology of PFO-related stroke and offer our approaches to primary and secondary stroke prevention for pregnant patients with PFO. We present 5 clinical scenarios: incidentally identified PFO in a pregnant patient without a stroke history; considerations for PFO screening and primary stroke prevention in select patients at unusually high risk of stroke in pregnancy; planning for pregnancy after a PFO-related stroke; PFO-related stroke occurring in pregnancy; and pregnancy planning for a patient with PFO identified after a transient neurological episode of unclear cause. Through these scenarios, we highlight the unique treatment considerations and challenges of primary and secondary PFO-related stroke prevention during this high-risk period. Collaboration between neurology, cardiology, and maternal-fetal medicine is integral for the successful management of these patients.

### Effectiveness of transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale in clinical practice [^112zFj7q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and ischemic stroke is well documented. Transcatheter closure of PFO has emerged as a potential stroke prevention strategy for patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Initial randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on PFO closure (Closure or medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen oval [CLOSURE‐1], Percutaneous Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) Using the Amplatzer PFO Occluder with Medical Treatment in Patients with Cryptogenic Embolism [PC], Stroke Comparing PFO Closure to Established Current Standard of Care Treatment [RESPECT]) raised concerns about the efficacy of the procedure for stroke prevention. However, the negative results of these trials were at least partially attributed to suboptimal patient selection. Subsequently, a second round of RCTs was launched using more stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of these trials (Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Anticoagulants versus Antiplatelet Therapy to Prevent Stroke Recurrence [CLOSE], GORE® Septal Occluder Device for Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) Closure in Stroke Patients [REDUCE], and Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke Patients With High‐Risk Patent Foramen Ovale [DEFENSE‐PFO]) and long‐term analyses of RESPECT consistently favored PFO closure over medical therapy, establishing the role of PFO closure as an effective stroke prevention strategy for selected patients with cryptogenic stroke. The discrepancy between the results of earlier versus later RCTs emphasized the impact of patient selection on clinical outcomes following the procedure. However, there is a considerable variability in the selection criteria in clinical practice. Concerns have been raised about overutilization of PFO closure following approval and whether the benefits observed in carefully selected patients in RCTs would translate into similar benefits of PFO closure in real world practice. To address this question, we leveraged a large national database to explore whether PFO closure in clinical practice yielded similar benefits as compared with what has been reported in RCTs.

### Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy alone for management of cryptogenic stroke? A clinical practice guideline [^1164xppG]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current practice

Management options for those with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke

Typically, patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO have three treatment options to reduce the risk of future stroke:

(a) Closure of the PFO with subsequent antiplatelet therapy that may be continued indefinitely or discontinued some months after PFO closure
(b) Antiplatelet therapy alone
(c) Anticoagulant therapy alone.

Most current guidelines recommend against routine closure of the PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke and instead recommend antiplatelets or anticoagulation (the latter if indicated for another reason) (box 2).

Box 2
Current guidance for closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke

Identification of cryptogenic stroke

In about a third of patients in the general population who are diagnosed with an acute ischaemic stroke, investigation finds no clear cause; it is cryptogenic. Clinicians reach the diagnosis by ruling out alternative reasons for stroke through prolonged rhythm monitoring to exclude atrial fibrillation; transoesophageal echocardiography or alternative imaging of the aorta and left atrial appendage to rule out aortic atherothrombosis or left atrial clot; and carotid ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging to rule out cerebrovascular disease.

Patients diagnosed with cryptogenic stroke are less likely to have classic risk factors for atheroembolic stroke such as older age, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes. They are more likely to have a PFO than patients in the general population.

Implications of a patent foramen ovale (PFO)

The presence of a PFO does not result in an identifiable increased risk of stroke in the general population. Many meta-analyses have addressed whether closure of a PFO reduces the long term risk of subsequent stroke, but most have concluded that there is insufficient evidence.

PFO is a communication between the right and left atrium, typically diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography with observed flow between the left to right atrium by colour Doppler ultrasonography. If the shunt direction reverses, this communication may allow a venous thrombus or right atrial thrombus to travel directly into the arterial circulation and cause a stroke — a phenomenon known as a paradoxical embolism. This can be characterised with echocardiography (box 3).

### Patent foramen ovale and perioperative stroke in noncardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113MgHEV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with perioperative stroke in noncardiac surgery. The magnitude of this association was assessed in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to June 2022 for studies assessing the association between patent foramen ovale and perioperative stroke in adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The primary analysis was limited to studies reporting effect estimates adjusted for significant clinical confounders. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

We included nine retrospective and two prospective observational studies, including 21 257 082 patients. The presence of a patent foramen ovale was independently associated with stroke at 30 days after surgery (aOR = 6.68 [95% CI: 3.51–12.73]; P < 0.001) and at longest follow-up available (aOR = 7.36 [95% CI: 3.56–15.21]; P < 0.001). The odds of stroke at 30 days varied according to surgical specialty: neurosurgery (aOR = 4.52 [95% CI: 3.17–6.43]), vascular surgery (aOR = 7.15 [95% CI: 2.52–20.22]), thoracic surgery (aOR = 10.64 [95% CI: 5.97–18.98]), orthopaedic surgery (aOR = 11.85 [95% CI: 5.38–26.08]), general surgery (aOR = 14.40 [95% CI: 10.88–19.06]), and genitourinary surgery (aOR = 17.28 [95% CI: 10.36–28.84]).

Conclusions

The presence of a patent foramen ovale is associated with a large and consistent increase in odds of stroke across all explored surgical settings. Prospective trials should further explore this association by systematically assessing patent foramen ovale and stroke prevalence and identifying a specific population at risk. This is crucial for the elaboration of prevention plans and may improve perioperative outcomes.

### Stroke prevention by percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115t1XMK]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The role of percutaneous closure of patent foramen oval (PFO) in patients with cryptogenic stroke has been very controversial for years due to a lack of clear evidence.

Objective

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of percutaneous PFO closure for secondary prevention of cryptogenic strokes as compared to best medical therapy (BMT).

Data Sources

Trials were identified through a literature search until 28 May 2013.

Study Selection

Controlled clinical trials (randomised and non-randomised) comparing percutaneous PFO closure with BMT.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Main end point of interest was stroke. A random effects model was used to calculate the pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% CIs.

Results

A total of 14 studies (three randomised controlled trials (RCT) and 11 non-randomised observational studies (non-RCT)), and a total of 4335 patients were included for this analysis. There was no significant treatment effect of PFO closure regarding stroke among the RCT (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.19, p = 0.171). However, among non-RCT stroke was reduced (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.67, p < 0.001) after PFO closure. A time-to-event (stroke) analysis, combining all three RCT and the two non-RCT which applied strict multivariate adjustments, showed a borderline significant risk reduction after PFO closure (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99, p = 0.047). Neither risk of bleeding nor mortality differed significantly between the groups. However, there was a higher incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation in the closure group (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.47 to 8.35, p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Percutaneous closure of PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke does not appear superior to medical therapy according to currently available randomised data. Furthermore, it is associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation. However, there are signals pointing towards a potential benefit and more research should be strongly encouraged.

### Percutaneous closure versus medical treatment in stroke patients with patent foramen ovale: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11298BVJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

New evidence emerged recently regarding the percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke.

Purpose

To compare risks for recurrent cerebrovascular events in adults with PFO and cryptogenic stroke who underwent PFO closure versus those who received medical therapy alone.

Data Sources

PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar from 1 December 2004 through 14 September 2017; references of eligible studies; relevant scientific session abstracts; and cardiology Web sites.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials, published in English, that compared PFO closure using a currently available device with medical treatment alone and that reported, at minimum, the rates of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL).

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently extracted study data and assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

4 of 5 trials comparing PFO closure with medical therapy used commercially available devices. These 4 trials, involving 2531 patients, found that PFO closure reduced the risk for the main outcome of stroke or TIA (risk difference [RD], -0.029 [95% CI, -0.050 to -0.007]) and increased the risk for new-onset AF or AFL (RD, 0.033 [CI, 0.012 to 0.054]). The beneficial effect of PFO closure was associated with larger interatrial shunts (P = 0.034).

Limitation

Trials were not double-blind, and inclusion criteria were heterogeneous.

Conclusion

Compared with medical treatment, PFO closure prevents recurrent stroke and TIA but increases the incidence of AF or AFL in PFO carriers with cryptogenic stroke.

### Closure, anticoagulation, or antiplatelet therapy for cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen ovale: systematic review of randomized trials, sequential meta-analysis, and new insights from the CLOSE study [^114ZV5MP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure, anticoagulation, and antiplatelet therapy to prevent stroke recurrence in patients with PFO-associated cryptogenic stroke.

Methods and Results

We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE through March 2018. The primary outcome was stroke recurrence. Pooled incidences, hazard ratios, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses. PFO closure was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke compared with antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation: 3560 patients from 6 RCTs; RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17–0.79; I² = 59%). The effect of PFO closure on stroke recurrence was larger in patients with atrial septal aneurysm or large shunt (RR = 0.27, 95% CI, 0.11–0.70; I² = 42%) compared with patients without these anatomical features (RR = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.43–1.47; I² = 12%). Major complications occurred in 2.40% (95% CI, 1.03–4.25; I² = 77%) of procedures. New-onset atrial fibrillation was more frequent in patients randomized to PFO closure versus antithrombotic therapy (RR = 4.33, 95% CI, 2.37–7.89; I² = 14%). One RCT compared PFO closure versus anticoagulation (353 patients; hazard ratio = 0.14, 95% CI, 0.00–1.45) and 2 RCTs compared PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy (1137 patients; hazard ratio = 0.18, 95% CI, 0.05–0.63; I² = 12%). Three RCTs compared anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy, with none showing a significant difference.

Conclusions

PFO closure is superior to antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke recurrence after cryptogenic stroke. The annual absolute risk reduction of stroke was low, but it has to be tempered by a substantial time at risk (at least 5 years) in young and middle-aged patients. PFO closure was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

### Atrial septal aneurysm, shunt size, and recurrent stroke risk in patients with patent foramen ovale [^111DF5he]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated stroke, the presence of large shunt or atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) has been suggested to convey a high risk of stroke recurrence.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the respective influence of PFO size and ASA status on stroke recurrence under medical therapy in patients with recent PFO-associated stroke without alternative cause.

Methods

The authors pooled individual patient data from 2 prospective observational studies and the medical arms of 2 randomized trials, in which shunt size and ASA status was assessed by independent reading of echocardiographic images. Associations between PFO anatomical features and recurrent ischemic stroke were assessed by mixed effects Cox models.

Results

Of 898 patients (mean age 45.3 years), 178 (19.8%) had ASA with large PFO, 71 (7.9%) ASA with nonlarge PFO, 397 (44.2%) large PFO without ASA, and 252 (28.1%) nonlarge PFO without ASA. Over a median follow-up of 3.8 years (interquartile range: 2.6 to 5.5 years), 47 (5.2%) patients experienced a recurrent stroke. There was a heterogeneity across studies for the association between PFO size and stroke recurrence (p interaction = 0.01). In a model accounting for age, hypertension, antithrombotic therapy, and PFO anatomy, ASA was independently associated with recurrent stroke (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.82 to 5.86; p < 0.0001), whereas large PFO was not (average adjusted hazard ratio across studies: 1.43; 95% confidence interval: 0.50 to 4.03; p = 0.50).

Conclusions

In patients with PFO-associated stroke, ASA is a more important predictor of recurrent stroke than shunt size. These results can help to better identify those patients with a high risk of stroke recurrence under medical therapy who may derive the most benefit from PFO closure.

### Patent foramen ovale and stroke: a review [^11517vQU]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A patent foramen ovale (PFO), an opening between the right and left atria during normal fetal development that fails to close after birth, is present in approximately 25% of all adults. Paradoxical embolism, a venous thromboembolism that travels to the systemic circulation typically through a PFO, accounts for about 5% of all strokes and 10% of strokes in younger patients.

Observations

Approximately 50% of patients 60 years or younger with an embolic stroke of undetermined source (cryptogenic stroke) have a PFO, compared with 25% of the general population. The Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score incorporates clinical characteristics (age, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, cortical infarct on imaging) to predict the likelihood that embolic stroke of undetermined source was caused by a PFO. Among patients in the lowest RoPE score category (score < 3), PFO prevalence was similar to that in the general population (23%), while PFO prevalence was 77% in patients with a RoPE score of 9 or 10. The PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification system combines the RoPE score and anatomical criteria from echocardiography (large shunt, atrial septal aneurysm) to classify PFO as the "probable", "possible", or "unlikely" cause of otherwise cryptogenic stroke. PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke in patients 60 years or younger with cryptogenic stroke. In a pooled analysis of 6 trials (3740 patients), the annualized incidence of stroke over a median follow-up of 57 months was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) with PFO closure vs 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) with medical therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28–0.60]). However, the benefits and harms of closure were highly heterogeneous across the trial populations. In patients categorized as PASCAL "probable" (ie, younger patients without vascular risk factors and high-risk PFO anatomical features), there was a 90% decreased relative rate of recurrent ischemic stroke after PFO closure at 2 years (hazard ratio, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.03–0.35]; absolute risk reduction, 2.1% [95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%]). PASCAL "unlikely" patients (eg, older patients with vascular risk factors and no high-risk PFO anatomical features) did not have a lower recurrent stroke rate with PFO closure but had higher risk of procedure- and device-related adverse events, such as atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patent foramen ovale is present in approximately 25% of all adults and is a common cause of stroke in young and middle-aged patients. The PASCAL classification system can help guide patient selection for PFO closure. Percutaneous PFO closure substantially reduces the risk of stroke recurrence in well-selected patients younger than 60 years after cryptogenic stroke.

It is implicated in several serious clinical syndromes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and systemic embolism. The PFO is now amenable to percutaneous interventional therapies, and multiple novel technologies are either available or under development for lesion closure. The PFO should be better understood to take advantage of emerging percutaneous treatment options.

### Practice advisory update summary: patent foramen ovale and secondary stroke prevention: report of the guideline subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^113uAh5r]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update the 2016 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice advisory for patients with stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO).

Methods

The guideline panel followed the AAN 2017 guideline development process to systematically review studies published through December 2017 and formulate recommendations.

Major Recommendations

In patients being considered for PFO closure, clinicians should ensure that an appropriately thorough evaluation has been performed to rule out alternative mechanisms of stroke (level B). In patients with a higher risk alternative mechanism of stroke identified, clinicians should not routinely recommend PFO closure (level B). Clinicians should counsel patients that having a PFO is common; that it occurs in about 1 in 4 adults in the general population; that it is difficult to determine with certainty whether their PFO caused their stroke; and that PFO closure probably reduces recurrent stroke risk in select patients (level B). In patients younger than 60 years with a PFO and embolic-appearing infarct and no other mechanism of stroke identified, clinicians may recommend closure following a discussion of potential benefits (absolute recurrent stroke risk reduction of 3.4% at 5 years) and risks (periprocedural complication rate of 3.9% and increased absolute rate of non-periprocedural atrial fibrillation of 0.33% per year) (level C). In patients who opt to receive medical therapy alone without PFO closure, clinicians may recommend an antiplatelet medication such as aspirin or anticoagulation (level C).

### Patent foramen ovale and cerebrovascular diseases [^1173iNT2]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been linked to ischemic strokes of undetermined cause (cryptogenic strokes). PFO-a remnant of fetal circulation when the foramen ovale does not seal after birth-can permit microemboli to escape the pulmonary filter into the intracranial circulation, causing stroke. Coexistent atrial septal aneurysm, pelvic deep vein thrombosis and inherited clotting factor deficiencies could potentiate stroke risk in patients with PFO. Transcatheter PFO closure, a minimally invasive procedure, is one technique used to prevent recurrent cerebrovascular events. A connection between PFO and migraine headache has been conceptualized from retrospective evidence of reduced migraine frequency and severity after PFO closure; however, prospective randomized trials are needed to verify the efficacy of PFO closure on migraine prevention. In this review we discuss embryologic origins, diagnostic techniques and treatment options for prevention of paradoxical embolism thought to be related to PFO, and the relation of PFO to cryptogenic stroke and migraine.

Introduction

Despite extensive pathogenic workup, approximately one third of acute ischemic strokes are classified as cryptogenic. 1, 2 Observational studies have demonstrated a strong association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke, 3, 4 suggesting that paradoxical embolism through a PFO may be an important cause of otherwise unexplained ischemic strokes, notably in younger patients. 5, 6 Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2012 and 2013 (CLOSURE I (STARFlex Septal Closure System in Patients with a Stroke and/or Transient Ischemic Attack due to Presumed Paradoxical Embolism through a Patent Foramen Ovale), 7 PC Trial (Clinical Trial Comparing Percutaneous Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale Using the Amplatzer PFO Occluder with Medical Treatment in Patients with Cryptogenic Embolism), 8 and RESPECT (Randomized Evaluation of Recurrent Stroke Comparing PFO Closure to Established Current Standard of Care Treatment) 9) failed to demonstrate the superiority of PFO closure over antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulants) to prevent recurrent stroke. Recently, the long‐term analysis of the RESPECT trial 10 and 3 other RCTs (Gore REDUCE (Gore Helex septal occluder and antiplatelet medical management for reduction of recurrent stroke or imaging‐confirmed transient ischemic attack in patients with patent foramen ovale), 11 CLOSE (Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Anticoagulants versus Antiplatelet Therapy to Prevent Stroke Recurrence), 12 and DEFENSE‐PFO (Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke Patients With High Risk Patent Foramen Ovale) 13) reported a lower incidence rate of recurrent stroke in patients randomized to PFO closure compared with controls. We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of all randomized data allowing the direct comparison of PFO closure, anticoagulation, and antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. To this aim, we included published data from all RCTs and unpublished data from the 3‐arm CLOSE trial, allowing head‐to‐head comparison of all the abovementioned therapeutic strategies and calculation of the absolute risk of stroke and corresponding number needed to treat. Because traditional updated meta‐analyses may sometimes lead to false‐positive results due to repeated significance testing, 14 we performed trial sequential analyses (TSA), a method similar to interim analyses of a single RCT, in order to determine whether enough evidence has been obtained to reach a conclusion. 15, 16

### Patent foramen ovale closure vs. medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113bEptu]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of stroke in the United States is approximately 800 000 per year, 30% of which are cryptogenic. In up to 40% of these patients, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is present. In the presence of a PFO, a clot in the venous circulation can travel across the PFO and lead to arterial occlusion; this paradoxical embolism can lead to a stroke. Subclinical episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) could be a further mechanism for stroke.

Observational studies have suggested an association between the presence of PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Percutaneous closure of PFOs using catheter-based systems has been available since the 1990 s. The superiority of device closure over medical therapy for the prevention of recurrent strokes in patients with cryptogenic stroke and a PFO has not been established. Three previously published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not demonstrate superiority of device closure over medical therapy. Meta-analyses of these trials have also not conclusively proven any significant benefit of device closure when analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Existing guidelines, written before recent trial data was available, do not recommend routine closure of PFOs for patients with cryptogenic stroke. Advisory committees have recommended restricting the closure of PFOs to ongoing clinical trials. Nevertheless, many patients continue to be treated 'off-label'.

Two recent RCTs comparing PFO closure to medical therapy have been published, along with updated long-term results from a previous RCT. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of RCT data including the most recent trials to formally evaluate the benefit of percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale after a cryptogenic stroke.

Patient Selection

Cryptogenic Stroke Evaluation; Which PFO Should We Close?

Evidence supporting PFO‐mediated paradoxical embolic stroke include: cortical location of infarcts, strokes in multiple vascular distributions, and infarcts of different ages in the same vascular territory. 47 A presumptive diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke can be inferred after all other causes of ischemic stroke have been eliminated. Other indirect evidence of a cryptogenic stroke would be absence of conventional stroke risk factors, a history of deep vein thrombosis, recent travel, pulmonary embolus, or Valsalva maneuver before the stroke event. Lacunar infarcts are generally not associated with embolic events. 48 For the purposes of the randomized clinical trials, stroke was defined as an acute neurological deficit, presumably attributed to ischemia, that either resulted in clinical symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer, or symptoms lasting less than 24 hours but associated with a new, neuroanatomically relevant, cerebral infarct on noninvasive imaging.

The RoPE (Risk of Paradoxical Embolism) score has been developed and validated as an assessment tool to determine the probability that a PFO is responsible for a cryptogenic stroke. 49, 50 It can be used when assessing patients with a PFO preceding closure (Table 2). A high score correlates with increased likelihood that a PFO is responsible for the index stroke. The PFO‐attributable fraction of stroke for a score of 7, 8, and 9 is 72%, 84%, and 88%, respectively, and defines a subset of patients who may benefit from PFO closure. The risk‐benefit ratio of performing PFO closure in patients with a RoPE score less than 7 should be carefully weighed. 49

RoPE Score

Before considering PFO closure, a careful evaluation should be done to rule out other causes of stroke, including hypercoagulable states, atherosclerotic lesions, other cardioembolic sources, and arterial dissection. Table 3 outlines a suggested diagnostic workup for a patient with suspected cryptogenic stroke. 51 One of the most important conditions to exclude is AF. Occult AF has been identified in up to 16% of cryptogenic stroke within 90 days of randomization. 52 Noninvasive electrocardiographic monitoring for 30 days improved detection of AF compared to 24‐hour monitoring. 52 A period of extended cardiac monitoring should then be performed in every patient with a cryptogenic stroke before considering PFO closure. Unmasking occult AF or atrial flutter would suggest an etiological association and mandate guideline‐directed chronic anticoagulation as opposed to percutaneous PFO closure.

### Prognosis of cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen ovale at older ages and implications for trials: a population-based study and systematic review [^1134xgWU]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

By comparing the risk of stroke recurrence in patients with vs without PFO stratified by age, we noted an apparent age-related excess risk of recurrent stroke conferred by PFO, with stroke risk associated with PFO being greater only in patients with PFO who were 65 years or older. This finding suggests that the increase in stroke risk with age in our main analysis of PFO cohorts is not simply due to the increase in the background vascular risk burden with age. The choice of a different age threshold of 65 years (as opposed to 60 years used in PFO trials) for our analysis of risk for PFO vs no PFO was related to the age thresholds reported in the studies included in the analysis.

Although randomized clinical trials of PFO closure showed benefit in younger patients, we did not find an increased risk of stroke recurrence in younger patients with PFO. However, these findings are not inconsistent, but instead suggest that PFO-associated cryptogenic stroke in younger patients has a relatively low risk of recurrence, albeit lowered further by closure. It is also possible that increasingly effective medical treatment in more recent studies might be associated with reduced risks. Given the small numbers of studies and outcome events in this analysis, it is also possible that our study lacked statistical power to detect potentially clinically important associations reliably.

### Patent foramen ovale diagnosis in young stroke patients: analysis of recurrence and mortality [^114nhyep]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke in young adults is a serious event that can cause death, lifelong disability, and decreased quality of life, with major social and economic impacts because of high healthcare costs. Worldwide, more than two million young adults suffer from ischemic stroke every year. Recent studies have revealed wide variation in the geographic incidence. Young stroke patients are typically considered to be individuals who experience a stroke before the age of 50. However, the age cutoff is biologically arbitrary, and other definitions may extend the upper age limit to 60. Despite the ever-increasing number of ischemic strokes among younger patients, the causes of stroke remain unknown in about one-third of all patients. In these patients, the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) may be a potential cause of paradoxical embolism. PFO exists in approximately 25% of the population, with high-risk features likely associated with clinical events in presumably 5%. The clinical benefit of PFO closure was previously uncertain. However, several trials have provided data on the role of PFO closure for secondary stroke prevention. Consequently, the European Stroke Organization (ESO) state in 2018 that it is reasonable to recommend PFO closure in patients aged between 18 and 60 with embolic appearing stroke, with no other apparent mechanism, introducing an alternative therapeutic option that can significantly change patient management.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the relative and the absolute effects of PFO closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone or versus anticoagulation and the effect of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. Figure 2 provides an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement.

Fig 2
Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of the effects of percutaneous closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy alone in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke. Evidence used from 6 randomised clinical trials(plus 2 further trials for comparison of antiplatelets and anticoagulants)

We conducted a network meta-analysis combining direct evidence (from studies of management in people with cryptogenic stroke comparing at least two of the three options) with indirect evidence (inferring benefits and harms of two alternatives through relative effects on a third option) to obtain more informative estimates of effect. The paucity of data regarding anticoagulation for this intervention resulted in a sparsely populated network with low certainty evidence. The estimates of relative effect of PFO closure versus anticoagulation were extremely imprecise. Only 353 patients were randomised to PFO closure versus anticoagulation, and 405 patients to anticoagulation versus antiplatelet agents, and events were infrequent. Therefore, to obtain more precise estimates, we performed additional analyses based on indirect evidence.

The systematic review also reports indirect evidence, from participants who did not have PFO and cryptogenic stroke, but venous thromboembolism. This evidence was used to inform the effects of anticoagulation versus on stroke. Similarly, for the outcome of major bleeding, we performed additional analyses based on indirect evidence comparing anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy for several non-PFO associated indications.

Specific groups of PFO patients with cryptogenic stroke

We hypothesised that studies including more patients with larger shunt sizes, and those that included more patients treated with anticoagulants, would demonstrate larger effects. A separate systematic reviewreported that PFO closure, compared with any medical therapy, was more effective in patients with moderate or large size shunts. However, the same clinical trials that included more patients with larger shunts also included fewer patients who were prescribed anticoagulants in the medical therapy arm; this confounding makes it impossible to sort out which association (if either) was responsible for the larger effect. Therefore, the shunt size subgroup effect has low credibility (for more details see the linked systematic review).

We were unable to stratify our analyses and recommendations by type or generation of PFO closure device because of the limitations in published data and small subset sample sizes.

What you need to know

The recommendations apply to patients under 60 years old with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who have had a cryptogenic ischaemic stroke, when extensive workup for other aetiologies of stroke is negative
For patients who are open to all options, we make a weak recommendation for PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy rather than anticoagulant therapy
For patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated or declined, we make a strong recommendation for PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone
For patients in whom closure is contraindicated or declined, we make a weak recommendation for anticoagulant therapy rather than antiplatelet therapy.
Further research may alter the recommendations that involve anticoagulant therapy

Options for the secondary prevention of stroke in patients younger than 60 years who have had a cryptogenic ischaemic stroke thought to be secondary to patent foramen ovale (PFO) include PFO closure (with antiplatelet therapy), antiplatelet therapy alone, or anticoagulants. International guidance and practice differ on which option is preferable.

The BMJ Rapid Recommendations panel used a linked systematic reviewtriggered by three large randomised trials published in September 2017 that suggested PFO closure might reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke more than alternatives. The panel felt that the studies, when considered in the context of the full body of evidence, might change current clinical practice. The linked systematic review finds that PFO closure prevents recurrent stroke relative to antiplatelet therapy, but possibly not relative to anticoagulants, and is associated with procedural complications and persistent atrial fibrillation. The review also presents evidence regarding the role of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy when PFO closure is not acceptable or is contraindicated.

This expert panel make a

Strong recommendation in favour of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy compared with antiplatelet therapy alone
Weak recommendation in favour of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy compared with anticoagulants
Weak recommendation in favour of anticoagulants compared with antiplatelet therapy.

### Patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke: diagnosis and updates in secondary stroke prevention [^114HNRtG]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The connection between the left and right atria at the fossa ovale in fetal circulation remains open during adulthood in a quarter of the general population, with the prevalence reported higher in those < 30 years old and less in those > 80 years old. This patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been implicated as an aetiology in cryptogenic stroke, comprising a hefty third of all strokes. The opportunity for risk stratification and secondary stroke prevention in this cohort — cryptogenic stroke with PFO — underscored a number of randomised controlled trials (RCT) leading to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Amplatzer PFO Occluder in October 2016. But at that time, the trials still yielded unconvincing data on the efficacy of PFO closure. Recently a new series of trials have tackled some challenges from previous trials and provided more affirmative data on the utility of PFO closure for a select patient population.

This review will discuss the modalities of diagnosing PFO, strategies to assess the risk of PFO in causing paradoxical embolism, updated evidence on the efficacy of percutaneous PFO closure for secondary stroke prevention of cryptogenic stroke, and antithrombotic choices in those with PFO and stroke.

American Academy of Neurology practice advisory — patent foramen ovale (PFO) and secondary stroke prevention — major recommendations are: In patients being considered for PFO closure, clinicians should ensure that an appropriately thorough evaluation has been performed to rule out alternative mechanisms of stroke (level B). In patients with a higher risk alternative mechanism of stroke identified, clinicians should not routinely recommend PFO closure (level B). Clinicians should counsel patients that having a PFO is common; that it occurs in about 1 in 4 adults in the general population; that it is difficult to determine with certainty whether their PFO caused their stroke; and that PFO closure probably reduces recurrent stroke risk in select patients (level B). In patients younger than 60 years with a PFO and embolic-appearing infarct and no other mechanism of stroke identified, clinicians may recommend closure following a discussion of potential benefits (absolute recurrent stroke risk reduction of 3.4% at 5 years) and risks (periprocedural complication rate of 3.9% and increased absolute rate of non-periprocedural atrial fibrillation of 0.33% per year) (level C). In patients who opt to receive medical therapy alone without PFO closure, clinicians may recommend an antiplatelet medication such as aspirin or anticoagulation (level C).

### Patent foramen ovale closure vs. medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112YwBnD]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we have shown that: (i) the risk of recurrent stroke is low in RCTs for patients with PFO who have suffered a cryptogenic stroke (annual risk of 1.16% in patients treated with medical therapy in trials); (ii) this risk can be reduced by two-thirds by device closure of a PFO in addition to medical therapy (HR 0.32 with device closure, 95% CI 0.13–0.82; P = 0.018); (iii) the benefit from PFO closure depends on shunt size (P = 0.031), with patients with large shunts benefitting from device closure (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.72; P = 0.005), in contrast to those with small shunts (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.60; P = 0.712); (iv) there is no impact of the presence or absence of an aneurysmal atrial septum on outcomes with device closure; and (v) AF is rare but significantly increased with device closure vs. medical therapy (annual risk 1.38% in device arm, RR 4.68, 95% CI 2.19–10.00, P < 0.001 with device closure).

Superiority of device closure to medical therapy

Previous RCTs and meta-analyses have failed to show the superiority of device closure to medical therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with a PFO. With the publication of two new RCTs, we have robust data to show that device closure is associated with a significant reduction in recurrent stroke. Furthermore, we now have data to support PFO closure with multiple device types (previously the only positive data was for the Amplatzer device). Our primary analysis, which included all RCTs published in this field, showed clear superiority of PFO closure; this was reinforced in a sensitivity analysis excluding the CLOSURE-1 trial which used the now defunct Starflex device, where the margins of superiority for stroke prevention were greater and the margins of inferiority for risk of AF were smaller.

The significance of PFO in the aetiology of cryptogenic stroke has been debated. This analysis demonstrates that interventional strategies can significantly reduce risk of recurrent stroke and supports the underlying mechanistic plausibility for causation of stroke via paradoxical embolism. With this combination of factors, we can now state that, in selected patients with a cryptogenic stroke and a PFO, device closure reduces future events.

### Prognosis of cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen ovale at older ages and implications for trials: a population-based study and systematic review [^116QAcuf]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The causal role of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with cryptogenic transient ischemic attack (TIA) and/or stroke (TIA/stroke) has been reinforced by randomized clinical trials showing that percutaneous closure reduces the risk of recurrent stroke, mostly in patients aged 60 years or younger. However, older patients account for most strokes and PFO is associated with cryptogenic TIA/stroke in patients at older ages, with a substantial burden at a population level (approximately 6000 patients aged > 60 years with large PFO and cryptogenic TIA/nondisabling stroke every year in the UK). To our knowledge, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials that PFO closure is effective in secondary prevention of stroke in patients older than 60 years.

In published trials of PFO closure, the risk of stroke recurrence is low even in the nonclosure arm (1.27 per 100 person-years), but this risk might be higher at older ages. However, PFO closure might be less effective and/or higher risk in older patients than in younger ones; therefore, new trials of PFO closure at older ages are required. Data on age-specific prognosis on medical treatment alone are warranted to justify trials of PFO closure at older ages and inform design of the trials.

We examined the age-related risk of ischemic stroke recurrence in a large, population-based cohort after cryptogenic TIA/nondisabling stroke in patients with PFO. We also performed a systematic review of cohort studies reporting ischemic stroke recurrence after cryptogenic TIA/stroke in patients with PFO receiving medical therapy alone or with PFO vs no PFO and pooled our data in a meta-analysis stratified by age, as well as in a meta-regression. We then estimated the sample size for future trials of PFO closure vs medical treatment alone in secondary prevention of cryptogenic TIA/stroke in patients with PFO aged 60 years or older.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing PFO closure and is based on the content expertise of the panel members; practical issues are also accessible, along with the evidence, as decision aids to support shared decision making in MAGICapp. Antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation are typically given as an oral medication once or twice a day.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of percutaneous closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy alone in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke

Costs and resources

The panel focused on the patient's perspective rather than that of society when formulating the recommendation. Because PFO closure is associated with higher costs related to the procedure, implementation of this recommendation is likely to have an important impact on the costs for health funders in the short term. Over the long term, however, PFO closure may reduce costs as a result of reduced stroke rates and reduction in associated costs. Addressing this issue formally would require a cost effectiveness analysis.

Uncertainties to be addressed in future research

The key remaining research question is the relative merit of PFO closure versus anticoagulation alone. It may also be appropriate to conduct further trials of PFO closure versus antiplatelet agents alone in those with small PFOs. Longer trials are also needed to address the longevity of the PFO closure device and ongoing need for monitoring of device performance.

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines include:

What are the benefits and harms of PFO closure versus anticoagulants (including direct oral anticoagulants) in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke?
What patient groups are more likely to benefit from PFO closure versus medical therapy? (That is, explore whether the effect of PFO closure versus medical therapy varies with shunt size, presence of atrial septal aneurysm, and age.)
Which device for PFO closure is best?
What is the longevity of the PFO closure device and ongoing need for monitoring of device performance?

### Patent foramen ovale closure vs. medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1139bWaV]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We carried out a meta-analysis of RCTs that evaluated device closure for patients with a PFO and cryptogenic stroke.

Search strategy

We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases from October 2000 to October 2017 for all studies of PFO closure. Our search strings included '(PFO or "patent foramen ovale") AND Closure'; and 'cryptogenic stroke', respectively. We also hand-searched the bibliographies of relevant selected studies, reviews and meta-analyses to identify further eligible studies. Abstracts were reviewed for suitability and articles accordingly retrieved. Two independent reviewers performed the search and literature screening (Y. A. and M.S.S.), with disputes resolved by consensus following discussion with a third author (S.S.).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We considered all randomized studies of PFO closure. Studies were eligible if they randomized patients to device closure or medical therapy, and reported outcome data with regards to recurrent stroke. Observational studies were not considered.

Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent stroke and the primary safety endpoint was risk of AF. Non-fatal and fatal ischaemic strokes were included together as stroke in endpoint definitions across trials. We considered major bleeding as a secondary safety endpoint.

### Heart-stroke team: a multidisciplinary assessment of patent foramen ovale-associated stroke [^114LnzGp]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure prevents recurrent ischemic stroke in selected patients with a cryptogenic stroke. Trial results tend to be generalized to daily practice, often extending original trial inclusion criteria. This may result in unnecessary closure without benefit, but with risk of complications. We therefore introduced a standardized and structured evaluation by an interdisciplinary Heart-Stroke Team (HST). Our aim was to investigate the proportion of actual PFO closure of all referred patients with a cryptogenic stroke, after evaluation by the HST.

Patients and methods:

We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study. Patients with an assumed cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and a PFO who were referred for PFO closure were analyzed. As part of the HST approach, all patients underwent a standardized work-up, first to demonstrate the ischemic event on neuroimaging, second to evaluate all potential causes of stroke and finally, to assess the possible relation between the PFO and stroke. Outcome was the proportion of patients treated with PFO closure after referral.

Results:

A total of 195 patients were included. In 124 patients (64%) PFO closure was advised. Fourty-two (22%) patients had a clear alternative cause of stroke and in 13 (7%) patients the initial stroke diagnosis could not be confirmed.

Conclusion:

After careful analysis of patients referred for PFO closure a relationship between the PFO and stroke could not be demonstrated in 32% of referrals, and 3% preferred best medical treatment over percutaneous closure. This stresses the need for a complete neurovascular work-up and multidisciplinary assessment.

A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials of closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) versus medical therapy to prevent recurrent stroke shows a statistically significant absolute 2% decrease in recurrent stroke but no difference in death. Patients treated with PFO closure have an absolute 2% increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation, usually transient, after the procedure, as well as increased risk of procedural complications, which are usually minor. Guidelines on PFO closure were written before most data in this meta-analysis were available. Those guidelines are now outdated.

### Patent foramen ovale closure vs. medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HoteT]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The efficacy of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for cryptogenic stroke has been controversial. We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing device closure with medical therapy to prevent recurrent stroke for patients with PFO.

Methods and Results

We systematically identified all RCTs comparing device closure to medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke in patients with PFO. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent stroke, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary safety endpoint was new onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Five studies (3440 patients) were included. In all, 1829 patients were randomized to device closure and 1611 to medical therapy. Across all patients, PFO closure was superior to medical therapy for prevention of stroke [hazard ratio (HR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.13–0.82; P = 0.018, I² = 73.4%]. The risk of AF was significantly increased with device closure [risk ratio (RR) 4.68, 95% CI 2.19–10.00, P < 0.001, heterogeneity I² = 27.5%)]. In patients with large shunts, PFO closure was associated with a significant reduction in stroke (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.72; P = 0.005), whilst there was no significant reduction in stroke in patients with a small shunt (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.60; P = 0.712). There was no effect from the presence or absence of an atrial septal aneurysm on outcomes (P = 0.994).

Conclusion

In selected patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure is superior to medical therapy for the prevention of further stroke: this is particularly true for patients with moderate-to-large shunts. Guidelines should be updated to reflect this.

### Patent foramen ovale transcatheter closure vs. medical therapy on recurrent vascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116g2fb1]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with cryptogenic stroke, transcatheter (TC) closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) has not been shown to better prevent recurrent vascular events than medical therapy. However, randomized controlled trials (RCT) to date have included few vascular events, and lack of power has been raised as an important concern.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing RCT published studies assessing the recurrence of vascular events after TC PFO closure when compared to medical therapy.

Methods

Using the search terms "patent foramen ovale", "PFO", "stroke", "percutaneous closure" and "transcatheter closure", Medline, Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were reviewed from inception through April 2013, with no language restrictions. Only studies in adult humans were considered. Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of studies reviewed. The following criteria were used for study selection: 1) randomized controlled trial, 2) subjects were adult patients with cryptogenic stroke who were randomized to TC PFO closure or medical treatment (antiplatelet therapy and/or anticoagulation), and 3) reported outcomes included cardiac death, all death, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and peripheral embolism. Methodological and descriptive data, adverse events (including raw data and risk estimates), as well as procedural success and complications were abstracted in duplicate from each study independently, and agreement was tested. We followed rigorously the recommended guidelines for reporting and conducting and assessing quality of meta-analysis of RCT. The primary endpoints pre-specified in advance were recurrent vascular events, and composite endpoint of death, and recurrent vascular events.

Results

Three studies were identified as meeting selection criteria. These included a total of 2,303 patients, with 1,150 patients randomized to TC PFO closure and 1,153 patients randomized to medical therapy. Mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Baseline characteristics (age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors) were similar across studies. Intention-to-treat analyses showed a statistically significant risk reduction in stroke and/or transient ischemic attack in the TC PFO closure group when compared to medical treatment, pooled HR = 0.59, 95%CI (0.36–0.97), P = 0.04. The combined outcome of death, and vascular events, showed a borderline statistically significant benefit for TC PFO closure when compared to medical treatment, pooled HR = 0.67, 95%CI (0.44–1.00), P = 0.05 Subjects with a substantial PFO shunt seem to benefit the most with TC PFO closure, pooled HR = 0.35, 95%CI (0.12–1.03), P = 0.06, however, it did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusion

These results suggest that in patients with cryptogenic stroke, TC PFO closure may be beneficial in reducing the risk of recurrent vascular events when compared to medical treatment. The benefit of TC PFO closure may be greater in patients with a substantial shunt.

### Device closure versus medical therapy alone for patent foramen ovale in patients with cryptogenic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aewky]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal strategy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) is unknown.

Purpose

To compare transcatheter PFO closure with medical therapy alone for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke.

Data Sources

PubMed and the Cochrane Library (without language restrictions) from inception to October 2017, reference lists, and abstracts from cardiology meetings.

Study Selection

Randomized trials enrolling adults with PFO and cryptogenic stroke that compared stroke outcomes (main outcome) and potential harms in those receiving transcatheter device closure versus medical therapy alone.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted study data and rated risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

Of 5 trials, 1 was excluded because it used a device that is no longer available due to high rates of complications and failure. Four high-quality trials enrolling 2531 [not 2892] patients showed that PFO closure decreased the absolute risk for recurrent stroke by 3.3% [not 3.2%] (risk difference [RD], −0.033 [95% CI, −0.062 to −0.004]) [not −0.032 (95% CI, −0.050 to −0.014)] compared with medical therapy. The treatment strategies did not differ in rates of transient ischemic attack or major bleeding. Closure of PFOs was associated with higher rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) than medical therapy alone in all trials, but this outcome had marked between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 81.9%), and high event rates in some groups resulted in extreme values for CIs.

Limitation

Heterogeneity of device type and antithrombotic therapy across trials, small numbers for some outcomes, and heterogeneous and inconclusive AF results.

Conclusion

In patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, transcatheter device closure decreases risk for recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone. Because recurrent stroke rates are low even with medical therapy alone and PFO closure might affect AF risk, shared decision making is crucial for this treatment.

Primary Funding Source

### Patent foramen ovale closure or anticoagulation vs. antiplatelets after stroke [^115toSQg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Trials of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure to prevent recurrent stroke have been inconclusive. We investigated whether patients with cryptogenic stroke and echocardiographic features representing risk of stroke would benefit from PFO closure or anticoagulation, as compared with antiplatelet therapy.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients 16 to 60 years of age who had had a recent stroke attributed to PFO, with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, to transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy (PFO closure group), antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group), or oral anticoagulation (anticoagulation group) (randomization group 1). Patients with contraindications to anticoagulants or to PFO closure were randomly assigned to the alternative noncontraindicated treatment or to antiplatelet therapy (randomization groups 2 and 3). The primary outcome was occurrence of stroke. The comparison of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 2, and the comparison of oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 3.

Results

A total of 663 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a mean (± SD) of 5.3 ± 2.0 years. In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 2, no stroke occurred among the 238 patients in the PFO closure group, whereas stroke occurred in 14 of the 235 patients in the antiplatelet-only group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.26; P < 0.001). Procedural complications from PFO closure occurred in 14 patients (5.9%). The rate of atrial fibrillation was higher in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (4.6% vs. 0.9%, P = 0.02). The number of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (P = 0.56). In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 3, stroke occurred in 3 of 187 patients assigned to oral anticoagulants and in 7 of 174 patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone.

Conclusions

Among patients who had had a recent cryptogenic stroke attributed to PFO with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, the rate of stroke recurrence was lower among those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone. PFO closure was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. (Funded by the French Ministry of Health; CLOSE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00562289 .).

### Cryptogenic stroke and patent Foramen Ovale [^115Gc646]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Nearly one-half of patients with cryptogenic stroke have a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The dilemma of whether to close these PFOs percutaneously, in an effort to reduce the risk of recurrent paradoxical embolism, has been a matter of ongoing debate for more than a decade. Early randomized clinical trials failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of percutaneous PFO closure for secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke in an intention-to-treat analysis. The long-term follow-up data from the RESPECT trial and 2 new randomized trials (CLOSE and REDUCE) have clarified these findings. They showed that with good patient selection, transcatheter PFO closure significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke, with no increased risk of serious adverse events or influence on major bleeding.

### Neuroimaging findings in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without patent foramen ovale [^111pwwxm]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke are commonly associated but some PFOs are incidental. Specific radiological findings associated with PFO may be more likely to indicate a PFO-related cause. We examined whether specific radiological findings are associated with PFO among subjects with cryptogenic stroke and known PFO status.

Methods

We analyzed the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism(RoPE) Study database of subjects with cryptogenic stroke and known PFO status, for associations between PFO and: (1) index stroke seen on imaging, (2) index stroke size, (3) index stroke location, (4) multiple index strokes, and (5) prior stroke on baseline imaging. We also compared imaging with purported high-risk echocardiographic features.

Results

Subjects (N = 2680) were significantly more likely to have a PFO if their index stroke was large (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; P = 0.0025), seen on index imaging (OR, 1.53; P = 0.003), and superficially located (OR, 1.54; P < 0.0001). A prior stroke on baseline imaging was associated with not having a PFO (OR, 0.66; P < 0.0001). Finding multiple index strokes was unrelated to PFO status (OR, 1.21; P = 0.161). No echocardiographic variables were related to PFO status.

Conclusions

This is the largest study to report the radiological characteristics of patients with cryptogenic stroke and known PFO status. Strokes that were large, radiologically apparent, superficially located, or unassociated with prior radiological infarcts were more likely to be PFO-associated than were unapparent, smaller, or deep strokes, and those accompanied by chronic infarcts. There was no association between PFO and multiple acute strokes nor between specific echocardiographic PFO features with neuroimaging findings.

### Risk of paradoxical embolism (RoPE)-estimated attributable fraction correlates with the benefit of patent foramen ovale closure: an analysis of 3 trials [^112RGxDt]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

In patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO), the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Score has been proposed as a method to estimate a patient-specific "PFO-attributable fraction"-the probability that a documented PFO is causally-related to the stroke, rather than an incidental finding. The objective of this research is to examine the relationship between this RoPE-estimated PFO-attributable fraction and the effect of closure in 3 randomized trials.

Methods

We pooled data from the CLOSURE-I (Evaluation of the STARFlex Septal Closure System in Patients With a Stroke and/or Transient Ischemic Attack due to Presumed Paradoxical Embolism through a Patent Foramen Ovale), RESPECT (Randomized Evaluation of Recurrent Stroke Comparing PFO Closure to Established Current Standard of Care Treatment), and PC (Clinical Trial Comparing Percutaneous Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale [PFO] Using the Amplatzer PFO Occluder With Medical Treatment in Patients With Cryptogenic Embolism) trials. We examine the treatment effect of closure in high RoPE score (≥ 7) versus low RoPE score (< 7) patients. We also estimated the relative risk reduction associated with PFO closure across each level of the RoPE score using Cox proportional hazard analysis. We estimated a patient-specific attributable fraction using a PC trial-compatible (9-point) RoPE equation (omitting the neuroradiology variable), as well as a 2-trial analysis using the original (10-point) RoPE equation. We examined the Pearson correlation between the estimated attributable fraction and the relative risk reduction across RoPE strata.

Results

In the low RoPE score group (< 7, n = 912), the rate of recurrent strokes per 100 person-years was 1.37 in the device arm versus 1.68 in the medical arm (hazard ratio, 0.82 [0.42–1.59] P = 0.56) compared with 0.30 versus 1.03 (hazard ratio, 0.31 [0.11–0.85] P = 0.02) in the high RoPE score group (≥ 7, n = 1221); treatment-by-RoPE score group interaction, P = 0.12. The RoPE score estimated attributable fraction anticipated the relative risk reduction across all levels of the RoPE score, in both the 3-trial (r = 0.95, P < 0.001) and 2-trial (r = 0.92, P < 0.001) analyses.

Conclusions

The RoPE score estimated attributable fraction is highly correlated to the relative risk reduction of device versus medical therapy. This observation suggests the RoPE score identifies patients with cryptogenic stroke who are likely to have a PFO that is pathogenic rather than incidental.

### Heterogeneity of treatment effects in an analysis of pooled individual patient data from randomized trials of device closure of patent foramen ovale after stroke [^114wjDvU]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Patent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated strokes comprise approximately 10% of ischemic strokes in adults aged 18 to 60 years. While device closure decreases stroke recurrence risk overall, the best treatment for any individual is often unclear.

Objective

To evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect of PFO closure on stroke recurrence based on previously developed scoring systems.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Investigators for the Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation (SCOPE) Consortium pooled individual patient data from all 6 randomized clinical trials that compared PFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone in patients with PFO-associated stroke, and included a total of 3740 participants. The trials were conducted worldwide from 2000 to 2017.

Exposures

PFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone. Subgroup analyses used the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Score (a 10-point scoring system in which higher scores reflect younger age and the absence of vascular risk factors) and the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) Classification System, which combines the RoPE Score with high-risk PFO features (either an atrial septal aneurysm or a large-sized shunt) to classify patients into 3 categories of causal relatedness: unlikely, possible, and probable.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Ischemic stroke.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 57 months (IQR, 24–64), 121 outcomes occurred in 3740 patients. The annualized incidence of stroke with medical therapy was 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) and with device closure was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28–0.60]). The subgroup analyses showed statistically significant interaction effects. Patients with low vs high RoPE Score had HRs of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37–1.00) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.11–0.42), respectively (P for interaction = .02). Patients classified as unlikely, possible, and probable using the PASCAL Classification System had HRs of 1.14 (95% CI, 0.53–2.46), 0.38 (95% CI, 0.22–0.65), and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03–0.35), respectively (P for interaction = .003). The 2-year absolute risk reduction was -0.7% (95% CI, -4.0% to 2.6%), 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.6%), and 2.1% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively. Device-associated adverse events were generally higher among patients classified as unlikely; the absolute risk increases in atrial fibrillation beyond day 45 after randomization with a device were 4.41% (95% CI, 1.02% to 7.80%), 1.53% (95% CI, 0.33% to 2.72%), and 0.65% (95% CI, -0.41% to 1.71%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients aged 18 to 60 years with PFO-associated stroke, risk reduction for recurrent stroke with device closure varied across groups classified by their probabilities that the stroke was causally related to the PFO. Application of this classification system has the potential to guide individualized decision-making.

### Patent foramen ovale and risk of recurrence in stroke of determined etiology [^112R9wHE]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is often found in stroke patients with determined etiologies. PFO may be the actual cause of stroke in some of them. We determined whether the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke differs with PFO status in stroke patients with determined etiologies.

Methods

This study included consecutive patients with stroke of determined etiology who underwent transesophageal echocardiography. We compared the rates of recurrent cerebral infarction in patients with versus without PFO, and according to PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification.

Results

Of 2,314 included patients, 827 (35.7%) had PFO. During a median follow-up of 4.4years, cerebral infarction recurred in 202 (8.7%). In multivariate modified Cox regression analyses, recurrence of infarction did not significantly differ between patients with PFO and those without PFO (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64–1.17, p = 0.339). Interaction analysis showed a significant effect of PFO in patients aged < 65years (adjusted p for interaction = 0.090). PFO was independently associated with a decreased risk of recurrent infarction in patients younger than 65years (HR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20–0.85, adjusted p = 0.016). Patients with probable PFO-associated stroke on the PASCAL classification had a significantly lower risk of recurrent infarction than those without PFO (HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.10–0.97, p = 0.044).

Interpretation

Considering the generally low risk of recurrence in PFO-associated stroke, PFO may be the actual cause of stroke in some patients with determined etiologies, especially younger patients or those with PFO features of probable PFO-associated stroke. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:596–606.

### Patent foramen ovale [^111ZMcmT]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is the most common anatomical cause of an interatrial shunt. It is usually asymptomatic but may cause paradoxical embolism, manifesting as stroke, myocardial infarction or visceral/peripheral ischaemia. PFO is a risk factor for stroke and may be associated with migraine with aura. New evidence suggests PFO closure reduces the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in a highly selected population of stroke survivors: those aged 60 years or younger with a cryptogenic stroke syndrome, a large right-to-left shunt, an atrial septal aneurysm and no evidence of atrial fibrillation. They benefit from percutaneous PFO closure in addition to antiplatelet therapy, rather than antiplatelet therapy alone. Current evidence does not support PFO closure in the treatment of migraine.

### Patent foramen ovale closure vs. medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112hKTtD]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Aims

The efficacy of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for cryptogenic stroke has been controversial. We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing device closure with medical therapy to prevent recurrent stroke for patients with PFO.

Methods and results

We systematically identified all RCTs comparing device closure to medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke in patients with PFO. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent stroke, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary safety endpoint was new onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Five studies (3440 patients) were included. In all, 1829 patients were randomized to device closure and 1611 to medical therapy. Across all patients, PFO closure was superior to medical therapy for prevention of stroke [hazard ratio (HR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.13–0.82; P = 0.018, I² = 73.4%]. The risk of AF was significantly increased with device closure [risk ratio (RR) 4.68, 95% CI 2.19–10.00, P < 0.001, heterogeneity I² = 27.5%)]. In patients with large shunts, PFO closure was associated with a significant reduction in stroke (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.72; P = 0.005), whilst there was no significant reduction in stroke in patients with a small shunt (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.60; P = 0.712). There was no effect from the presence or absence of an atrial septal aneurysm on outcomes (P = 0.994).

Conclusion

In selected patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure is superior to medical therapy for the prevention of further stroke: this is particularly true for patients with moderate-to-large shunts. Guidelines should be updated to reflect this.

### Cryptogenic stroke and PFO closure: does sex matter? [^111io1kf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a common disease, affecting 750 000 people in the United States each year, the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability. Many ischemic strokes are related to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and large‐artery atherosclerosis, along with cardioembolism caused by atrial fibrillation. One‐third of ischemic strokes, however, remain cryptogenic, with no clear cause, and many of these occur in younger adults. In recent years, the association of patent foramen ovale (PFO) and embolic strokes of unclear source has been of more interest, and now 4 trials, have found benefit in percutaneous PFO closure in patients aged < 60 years with cryptogenic stroke and few risk factors. In aggregate, these studies have found about a 3.3% absolute risk reduction in recurrent stroke with closure compared with medical therapy alone, and determining which strokes are related to PFO and therefore may benefit from closure is key to the success of the procedure. Several measures for predicting benefit of closure, such as Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score of > 7, containing patient risk factors (ie, age; history of hypertension, diabetes, or strokes; cortical infarction), as well as the PFO‐Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood classification of possible or probable, adding higher‐risk PFO features (ie, shunt size and atrial septal aneurysm). Guidelines currently recommend that PFO closure should be considered in addition to antiplatelet therapy in patients aged 18 to 60 years with nonlacunar ischemic stroke of undetermined cause and PFO with high‐risk anatomic features after a thorough evaluation by a multidisciplinary team (cardiology and neurology) in a shared decision‐making model.

While stroke overall is decreasing in incidence over time, there is evidence that stroke in young adults may be increasing. Furthermore, there are also reasons to believe that the causes of stroke in young women may differ from that in young men. While the incidence of myocardial infarction is higher in men than women for every age group, it appears that in adults aged < 45 years, women have more strokes than men. This finding suggests that factors other than the traditional cardiovascular risk factors driving acute myocardial infarction are at play in the development of ischemic strokes among young adults. Some of the nontraditional causes of ischemic strokes in young adults, in addition to PFO, include arterial dissection, migraine, substance use disorder, and, specifically in women, hormone‐related risk factors such as exogenous estrogen use, pregnancy, and puerperium.

### Prevalence, causal classification, and prognosis of patent foramen ovale in young patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source [^111VV4zo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Strokes are a significant cause of death and disability worldwide, with an increasing incidence in young adults (aged 18–50 years). Approximately 60% of cryptogenic ischemic strokes in young adults can be attributed to a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Current guidelines recommend PFO closure in those aged < 60 years if the stroke is attributed to the PFO. Two standard scoring systems, RoPE (Risk of Paradoxical Embolism) and PASCAL (PFO‐Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood classification system), assess PFO‐related stroke risk, with incorporating anatomic factors of the PFO, like shunt size and atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) in addition.

Education into practice

Does this article offer you new ways to approach advising patients with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke presumed to be related to a patent foramen ovale (PFO)?
How might you better respect differences in patients' preferences, particularly their perspective regarding the bleeding risk associated with long term anticoagulation or their feelings about undergoing an invasive procedure?
What information could you share with your patients to help them reach a decision?
How might you share this information with colleagues to learn together?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article.

The panel included three people with personal experience of cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO). These panel members identified important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and preferences. The patients agreed that, in general, small reductions in risk of ischaemic stroke are more important to them than small increases in risk of atrial fibrillation or of device or procedure related adverse events. We expect these values to be shared by most patients for ischaemic stroke. The patients participated as full panel members in the teleconferences and email discussions and met all authorship criteria. They had equal input as any other author on the recommendation.

Understanding the recommendations

Absolute benefits and harms

The panel considered PFO closure plus antiplatelets better than antiplatelet agents alone. This is a strong recommendation because the absolute differences and patient preferences were aligned to place a high value on stroke prevention. Patients are likely to find an absolute reduction of stroke with PFO closure of 8.7% at five years very important. Although 3.6% will experience an adverse event, such events, including 1.8% increase in atrial fibrillation, do not usually result in long term disability and so were considered less important.

The possible small reduction in stroke and decreased bleeding risk with PFO closure versus anticoagulants alone mandated a weak recommendation for PFO closure.

For those patients who need or want to avoid PFO, the panel judged anticoagulation the best alternative, although the evidence regarding stroke reduction was of low certainty. The risk of major bleeding probably increased with anticoagulation. Although direct anticoagulants have not been evaluated in PFO, their advantages in terms of convenience may render them, rather than warfarin, the best option for those who choose anticoagulants.

The main infographic explains the recommendations and provides an overview (GRADE summary of findings) of the absolute benefits (reduction in recurrent ischaemic stroke) and harms of:

PFO closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone
PFO closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus anticoagulants alone
Anticoagulants versus antiplatelet therapy.

Estimates of baseline risk for effects come from the control arm of the trials, using the median estimate of risk where available.

The panel agreed that, compared with antiplatelet therapy alone, PFO closure followed by antiplatelet therapy:

Probably has a large decrease in ischaemic stroke (8.7% absolute risk reduction, moderate quality evidence) over five years
Has a risk of device or procedure related adverse events (3.6% absolute risk, high quality evidence) at one year
Probably has an increase in persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter (1.8% absolute risk increase, moderate quality evidence) and transient atrial fibrillation or flutter (1.2% absolute risk increase, moderate quality evidence) at one year
Probably has little or no difference in death, major bleeding, pulmonary embolism, transient ischaemic attack, or systemic embolism (moderate to high quality evidence) at five years.

### Patent foramen ovale in children: a review of recent progress [^116JiVJe]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a natural connection between the right and left atrial chambers that occurs during fetal development. The embryology of PFO is depicted in Fig. 1. In the majority of individuals, this connection gradually closes after birth. However, if the primary septum fails to fully fuse with the secondary septum, the PFO remains open in approximately 25% of adults. Under certain conditions that raise the pressure in the right atrium, the right-to-left shunt (RLS) through the PFO (as shown in Fig. 2) can be amplified, thereby increasing the risk of paradoxical embolization (PE).

Fig. 1
Development of the atrial septal during the embryonic period. A The septum primum originates from the posterior superior wall of the common atrium and extends toward the atrioventricular (AV) valves. B Fenestrations form in the septum primum and merge together superiorly and anteriorly, while maintaining a connection as fusion occurs inferiorly with the endocardial cushions. C Subsequently, the septum secundum emerges on the right atrial side of the septum primum and grows toward the AV valves. The ostium secundum serves as a pathway for the right-to-left shunt of oxygenated blood. D The primum and secundum septa do not fuse completely, resulting in a patent foramen ovale (PFO) located at the anterosuperior edge of the fossa ovalis

Clinical trials and guidelines have offered assistance in managing PFO in cryptogenic stroke (CS) among adults, while the involvement of PFO in migraines among adults remains a subject of debate. Nevertheless, as these trials did not include children, a conclusive determination regarding the role of PFO in pediatric cases is still pending.

Hence, the objective of this current research was to perform an in-depth analysis to assess the relationship between a PFO and different clinical syndromes in children such as CS, migraine, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and other rare clinical syndromes. Furthermore, we investigated the significance of imaging in the detection of PFO in children and delved into the strategies for managing PFO in children.

### Prognostic significance of patent foramen ovale in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [^114fv7iD]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common remnant of the foetal circulation that is found in about 25% to 30% of the general population. Previous studies have shown that the presence of a PFO may have a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral and systemic embolism, ostensibly because of paradoxical embolisation from sources within the venous circulation across the atrial right-to-left shunt. Several case-control and population-based studies, including a meta-analysis of these studies have reported a significant association between PFO and cryptogenic ischaemic strokes.

Similarly, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition that is also linked to ischaemic stroke. Despite the recognised increased risk of cerebrovascular events associated with both PFO and AF, it is not known whether the coexistence of PFO and AF has an incremental impact on the risk of ischaemic stroke. We hypothesise that the concomitant presence of PFO and AF would pose a larger risk of stroke compared with either condition alone. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the presence of a PFO influences the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with AF.

### Practice advisory update summary: patent foramen ovale and secondary stroke prevention: report of the guideline subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116YL78x]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure — efficacy and risks in patients younger than 60 years: Among patients younger than 60 years with no other etiology identified after a thorough evaluation, transcatheter PFO closure probably reduces recurrent stroke, with a summary rate difference −0.67% per year, 95% CI, −0.39% to −0.94%, I² = 0, and a number needed to treat of 29 to reduce 1 stroke at 5 years. PFO closure was associated with a small risk of procedural complications (summary risk 3.9% [95% CI, 2.3%–5.7%]) and non-periprocedural atrial fibrillation (summary rate difference 0.33% per year [95% CI, 0.04%–0.65%]). Subgroup analysis suggests overall benefit may not extend to patients with small shunts and small, deep infarcts, with no difference in benefit in patients aged 45–60 years compared with those aged < 45 years, and there is evidence PFO may play a role in some cryptogenic stroke in patients older than 60 years.

### Practice advisory update summary: patent foramen ovale and secondary stroke prevention: report of the guideline subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^113PB7K9]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice advisory — patent foramen ovale (PFO) after otherwise cryptogenic ischemic stroke — frames two clinical questions: whether percutaneous PFO closure reduces recurrent stroke risk compared with medical therapy alone and whether anticoagulation reduces recurrent stroke risk compared with antiplatelet medication. The panel relied on intention-to-treat analyses to minimize bias, used studies with the lowest risk of bias for the primary summary analysis, and excluded studies of devices that are not being manufactured or available. Ratio measures were pooled by meta-analyses; because of low event rates, hazard ratios (HRs), risk ratios (RRs), and odds ratios were considered comparable. For the primary efficacy analysis of recurrent stroke, a hybrid meta-analytic approach was used with a fixed-effect inverse-variance hypothesis test followed by a random-effects model of RRs using the weighted symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) algorithm to explore heterogeneity. Consistent with prior AAN guidance, the primary outcome was recurrent stroke, and primary safety outcomes were study-reported, procedure-related serious adverse events and non-periprocedural atrial fibrillation. To improve clinical interpretability, the panel calculated risk differences (RDs) or rate differences from pooled RRs using baseline recurrent stroke risk from nonclosure arms, conducted sensitivity analyses including trials with a higher risk of bias and comparisons of different meta-analytic techniques, and examined prespecified subgroups including age, shunt size, atrial septal aneurysm, antithrombotic management (antiplatelet vs anticoagulation) in medically treated patients, and whether the index stroke appeared embolic.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure — patient selection and counseling (Statements 2a–2e): In patients younger than 60 years with a PFO and an embolic-appearing infarct and no other mechanism of stroke identified, clinicians may recommend closure following a discussion of potential benefits and risks (level C). Clinicians may inform patients that presence of a large shunt probably is associated with benefit from closure, whereas there probably is less likelihood of benefit with a small shunt or a non-embolic-appearing single, small, deep infarct, and it is uncertain whether atrial septal aneurysm in the absence of a large shunt increases the likelihood of benefitting (level C). PFO closure may be offered in other populations, such as for a patient aged 60–65 years with very limited traditional vascular risk factors and no other mechanism of stroke detected after thorough evaluation including prolonged monitoring for atrial fibrillation (level C), and may be offered to younger patients (e.g., < 30 years) with a single, small, deep stroke (< 1.5 cm), a large shunt, and absence of vascular risk factors that would lead to intrinsic small-vessel disease (level C). In a patient for whom PFO closure is being considered, a shared decision-making approach between clinicians and the patient should be used, exploring trial-matched attributes and the patient's preferences and concerns (level B).

### Long-term outcomes of patent foramen ovale closure or medical therapy after stroke [^111AtQLg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether closure of a patent foramen ovale reduces the risk of recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients who have had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke is unknown.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with blinded adjudication of end-point events, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 60 years of age who had a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke to undergo closure of the PFO (PFO closure group) or to receive medical therapy alone (aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin combined with extended-release dipyridamole; medical-therapy group). The primary efficacy end point was a composite of recurrent nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal ischemic stroke, or early death after randomization. The results of the analysis of the primary outcome from the original trial period have been reported previously; the current analysis of data from the extended follow-up period was considered to be exploratory.

Results

We enrolled 980 patients (mean age, 45.9 years) at 69 sites. Patients were followed for a median of 5.9 years. Treatment exposure in the two groups was unequal (3141 patient-years in the PFO closure group vs. 2669 patient-years in the medical-therapy group), owing to a higher dropout rate in the medical-therapy group. In the intention-to-treat population, recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 18 patients in the PFO closure group and in 28 patients in the medical-therapy group, resulting in rates of 0.58 events per 100 patient-years and 1.07 events per 100 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio with PFO closure vs. medical therapy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.999; P = 0.046 by the log-rank test). Recurrent ischemic stroke of undetermined cause occurred in 10 patients in the PFO closure group and in 23 patients in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.79; P = 0.007). Venous thromboembolism (which comprised events of pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis) was more common in the PFO closure group than in the medical-therapy group.

Conclusions

Among adults who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke, closure of a PFO was associated with a lower rate of recurrent ischemic strokes than medical therapy alone during extended follow-up. (Funded by St. Jude Medical; RESPECT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00465270 .).

### A systematic review of closure versus medical therapy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^115Zeuq8]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment for secondary prevention in patients who have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and history of cryptogenic stroke is still uncertain and controversial. In view of this, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate whether PFO closure was superior to medical therapy for prevention of recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with PFO after cryptogenic stroke. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Three randomized controlled trials with a total of 2303 patients were included and analyzed. A fixed-effect model was used by Review Manager 5.2 (RevMan 5.2) software. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of recurrent stroke or TIA was 0.70, with 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47 to 1.04, p = 0.08. The results were similar in the incidence of death and adverse events, and the pooled RR was 0.92 (95% CI = 0.34 to 2.45, p = 0.86) and 1.08 (95% CI = 0.93 to 1.26, p = 0.32), respectively. The data of this systematic review did not show superiority of closure over medical therapy for secondary prevention after cryptogenic stroke. Due to some limitations of the included studies, more randomized controlled trials are needed for further investigation regarding this field.

### Patent foramen ovale is not associated with an increased risk of stroke recurrence [^113KBx37]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite numerous studies suggesting a relationship between paradoxical embolism from a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and stroke, the role of PFO as a risk factor for cerebral ischaemia remains controversial. We therefore sought to determine the association between a RLS detected by contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (c-TCD) and recurrent stroke in an unselected population sample.

Methods

We analyzed the records of 763 patients with diagnosis of cerebral ischaemia at our institution. All patients had undergone TCD-based detection of RLS. Embolic signals have been measured both under resting conditions and after performing a Valsalva maneuver. For follow-up, all patients were contacted by mail, which included a standardized questionnaire. Endpoints of follow-up were defined as recurrence of cerebral ischaemia, occurrence of myocardial infarction or death from any cause.

Results

Follow-up data were available in 639 patients (83.7%). At baseline, a RLS was detected in 140 (28%) men and in 114 (42%) women. Ten shunt-carriers (1.6%) and 32 patients (5.0%) without RLS had suffered a recurrent stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and atrial fibrillation, the hazard ratio of RLS for stroke recurrence was 0.86 (95% CI 0.41–1.79). The condition of RLS at rest adjusted for age, sex, stroke subtype, and cardiovascular risk factors was not found to increase the risk of stroke substantially (HR 1.16 [95% CI 0.41–3.29])

Conclusion

Our data suggest that the risk of recurrent stroke in subjects with PFO is not significantly increased in comparison with subject without it.

### Stroke prevention in pregnancy and postpartum in patients with patent foramen ovale [^1161waTn]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and patent foramen ovale (PFO) are both stroke risk factors in young people. Paradoxical embolism from a systemic venous thrombus is the most widely accepted mechanism for PFO-related stroke. Exposure to transient prothrombotic states, such as combined hormonal contraception and pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of PFO-related stroke. Knowledge gaps remain in stroke-prevention strategies for this patient population. Here, we review the pathophysiology of PFO-related stroke and discuss our multidisciplinary clinical approach to the pregnant patient with a PFO (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
Multidisciplinary Management of Pregnancy in a Patient With PFO

Multiple factors warrant consideration for multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision-making in the preconception, pregnant, and postpartum periods for patients with PFO. For patients with a history of stroke or TIA, PFO closure should be considered prior to pregnancy. For PFO-related stroke occurring during pregnancy, anticoagulation is suggested and deferral of closure until after pregnancy. For patients without a history of stroke, PFO closure is not recommended; decisions regarding primary stroke prevention with conservative management, aspirin, or in rare cases, anticoagulation would depend on factors such as a history of unprovoked venous thromboembolism, underlying hypercoagulable states, or other risk factors. Routine screening for PFO is not recommended, but screening for right-to-left shunt with transcranial Doppler could be considered for selected patients with high-risk conditions. We do not consider pregnancy a contraindication to agitated saline injection. PFO = patent foramen ovale; TIA = transient ischemic attack.

### Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy alone for management of cryptogenic stroke? A clinical practice guideline [^112q6amV]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The largest challenge in making our recommendation was the low quality evidence for the comparisons that included anticoagulants. We summarised all the highest quality available evidence separately for antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulants because the evidence suggests it is likely their effectiveness and adverse effects differ, and clinicians and patients should be aware of these likely differences. Our panel believes that the mechanism of benefit with PFO closure is prevention of venous clots crossing the PFO. Anticoagulants are likely to be substantially more effective in preventing such clots from initially arising than antiplatelet agents.

SCAI patent foramen ovale management — recommendation for adults with a prior PFO‑associated stroke: In patients between the ages of 18 and 60 with a prior PFO‑associated stroke, the SCAI guideline panel recommends PFO closure rather than antiplatelet therapy alone (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

### SCAI guidelines for the management of patent foramen ovale [^1176zedq]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

Patent foramen ovale closure in persons with a history of TIA without prior PFO-associated stroke — in this population, the SCAI guideline panel suggests against PFO closure (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel did not identify any studies directly addressing the benefits of PFO closure in patients with TIA, and notes that by definition, TIA patients have normal neuroimaging and no persistent clinical neurologic deficits, so an ischemic etiology for any given neurologic clinical presentation cannot be confirmed with confidence; therefore a suspected TIA cannot be differentiated from other complex migraine or from other cause of transient neurological symptoms.

### Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on patent foramen ovale closure versus medical therapy for secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke [^115eLFFs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The optimal management of patients with cryptogenic stroke (CS) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effect of PFO closure for secondary prevention of stroke on patients with CS. We searched the literature for randomized control trials assessing the recurrence of stroke after PFO closure compared with medical therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation). Five randomized control trials with a total of 3,440 patients were included. The mean age was 45.2 ± 9.7 years and follow-up duration ranged from 2.0 to 5.9 years. PFO closure significantly reduced the risk of stroke compared with the medical therapy (2.8% vs 5.8%; relative risk [RR] 0.48, confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.87, p = 0.01, I² = 56%). The number needed to treat for stroke prevention was 10.5. PFO closure was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared with medical therapy (4.2% vs 0.7%; RR 4.55, CI 2.16 to 9.6, p = 0.0001, I² = 25%). There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.33, CI 0.56 to 3.16, p = 0.52, I² = 0%), as well as no difference in bleeding risk between the 2 groups (RR 0.94, CI 0.49 to 1.83, p = 0.86, I² = 29%). In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates that PFO closure is associated with significantly lower risk of recurrent stroke in patients with PFO and CS compared with medical therapy. However, atrial fibrillation was more common among closure patients.

### Closure of patent foramen ovale versus medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pK8oB]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses compared the efficacy and safety of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure versus medical treatment in patients with cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Recently, new evidence from randomized trials became available.

Methods

We searched PubMed until September 24, 2017, for trials comparing PFO closure with medical treatment in patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA using the items: stroke or cerebrovascular accident or TIA and patent foramen ovale or paradoxical embolism and trial or study.

Results

Among 851 identified articles, 5 were eligible. In 3627 patients with 3.7-year mean follow-up, there was significant difference in ischemic stroke recurrence (0.53 versus 1.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively; odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.21–0.90; relative risk reduction, 50.5%; absolute risk reduction, 2.11%; and number needed to treat to prevent 1 event, 46.5 for 3.7 years). There was no significant difference in TIAs (0.78 versus 0.98 per 100 patient-years, respectively; OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.53–1.19) and all-cause mortality (0.18 versus 0.23 per 100 patient-years, respectively; OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.34–1.56). New-onset atrial fibrillation occurred more frequently in the PFO closure arm (1.3 versus 0.25 per 100 patient-years, respectively; OR, 5.15; 95% CI, 2.18–12.15) and resolved in 72% of cases within 45 days, whereas rates of myocardial infarction (0.12 versus 0.09 per 100 patient-years, respectively; OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.25–5.91) and any serious adverse events (7.3 versus 7.3 per 100 patient-years, respectively; OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25) were similar.

Conclusions

In patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA and PFO who have their PFO closed, ischemic stroke recurrence is less frequent compared with patients receiving medical treatment. Atrial fibrillation is more frequent but mostly transient. There is no difference in TIA, all-cause mortality, or myocardial infarction.

### Meta-analysis comparing patent foramen ovale closure versus medical therapy to prevent recurrent cryptogenic stroke [^111FiMem]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

New evidence suggests that closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) plus medical therapy (MT; antiplatelet or anticoagulation) is superior to MT alone to prevent recurrent cryptogenic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared PFO closure plus MT with MT alone in patients with cryptogenic stroke. The efficacy end points were recurrent stroke, transient ischemia attack, and death. The safety end points were major bleeding and newly detected atrial fibrillation. Trials were pooled using random effects and fixed effects models. A trial sequential analysis was performed to assess if the current evidence is sufficient. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for pooled estimates of risk. Five randomized controlled trials (3,440 patients) were included. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. PFO closure reduced the risk of recurrent stroke by 58% (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.91, p = 0.03). The number needed to treat was 38. The cumulative Z-line crossed the trial sequential boundary, suggesting there is adequate evidence to conclude that PFO closure reduces the risk of recurrent stroke by 60%. PFO closure did not reduce the risk of transient ischemia attack (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15, p = 0.21), mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.60, p = 0.45), or major bleeding (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.20, p = 0.93); it did increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 4.69, 95% CI 2.17 to 10.12, p < 0.0001).

### Patent foramen ovale closure or antiplatelet therapy for cryptogenic stroke [^112m9yGE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the prevention of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke is uncertain. We investigated the effect of PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone on the risks of recurrent stroke and new brain infarctions.

Methods

In this multinational trial involving patients with a PFO who had had a cryptogenic stroke, we randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to undergo PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy (PFO closure group) or to receive antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group). Imaging of the brain was performed at the baseline screening and at 24 months. The coprimary end points were freedom from clinical evidence of ischemic stroke (reported here as the percentage of patients who had a recurrence of stroke) through at least 24 months after randomization and the 24-month incidence of new brain infarction, which was a composite of clinical ischemic stroke or silent brain infarction detected on imaging.

Results

We enrolled 664 patients (mean age, 45.2 years), of whom 81% had moderate or large interatrial shunts. During a median follow-up of 3.2 years, clinical ischemic stroke occurred in 6 of 441 patients (1.4%) in the PFO closure group and in 12 of 223 patients (5.4%) in the antiplatelet-only group (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.62; P = 0.002). The incidence of new brain infarctions was significantly lower in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (22 patients [5.7%] vs. 20 patients [11.3%]; relative risk, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.91; P = 0.04), but the incidence of silent brain infarction did not differ significantly between the study groups (P = 0.97). Serious adverse events occurred in 23.1% of the patients in the PFO closure group and in 27.8% of the patients in the antiplatelet-only group (P = 0.22). Serious device-related adverse events occurred in 6 patients (1.4%) in the PFO closure group, and atrial fibrillation occurred in 29 patients (6.6%) after PFO closure.

Conclusions

Among patients with a PFO who had had a cryptogenic stroke, the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke was lower among those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone; however, PFO closure was associated with higher rates of device complications and atrial fibrillation.

### Patent foramen ovale closure in older patients with stroke: patient selection for trial feasibility [^116T7Koh]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Whether patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure benefits older patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke is unknown because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have predominantly enrolled patients younger than 60 years of age. Our objective was to estimate anticipated effects of PFO closure in older patients to predict the numbers needed to plan an RCT.

Methods

Effectiveness estimates are derived from major observational studies (Risk of Paradoxical Embolism [RoPE] Study and Oxford Vascular Study, together referred to as the "RoPE-Ox" database) and all 6 major RCTs (Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation [SCOPE] Consortium). To estimate stroke recurrence risk, observed outcomes were calculated for patients older than 60 years in the age-inclusive observational databases (n = 549). To estimate the reduction in the rate of recurrent stroke associated with PFO closure vs medical therapy based on the RoPE score and the presence of high-risk PFO features, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was developed on the RCT data in the SCOPE database (n = 3,740). These estimates were used to calculate sample sizes required for a future RCT.

Results

Five-year risk of stroke recurrence using Kaplan-Meier estimates was 13.7 (95% CI 10.5–17.9) overall, 14.9% (95% CI 10.2–21.6) in those with high-risk PFO features. Predicted relative reduction in the event rate with PFO closure was 12.9% overall, 48.8% in those with a high-risk PFO feature. Using these estimates, enrolling all older patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO would require much larger samples than those used for prior PFO closure trials, but selectively enrolling patients with high-risk PFO features would require totals of 630 patients for 90% power and 471 patients for 80% power, with an average of 5 years of follow-up.

Discussion

Based on our projections, anticipated effect sizes in older patients with high-risk features make a trial in these subjects feasible. With lengthening life expectancy in almost all regions of the world, the utility of PFO closure in older adults is increasingly important to explore.

### An index to identify stroke-related vs incidental patent foramen ovale in cryptogenic stroke [^111irv4V]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to create an index to stratify cryptogenic stroke (CS) patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) by their likelihood that the stroke was related to their PFO.

Methods

Using data from 12 component studies, we used generalized linear mixed models to predict the presence of PFO among patients with CS, and derive a simple index to stratify patients with CS. We estimated the stratum-specific PFO-attributable fraction and stratum-specific stroke/TIA recurrence rates.

Results

Variables associated with a PFO in CS patients included younger age, the presence of a cortical stroke on neuroimaging, and the absence of these factors: diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and prior stroke or TIA. The 10-point Risk of Paradoxical Embolism score is calculated from these variables so that the youngest patients with superficial strokes and without vascular risk factors have the highest score. PFO prevalence increased from 23% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19%-26%) in those with 0 to 3 points to 73% (95% CI: 66%-79%) in those with 9 or 10 points, corresponding to attributable fraction estimates of approximately 0% to 90%. Kaplan-Meier estimated stroke/TIA 2-year recurrence rates decreased from 20% (95% CI: 12%-28%) in the lowest Risk of Paradoxical Embolism score stratum to 2% (95% CI: 0%-4%) in the highest.

Conclusion

Clinical characteristics identify CS patients who vary markedly in PFO prevalence, reflecting clinically important variation in the probability that a discovered PFO is likely to be stroke-related vs incidental. Patients in strata more likely to have stroke-related PFOs have lower recurrence risk.

### Effect of medical treatment in stroke patients with patent foramen ovale: patent foramen ovale in cryptogenic stroke study [^1125AeRe]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with stroke, but there are no randomized studies to evaluate the efficacy of antithrombotic therapies.

Methods and Results

The PFO in Cryptogenic Stroke Study was a 42-center study that evaluated transesophageal echocardiographic findings in patients randomly assigned to warfarin or aspirin in the Warfarin-Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study. In this study, 630 stroke patients were enrolled, of whom 312 (49.5%) were randomized to warfarin and 318 (50.5%) to aspirin. Of these, 265 patients experienced cryptogenic stroke and 365 experienced known stroke subtypes. End points were recurrent ischemic stroke or death. PFO was present in 203 patients (33.8%). There was no significant difference in the time to primary end points between those with and those without PFO in the overall population (P = 0.84; hazard ratio 0.96; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48; 2-year event rates 14.8% versus 15.4%) or in the cryptogenic subset (P = 0.65; hazard ratio 1.17; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.37; 2-year event rates 14.3% versus 12.7%). There was no significant difference among those with no, small, or large PFO (P = 0.41 for small PFO and P = 0.16 for large PFO; 2-year event rates for no, small, and large PFO, 15.4%, 18.5%, and 9.5%, respectively). There was no significant difference between patients with isolated PFO and those with PFO in association with atrial septal aneurysm (P = 0.84; 2-year event rates 14.5% versus 15.9%). In patients with PFO, there was no significant difference in the time to primary end points between those treated with warfarin and those treated with aspirin (P = 0.49; hazard ratio 1.29; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.64; 2-year event rates 16.5% versus 13.2%).

Conclusions

On medical therapy, the presence of PFO in stroke patients did not increase the chance of adverse events regardless of PFO size or the presence of atrial septal aneurysm.

### Patent foramen ovale closure versus medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke: an updated meta-analysis [^112f6Uf6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for secondary stroke prevention in cryptogenic stroke (CS) patients with PFO is uncertain. This meta-analysis aims to assess whether PFO closure is superior to medical therapy.

Methods

Pooled estimates were calculated using Revman 5.3. The two primary endpoints were stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter, major bleeding and any adverse event.

Results

Five randomized controlled trials were included. A total of 3440 patients were randomized to either PFO closure (n = 1829) or medical therapy group (n = 1611) and followed for average 2.0–5.9 years. PFO closure reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke in CS patients with PFO compared to medical therapy (Risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.20–0.91, P = 0.03; hazard ratio (HR) 0.34, 95% CI 0.15–0.78, p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between the two groups in TIA (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53–1.15, P = 0.21; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.49–1.09, p = 0.12), all-cause mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.35–1.63, P = 0.48), major bleeding (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.42–2.20, P = 0.93) and any adverse event (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95–1.18, P = 0.29). Higher risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter was found in closure group (RR 4.69, 95% CI 2.17–10.12, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

PFO closure combined with medical therapy showed superiority over medical therapy alone for stroke prevention in carefully selected CS patients with PFO, but increased the risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter.

### Patent foramen ovale and long-term risk of ischaemic stroke after surgery [^114MhdBy]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Pre-operatively diagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke within 30days after surgery. This study aimed to assess the PFO-attributable ischaemic stroke risk beyond the perioperative period.

Methods and Results

This observational study of adult patients without history of stroke undergoing non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia examined the association of PFO with ischaemic stroke 1 and 2 years after surgery using multivariable logistic regression. Of the 144 563 patients included, a total of 1642 (1.1%) and 2376 (1.6%) ischaemic strokes occurred within 1 and 2 years after surgery, 54 (4.7%) and 76 (6.6%) among patients with PFO, and 1588 (1.1%) and 2300 (1.6%) among patients without PFO, respectively. The odds of ischaemic stroke within 1 and 2 years after surgery were increased in patients with PFO: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51–2.69; P < 0.001 and aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.64–2.68; P < 0.001, respectively. Among patients who underwent contrast transoesophageal echocardiography, the frequency of PFO was 27%, and the increased stroke risk in patients with PFO was robust (aOR 3.80, 95% CI 1.76–8.23; P = 0.001 for year 1). The PFO-attributable risk was mitigated by post-operative prescription of combination antithrombotic therapy (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.22–0.75; P for interaction = 0.004).

Conclusion

Patients with PFO are vulnerable to ischaemic stroke for an extended period of time after surgery. Physicians should consider implementing PFO screening protocols in patients scheduled for major non-cardiac surgery.

### Uncertainties and controversies in the management of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack patients with patent foramen ovale [^111h56RA]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of patent foramen ovale closure over medical therapy alone for patients who have had a stroke that has been attributed to the patent foramen ovale. Nevertheless, there are many areas of uncertainty and controversy related to patient selection, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. We summarize the available data on these challenging topics and attempt to provide some clarity and future directions for clinicians and investigators.

### Burden of modifiable risk factors in young-onset cryptogenic ischemic stroke by high-risk patent foramen ovale [^117KMD8W]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, no studies thus far have assessed the influences of a comprehensive set of risk factors on young-onset CIS, in the context of a clinically relevant PFO, defined as those with high-risk features. In this international case-control study, we evaluated the burden and strength of association of traditional, nontraditional, and female sex–specific risk factors in young-onset CIS, stratified by the presence or absence of PFO, as well as by sex and age groups.

### Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy alone for management of cryptogenic stroke? A clinical practice guideline [^111G9uM3]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Which route — Transesophageal echocardiography has a higher sensitivity for detection of a PFO compared with transthoracic imaging and is recommended in younger adults with unexplained cerebrovascular events
Work-up of cryptogenic stroke — In addition to detection of PFO, rarer causes of embolic events include an atrial septal defect, cardiac tumours (such as myxoma or papillary fibroelastoma), bacterial or non-bacterial valve vegetations, and atrial thrombi
Detection of PFO — Microbubbles enter the right atrium, and, if a PFO is present, they pass into the left atrium within a few beats of appearance in the right atrium. Although shunting usually is predominantly left to right, there is some right to left shunting as the relative pressures in the two chambers change during the cardiac cycle and with respiration Sensitivity of saline contrast for detection of a PFO is increased by asking the patient to perform a Valsalva manoeuvre, which transiently increases right atrial pressure Estimating the size of a PFO based on the amount of contrast seen in the left atrium may be unreliable
Those with PFO at greater risk — An atrial septal aneurysm, defined as excessive bulging of atrial septal fossa ovalis, is often associated with septal fenestrations and may be a marker of increased embolic risk
Ahead of planned PFO closure — Transeophageal echocardiography is recommended for more detailed visualisation of the atrial septal anatomy when PFO closure is planned

How the recommendation was created

Our international panel included general internists, interventional and non-interventional cardiologists, stroke physicians, epidemiologists, methodologists, statisticians, and people with personal experience of cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO). They decided on the scope of the recommendation and the outcomes that are most important to patients. The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: non-fatal ischaemic stroke, death, major bleeding, pulmonary embolism, serious procedure related or device related adverse events, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, and systemic embolism.

A parallel team conducted a systematic review addressing the benefits and harms of three patient-relevant clinical questions framed by the panel: (a) PFO closure with subsequent antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone, (b) PFO closure with subsequent antiplatelet therapy versus anticoagulation, and (c) anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy.

Values and preferences

PFO closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone

Patients for whom anticoagulation is unacceptable or contraindicated should consider PFO closure. Our strong recommendation for PFO closure for such patients reflects the high value they place on avoiding recurrent ischaemic stroke. Patients are likely to find absolute reduction of stroke with PFO closure of 8.7% in five years important. Although 3.6% experience serious device or procedure related adverse events, these do not usually result in long term disability, and so we considered them less important. Persistent atrial fibrillation after PFO closure procedure might be a concern; however, the main adverse consequence of atrial fibrillation is increased risk of stroke, which was already shown to be substantially lower in patients randomised to PFO closure.

PFO closure followed by antiplatelet therapy versus anticoagulation

The major downsides of PFO closure are the 3.6% incidence of complications from the procedure and the probable 1.8% absolute increase in persistent atrial fibrillation. The major downside of anticoagulation is the probable 2.0% absolute increase in bleeding risk over five years. Other issues to consider are the burden and costs of long term anticoagulation. Our weak recommendation for PFO closure reflects (in addition to the low certainty in the estimates of effect) that most serious complications of PFO closure are usually short term, whereas anticoagulation imposes a long term burden and increased risk of major bleeding. Most fully informed patients would probably accept the transient risk of major adverse events rather than the long term bleeding risk, but a substantial minority would probably choose anticoagulation.

Anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy

Patients to whom PFO closure is unacceptable or contraindicated have to choose between anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. A typical patient places a high value in a possible absolute reduction of stroke with anticoagulation of 7.1% over five years and would therefore place higher value on the possible benefit of stroke reduction than the probable increased risk of major bleeding. A systematic reviewand a primary studyof values and preferences on thromboprophylaxis treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation showed that, though preferences were highly variable, most patients value preventing strokes considerably more than they are concerned about increased risk of bleeding. However, there is substantial uncertainty in our estimates for stroke reduction — how this uncertainty would influence decisions is likely to vary substantially. Therefore, we issue a weak recommendation for anticoagulation. Both options need to be discussed with the patient, ideally in a process of shared decision making.

### Burden of modifiable risk factors in young-onset cryptogenic ischemic stroke by high-risk patent foramen ovale [^111MSVYH]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs for the association of each incremental traditional, nontraditional, and female sex–specific risk factor with cryptogenic ischemic stroke (CIS) in the entire cohort and by sex and age group, stratified by the presence of high-risk patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients. All models were adjusted for demographics and other risk factor count(s), except the models including traditional risk factors alone. *Fully adjusted models.

Regarding risk factors in patients with CIS with PFO, the association of the count of traditional risk factors was significant only in models adjusted for demographics in the overall cohort, across sexes, and in the younger age group, while further adjustment attenuated this association. In contrast, nontraditional risk factors showed consistently strong associations in the overall cohort (odds ratio, 2.7 [95% CI, 2.0–3.5]) and across demographic subgroups. Furthermore, each additional female sex–specific risk factor increased the odds of CIS with PFO by 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2–3.0; Figure 2). We found no interactions between age or sex and count of traditional risk factors (P for interaction = 0.805 and P for interaction = 0.541, respectively), and no interactions between age or sex and count of nontraditional risk factors (P = 0.069 and P = 0.991, respectively).

PFO diagnoses

To evaluate the rise in PFO detection during the study period, we conducted Cochran–Armitage tests at the univariate level. Furthermore, we compared PFO detection before (2016–2017) and after (2019–2021) the update in clinical guidelines (2018) using a χ² test. Confidence intervals for proportions were calculated using a method described by Wilson et al.

We continued doing multivariate analyses in which the presence or absence of PFO was considered as a binomial variable. Hence, we employed multivariate logistic regression models with PFO diagnosis as the dependent variable at the patient-level and dichotomous time (2016–2017 vs 2019–2021) as the independent predictor of interest. This model was adjusted for continuous age to address demographic differences across periods. Besides, we conducted an additional model considering the entire study period from 2016 to 2021, where the year was introduced as a continuous variable in exchange of dichotomic time. This model tested whether existed a linear increase in PFO diagnosis over the full follow-up. Finally, to explore potential non-linear relationships, we incorporated year as an ordinal variable and employed backward difference contrasts. This method enabled us to compare the average proportion of diagnosed PFO between consecutive years and assess any deviations from linear trends. These analyses were stratified by the sanitary region although we excluded the Pirineu region due to its small population size and low stroke incidence and, thus, we could not calculate confidence interval for this territory.

We also tested whether the effect of time, either as a dichotomic, continuous or ordinal variable, on PFO diagnosis was influenced by relevant demographic variables, such as age, sex and sanitary region. To that aim, we modeled the interaction between time and these predictors.

We also examined whether the increase in PFO diagnoses was consistent across all age groups and sex. After studying the interaction term between time and age group, we confirmed there was no moderation of age on the relationship between time and PFO diagnosis (OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.99–1.02], p value = 0.416; Fig. 2 C and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Although no significant interaction between sex and categorical time was observed, the increase in PFO detection following the update in clinical guidelines was higher in men (OR 1.38 [95% CI 0.98–1.96], p value = 0.070; Fig. 2 D and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Regional distribution

We proceeded to evaluate the impact of the updated clinical guidelines on each sanitary region in Catalonia. Most regions showed an increase in the detection of PFO following the update of clinical guidelines, with only Lleida and Penedès locations showing stability or decrease (supplementary Fig. 5-A). Although the interaction between region and time did not yield statistical significance (F = 0.57, Df = 9; p value = 0.825; Supplementary Tables 6 and 7), we visually depicted the linear relationship between time and prevalence of PFO diagnosis on the map of Catalonia, reaffirming a widespread increase in PFO detection across most Sanitary regions over time (supplementary Fig. 5-B).

Stroke recurrence

To study the incidence of recurrent stroke, we analyzed a subset of the cohort consisting of 9180 individuals without prior history of ischemic stroke and who had a valid follow-up within the 3 months after stroke onset. In the Supplementary Table 8, we compare the baseline characteristics of patients included in the sub-study with those who were excluded. Notably, the included patients were slightly older and exhibited a higher prevalence of risk factors compared to the excluded group. The median follow-up duration was 3.1 years (IQR 1.5–5.0 years), encompassing a total of 27,758.8 patient-years. Over this period, there were 917 (9.99%) stroke recurrences, representing a 5-year incidence of 12.1% [95% CI 11.3–12.9]; supplementary Fig. 6).

### Patent foramen ovale-associated stroke… [^114DSt3w]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A patent foramen ovale is present in approximately 25% of all adults. Author David M. Kent, MD, MS, of Tufts Medical Center and JAMA Associate Editor David Simel, MD, MHS, discuss how to evaluate the likelihood that a PFO was causal in a patient with a cryptogenic ischemic stroke, and closure of a PFO to lower the incidence of recurrent strokes for affected patients. Simel: So how is the PFO itself associated with the stroke. Kent: So the association arises through a mechanism we call paradoxical embolism. And the embolism is called paradoxical because a stroke is typically caused by an arterial blockage, an arterial clot. But a paradoxical embolism arises from a clot in the venous system. And the embolism comes off and it gains access to the arterial circulation through a right-to-left shunt, in this case through a PFO, the most common cause of right-to-left shunt.

And therefore, if we find the PFO, given the fact that the contrast between that and the 25% in the general population, we can be pretty confident that the PFO is the cause of the stroke in such a patient. Now, the RoPE score is not perfect. It's not totally comprehensive. The one thing that it doesn't include is any of the anatomic or physiologic features of the PFO itself. So a large PFO is much more likely to be pathogenically related to the stroke than a small PFO. And a PFO with an atrial septal aneurysm is also more likely to be pathogenically associated with a stroke than one without. So PASCAL incorporates all the characteristics we just spoke about in order to estimate the overall probability that the stroke can be attributed to the PFO. Simel: Tell me what you mean by closure. Kent: So, you know, closure is really the therapy that's recommended to prevent recurrent stroke in well-selected people with PFO-associated stroke.

It reduces the risk of a recurrent stroke by maybe around 60% on average within the trials. Closure is achieved by percutaneously introducing a device typically into the femoral vein and introducing it up into the right atrium across the PFO and into the left atrium and then deploying the device such that the PFO is closed. Simel: Why not just close a PFO in all patients who have an ischemic stroke and where you find a PFO.

### Patent foramen ovale closure-harnessing clinical trial evidence to inform individualized treatment decisions… [^112uQyBc]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

According to some estimates, approximately one-quarter of the general US population has a patent foramen ovale. 1 With such a high prevalence, clinicians frequently attempt to determine whether a PFO has had a causal role among patients who experience an unexplained stroke, and whether closing the PFO might reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Several randomized clinical trials have compared the outcomes of PFO closure vs treatment with antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents. 2–5 In 2016, the American Academy of Neurology conducted a systematic review of 3 trials and concluded that clinicians "should not routinely offer percutaneous PFO closure to patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke outside of a research setting". 6 However, these guidelines were revised 4 years later following the publication of 4 additional studies that demonstrated significant reductions in recurrent stroke after PFO closure compared with medical treatment.

Currently, PFO closure may be recommended for patients younger than 60 years with "embolic-appearing infarct and no other mechanism of stroke identified… following a discussion of potential benefits… and risks.

### NCT05387954 | PFO closure, oral anticoagulants or… [^111wqzzZ]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

PFO Closure, Oral Anticoagulants or Antiplatelet Therapy After PFO-associated Stroke in Patients Aged 60 to 80 Years ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The CLOSE trial has unambiguously demonstrated the superiority of patent foramen ovale closure over antiplatelet therapy alone in patients aged up to 60 years with a PFO associated with an atrial septal aneurysm or a large right-to-left shunt, and an otherwise unexplained ischemic stroke. Oral anticoagulant therapy is also a logical approach assuming that PFO-related strokes are due to paradoxical embolism which implies a venous source of embolism, or to direct embolization of a thrombus formed at the atrial level. The CLOSE trial also suggested that oral anticoagulants might reduce stroke recurrence compared to aspirin. There is accumulating evidence that presence of a PFO is significantly associated with cryptogenic stroke in patients over 60 years.

Cryptogenic ischemic strokes represent about one third of all ischemic strokes in patients older than 60 years. However, the optimal therapeutic strategy in patients older than 60 years with a PFO and an otherwise unexplained ischemic stroke is unknown, because these patients were excluded from randomized trials. The hypothesis tested in this trial is that transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy is superior to antiplatelet therapy alone and that oral anticoagulant therapy is superior to antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in patients aged 60 to 80 years who have a high-risk PFO and a recent otherwise unexplained ischemic stroke.

Presence of a PFO with at least 1 of the 2 following characteristics:

- PFO with large shunt > 20 microbubbles appearing in the left atrium during at least one of the 3 cardiac cycles after opacification of the right atrium, detected spontaneously or during provocative manoeuvers, on contrast transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography. The diagnosis of PFO by contrast TEE must be confirmed by contrast TOE showing a right-to-left passage of the contrast material across the PFO.
