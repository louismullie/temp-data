## Question

Depakote liquid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Depakote liquid, including what it is, how it differs from other formulations, dosing, administration, pharmacokinetics, safety, and practical pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether a true "Depakote liquid" exists and clarify the formulation landscape. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic differences and their clinical implications. Next, I will review dosing principles across indications and special populations. After that, I need to check administration instructions, drug–drug interactions, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical pearls and a bottom-line recommendation, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the formulation question, because I need to ensure I'm not mislabeling a product. Depakote is the brand for divalproex sodium, which is a delayed-release tablet; there is no FDA-labeled "Depakote liquid", though valproic acid oral solution (sometimes called syrup) exists and is pharmacologically related but not identical in formulation or excipients, so I should not conflate them even though clinicians may colloquially say "liquid Depakote" when they mean valproic acid solution [^5690c807] [^a1644ecd].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic implications of formulation differences before drawing conclusions. Multiple FDA labels state that while Tmax and Cmax can vary among oral formulations (liquid, solid, sprinkle), total systemic bioavailability at steady state is similar across equivalent total daily doses, so chronic seizure control should be comparable if total daily exposure is matched; however, early in therapy or during switches, rate differences can matter clinically, so I should be cautious during initiation and titration [^c5f47b2d] [^6e5d9dda] [^a1644ecd].

> I will now examine dosing principles, but hold on, I should verify whether the indication changes the starting paradigm. For epilepsy, typical initiation uses 10–15 mg/kg/day, titrated by 5–10 mg/kg/week toward a maintenance range often below 60 mg/kg/day, with therapeutic troughs commonly cited as 50–100 mcg/mL; for absence seizures, some labels start at 15 mg/kg/day, and for mania, fixed starting doses around 750 mg/day in divided doses are standard, with targets of 50–125 mcg/mL in acute mania trials; for migraine prophylaxis, 250–500 mg/day is typical, with a usual range of 500–1,000 mg/day, and I should confirm that these ranges align with FDA and guideline sources before concluding [^ec0d8407] [^31385aa8] [^5690c807] [^35629c88] [^ce59ab58] [^dda9783b].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and safety thresholds. In older adults, start low and go slow due to reduced clearance and higher somnolence risk; in hepatic disease, valproate is contraindicated; in renal impairment, no routine dose adjustment is needed, but protein binding shifts can increase the free fraction, so clinical monitoring is prudent; thrombocytopenia risk rises with total valproate concentrations above about 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males, so I should keep those thresholds in mind when pushing doses [^5dc008e1] [^8633d1a9] [^8c138b55] [^ec0d8407].

> Next, I should review administration and missed-dose guidance, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize from tablets to a hypothetical liquid. For Depakote delayed-release tablets, swallow whole and do not crush or chew; if a dose is missed, take it as soon as remembered unless it's close to the next dose, and do not double up; for valproic acid oral solution, dosing is by calibrated device and can be mixed with small amounts of liquid or soft food to improve palatability, but I should confirm product-specific instructions before advising mixing or flavoring [^5690c807] [^a1644ecd].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that materially change practice. Valproate inhibits metabolism of phenobarbital and can raise levels, risking CNS depression; it inhibits ethosuximide metabolism; it can precipitate absence status with clonazepam in susceptible patients; it increases lamotrigine levels and the risk of serious rash, so lamotrigine dose must be reduced; enzyme inducers like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital increase valproate clearance and may lower levels; and with sodium oxybate, co-administration increases GHB exposure and impairs cognition, so oxybate dose should be reduced by about 20% when starting valproate, with close monitoring [^c271ca00] [^ac42f273] [^d614efaa] [^42bda8f9].

> Let me consider monitoring and safety labs, and I should confirm the cadence. Baseline CBC, LFTs, and ammonia are reasonable; during titration, check levels about 3–5 days after a dose change; once stable, periodic CBC and LFTs every 3–6 months are typical, with more frequent checks if symptoms arise; in acute mania, targeting troughs of 50–125 mcg/mL is evidence-based, whereas for epilepsy, 50–100 mcg/mL is commonly used, recognizing that clinical response varies and some patients are controlled outside that range [^4d699488] [^ce59ab58] [^ec0d8407].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot swallow tablets or has short bowel syndrome; I need to ensure formulation choice matches anatomy. In short bowel or malabsorption, avoid delayed- or extended-release formulations and prefer liquids or immediate-release forms, with consideration of level monitoring to guide absorption and dose; sprinkle capsules can be an alternative when tablets are not feasible, though they are still delayed-release and may be less predictable in altered GI anatomy [^94f643db] [^a1644ecd].

> I should confirm pregnancy and teratogenicity counseling, because this is non-negotiable. Valproate is contraindicated in pregnancy due to neural tube defects and neurodevelopmental risks; in women of childbearing potential, use effective contraception and consider alternatives when possible; if used, employ the lowest effective dose and consider folate supplementation, with shared decision-making and documentation of risks [^c89b4b25].

> Let me synthesize practical pearls, and I will sanity-check each against the evidence. Total daily exposure drives seizure control more than peak/trough fluctuations, so matching total daily dose across formulations is key; when switching from delayed-release to extended-release, expect to need roughly 8–20% more total daily dose to achieve similar troughs; oral loading strategies can achieve therapeutic levels within 2–3 days in mania but require inpatient monitoring; and always reassess adherence, interactions, and organ function when response is suboptimal before escalating dose [^c5f47b2d] [^afde4fa2] [^b27ae26a] [^630020df].

> Bottom line, I should be precise: there is no FDA-approved "Depakote liquid". If a liquid is needed, valproic acid oral solution is the appropriate alternative, with the caveat that while total bioavailability at steady state is similar to divalproex, absorption kinetics differ, so clinical vigilance during initiation and switches is essential. Dose by indication, titrate to response and tolerability, monitor levels when appropriate, and maintain robust safety surveillance for hematologic, hepatic, and teratogenic risks [^a1644ecd] [^c5f47b2d] [^ec0d8407] [^ce59ab58].

Depakote liquid is a **valproate oral solution** used for epilepsy, bipolar mania, and migraine prevention, with dosing individualized by indication, age, and weight. It offers **flexible titration** and rapid absorption, but requires careful monitoring for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and teratogenicity. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, sedation, and tremor; serious risks include liver failure, pancreatitis, and fetal harm. Use is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease, urea cycle disorders, or hypersensitivity to valproate.

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Valproate increases GABA, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, and modulates glutamate, reducing neuronal excitability.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid oral absorption with peak levels in 1–4 hours; protein binding ~90% (lower in elderly, hepatic/renal impairment); hepatic metabolism with half-life 9–16 hours (longer in neonates, elderly, hepatic impairment).

- **Formulation**: Liquid allows flexible dosing and is useful for patients who cannot swallow tablets.

---

## Clinical indications

Depakote liquid is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|
| Epilepsy | - Complex partial seizures <br/> - Simple and complex absence seizures <br/> - Multiple seizure types including absence seizures [^aa419e16] [^ec0d8407] |
| Bipolar disorder | Manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder [^aa419e16] [^5690c807] |
| Migraine prophylaxis | Prevention of migraine headaches [^aa419e16] [^35629c88] |

---

## Dosage and administration

Dosing is **individualized** by indication, age, weight, and clinical response:

- **Epilepsy**: Start 10–15 mg/kg/day, titrate by 5–10 mg/kg/week to 10–60 mg/kg/day; divide doses if > 250 mg/day [^ec0d8407] [^31385aa8].

- **Bipolar mania**: Start 750 mg/day in divided doses, titrate to 50–125 mcg/mL trough [^5690c807] [^ce59ab58].

- **Migraine prophylaxis**: Start 250 mg twice daily, titrate to 500–1,000 mg/day [^b4fba196] [^35629c88].

- **Elderly**: Reduce starting dose and titrate slowly due to higher free fractions and sensitivity to sedation [^5dc008e1].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

### Common adverse effects

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

- **CNS**: Sedation, dizziness, tremor, ataxia.

- **Metabolic**: Weight gain, hyperammonemia.

---

### Serious adverse effects

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Risk is highest in children < 2 years and those with mitochondrial disorders; monitor LFTs [^8c11d189].

- **Pancreatitis**: Potentially fatal; monitor for abdominal pain and elevated lipase/amylase.

- **Teratogenicity**: Neural tube defects and neurodevelopmental impairment; avoid in pregnancy [^c89b4b25].

- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include hepatic disease, urea cycle disorders, mitochondrial disorders, and hypersensitivity to valproate. Precautions include use in the **elderly** (start low, go slow), in **pregnancy** (avoid if possible), and in patients with bleeding disorders or **concomitant enzyme-inducing drugs** (may lower valproate levels) [^8633d1a9] [^c89b4b25] [^7b477a27].

---

## Drug interactions

- **Enzyme inducers**: Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital reduce valproate levels [^7b477a27].

- **Enzyme inhibitors**: Valproate inhibits metabolism of lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and ethosuximide, increasing their levels [^c271ca00].

- **CNS depressants**: Additive sedation with benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol.

---

## Monitoring and clinical considerations

- **Baseline labs**: LFTs, CBC, platelets, ammonia, pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential [^d60a9706].

- **Routine monitoring**: LFTs and CBC every 3–6 months; trough valproate levels for epilepsy/bipolar mania (target 50–100 mcg/mL) [^4d699488].

- **Patient counseling**: Adherence, signs of hepatotoxicity/pancreatitis, pregnancy planning, and alcohol avoidance [^5690c807].

---

Depakote liquid is a **versatile valproate formulation** for epilepsy, bipolar mania, and migraine prevention, offering flexible dosing but requiring vigilant monitoring for serious adverse effects and drug interactions.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Depakote may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Depakote tablets are intended for oral administration. Depakote tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or chewed.

Patients should be informed to take Depakote every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.

2.1 Mania

Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended initial dose is 750 mg daily in divided doses. The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic dose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to a clinical response with a trough plasma concentration between 50 and 125 mcg/mL. Maximum concentrations were generally achieved within 14 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.

There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer term management of a patient who improves during Depakote treatment of an acute manic episode. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no data to support the benefits of Depakote in such longer-term treatment. Although there are no efficacy data that specifically address longer-term antimanic treatment with Depakote, the safety of Depakote in long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated with Depakote for greater than 3 months.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption/Bioavailability

Equivalent oral doses of Depakote (divalproex sodium) products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.

However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in Tmaxand Cmaxcould be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the tablet (increase in Tmaxfrom 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the sprinkle capsules (increase in Tmaxfrom 3.3 to 4.8 hours).

While the absorption rate from the G. I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Whether or not rate of absorption influences the efficacy of valproate as an antimanic or antimigraine agent is unknown.

2.2 Epilepsy

Depakote tablets are administered orally. Depakote is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. As the Depakote dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Complex Partial Seizures

For adults and children 10 years of age or older.

Monotherapy (Initial Therapy)

Depakote has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

2.4 General Dosing Advice

Dosing in Elderly Patients

Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose-Related Adverse Reactions

The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

G. I. Irritation

Patients who experience G. I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level.

2.5 Dosing in Patients Taking Rufinamide

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

---

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^a37d41fd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Co-administration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various Depakote and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations.

Distribution

Protein Binding

The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs].

CNS Distribution

Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).

Metabolism

Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30–50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15–20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

### Divalproex sodium [^acfac618]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Adjunctive Therapy

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

 Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

The dosage of divalproex sodium DR PO for treatment of bipolar disorder in adults (manic episodes) is 750 mg PO daily, in 2–3 divided doses

---

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodium extended-release) [^0a7b084c]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear.

Elimination

Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2and 11 L/1.73 m2, respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m2and 92 L/1.73 m2. Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1,000 mg.

The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.

Specific Populations

Effect of Age

Neonates

Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months.

1.1 Mania

Depakote (divalproex sodium) is a valproate and is indicated for the treatment of the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility.

The efficacy of Depakote was established in 3-week trials with patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of Depakote for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use Depakote for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

1.2 Epilepsy

Depakote is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Depakote is also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.

Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.

1.3 Migraine

Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that Depakote is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches.

### Comparative absorption profiles of divalproex sodium delayed-release versus extended-release tablets – clinical implications [^0ede0ab5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The distinct absorption characteristics of the conventional enteric-coated, delayed-release (DR) and the novel extended-release (ER) divalproex sodium formulations are not well recognized.

Objective

To quantitatively and qualitatively differentiate the absorption characteristics of divalproex-DR and -ER formulations.

Methods

Healthy volunteers (N = 28) received single 1000 mg doses of divalproex-DR and divalproex-ER tablets in a crossover fashion. Noncompartmental and compartmental analyses were used to estimate valproic acid (VPA) pharmacokinetics from the plasma concentration-time profiles determined from intensive blood sampling over 48 hours.

Results

VPA was not absorbed from divalproex-DR in the first 2 hours (absorption lag-time) after dosing. After VPA release in the intestine, approximately 63% of the dose was absorbed in less than 1 hour, that is, 2.9 hours (mean absorption time) from dosing. Maximum concentration (C(max)) was achieved approximately 4 hours after dosing. VPA absorption was complete (approximately 93% of dose) within 3 absorption half-lives (approximately 4.5 h) post-absorption lag-time, that is, 6–7 hours from dosing. In contrast, VPA absorption from divalproex-ER starts immediately after administration, initially at a modest rate, followed by slow and extended absorption at a constant rate for more than 20 hours; VPA concentrations at 1 and 2 hours were 28% and 40% of C(max). Approximately 53% of the dose was absorbed within 12 hours (mean absorption time); complete absorption occurred over more than 20 hours without any dose dumping.

Conclusions

VPA absorption from enteric-coated divalproex-DR is rapid following a lag-time of approximately 2 hours and is complete within 6–7 hours of dosing. In contrast, VPA absorption from divalproex-ER starts immediately after administration, but occurs at a slow, approximately constant rate over more than 20 hours.

Lamotrigine

In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase). The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration. See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine dosing with concomitant valproate administration.

Phenobarbital

Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose). The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.

There is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption/Bioavailability Equivalent oral doses of divalproex sodium products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.

However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in Tmaxand Cmaxcould be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the tablet (increase in Tmaxfrom 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the sprinkle capsules (increase in Tmaxfrom 3.3 to 4.8 hours).

While the absorption rate from the G. I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Whether or not rate of absorption influences the efficacy of valproate as an antimanic or antimigraine agent is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption/Bioavailability

The absolute bioavailability of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets administered as a single dose after a meal was approximately 90% relative to intravenous infusion.

When given in equal total daily doses, the bioavailability of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are less than that of divalproex sodium tablets. In five multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects (N = 82) and in subjects with epilepsy (N = 86), when administered under fasting and nonfasting conditions, divalproex sodium extended-release tablets given once daily produced an average bioavailability of 89% relative to an equal total daily dose of divalproex sodium tablets given BID, TID, or QID. The median time to maximum plasma valproate concentrations (Cmax) after divalproex sodium extended-release tablets administration ranged from 4 to 17 hours. After multiple once-daily dosing of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets, the peak-to-trough fluctuation in plasma valproate concentrations was 10–20% lower than that of regular divalproex sodium tablets given BID, TID, or QID.

Conversion from Divalproex Sodium Tablets to Divalproex Sodium Extended-Release Tablets

When divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are given in doses 8 to 20% higher than the total daily dose of divalproex sodium tablets, the two formulations are bioequivalent. In two randomized, crossover studies, multiple daily doses of divalproex sodium tablets were compared to 8 to 20% higher once-daily doses of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets. In these two studies, divalproex sodium extended-release tablets and divalproex sodium tablets regimens were equivalent with respect to area under the curve (AUC; a measure of the extent of bioavailability). Additionally, valproate Cmaxwas lower, and Cminwas either higher or not different, for divalproex sodium extended-release tablets relative to divalproex sodium tablets regimens (see Table 9).

### Pilot comparison of extended-release and standard preparations of divalproex sodium in patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders [^edb4787a]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors compared the new extended-release and standard preparations of divalproex sodium.

Method

Twelve patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically stable while taking the standard form of divalproex participated in the study. These patients were given a single daily dose of the extended-release preparation of divalproex in an open 6-week trial. Clinical symptoms and adverse effects were rated weekly. Doses were adjusted to maintain steady serum valproate concentrations.

Results

The medication change was associated with negligible changes in clinical status and tolerability. To maintain serum drug levels, however, 21% higher doses of the extended-release preparation were required.

Conclusions

Use of extended-release divalproex once a day was as well tolerated as the standard preparation, with no change in efficacy within 6 weeks, but the daily dose needed to maintain stable serum valproic acid concentration was 21% higher.

Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.

Clonazepam

The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures.

Diazepam

Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.

Ethosuximide

Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.

Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets once daily doses ranged from 250–1750 mg. Once daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (10–17 years) produced plasma VPA concentration-time profiles similar to those that have been observed in adults.

The recommended starting dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is one-half of the original dosage per night, administered orally divided into two doses [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustment with Co-administration of Divalproex Sodium

When initiating divalproex sodium in patients taking a stable dosage of sodium oxybate oral solution, a reduction of the sodium oxybate oral solution dosage by at least 20% is recommended with initial concomitant use [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When initiating sodium oxybate oral solution in patients already taking divalproex sodium, a lower starting dosage of sodium oxybate oral solution is recommended. Subsequently, the dosage of sodium oxybate oral solution can be adjusted based on individual clinical response and tolerability.

Data

Human

In a published study, breast milk and maternal blood samples were obtained from 11 epilepsy patients taking valproate at doses ranging from 300 mg/day to 2,400 mg/day on postnatal days 3 to 6. In 4 patients who were taking valproate only, breast milk contained an average valproate concentration of 1.8 mcg/mL (range: 1.1 mcg/mL to 2.2 mcg/mL), which corresponded to 4.8% of the maternal plasma concentration (range: 2.7% to 7.4%). Across all patients (7 of whom were taking other AEDs concomitantly), similar results were obtained for breast milk concentration (1.8 mcg/mL, range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL) and maternal plasma ratio (5.1%, range: 1.3% to 9.6%).

A published study of 6 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs measured serum valproate levels during maternal treatment for bipolar disorder (750 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day). None of the mothers received valproate during pregnancy, and infants were aged from 4 weeks to 19 weeks at the time of evaluation. Infant serum levels ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 1.5 mcg/mL. With maternal serum valproate levels near or within the therapeutic range, infant exposure was 0.9% to 2.3% of maternal levels. Similarly, in 2 published case reports with maternal doses of 500 mg/day or 750 mg/day during breastfeeding of infants aged 3 months and 1 month, infant exposure was 1.5% and 6% that of the mother, respectively.

A prospective observational multicenter study evaluated the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of AED use on children. Pregnant women receiving monotherapy for epilepsy were enrolled with assessments of their children at ages 3 years and 6 years. Mothers continued AED therapy during the breastfeeding period. Adjusted IQs measured at 3 years for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 93 (n = 11) and 90 (n = 24), respectively. At 6 years, the scores for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 106 (n = 11) and 94 (n = 25), respectively (p = 0.04). For other cognitive domains evaluated at 6 years, no adverse cognitive effects of continued exposure to an AED (including valproate) via breast milk were observed.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of divalproex sodium extended-release in the acute treatment of mania [^d6c6dba9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Divalproex sodium extended-release (ER) was examined for the treatment of acute mania in adults in 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. One study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in mania symptoms compared to placebo, while an earlier study did not. Results of the earlier study are presented here.

Method

A total of 225 DSM-IV-diagnosed bipolar I disorder patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 21 days of double-blind treatment with divalproex ER (n = 147) or placebo (n = 78). The daily divalproex ER dosage was initiated at 20 mg/kg. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to final evaluation in Mania Rating Scale (MRS) score. Subjects were discontinued from the study if they were discharged from the hospital or if they met prespecified improvement criteria. The study was conducted from May 1998 to July 1999 at centers in the United States.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in MRS score change from baseline to final for patients treated with divalproex ER compared with those treated with placebo. With the exception of back pain and constipation, adverse event rates between placebo and divalproex ER were very similar. A large proportion of patients prematurely discontinued study treatment (divalproex ER: 83%, placebo: 82%). The mean daily dose of divalproex ER was 2,211 mg with a mean maximum serum valproic acid concentration of 77.9 microg/mL.

Conclusions

The results of the current study did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in mania symptoms associated with divalproex ER treatment compared to placebo. A number of methodological considerations may have contributed to the negative findings, including allowance for early study discontinuation and lower than optimal dosing.

### A pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of switching patients with bipolar I disorder from delayed-release to extended-release divalproex [^8dc2cc5f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimal strategy for converting stable bipolar patients from twice-daily divalproex delayed release (DR) to once-daily divalproex extended release (ER).

Method

This prospective, open-label, crossover study compared 4 divalproex regimens in euthymic outpatients with bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV diagnosis confirmed by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Serum valproic acid levels were collected 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the last bedtime dose of the following regimens: DR twice daily (DR b.i.d.) during week 1; total daily DR dose once daily (DR q.h.s.) during week 2; once-daily ER at equal daily DR dose (ER 1:1) during week 3; and once-daily ER with the dose increased by 500 mg (ER + 500) during week 4. Patients continued on ER + 500 for 4 additional weeks after the pharmacokinetic phase. Side effects and psychiatric symptoms were assessed at weeks 1 through 4, 6, and 8. Twenty-one patients were enrolled from July 2002 to July 2004.

Results

Of the regimens tested, DR q.h.s. produced the widest fluctuations in valproic acid levels, with the highest 12-hour (82 mug/mL) and lowest 24-hour (44 mug/mL) levels. The ER + 500 dose was the only regimen that maintained the mean minimum valproic acid concentration above 50 mug/mL. Each regimen was well tolerated, and no significant changes in psychometric indices were observed.

Conclusions

When converting stable bipolar patients from twice-daily divalproex DR to once-daily ER, we recommend increasing the total daily dose by 250 to 500 mg to ensure maintenance of therapeutic valproic acid levels.

### Lower effectiveness of divalproex versus valproic acid in a prospective, quasi-experimental clinical trial involving 9, 260 psychiatric admissions [^7939cade]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors examined clinical differences between divalproex sodium and generic immediate-release valproic acid.

Method

This 6-year prospective, quasi-experimental clinical trial compared the effectiveness and tolerability of divalproex and valproic acid. The dependent variables were length of hospital stay, rehospitalization rate, and adverse drug reactions in 9,260 psychiatric admissions.

Results

Inpatients who initially received divalproex sodium had a 32.7% longer hospital stay and 3.8% higher readmission rate than did patients who initially received valproic acid. Initial treatment with divalproex prolonged length of stay by 30.3% in patients treated with divalproex and valproic acid during different admissions. After other variables were controlled by multiway analysis of variance, the hospital stay of patients who continued the initial medication was 15.2% longer (2.0 days) for divalproex than valproic acid. Switching medications was more common for valproic acid, partly because of study design. Medication intolerance occurred in approximately 6.4% more patients taking valproic acid than divalproex. However, switching from valproic acid to divalproex did not significantly prolong length of stay, over that for continuous divalproex, or increase the rehospitalization rate.

Conclusions

Lower peak valproate concentrations with divalproex sodium may have enhanced tolerability but may also explain the lower effectiveness. Extended-release divalproex could lower effectiveness further and require higher doses. Thus, inpatients are better served by beginning with generic valproic acid and by changing to delayed-release divalproex only if intolerance occurs. This would save up to one-third of inpatient costs and two-thirds of a billion dollars yearly in medication costs.

### Delayed-onset neutropenia with divalproex sodium [^82ac2b67]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the development of neutropenia in a patient after almost 8 years of being stabilized on delayed-release divalproex sodium (DVPX).

Case Summary

A 45-year-old man had been maintained on DVPX for nearly 8 years, with serum valproic acid concentrations of 85–128 mg/L and normal white blood cell (WBC) counts and absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs). Five months prior to the development of neutropenia (defined as ANC < 1800 cells/microL), the patient's DVPX dosage was decreased by 250 mg to 1250 mg every morning and 1500 mg every evening. After 2 months of that regimen, the DVPX dosage was increased back to 1500 mg twice daily. Three months after that increase, the patient's WBC count dropped to 3.7 x 10(3)/microL and ANC was 1199 cells/microL. Although the ANC was below 1800 cells/microL, he showed no physical manifestations consistent with neutropenia. DVPX was discontinued, and 2 weeks later the patient's WBC count was 7.2 x 10(3)/microL and ANC was 2290 cells/microL.

Discussion

Although a complete blood cell count with differential is a commonly accepted form of therapeutic drug monitoring with DVPX, the monitoring is considered most necessary to identify dose-related thrombocytopenia. However, neutropenia has been rarely associated with the use of DVPX and could contribute to the development of different types of infection, including those of a bacterial, viral, or fungal origin. Although neutropenia is generally mild in severity, potentially severe DVPX-associated neutropenia can occur any time during the course of therapy, although it is most common within the first few months of treatment. In this case, DVPX was the probable cause of the neutropenia, according to the Naranjo probability scale. However, this case of neutropenia is atypical with respect to the timeframe in which it developed and was identified. Although the documented laboratory findings suggest neutropenia, the patient did not experience any clinical complications as a result. The late onset of the patient's neutropenia is unlike other cases that have been documented in the literature.

Conclusions

Hematologic therapeutic drug monitoring continues to be clinically important regardless of whether the patient is early in therapy or even years later in the course. In this patient, continued regular therapeutic drug monitoring identified a suspected drug-related complication and the medication was able to be discontinued without the development of clinical complications.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^ce59ab58]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — divalproex sodium dosing and key cautions: Formulations listed are "CA: 250 mg CS: 125 mg S: 250 mg/5 mL IV: 100 mg/ml TDR: 125 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg ET: 250 mg, 500 mg". The initial dose is "Acute mania: 750 mg/day in divided doses", with a maximum of "60 mg/kg/day". For older adults, "Initiate at lower end of dosing range". Renal dosing is "No adjustment necessary". Hepatic use is "Not recommended (Child-Pugh A or B) Contraindicated (Child-Pugh C)". Clinical considerations note it "Lacks evidence for acute bipolar depression and preventing recurrence of mania and depression", and serum monitoring guidance states "trough plasma concentration between 50 and 125 mcg/mL for acute mania".

### Valproic acid [^a1644ecd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption/Bioavailability

Equivalent oral doses of divalproex sodium products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.

However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in Tmaxand Cmaxcould be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the divalproex sodium tablet (increase in Tmaxfrom 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules (increase in Tmaxfrom 3.3 to 4.8 hours).

While the absorption rate from the G. I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint.

### Sodium oxybate [^42bda8f9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concomitant use with divalproex sodium: An initial reduction in sodium oxybate oral solution dose of at least 20% is recommended (2.5, 7.2).

7.1 Alcohol, Sedative Hypnotics, and CNS Depressants

Sodium oxybate is contraindicated for use in combination with alcohol or sedative hypnotics. Use of other CNS depressants may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of sodium oxybate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

7.2 Divalproex Sodium

Concomitant use of sodium oxybate with divalproex sodium results in an increase in systemic exposure to GHB, which was shown to cause a greater impairment on some tests of attention and working memory in a clinical study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An initial dose reduction of sodium oxybate oral solution is recommended when used concomitantly with divalproex sodium [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Prescribers are advised to monitor patient response closely and adjust dose accordingly if concomitant use of sodium oxybate oral solution and divalproex sodium is warranted.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodium extended-release) [^e1c43343]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Concomitant antiepilepsy drugs (topiramate, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lamotrigine were evaluated) that induce the cytochrome P450 isozyme system did not significantly alter valproate bioavailability when converting between divalproex sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets.

Distribution

Protein Binding

The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs].

CNS Distribution

Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).

Metabolism

Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30–50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15–20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

### Rapid oral loading of extended release divalproex in patients with acute mania [^b27ae26a]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Oral loading with the delayed release formulation of divalproex sodium is widely used for the treatment of patients with acute mania and produces rapid attainment of therapeutic serum levels. Recently, an extended release formulation of divalproex sodium (divalproex ER) was approved for treatment of migraine headaches. This formulation may be a useful treatment option for patients with acute mania.

Method

A retrospective review of medical records was conducted on 14 inpatients with acute mania whose treatment included initiation of divalproex ER at a dose of 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in a single dose. Doses, serum levels and side effects associated with this treatment were recorded from the medical records of these patients.

Results

The average dose of divalproex ER was 2034 mg day(-1) (range, 1500–3000 mg day(-1)). Two of the 14 patients (14%) had documented side effects, none of which were severe. The average level obtained on day 3 after initiation of divalproex ER treatment was 93.2 mug ml(-1) (range, 47–136 mug ml(-1)), and in all but three patients valproate levels at this time point were within the therapeutic range of 50–125 mug ml(-1). In no case was divalproex ER discontinued due to a perceived lack of efficacy.

Conclusion

The results suggest that divalproex ER can be safely administered by oral loading in inpatients with acute mania and that using a standard loading protocol can result in therapeutic serum levels in most patients in 3 days or less.

### Divalproex-ER pharmacokinetics in older children and adolescents [^82817ac5]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Valproic acid pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability after administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets was characterized in older children and adolescents. In this multiple-dose, open-label, pharmacokinetic study, the patients were divided into two age groups, 8–11 years (older children; n = 15) and 12–17 years (adolescents; n = 14). Once-daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets (doses ranged from 250 to 1750 mg) in older children and adolescents produced relatively flat plasma valproic acid concentration-time profiles over the entire 24-hour dosing interval, similar to the pharmacokinetic performance of this formulation in adults. The mean (standard deviation) oral clearance values for unbound valproic acid were 94.3 (51.8) and 82.3 (28.2) mL/h/kg and for total valproic acid were 11.2 (3.77) and 9.06 (2.03) mL/h/kg in older children and adolescents, respectively. Two patients discontinued for administrative reasons, whereas one discontinued for an adverse event (flulike syndrome). Adverse events reported by three or more patients were flu syndrome (5 patients, 17.2%) and headache (3 patients, 10.3%). Reported adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those reported in previous divalproex studies. This study demonstrates that in older children and adolescents, once-daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets may potentially be used to sustain plasma valproic acid concentrations within the usually accepted therapeutic ranges for various indications.

### Valproate sodium [^23c5afec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the Valproate Sodium Injection dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

Replacement Therapy

When switching from oral valproate products, the total daily dose of Valproate Sodium Injection should be equivalent to the total daily dose of the oral valproate product [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)], and should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day, particularly those not receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen. There is no experience with more rapid infusions in patients receiving Valproate Sodium Injection as replacement therapy. However, the equivalence shown between Valproate Sodium Injection and oral valproate products (divalproex sodium) at steady state was only evaluated in an every 6 hour regimen. Whether, when Valproate Sodium Injection is given less frequently (i.e., twice or three times a day), trough levels fall below those that result from an oral dosage form given via the same regimen, is unknown. For this reason, when Valproate Sodium Injection is given twice or three times a day, close monitoring of trough plasma levels may be needed.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of divalproex sodium extended release in the treatment of acute mania [^ad7a16b7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The efficacy and safety of divalproex sodium extended release (divalproex ER) were evaluated in patients hospitalized for acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed type (DSM-IV-TR criteria).

Method

Following screening and washout of psychotropic medications, 377 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 21 days of double-blind treatment with divalproex ER (N = 192) or placebo (N = 185). Daily dosage was initiated at 25 mg/kg, increased 500 mg on day 3, and adjusted to serum valproate concentrations of 85 to 125 microg/mL. The Mania Rating Scale (MRS) was used to assess efficacy. Patients remained hospitalized at least 15 days during blinded treatment. The study was conducted from April 2003 to May 2004.

Results

Improvement from baseline on the MRS was significantly greater among patients who received divalproex ER compared with placebo at the first on-treatment rating assessment, day 5, and all subsequent ratings through day 21 (p = .013). Furthermore, the proportion of patients achieving at least 50% improvement from baseline in MRS was significantly higher in patients receiving divalproex ER (48%) than in patients receiving placebo (34%) (p = .012). Five of the 11 MRS items improved significantly more in patients receiving divalproex ER than placebo: less need for sleep (p ≤ .01), more energetic (p ≤ .05), increased activity (p ≤ .05), generalized motor hyperactivity (p ≤ .05), and racing thoughts (p ≤ .001). Side effects associated with divalproex ER included somnolence, dizziness, and gastrointestinal complaints.

Conclusion

The results indicate that dival-proex ER is effective and safe for the treatment of mania episodes in bipolar I patients.

### The safety and early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex versus standard-titration divalproex, lithium, olanzapine, and placebo in the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar disorder [^630020df]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have examined the safety and tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex sodium in the treatment of acute mania, but not the early efficacy of this dosing strategy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex.

Method

In this pooled analysis, 348 subjects from 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- or placebo-controlled studies were used to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, olanzapine, or placebo. Subjects were inpatients diagnosed with acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R or -IV and SADS-Change Version). Patients were administered oral-loaded divalproex (20 or 30 mg/kg/day on days 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg/kg/day, and increased at physician's discretion), standard-titration divalproex initiated at 250 mg t.i.d. and titrated to 40–150 microg/mL, lithium (300 mg t.i.d. initial dose) titrated to 0.4 to 1.5 mEq/L, olanzapine (10 mg q.d. initial dose) up to 20 mg/day, or placebo.

Results

The results demonstrate an early efficacy advantage for oral-loaded divalproex compared to standard-titration divalproex at days 5, 7/8, and 10. Efficacy was improved over lithium on day 7/8. There were no efficacy differences between divalproex loading and olanzapine. Divalproex loading showed greater efficacy than placebo at all time points. Divalproex loading was as well tolerated or better tolerated than the other active treatments as measured by adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters.

Conclusion

These results suggest the oral loading of divalproex leads to a more rapid antimanic effect when compared with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, or placebo and is better tolerated than olanzapine and as well tolerated as lithium or standard-titration divalproex.

### Valproate sodium [^a35fa004]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Bioavailability

Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) valproate and oral valproate products are expected to result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to the valproate ion when the IV valproate is administered as a 60 minute infusion. However, the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation used. These differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.

Administration of divalproex sodium tablets and IV valproate (given as a one hour infusion), 250 mg every 6 hours for 4 days to 18 healthy male volunteers resulted in equivalent AUC, Cmax, Cminat steady state, as well as after the first dose. The Tmaxafter IV Valproate Sodium Injection occurs at the end of the one hour infusion, while the Tmaxafter oral dosing with divalproex sodium occurs at approximately 4 hours. Because the kinetics of unbound valproate are linear, bioequivalence between Valproate Sodium Injection and divalproex sodium up to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg/kg/day can be assumed. The AUC and Cmaxresulting from administration of IV valproate 500 mg as a single one hour infusion and a single 500 mg dose of valproic acid syrup to 17 healthy male volunteers were also equivalent.

Patients maintained on valproic acid doses of 750 mg to 4250 mg daily (given in divided doses every 6 hours) as oral divalproex sodium alone (n = 24) or with another stabilized antiepileptic drug [carbamazepine (n = 15), phenytoin (n = 11), or phenobarbital (n = 1)], showed comparable plasma levels for valproic acid when switching from oral divalproex sodium to IV valproate (1-hour infusion).

Eleven healthy volunteers were given single infusions of 1000 mg IV valproate over 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes in a 4-period crossover study. Total valproate concentrations were measured; unbound concentrations were not measured. After the 5 minute infusions (mean rate of 2.8 mg/kg/min), mean Cmaxwas 145 ± 32 mcg/mL, while after the 60 minute infusions, mean Cmaxwas 115 ± 8 mcg/mL. Ninety to 120 minutes after infusion initiation, total valproate concentrations were similar for all 4 rates of infusion. Because protein binding is nonlinear at higher total valproate concentrations, the corresponding increase in unbound Cmaxat faster infusion rates will be greater.

### Acute efficacy of divalproex sodium versus placebo in mood stabilizer-naive bipolar I or II depression: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^04e9a6f7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct an exploratory evaluation of the acute efficacy of extended-release divalproex sodium compared to placebo in patients with bipolar I or II depression.

Method

Outpatients aged 18–70 years with mood stabilizer-naive bipolar I or II disorder experiencing a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of divalproex sodium monotherapy or placebo. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary outcomes included rates of response and remission, changes in the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness scores, and changes in anxiety symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. The study was conducted between 2003 and 2007.

Results

Fifty-four subjects with bipolar I (n = 20) or bipolar II (n = 34) disorder were randomly assigned to divalproex or placebo; 67% (36 of 54) met DSM-IV criteria for rapid cycling. Divalproex treatment produced statistically significant improvement in MADRS scores compared with placebo from week 3 onward. The proportions of patients meeting response criteria were 38.5% (10 of 26) in the divalproex group versus 10.7% (3 of 28) for the placebo group (P = 0.017). The proportions of patients meeting remission criteria were 23.1% (6 of 26) for divalproex versus 10.7% (3 of 28) for placebo (P = 0.208). Subgroup analysis revealed no separation between divalproex and placebo for those with bipolar II diagnoses. Nausea, increased appetite, diarrhea, dry mouth, and cramps were the most common side effects.

Conclusions

These data suggest that divalproex sodium is efficacious and reasonably well tolerated in the acute treatment of mood stabilizer-naive patients with bipolar depression, particularly for those with rapid-cycling type I presentations, and that confirmatory large-scale studies are indicated.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^68e61352]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — anticonvulsants for agitation and behavioral symptoms: Carbamazepine is not recommended for the routine treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, and routine use of valproate to treat behavioral symptoms in dementia is not recommended based on the current evidence; most randomized placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit of valproate compared with placebo and a 2004 Cochrane review concluded that valproate formulations were no more effective than placebo and that side effects were more common. Nonetheless, a therapeutic trial of carbamazepine or valproate may be considered in individual cases, and given the potential toxicity of both agents it is important to identify and monitor target symptoms and to discontinue the medication if no improvement is observed. If used, carbamazepine may be given in two to four doses per day, started at a total dosage of 50–100 mg/day, and increased gradually as warranted by behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 8–12 ng/ml; divalproex sodium may be given in two or three doses per day and should be started at 125–250 mg/day, with gradual increases based on behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 50–60 ng/ml (or, in rare cases, 100 ng/ml). Principal adverse effects of carbamazepine include ataxia, falls, sedation, and confusion, with drug interactions through the cytochrome P450 system and rare bone marrow suppression or hyponatremia; valproate's principal side effects are sedation, gastrointestinal disturbances, and confusion.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^e14b878e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication selection and pharmacokinetics in physically ill children and adolescents emphasize that "psychotropic medication levels are not consistent indicators of either efficacy or toxicity in physically ill patients" and "it is generally preferable to choose a medication with a short half-life and attempt to avoid introducing more than one medication at a time". When possible, medications "should be selected that can be administered in a single or divided dose, are easily titrated to an ideal dose, and do not require frequent laboratory monitoring", and "Multiple medications and demanding treatment regimens threaten adherence". It is helpful to follow the maxim "start low, go slow" when initiating medication in children with "hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiac diseases", and to consider routes and side effects; medications can be given by "oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, transdermal, and sublingual" routes. Most psychoactive drugs are "80% to 95% bound to protein" "with the exception of lithium, methylphenidate, venlafaxine, divalproex sodium, gabapentin, and topiramate"; "The unbound drug is typically pharmacologically active" and reduced "albumin binding… necessitating adjustments to medication dosages". Medications are "absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted through the kidneys", and clinicians should be aware of effects on hepatic metabolism, renal excretion, and discontinuation effects such as "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome". For interactions, "The hepatic CYP450 system is responsible for most metabolic drug interactions", uridine glucuronosyltransferase enzymes generally play "a minor metabolic role" though lamotrigine, morphine, and lorazepam are primarily metabolized by them, and "P-glycoproteins… function as 'gatekeepers' for CYP3A4 metabolism".

### Valproic acid poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^cc6df274]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 9000 ingestions of valproic acid. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of valproic acid by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of valproic acid might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of valproic acid ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the acute ingestion and acute-on-chronic ingestion of immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms of valproic acid, divalproex, and valproate sodium alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose and the effects of an overdose. Although therapeutic doses of valproic acid can cause adverse effects in adults and children, some idiosyncratic and some dose-dependent, these cases are not considered. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in whom a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who are symptomatic (more than somnolence or exhibiting coma or seizures) after a valproic acid ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Asymptomatic patients with an unintentional acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more or asymptomatic patients who are taking the drug therapeutically and who take an additional single acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more of any valproic acid formulation should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 4) Patients with unintentional ingestions of immediate-release valproic acid formulations, who are asymptomatic, and more than 6 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 5) Patients with unintentional ingestions of delayed-release or extended-release formulations of valproic acid who are asymptomatic, and more than 12 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 6) Pregnant women who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care obstetrical provider for evaluation of potential maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade D). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 8) Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested valproic acid within the preceding hour (Grade C). Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Poison centers should follow local protocols and experience with its use. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades D). 9) In patients who have ingested valproic acid and who are comatose, naloxone can be considered for prehospital administration in the doses used for treatment of opioid overdose, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) A benzodiazepine can be administered by EMS personnel if convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction, expressed by written treatment protocol or policy, or if there is direct medical oversight (Grade C).

### Separate and concomitant use of lamotrigine, lithium, and divalproex in bipolar disorders [^1458a9bb]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Expert consensus emphasizes the need for better recognition and accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Current research on lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine provides new insight into the effective management of this illness. Advances in identifying the mechanism of action of mood stabilization has focused on signaling pathways within the cell that are associated with neurotrophic effects. Clinical research has led to confirmatory evidence of the efficacy of lithium in all phases of bipolar disorder, with the greatest effects seen in the treatment and prevention of mania. Compared to divalproex, lithium also has been found to have greater efficacy in the prevention of suicide. Lamotrigine has emerged as a first line treatment for bipolar depression, which is an area of weakness for other mood stabilizers. Oral loading of divalproex leads to rapid stabilization of mania without imposing a greater adverse effect burden than conventional dosing. Because no agent is universally effective in all phases of the illness, combination therapy with two or more agents often is the best option.

Fluoxetine is typically administered in oral capsules or liquid form, with initial doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg daily, and the dose can be gradually increased depending on the patient's response and tolerance (Sohel et al.). Other SSRIs, such as sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro), have also been used off‐label for IED (Edinoff et al; Sanchez, Reines, and Montgomery). These drugs share similar mechanisms of action as fluoxetine, but they differ in terms of adverse effect profiles and individual response rates. For instance, while all SSRIs enhance serotonergic transmission, the incidence of side effects such as nausea, insomnia or sexual dysfunction may vary across medications, and treatment decisions are often tailored to patient‐specific needs (Chu and Wadhwa).

In addition to SSRIs, mood stabilizers are another prominent class of drugs used in managing IED, particularly when impulsive aggression is severe or coexists with mood dysregulation (Gould, Chen, and Manji). Lithium, valproate (Depakote) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) are the most commonly used mood stabilizers in this context (Coccaro and McCloskey). Lithium, in particular, has been widely studied and is known to modulate neurotransmitter activity, specifically balancing dopamine and serotonin, which helps regulate mood swings and reduce aggression (Malhi et al.). However, lithium's use requires close monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic window and significant side effects, such as hand tremors, polyuria (Gitlin; Malhi et al.) and potential long‐term effects on the kidneys and thyroid (Boivin et al.). Regular blood tests are necessary to prevent toxicity, which could result in neurological complications (Gitlin).

8.2 Monitoring medication serum levels

Patients on lithium, divalproex, or carbamazepine need to have their serum medication levels monitored regularly. This is particularly important for those who may be non‐adherent to treatment. Measurement of serum levels should be repeated at the trough point, which is approximately 12 h after the last dose. It is recommended that two consecutive serum levels be established in the therapeutic range during the acute phase for lithium and divalproex, and then measurement be repeated every 3‐6 months or more frequently if clinically indicated. For carbamazepine, serum level monitoring is mainly done to ensure that the levels are not in the toxic range and to check for treatment adherence as there is no established relationship between efficacy and serum level; thus, monitoring for serum carbamazepine levels may be done at 6‐12 monthly intervals and as clinically indicated.

The target serum level for lithium in acute treatment is 0.8‐1.2 mEq/L (0.4‐0.8 mEq/L in older adults) while in maintenance treatment, serum levels of 0.6‐1 mEq/L may be sufficient 801, 802; serum levels should be obtained about 5 days after the most recent dose titration. Clinicians may wish to consult the "lithiumeter" schematic for further guidance. 803 It is important to avoid toxic levels as these are associated with an increased risk of kidney damage in the long term. 804 The target serum level for divalproex is 350‐700 mM/L (50‐100 ug/mL) in the acute phase and should be obtained 3‐5 days after the most recent dose titration. There is some evidence for a linear relationship between serum divalproex level and therapeutic efficacy in acute mania, with higher levels associated with greater efficacy. 805 It is currently unknown what levels of divalproex offer optimum efficacy in maintenance treatment as no study to date has systematically assessed the relationship between serum divalproex level and the maintenance efficacy. Therefore, clinician are advised to maintain serum divalproex levels within the accepted laboratory range values during maintenance treatment and carefully monitor patients for emerging mood symptoms and tolerability and adjust the dose of divalproex as needed in order to achieve optimum efficacy and tolerability.

Patients who are treated with concurrent carbamazepine or other hepatic enzyme‐inducing agents should have serum levels of all psychotropic medications monitored, particularly in cases of inadequate response or non‐response, to determine whether efficacy has been compromised because of reduced serum levels.

### Sodium oxybate [^80cd2a27]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions Studies

Studies in vitro with pooled human liver microsomes indicate that sodium oxybate does not significantly inhibit the activities of the human isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A up to the concentration of 3 mM (378 mcg/mL), a level considerably higher than levels achieved with recommended doses.

Drug interaction studies in healthy adults (age 18 to 50 years) were conducted with sodium oxybate and divalproex sodium, diclofenac, and ibuprofen:

Divalproex sodium: Co-administration of sodium oxybate oral solution (6 g per day as two equal doses of 3 grams dosed four hours apart) with divalproex sodium (valproic acid, 1250 mg per day) increased mean systemic exposure to GHB as shown by AUC by approximately 25% (AUC ratio range of 0.8 to 1.7), while Cmaxwas comparable. Co-administration did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid. A greater impairment on some tests of attention and working memory was observed with co-administration of both drugs than with either drug alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
Diclofenac: Co-administration of sodium oxybate oral solution (6 g per day as two equal doses of 3 grams dosed four hours apart) with diclofenac (50 mg/dose twice per day) showed no significant differences in systemic exposure to GHB. Co-administration did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac.
Ibuprofen: Co-administration of sodium oxybate oral solution (6 g per day as two equal doses of 3 grams dosed four hours apart) with ibuprofen (800 mg/dose four times per day also dosed four hours apart) resulted in comparable systemic exposure to GHB as shown by plasma Cmaxand AUC values. Co-administration did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen.

Drug interaction studies in healthy adults demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interactions between sodium oxybate and protriptyline hydrochloride, zolpidem tartrate, and modafinil. Also, there were no pharmacokinetic interactions with the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor fomepizole. However, pharmacodynamic interactions with these drugs cannot be ruled out. Alteration of gastric pH with omeprazole produced no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of GHB. In addition, drug interaction studies in healthy adults demonstrated no pharmacokinetic or clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions between sodium oxybate and duloxetine HCl.

US vs non-US patients.

The KM-estimated exit rates for the US subgroup were greater than those for the non-US subgroup (figure 2A). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis confirmed that US patients were significantly more likely to exit the study (p < 0.001; figure 2C). The time to exit for US patients exhibited a dose-response relationship; the rate was lower with ESL 1,600 mg vs 1,200 mg. For US patients taking 2 baseline AEDs, or with secondarily generalized seizures before or during the baseline period, the difference in exit rates between dose groups was particularly marked. For all 4 subgroups (US and non-US patients taking ESL 1,600 and 1,200 mg), the UCLs of the exit rates were lower than the 65.3% historical control threshold.

### Valproate preparations for agitation in dementia [^51436979]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation affects up to 70% of older people with dementia. Valproic acid derivatives have been used for the past 10 years to control agitation in dementia, but no systematic review of the effectiveness of this treatment has been published to date. A systematic review of 2004 examined three randomised, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of valproate therapy on older people with dementia who were agitated. The review was updated (October 2008) to include two additional studies.

Objectives

To determine whether evidence supports the use of valproate preparations in the treatment of agitation of people with dementia.

Search Strategy

The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 7 February 2008 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation where agitation and dementia of participants were assessed

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Two reviewers extracted data from published trials 2. Odds ratios of average differences were calculated 3. Only "intention to treat" analyses were included 4. Analysis compared participants treated with valproic acid with controls

Main Results

Meta-analysis in 2004 of the pooled results was limited because of the following problems. In Porsteinsson 2001, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage on the basis of reports from blinded raters and from confidential laboratory reports. Therefore, because the physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation. In Tariot 2001, 54% of the treated patients dropped out compared with 29% of control patients. Of all treated patients, 22% dropped out because of adverse effects, and the study had to be discontinued prematurely. The third trial (Sival 2002) had a cross-over design. No results from the first phase of the study were available, and although the statistical section stated, "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyse the two-period cross-over trial", because the samples were not independent - they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups - a question must be raised about the correctness of the analyses. The valproate preparation used in the trials varied - one used short-acting sodium valproate, one long-acting divalproex sodium, and the third early-onset acting divalproex sodium. Average doses differed (480 mg/d - 1000 mg/d), as did duration of therapy (3 weeks - 6 weeks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy. A limited meta-analysis, pooling the results concerning adverse effects (Porsteinsson 2001, Tariot 2001) revealed the following: sedation occurred more frequently in patients treated with valproic acid than in controls. Urinary tract infection was more common among patients treated with valproic acid than controls. An updated systematic review (October 2008) of two new studies (Tariot 2005, Herrmann 2007) applied meta-analysis to the effect of valproate on agitation in demented patients and also combined these studies with the earlier reports to examine adverse effects among valproate treated patients. Because the study of Herrmann et al involved a cross-over design, only those results from the first part of this study were included in the updated review. The new meta-analysis of pooled results showed no improvement of agitation among valproate treated patients, compared with controls, and showed an increase in adverse events (falls, infection, gastrointestinal disorders) among valproate treated patients.

Authors' Conclusions

The updated review corroborates the earlier findings that valproate preparations are ineffective in treating agitation among demented patients, and that valproate therapy is associated with an unacceptable rate of adverse effects. More research on the use of valproate preparations for agitation of people with dementia is needed. On the basis of current evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia.

### Valproic acid, valproate and divalproex in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^26afa018]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness that is amongst the top 30 causes of disability worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs. In the past, emphasis was placed solely on the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder; recently, the importance of episode prevention and of minimisation of iatrogenicity has been recognised. For many years, lithium was the only mood stabiliser in common use, and it remains an agent of first choice in the preventative treatment of bipolar disorder. However, an estimated 20% to 40% of patients may not respond adequately to lithium. Valproate is an anticonvulsant drug that has been shown to be effective in acute mania and is frequently used in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When the acceptability of long-term treatment is considered, together with efficacy, the adverse event profile of a medication is also important. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2009.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of valproate continuation and maintenance treatment:a) in preventing or attenuating manic, depressive and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder; b) in preventing or attenuating episodes of bipolar disorder in patients with rapid cycling disorder; and; c) in improving patients' general health and social functioning, as measured by global clinical impression, employment and marital stability.2. To review the acceptability to patients of long-term valproate treatment, as measured by numbers of dropouts and reasons for dropping out, by compliance and by reference to patients' expressed views regarding treatment.3. To investigate the adverse effects of valproate treatment (including general prevalence of side effects) and overall mortality rates.

Search Methods

Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) (to January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing valproate and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating participants with bipolar disorder to long-term treatment with valproate or any other mood stabiliser, or antipsychotic drugs, or placebo. Maintenance treatment was defined as treatment instituted specifically or mainly to prevent further episodes of illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data. A double-entry procedure was employed by two review authors. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. For dichotomous data, risk ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For statistically significant results, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). For continuous data, mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated along with 95% CIs. MDs were used when the same scale was used to measure an outcome; SMDs were employed when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. The primary analysis used a fixed-effect model. Binary outcomes were calculated on a strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; dropouts were included in this analysis. When data were missing and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used.

Main Results

Six randomised controlled trials (overall 876 participants) lasting 6 to 24 months were included. Two studies (overall 312 participants) compared valproate with placebo, four studies (overall 618 participants) valproate with lithium, one study (overall 23 participants) valproate with olanzapine and one study (overall 220 participants) valproate with the combination of valproate plus lithium. In terms of study quality, most studies reported the methods used to generate random sequence; however, only one study reported enough details on allocation concealment. Four of six included studies described their design as "double blind", but only two trials reported full details about blinding. Valproate was more effective than placebo in preventing study withdrawal due to any mood episode (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93; NNTB 8), but no difference in efficacy was found between valproate and lithium (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). Valproate was associated with fewer participants dropping out of treatment for any cause when compared with placebo or lithium (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95 and RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98, respectively). However, combination therapy with lithium plus valproate was more likely to prevent relapse than was monotherapy with valproate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96). Significant differences in adverse event frequencies were found, and lithium was associated with more frequent diarrhoea, polyuria, increased thirst and enuresis, whereas valproate was associated with increased sedation and infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supports the efficacy of valproate in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. Clinicians and patients should consider acceptability and tolerability profile when choosing between lithium and valproate-their combination or other agents-as long-term treatment for bipolar disorder.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1cc4eeac]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and weight effects — We recommend considering weight gain potential in choosing an AED for any given patient and using shared decision-making with quantitative estimates of expected weight effects. AEDs associated with weight loss are felbamate, topiramate, and zonisamide; AEDs associated with weight gain are gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid, vigabatrin, and carbamazepine; weight-neutral AEDs are lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproic acid studies reported mild-to-moderate weight gain (5 to 10% of baseline weight) in 24% of patients and marked weight gain (> 10% gain of baseline weight) in 47% of patients. In a gabapentin cohort of 44 patients, 57% gained more than 5% of baseline body weight and 10 patients (23%) gained more than 10%. A systematic review suggested weight gain with gabapentin (2.2 kg after 1.5 mo of use) and divalproex (relative risk for weight gain, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.30, 6.02). For carbamazepine, 66.7% had gained an average of 1.5 kg at a 6- to 8-month follow-up visit.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^94f643db]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 7: Drug dosing — As most oral medications are absorbed within the proximal jejunum, they can be used in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS); however, sustained- and delayed-release medications should be avoided. When applicable, alternative drug delivery methods (eg, liquids, topical) should be considered in SBS, as should the monitoring of medication levels in the blood. If there is a lack of clinical response, options may include escalating the dose, changing dosing schedule or frequency, or changing drug formulation or route of administration (eg, intravenous, subcutaneous, transdermal).

### Valproic acid, valproate and divalproex in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^c8431d73]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although lithium has been the most commonly used maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder for several decades, valproate is being used increasingly - especially in the United States of America. There is a need to clarify whether the increasingly prominent prophylactic role of valproate in bipolar disorder is justified.

Objectives

To review the effectiveness of valproate, relative to placebo, other mood stabilisers and antipsychotics, in the prevention and/or attenuation of acute episodes of bipolar disorder. The effectiveness of valproate was considered in terms of mood symptoms, mortality, general health, social functioning, adverse effects and overall acceptability to patients.

Search Strategy

The CCDAN group search strategy was used. The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), The Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register (CCCTR), EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS, PsycLIT and Psyndex. Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of mood disorder were examined. Authors, other experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for knowledge of suitable published or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which compared valproate with placebo, alternative mood stabilisers (including lithium and carbamazepine) or neuroleptics, where the stated intent of intervention was the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Participants were males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder however diagnosed, approximating to ICD 10 Code F31 and DSM IV 296, but including patients diagnosed as ICD-9 manic depressive psychosis and DSM-III and DSM-IIIR bipolar disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the original reports individually by two reviewers. The main outcomes to be assessed were: 1. The effectiveness of valproate treatment in preventing or attenuating further episodes of bipolar disorder, including its effectiveness in rapid cycling disorder. 2. The acceptability of valproate treatment to patients. 3. The prevalence of side-effects. 4. Mortality on valproate treatment. Outcomes concerning relapse/recurrence were analysed excluding data from discontinuation studies, which were to be analysed separately. Sub-group analyses were to be performed to examine the effects of valproate treatment in rapid cycling bipolar disorder and previous mood stabiliser non-responders. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 4.1.

Main Results

One trial of 12 months duration with 372 participants was identified comparing lithium, divalproex and placebo. It had several methodological limitations. The primary analysis of time to occurrence of mood episode described in the main trial report found no reliable difference between the treatments, although there was a trend for divalproex to be more effective than lithium. In the analysis in this review, patients taking divalproex who left the study because of the occurrence of an mood episode were significantly less in number than those on placebo (RRR 37%; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90). There was no significant difference in the numbers of patients in receipt of divalproex compared with those in receipt of lithium who left the study because they suffered any mood episode. (RRR 22%; RR 0.78; 95% C. I. 0.52 to 1.17). There was insufficient information to allow sub-group analyses of rapid-cycling disorder. The divalproex group had significantly more patients suffering tremor (RRI 223%; RR 3.23; 95% C. I. 1.85 to 5.62), weight gain (RRI 187%; RR 2.87; 95% C. I. 1.34 to 6.17) and alopecia (RRI 143%; RR 2.43; 95% C. I. 1.05 to 5.65) than the placebo group. In comparison with the lithium, divalproex was associated with more frequent sedation (RRI 58%; RR 1.58; 95% C. I. 1.08 to 2.32) and infection (RRI 107%; RR 2.07; 95% C. I. 1.16 to 3.68), but less suffered thirst (RRR 62%; RR 0.38; 95% C. I. 0.18 to 0.81) and polyuria (RRR 57%; RR 0.43; 95% C. I. 0.22 to 0.82).

Reviewer's Conclusions

In view of the equivocal findings of this review, conclusions about the efficacy and acceptability of valproate compared to placebo and lithium cannot be made with any degree of confidence. With current evidence, patients and clinicians would probably wish to use lithium before valproate for maintenance treatment. At present, the observed shift of prescribing practice to valproate is not based on reliable evidence of efficacy

### Valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^92e674aa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of valproate taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between valproate and comparator (placebo, active control, or valproate in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and, in select cases, risk ratios (RRs); we also calculated numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We calculated MDs for Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) scores. We also summarised data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Ten papers describing 10 unique trials met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of data from two trials (63 participants) showed that sodium valproate reduced headache frequency by approximately four headaches per 28 days as compared to placebo (MD -4.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.32 to -0.30). Data from four trials (542 participants) showed that divalproex sodium (a stable combination of sodium valproate and valproic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio) more than doubled the proportion of responders relative to placebo (RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.72; NNT 4; 95% CI 2 to 11). One study of sodium valproate (34 participants) versus placebo supported the latter findings (RR for responders 2.83; 95% CI 1.27 to 6.31; NNT 3; 95% CI 2 to 9). There was no significant difference in the proportion of responders between sodium valproate versus flunarizine (one trial, 41 participants) or between divalproex sodium versus propranolol (one trial, 32 participants). Pooled analysis of post-treatment mean headache frequencies in two trials (88 participants) demonstrates a slight but significant advantage for topiramate 50 mg over valproate 400 mg (MD -0.90; 95% CI -1.58 to -0.22). For placebo-controlled trials of sodium valproate and divalproex sodium, NNHs for clinically important adverse events ranged from 7 to 14.

Authors' Conclusions

Valproate is effective in reducing headache frequency and is reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine.

### Valproate preparations for agitation in dementia [^36aa06ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation has been reported in up to 90% of people with dementia. Agitation in people with dementia worsens carer burden, increases the risk of injury, and adds to the need for institutionalisation. Valproate preparations have been used in an attempt to control agitation in dementia, but their safety and efficacy have been questioned.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of valproate preparations used to treat agitation in people with dementia, including the impact on carers.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 7 December 2017 using the terms: valproic OR valproate OR divalproex. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials that assessed valproate preparations for agitation in people with dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data in meta-analyses where possible. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2009. We found no new studies for inclusion.

Main Results

The review included five studies with 430 participants. Studies varied in the preparations of valproate, mean doses (480 mg/day to 1000 mg/day), duration of treatment (three weeks to six weeks), and outcome measures used. The studies were generally well conducted although some methodological information was missing and one study was at high risk of attrition bias. The quality of evidence related to our primary efficacy outcome of agitation varied from moderate to very low. We found moderate-quality evidence from two studies that measured behaviour with the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (range 0 to 108) and with the BPRS agitation factor (range 0 to 18). They found that there was probably little or no effect of valproate treatment over six weeks (total BPRS: mean difference (MD) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.14 to 2.59; 202 participants, 2 studies; BPRS agitation factor: MD -0.67, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.15; 202 participants, 2 studies). Very low-quality evidence from three studies which measured agitation with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI) were consistent with a lack of effect of valproate treatment on agitation. There was variable quality evidence on other behaviour outcomes reported in single studies of no difference between groups or a benefit for the placebo group. Three studies, which measured cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), found little or no effect of valproate over six weeks, but we were uncertain about this result because the quality of the evidence was very low. Two studies that assessed functional ability using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) (range 6 to 30) found that there was probably slightly worse function in the valproate-treated group, which was of uncertain clinical importance (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.98; 203 participants, 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Analysis of adverse effects and serious adverse events (SAE) indicated a higher incidence in valproate-treated participants. A meta-analysis of three studies showed that there may have been a higher rate of adverse effects among valproate-treated participants than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.14; 381 participants, 3 studies, low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis of the number of SAE for the two studies that reported such data indicated that participants treated with valproate preparations were more likely to experience SAEs (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 22.74; 228 participants, 2 studies), but the very low quality of the data made it difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding SAEs. Individual adverse events that were more frequent in the valproate-treated group included sedation, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), and urinary tract infections.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review corroborates earlier findings that valproate preparations are probably ineffective in treating agitation in people with dementia, but are associated with a higher rate of adverse effects, and possibly of SAEs. On the basis of this evidence, valproate therapy cannot be recommended for management of agitation in dementia. Further research may not be justified, particularly in light of the increased risk of adverse effects in this often frail group of people. Research would be better focused on effective non-pharmacological interventions for this patient group, or, for those situations where medication may be needed, further investigation of how to use other medications as effectively and safely as possible.

8.1 Medical evaluation and laboratory investigations

A complete medical history including assessment of BMI and baseline laboratory investigations (Table 23) should be performed prior to initiating pharmacological treatment for BD or, in the case of an acute clinical situation, as soon as the patient is cooperative. For more detail, readers are referred to comprehensive guidelines for safety monitoring in BD. 652 In women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be ruled out, and they should be counselled about the possibility of lamotrigine and carbamazepine affecting the efficacy of oral contraceptives before initiating pharmacotherapy.

Table 23
Baseline laboratory investigations in patients with bipolar disorder

For those on maintenance therapy with lithium, thyroid and renal function as well as plasma calcium 799 should be assessed at 6 months and at least annually thereafter or as clinically indicated. Menstrual history (to assess for polycystic ovary syndrome), haematology profile, and liver function tests should be obtained at 3‐6 month intervals during the first year, and yearly thereafter and as clinically indicated, in patients on maintenance treatment with divalproex. Patients initiated on lamotrigine or carbamazepine should be routinely educated about the risks of skin rashes and the potential for Stevens‐Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). They should be advised to contact the treating physician if they observe any type of skin rashes or mucosal ulcers as they require urgent medical evaluation to determine the nature of rashes/ulcers and implementation of most appropriate treatment options which might include discontinuation of these medications and instituting other therapeutic strategies to treat serious rashes and prevent destabilization of BD. Further, prior to commencing carbamazepine, patients with ancestry in genetically at‐risk populations such as Han Chinese and other Asian patients should have genotyping performed to ensure that they do not have the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‐B✱1502 allele, which confers a high risk for SJS/TEN with carbamazepine. 800 In addition, those on carbamazepine therapy should have serum sodium levels measured at least annually and as clinically indicated given the risk of hyponatraemia with this compound. Patients on atypical antipsychotics should have their weight monitored monthly in the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile should be assessed at 3 and 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Children under 10 years of age, seniors, medically ill patients, and patients on combination treatments should receive more frequent monitoring. Re‐emergence of clinical symptoms, as well as signs of haematological, hepatic, cardiovascular, and neurological dysfunction, should also signal the need for additional investigations.

### Co-crystals as a new approach to multimodal analgesia and the treatment of pain [^354dd01a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Co-crystallization of an API within an API–coformer co-crystal has several potential physicochemical and pharmacokinetic (PK) benefits, compared with the API alone. For example, over 100 co-crystal studies have shown improved solubility and/or dissolution rates, properties that can lead to optimized oral absorption and enhanced bioavailability. Other promising effects include changes in drug biodistribution, permeability, and metabolism. The physicochemical properties of an API – for example, chemical and physical stability, photostability, melting points, particle morphology and size, tableting and compaction, and tendency to form agglomerates,– can also be optimized via co-crystallization, leading to easier manufacturing processes. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the field of pharmaceutical co-crystals, but to date there are relatively few examples that have been successfully commercialized. The antidepressant escitalopram, originally thought to be a salt, is now known to be a salt/co-crystal complex (escitalopram oxalate–oxalic acid; Cipralex ® [Lundbeck Ltd, Valby, Denmark], Lexapro ® [Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA]), and the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors ipragliflozin–L-proline (Suglat ® [Astellas Pharma, Inc. Tokyo, Japan]) and ertugliflozin–L-pyroglutamic acid (Steglatro™ [Merck and Co. Inc. Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA]) – approved treatments for type 2 diabetes – are co-crystals.–In the case of ipragliflozin–L-proline, the co-crystal was developed in order to improve drug quality, since ipragliflozin changed to a non-stoichiometric hydrate under certain hygrothermal conditions. The L-proline co-crystal provided a form with superior stability and constant quality with good reproducibility. Specific benefits of co-crystallization with a coformer have also been reported for other APIs. For example, the anticonvulsant valproic acid, which is liquid at room temperature, was co-crystallized with sodium valproate to form sodium valproate–valproic acid (Depakote ® [Abbvie Inc. North Chicago, IL, USA]), a product that is solid at room temperature and provides enhanced stability compared with salts of valproic acid, including sodium valproate itself. A co-crystal of the anti-emetic aprepitant (aprepitant–L-proline monohydrate; Figure 2A), which has a significantly improved dissolution rate compared with aprepitant, has also been patented. In addition, co-crystals of the muscle relaxant metaxalone have been reported to improve preclinical in vivo bioavailability. While such improvements, conferred by co-crystallization, provide benefits with respect to the ease of drug development and – due to improved bioavailability – may permit administration of lower doses of the API therein, API–coformer co-crystals do not offer additional clinical benefits (ie, the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of the constituent APIs are unlikely to be altered). In contrast, and as we discuss in the following sections, API–API co-crystals have the potential to provide an improved clinical profile compared with commercially available single-entity reference products administered alone or in free combination.

### Valproate [^c89b4b25]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This article summarizes the role of valproate as a treatment for bipolar disorder and related conditions.

Methods

Published studies and reviews were systematically reviewed. Results from randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that included an active comparator are emphasized.

Results

Valproate is an effective treatment for manic patients. Valproate was superior to placebo in one 1-year randomized, parallel group study in rate of recurrence requiring discontinuation, rate of depression requiring discontinuation, total early termination and time to 25% of patients relapsing with mania, and in controlling mild depressive symptoms. On some measures, including time to development of a manic episode, valproate did not differ from placebo. Assessments of maintenance efficacy of valproate and other putative prophylactic treatments for bipolar disorder are problematic, because of the need to analyze multiple indices of efficacy, and practical and ethical issues that limit generalizability of results of placebo-controlled studies. Valproate has some advantages over lithium in treatment of mania for persons with more severe illnesses. Valproate benefits a broader spectrum of bipolar conditions than lithium. Valproate appears at best modestly effective for bipolar depression. Used in combination with several other treatments, additive benefits result, that are greater than with any of the treatments as monotherapy. Side effects are generally mild and manageable, particularly with divalproex. Weight gain and pharmacokinetic interaction with lamotrigine are perhaps the most consistent problems in use. Valproate contributes to neural tube defects if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy, and this risk must be conveyed to women.

Conclusions

Valproate is an effective and useful treatment for bipolar disorder. Studies clarifying its spectrum of efficacy, its safety and efficacy in combination regimens, and its mechanisms of action are warranted.

### Requirements for generic anti-epileptic medicines: a regulatory perspective [^844c8a9f]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The bioequivalence study will reveal whether 'inactive' excipients of a medicinal product play a role in the absorption of the active moiety. If this is the case, concentration–time profiles will differ, and when 90% confidence intervals do not comply with the requirements, registration of the generic medicine is not possible.

Supplementary requirements for bioequivalence studies apply in cases of special formulations, such as products with controlled release. For instance, minimal plasma concentrations (C min), peak-trough fluctuations and a possible food interaction will be included in the assessment. Furthermore, dose-dumping, i.e. the immediate release of the full dose, should be excluded in vivo.
