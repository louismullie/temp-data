## Question

POC multiplex molecular diagnosis in LRTI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role, performance, and implementation of point-of-care multiplex molecular diagnostics for lower respiratory tract infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and the diagnostic gap. Then, I should verify the test characteristics and performance of available POC multiplex panels. Next, I will examine clinical impact data, including randomized trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check guideline positions and stewardship frameworks. Finally, I will consider limitations, implementation requirements, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and diagnostic gap. Lower respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, carry high morbidity and mortality, yet conventional culture-based diagnostics identify pathogens in only about 20–40% of cases and require 48–72 hours, leading to broad-spectrum empiric therapy and missed opportunities for de-escalation, which fuels resistance and adverse events [^346408a3] [^05a28d9d] [^d18282cb].

> I need to verify what POC multiplex molecular tests actually deliver. These syndromic panels detect multiple bacterial and viral targets simultaneously from lower respiratory specimens with turnaround times around 1–6 hours, and some provide semi-quantitative bacterial loads and genotypic resistance markers, which is a key differentiator from traditional culture and single-target PCRs [^46306ce3] [^393f3dc1] [^05eed1a6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy without checking performance. Prospective evaluations of the BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel show positive percent agreement with culture ranging roughly 83–100% for BAL and 75–100% for sputum, with overall agreement 92–98%, acknowledging that culture is an imperfect reference and that panel sensitivity varies by target and specimen quality [^46306ce3] [^cbc4dcb6]. Quantitative features can help distinguish colonization from infection when bacterial burdens are high, though interpretation must be contextualized with clinical data and stewardship input [^05eed1a6].

> Next, I should review randomized and quasi-randomized trials for clinical impact. In a multicenter RCT of hospitalized adults with CAP, adding multiplex PCR to standard care increased pathogen-directed therapy from 13.4% to 35.3% and shortened time to pathogen-directed therapy by about 9 hours, with no safety signals, supporting diagnostic stewardship benefits even if overall antibiotic use did not fall in that study [^84bb5037]. In contrast, a larger RCT using a POC multiplex viral and atypical pathogen panel reduced IV antibiotic duration by about 1 day and shortened hospital stay by about 1 day, with more de-escalation within 72 hours, suggesting that faster results can modify therapy intensity and resource use when coupled with clinical judgment [^a6529b6c]. In the ICU, a pragmatic RCT showed that molecular POC testing dramatically accelerated results and enabled de-escalation in 42% vs 8% with conventional testing, again without excess adverse outcomes, reinforcing stewardship value in critical care [^7669d0fa].

> Wait, let me verify the broader synthesis. Meta-analyses of rapid multiplex viral PCR show consistent reductions in time-to-result by roughly 24 hours and modest reductions in length of stay, with improved antiviral use and infection control actions in influenza-positive patients, supporting operational and stewardship gains even when mortality effects are uncertain [^0b406bab]. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs in critically ill pneumonia patients found improved adequacy of initial therapy and faster effective therapy with syndromic PCR, though mortality effects remain inconsistent across studies, which aligns with the notion that process-of-care benefits are more reliable than hard outcomes in this context [^d1cb109b].

> I should confirm guideline positions to avoid overgeneralization. IDSA/ASM guidance advises that multiplex molecular pneumonia panels, when used judiciously, can provide earlier opportunities for therapeutic optimization than culture but should not replace culture and susceptibility testing, especially when phenotypic resistance is needed or when the pretest probability is low [^d18282cb]. ATS guidance for noninfluenza viral testing in suspected CAP emphasizes that evidence for routine use is limited and calls for more pragmatic trials, while allowing that results may influence management in selected hospitalized patients [^423f8d40]. ESCMID 2024 emergency department guidance recommends avoiding multiplex PCR solely to reduce antibiotic initiation in the ED, reflecting concerns about low pretest probability and potential overtreatment of colonization in low-risk patients [^6f49afe9]. For severe CAP and ICU patients, contemporary European guidance supports considering lower respiratory multiplex PCR when nonstandard antibiotics are prescribed or considered, aligning with a stewardship-driven, risk-stratified approach [^c17242be].

> But wait, what about limitations and implementation pitfalls. I need to ensure we address colonization versus infection, specimen quality, and cost. PCR detects nucleic acid from live and dead organisms, so positive results in nonsterile sites like sputum may reflect colonization or prior therapy rather than active infection; quantitative reporting and clinical correlation mitigate this, but overcalling remains a risk without stewardship [^bd94a43a] [^05eed1a6]. Panels do not cover all pathogens, may miss fungi, and genotypic resistance markers can discord with phenotypic susceptibility, so negative panels do not obviate the need for clinical reassessment and, at times, repeat sampling or alternative diagnostics [^a1a4b8be] [^05eed1a6]. Real-world surveys show that while panels are increasingly available, dedicated stewardship workflows and education are often lacking, limiting measured impact on antibiotic use, which argues for bundled implementation with clear interpretation criteria [^ca1b284b] [^2bc1b1f5].

> Let me consider special populations and settings. In immunocompromised hosts, including CAR T-cell recipients, multiplex PCR is recommended for symptomatic respiratory infections given the breadth of pathogens and the consequences of delays, but results must be integrated with imaging and clinical evolution to avoid misattribution [^fa32749f]. In children, RCTs show that multiplex viral POC testing can reduce unnecessary antibiotics when results are available during the encounter, though coinfection and local prescribing culture influence effect size, reinforcing the need for diagnostic stewardship and aligned incentives [^776bef10]. In low-resource settings, cost and infrastructure barriers persist, and while multiplex testing can reveal high viral etiologic fractions, affordable, algorithmic approaches and selective deployment may be more realistic paths to impact [^851dd9d8] [^d7249514].

> I should double-check the practical implementation elements that make or break value. Success depends on preanalytic quality for lower respiratory specimens, with microscopic assessment to prioritize high-quality sputum or BAL, and on analytic pathways that return results within the clinical window for decision-making, ideally under 6 hours, alongside stewardship protocols for interpreting semi-quantitative bacterial loads and resistance genes with explicit de-escalation triggers [^c194b916] [^393f3dc1]. Education for clinicians on pretest probability, the meaning of detection at low bacterial burden, and when to escalate, repeat, or stop therapy is essential to avoid both undertreatment and overtreatment [^393f3dc1] [^82f25314].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified recommendation, and I will correct myself if I overstate certainty. For severe CAP, HAP, or VAP, especially when broad-spectrum or nonstandard agents are being used or considered, obtaining lower respiratory specimens for multiplex PCR alongside culture is reasonable to accelerate pathogen identification and enable earlier de-escalation, provided stewardship support is in place to interpret results and act within 48–72 hours [^c17242be] [^d18282cb]. For stable, nonsevere CAP in immunocompetent adults, routine multiplex PCR is not yet broadly endorsed; selective use may be justified when the result is likely to change management, such as in patients with treatment failure, immunocompromise, or high risk of resistant organisms, recognizing that evidence for hard outcomes remains mixed and cost-effectiveness varies by setting [^423f8d40] [^a1a4b8be]. In the ED, ultra-rapid multiplex PCR can reduce length of stay and improve flow, but stewardship guardrails are needed to prevent reflexive testing in low-probability patients and to align results with disposition and therapy decisions [^46cca6c1] [^6f49afe9].

> In conclusion, POC multiplex molecular diagnostics for LRTI are not a universal replacement for culture but, when deployed with diagnostic stewardship and appropriate specimens, they consistently accelerate pathogen identification, increase pathogen-directed therapy, and enable timely antibiotic de-escalation, with measurable improvements in process outcomes and resource use; mortality benefits remain unproven and implementation quality determines real-world impact, so I need to ensure we frame this as a stewardship-enhanced strategy rather than a standalone diagnostic fix [^7669d0fa] [^a6529b6c] [^0b406bab] [^d1cb109b] [^d18282cb].

Point-of-care multiplex molecular diagnostics for LRTI provide **rapid, comprehensive pathogen detection** [^0553d774] within 1–2 hours, enabling earlier targeted therapy and antibiotic de-escalation [^7669d0fa] [^a6529b6c]. They outperform culture for many pathogens [^05a28d9d] and detect viral-bacterial coinfections, but **cannot distinguish colonization from infection** [^bd94a43a] and may miss pathogens outside panel targets [^a1a4b8be]. Clinical trials show reduced IV antibiotic duration [^a6529b6c], faster de-escalation [^7669d0fa], and shorter hospital stay [^a6529b6c], though mortality benefits are unproven [^d1cb109b]. Panels should be used with clinical judgment and stewardship [^d18282cb]; they complement — but do not replace — culture and susceptibility testing [^a1a4b8be].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines support **selective use** in severe disease, immunocompromised patients, or when broad-spectrum therapy is planned [^c17242be] [^d18282cb]. They emphasize that panels should complement — not replace — culture and susceptibility testing [^a1a4b8be] [^05eed1a6]. Routine use in uncomplicated CAP is not recommended due to limited evidence of benefit [^6f49afe9] [^423f8d40].

### Testing for respiratory viruses in adults with severe lower respiratory infection [^671f30e0]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Viral pathogens are a common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in adults. Our ability to rapidly and accurately identify viral infections has dramatically improved as slow culture-based techniques have been largely replaced by multiplex high-throughput systems. Given these advances, reevaluation of the role of respiratory viral testing in adults presenting with lower respiratory tract infection is important. This article reviews the potential benefits of testing, provides an overview of the most commonly used diagnostic techniques, and considers whether current evidence supports routine testing.

Respiratory tract infections rank second as causes of adult and paediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. Respiratory tract infections are caused by many different bacteria (including mycobacteria) and viruses, and rapid detection of pathogens in individual cases is crucial in achieving the best clinical management, public health surveillance, and control outcomes. Further challenges in improving management outcomes for respiratory tract infections exist: rapid identification of drug resistant pathogens; more widespread surveillance of infections, locally and internationally; and global responses to infections with pandemic potential. Developments in genome amplification have led to the discovery of several new respiratory pathogens, and sensitive PCR methods for the diagnostic work-up of these are available. Advances in technology have allowed for development of single and multiplexed PCR techniques that provide rapid detection of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens. Microarray-based multiplexing and nucleic-acid-based deep-sequencing methods allow simultaneous detection of pathogen nucleic acid and multiple antibiotic resistance, providing further hope in revolutionising rapid point of care respiratory tract infection diagnostics.

In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for the key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission, than current standard methods. A faster and more accurate microbiological diagnosis should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Molecular point-of-care testing for lower respiratory tract pathogens improves safe antibiotic de-escalation in patients with pneumonia in the ICU: results of a randomised controlled trial [^7669d0fa]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective treatment of pneumonia requires timely administration of appropriate antimicrobials but standard diagnostic tests take around 48 h to generate results. Highly accurate, rapid molecular tests have been developed for identifying organisms in lower respiratory tract samples, however their impact on antibiotic use is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of syndromic molecular point-of-care testing compared to conventional diagnostic testing, on antibiotic use.

Methods

In this pragmatic, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled critically ill adults with pneumonia. Patients were assigned (1:1) to molecular testing of samples at the point-of-care or routine clinical care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received results-directed antimicrobial therapy.

Results

200 patients were randomly assigned to point-of-care testing (n = 100) or the control group (n = 100). 85 patients had community acquired pneumonia (42 in the mPOCT group and 43 in the control group), 69 hospital acquired pneumonia (30 in mPOCT and 39 in control) and 46 ventilator associated pneumonia (28 in mPOCT and 18 in control). The median [IQR] time to results was 1.7 [1.6–1.9] hours for point-of-care testing and 66.7 [56.7–88.5] hours for standard diagnostics (difference of -65.0 h, 95%CI -68.0 to -62.0; p < 0.0001). 71 (71%) patients in the point-of-care testing arm had pathogens detected compared to 51 (51%) in the control arm (difference of 20%, 95%CI 7 to 33; p = 0.004). 80 (80%) of patients in the point-of-care group received results-directed therapy, compared with 29 (29%) of 99 in the control group (difference of 51%, 95%CI 39–63; p < 0.0001). Time to results-directed therapy was 2.3 [1.8–7.2] hours in the mPOCT group and 46.1 [23.0–51.5] hours in the control group (difference of -43.8 h, 95% CI -48.9 to -38.6; p < 0.0001). 42 (42%) patients in mPOCT group had antibiotics de-escalated compared with 8 (8%) of 98 in the control group (difference of 34%, 95%CI 23–45; p < 0.0001). Time to de-escalation was 4.8 [2.4–13.0] hours in the mPOCT group compared with 46.5 [26.3–48.6] hours in the control group (difference of -41.4 h, 95%CI -53 to -29.7; p < 0.0001). There was no major difference in antibiotic duration or in clinical or safety outcomes between the two groups.

Conclusions

Use of molecular point-of-care testing in patients with pneumonia returned results more rapidly and identified more pathogens than conventional testing. This was associated with improvements in appropriate antimicrobial use and appeared safe.

May antimicrobial therapy be withheld until the results of the syndromic PCR panel are available (early targeted antimicrobial therapy)?

In cases where shock is absent, physicians may opt for front-line targeted antimicrobial therapy based on syndromic panel results. The high negative predictive value of RMMSP for all panel targets enables the avoidance of antimicrobials directed at undetectable targets (e.g. linezolid in the absence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]).
Experts' opinion 2: In patients with hemodynamic stability (no shock), antimicrobial therapy could be delayed until molecular syndromic panel results are available (no longer than 3 h thereafter).

What specimens should be run on pneumonia syndromic PCR panels?

Both, bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and high-quality (as evaluated microscopically) sputum-like specimens (sputa and endotracheal aspirates) may be used.
Experts' opinion 3: High quality lower respiratory tract specimens, as assessed microscopically, should be used for testing.

### Molecular diagnostic methods for pneumonia: how can they be applied in practice? [^52a82836]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia represents a major burden in clinical practice. A rapid etiological diagnosis is critical for optimizing the antibiotic use. Owing to the variety of possible pathogens and the time needed for bacterial cultures or usual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, timely and precise diagnosis is a huge challenge. Several new rapid multiplex assays have been developed in the last decade to resolve these issues. This review aims to provide an overview of recent evidence on improvements and limitations of new rapid molecular assays for pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Several rapid multiplex-PCR assays are commercially available for upper or lower respiratory tract samples, allowing detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses, bacteria, and, in some cases, of several antibiotic resistance genes. Clinical evaluations demonstrated their good correlation with gold-standard assays but their lack of exhaustiveness, especially for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Studies that evaluated their potential benefits on antibiotic use suffered from important weaknesses with conflicting and limited results.

Summary

New molecular assays may enable improvements in patient management and antibiotic use. Available studies highlight several benefits and the strong interrelations needed between microbiologists and physicians for their implementation and interpretation according to the clinical and epidemiological context.

Results

Molecular syndromic panels to diagnose infectious diseases in critically ill patients: general considerations

Time until microbiological diagnosis and minimum diagnostic standards for therapeutic adequacy.

The key point of a rapid diagnosis is administering the correct antibiotic treatment at the right time, through the appropriate route, and with the necessary dose to control the infection and symptoms. Additionally, it involves adjusting or discontinuing treatment when it is no longer needed.

While traditional culture-based techniques remain the standard, molecular methods, such as nucleic acid amplification, are rapid and can provide results in a few hours. However, its implementation requires adequate technical and organizational resources.

Although clinical microbiology laboratories have maintained their fundamental mission, they have undergone significant transformation, largely driven by molecular diagnostics. Indeed, RMMSP have revolutionized the management of infectious diseases, expanding their impact from routine cases in everyday practice to rare conditions handled by specialists.

Syndromic molecular panels

Introduction of RMMSP in daily practice capability facilitates timely clinical management decisions, such as hospital admission, isolation, and initiation or avoidance of antimicrobial treatment.

These panels are tailored to screen for the most common microorganisms associated with specific clinical syndromes such as bloodstream infection, meningitis/encephalitis, gastrointestinal infection, respiratory tract infection, joint infection, urinary tract infection, and sexually transmitted diseases.

Some RMMSP, like those for bloodstream infection and lower respiratory tract infection, have the capability to detect genotypic markers of β-lactam resistance, such as genes encoding main carbapenemases (bla KPC, bla NDM, bla VIM, bla OXA-48), extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) from the bla CTX-M group, methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (mecA), or glycopeptide resistance in Enterococcus spp. (van A/vanB).

### New molecular virus detection methods and their clinical value in lower respiratory tract infections in children [^d19150a9]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

During the past decade, several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered. All these new viruses, as well as previously known respiratory viruses, can be detected by sensitive PCR methods, which have become popular in the diagnostic workup of respiratory viral infections. Currently, respiratory viruses can be detected in up to 95% of children with lower respiratory tract illness. On the other hand, virus detection rates in asymptomatic children are also high (up to 68%), as are coinfection rates in symptomatic children (up to 43%) and justified concerns of causality have been raised. Imposing progress has been made in developing multiplex quantitative PCR assays; here, several primer sets are run within a single PCR mixture. These PCR assays give a better understanding of the dominant viral infection, of viral infections that may be incipient and of any waning infections than does a single-target PCR. Multiplex PCR assays are also gaining popularity due to their cost-effectiveness and short throughput time compared to multiple single-target PCRs. Our understanding of the indications of virus PCRs and our ability to interpret the results from a clinical point of view have improved. This paper reviews the progress in PCR assays and discusses their role in the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in children.

### Current trends and newer concepts on diagnosis, management and prevention of respiratory tract infections [^a236fabc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Current standard diagnostic tests for acute and chronic bacterial and viral infections are laborious and time consuming. Currently, all ill patients presenting with any form of respiratory tract infections (CAP, HAP, VAP, or respiratory tract infections in the immunosuppressed) are treated empirically without an accurate diagnosis of the causative microorganism and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Correctly identifying the exact microorganism causing respiratory tract infections and treating with appropriate antibiotics they are susceptible to is essential, as morbidity and mortality rates are high. Respiratory tract infections remain difficult to diagnose accurately as a broad range of pathogens and opportunistic microorganism are involved in their cause. Kate Reddington et al. (pp. 298–304) review literature on recently available commercial multiparametric molecular diagnostics tests for the detection of respiratory tract infections. They emphasize that reliability of the molecular drug resistance markers chosen, the need for the quantitative detection of some organisms, and throughput are also important considerations for new technology developers. As point of care diagnostic tools become available so will an array of biomarkers of disease activity, monitoring treatment efficacy and cure. Mervyn Singer (pp. 305–309) reviews the growing literature on biomarkers of sepsis and suggests that new biomarkers will facilitate early and accurate diagnosis, faster recognition of impending organ dysfunction, optimal selection, and titration of appropriate therapies, and more reliable prognostication of risk and outcome. Travis Henry and Kristopher Cummings (pp. 310–317) summarize imaging findings of common parasitic infections of the lung in the context of the life cycle and pathophysiology of each parasite.

With recent exciting advances in technology, the future promises a wide array of rapid point-of-care diagnostics and biomarker tools on the horizon that may become available within the next decade and could revolutionize the management of respiratory tract infections, reducing mortality and morbidity worldwide.

### Exploring the utility of multiplex infectious disease panel testing for diagnosis of infection in different body sites: a joint report of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and pan American society for clinical virology [^a1a4b8be]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) molecular panels — clinical utility — remain uncertain; evaluations suggest pneumonia panels may allow earlier modification of antimicrobial therapy in hospitalized patients when positive, but given limited sensitivity and the potential for pathogens not on the panel (low negative predictive value), a negative result would not impact treatment decisions, and at this time culture and traditional susceptibility testing are still necessary, with molecular platforms used as an adjunct test.

### The role of rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels in the clinical management of infections in critically ill patients: an experts-opinion document [^05eed1a6]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

How should the results of the syndromic PCR panel be informed (qualitative vs. quantitative for the filmarray panel)?

When feasible (use of the FA-PNp) results should be reported in a quantitative fashion.
Experts' opinion 4: Molecular syndromic panel results should be reported quantitatively, when possible. Quantitative results (in copies/ml) should be interpreted on an individual basis considering factors such as patient clinical condition, receipt of antimicrobials at the time of sampling, bacterial load, and number of detected targets.

How should results be interpreted?

The FA-PNp provides quantitative results (genomic copies/ml) in binned values (log 10 increments from 10⁴ to ≥ 10⁷ genomic copies/ml) for 15 bacterial targets, excluding atypical bacteria. High bacterial burdens (10⁶ or ≥ 10⁷) generally indicate causality. However, lower genomic copies/ml (10⁴ or 10⁵) may also indicate causality, particularly for certain microorganisms as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and MRSA, especially in patients receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

Interpreting the detection of more than two targets should be approached cautiously, especially when only qualitative results are available. However, high bacterial burdens (10⁶ or ≥ 10⁷), regardless of the number of co-detected microorganisms, may indicate.

The results of genotypic resistance markers offer valuable insights, particularly for Enterobacterales and MRSA. However, it is crucial to interpret these markers in conjunction with the clinical context, local resistance patterns, and antimicrobial stewardship guidelines.

Should pneumonia syndromic PCR Panels replace standard microbiological procedures?

The use of Pneumonia Syndromic molecular panels must not replace conventional methods, but rather serve as a complementary tool for improving the management of patients and decrease the selection of MDR bacteria.

Regarding FA-PNp assay, it demonstrated strong concordance with standard-of-care diagnostics for included species, with no false positives compared to clinical symptoms or cultures. FA-PNp assay reduced the median time to clinical interpretation, potentially improving patient outcomes. However, the assay missed clinically important pathogens, including H. parainfluenza and fungal species such as Aspergillus. While the assay may expedite diagnosis and treatment for certain bacterial and viral infections, it cannot replace standard culture techniques, especially in lung transplant recipients.

For fungal species detection, combining RMMSP with next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers the potential for enhanced accuracy, thereby improving its overall clinical utility.
Experts' opinion 5: Molecular syndromic panel must not replace conventional microbiological procedures.

### Molecular testing for acute respiratory tract infections: clinical and diagnostic recommendations from the IDSA's diagnostics committee [^4e835e1e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are not pathogen specific. Highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests have become the diagnostic reference standard for viruses, and translation of bacterial assays from basic research to routine clinical practice represents an exciting advance in respiratory medicine. Most recently, molecular diagnostics have played an essential role in the global health response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. How best to use newer molecular tests for RTI in combination with clinical judgment and traditional methods can be bewildering given the plethora of available assays and rapidly evolving technologies. Here, we summarize the current state of the art with respect to the diagnosis of viral and bacterial RTIs, provide a practical framework for diagnostic decision making using selected patient-centered vignettes, and make recommendations for future studies to advance the field.

### Exploring the utility of multiplex infectious disease panel testing for diagnosis of infection in different body sites: a joint report of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and pan American society for clinical virology [^08726313]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of clinical molecular diagnostic methods for detecting microbial pathogens continues to expand and, in some cases, supplant conventional identification methods in various scenarios. Analytical and clinical benefits of multiplex molecular panels for the detection of respiratory pathogens have been demonstrated in various studies. The use of these panels in managing different patient populations has been incorporated into clinical guidance documents. The Association for Molecular Pathology's Infectious Diseases Multiplex Working Group conducted a review of the current benefits and challenges to using multiplex PCR for the detection of pathogens from gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, lower respiratory tract, and joint specimens. The Working Group also discusses future directions and novel approaches to detection of pathogens in alternate specimen types, and outlines challenges associated with implementation of these multiplex PCR panels.

### Bacterial multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests for the diagnosis and management of pneumonia: ready for prime time? [^66f0e483]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis and management of pneumonia is often challenging due to its overlapping clinical presentations with other respiratory illnesses, low pathogen identification rates, and slow turnaround time of conventional bacterial cultures. These factors contribute to both inadequate empiric therapy and overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can negatively impact outcomes. Recently, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assays capable of rapidly detecting multiple bacterial respiratory pathogens and resistance genes have emerged. However, their clinical utility in pneumonia management remains uncertain.

Objective

To assess the utility of bacterial mPCR assays in pneumonia diagnosis, their impact on antimicrobial usage, and their effect on patient outcomes.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE to identify observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the accuracy and clinical impact of bacterial mPCR tests for pneumonia.

Results

Bacterial mPCR assays demonstrate high sensitivity for pathogen detection, rapid turnaround compared to conventional cultures, and the ability to identify many common resistance genes. They may also improve pathogen detection in patients who received empirical antibiotics prior to specimen collection. However, mPCRs do not detect all potential pathogens, cannot reliably differentiate colonisation from infection, and may show discordance between genetic and phenotypic resistance. mPCR panels also generally require lower respiratory tract specimens, limiting their utility since many pneumonia patients cannot produce adequate sputum. Observational studies and RCTs suggest that mPCR may help optimise antibiotic selection, but RCTs have not clearly demonstrated reductions in overall antibiotic use or improved clinical outcomes including mortality. Implementation of mPCR without structured antimicrobial stewardship may limit clinical impact.

Conclusions

Bacterial mPCR assays offer rapid and sensitive pathogen detection, but their integration into pneumonia management requires careful consideration of clinical context and expert antimicrobial stewardship guidance. Future research should focus on optimising their diagnostic and therapeutic applications, evaluating cost-effectiveness, and assessing patient-centered outcomes.

RMMSP rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels; MDR multi-drug resistant

Inadequate antibiotic therapy can lead to treatment failure, prolonged illness, and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. When antibiotics are prescribed without identifying the pathogen or selecting ineffective drugs, infections may persist and facilitate the emergence of MDR bacteria. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and proper antibiotic selection are crucial for managing critically ill patients and controlling antibiotic resistance.

RMMSP offer a promising approach to expedite the diagnosis of infectious diseases by simultaneously testing for multiple pathogens associated with a particular clinical syndrome. These panels utilize molecular techniques, such as PCR, to detect the presence of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens directly from clinical specimens like blood, urine, respiratory secretions, or sterile fluids.

RMMSP provide rapid results and comprehensive pathogen detection, potentially supporting precision medicine, improving patient outcomes, and contributing to public health surveillance. However, their clinical performance in specific scenarios and their impact on antibiotic use remain areas of ongoing debate. Therefore, they should always be used from a clinical perspective and within the appropriate clinical context.

Furthermore, RMMSP, combined with NGS, have revolutionized diagnostic workflows by providing precise pathogen identification and resistance profiling. This integration significantly reduces turnaround times, enhancing clinical decision-making and patient outcomes, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios such as respiratory and central nervous system infectious diseases.

In conclusion, while syndromic panels provide rapid, comprehensive diagnostics for infectious diseases, their use must be balanced with clinical judgment and antibiotic stewardship to optimize care and reduce risks like inadequate therapy and antibiotic resistance. Future advancements may include integrating RMMSP with predictive artificial intelligence, further enhancing diagnostic accuracy and refining the management of critically ill, infected patients.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care tests in acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^2cf5055e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Point-of-care tests could be essential in differentiating bacterial and viral acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections and driving antibiotic stewardship in the community.

Objectives

To assess diagnostic test accuracy of point-of-care tests in community settings for acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

Data Sources

Multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Open Gray) from inception to 31 May 2021, without language restrictions.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Diagnostic test accuracy studies involving patients at primary care, outpatient clinic, emergency department and long-term care facilities with a clinical suspicion of acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The comparator was any test used as a comparison to the index test. In order not to limit the study inclusion, the comparator was not defined a priori.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Four investigators independently extracted data, rated risk of bias, and assessed the quality using QUADAS-2.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

The measures of diagnostic test accuracy were calculated with 95% CI.

Results

A total of 421 studies addressed at least one point-of-care test. The diagnostic performance of molecular tests was higher compared with that of rapid diagnostic tests for all the pathogens studied. The accuracy of stand-alone signs and symptoms or biomarkers was poor. Lung ultrasound showed high sensitivity and specificity (90% for both) for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Rapid antigen-based diagnostic tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae had sub-optimal sensitivity (range 49%-84%) but high specificity (> 80%).

Discussion

Physical examination and host biomarkers are not sufficiently reliable as stand-alone tests to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia. Lung ultrasound shows higher accuracy than chest X-ray for bacterial pneumonia at emergency department. Rapid antigen-based diagnostic tests cannot be considered fully reliable because of high false-negative rates. Overall, molecular tests for all the pathogens considered were found to be the most accurate.

### What is the role of newer molecular tests in the management of CAP? [^0be7ab63]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) accounts for major morbidity and mortality in the United States. With improved broad-spectrum antibiotics, the implementation of diagnostic studies has declined and most patients do not have an etiologic pathogen of CAP identified. To enhance the appropriate use of antiviral agents and prevent overuse of antibiotics, the successful management of CAP requires rapid and accurate diagnosis of the etiologic agent of CAP. This article provides an overview of the new rapid molecular tests for the diagnosis of influenza, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria compared with nonmolecular tests and how their use for directed therapy can enhance and improve the management of CAP.

### Performance assessment of a rapid molecular respiratory syncytial virus point-of-care test: a prospective community study in older adults [^b7adef13]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infections are estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of mortality worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections in older adults (≥ 60 years) with a substantial disease burden. The annual incidence rate of RSV infection in community-dwelling older adults is estimated at 3%–7.2%. It was estimated that approximately 14 000 (range, 5000–50 000) in-hospital deaths due to acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in older adults were related to RSV in 2015.

Currently, the gold standard for RSV diagnosis is laboratory-based real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR has the disadvantage that it requires technical skills and has a long turnaround time. Therefore, reliable rapid diagnostic tests are needed to improve patient management, to enable cohorting and isolation of hospitalized patients, to prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics, and for the use of RSV antivirals for treatment in the near future.

### Exploring the utility of multiplex infectious disease panel testing for diagnosis of infection in different body sites: a joint report of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and pan American society for clinical virology [^bd94a43a]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Multiplex infectious disease PCR (polymerase chain reaction) panel implementation — advantages, logistics, and limitations — is characterized by the following: highly multiplexed syndromic panels are more complicated to develop than single-target assays and increasing targets in a single reaction may result in a loss of sensitivity; multiple primer pairs may increase mispairing with nonspecific amplification and primer dimers, and differing reaction components and temperature cycling across targets make it difficult to find a single optimal condition set; early use showed PCR to be at least as, if not more, sensitive than culture- and non–culture-based methods and, in many instances, PCR has displaced culture as the gold standard; newer panels permit near-patient testing and provide results in < 30 minutes, enabling CLIA-waived point-of-care use by nonlaboratory personnel so physicians can administer targeted therapy during the initial visit, reducing the need for follow-up or avoiding unnecessary antibiotics; limitations include that multiplex PCR detects nucleic acid from both living and dead organisms, complicating identification of the relevant pathogen in polymicrobic samples, differentiation between active and resolving infection, or serving as a test of cure, and the presence of S. pneumoniae in the nares or oropharynx of a patient with pneumonia may represent colonization rather than the cause of infection.

### Effect of point-of-care testing for respiratory pathogens on antibiotic use in children: a randomized clinical trial [^776bef10]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The strengths of the present study include the fact that broad respiratory multiplex PCR panels, including those detecting SARS-CoV-2, have now become available for clinical use, making the topic particularly relevant. This study is one of the first RCTs to outline the role of diagnostic stewardship in decentralizing laboratory diagnostics and implementing new advanced molecular point-of-care assays in clinical practice. We achieved a sample size sufficient to assess the predefined outcomes and were able to report the effects of multiplex PCR testing on both the targeted and untargeted prescribing of antibiotics.

Limitations

The main limitation of this study is that the proportion of children who were actively tested for RSV and influenza in the ED was high in the control group, suggesting that the effect of the intervention may differ in centers with less active baseline diagnostics for respiratory pathogens. Our study was conducted in a high-income country with low antibiotic consumption. In Europe, antibiotic prescription rates for febrile children range from 22% to 42%. Thus, it is unknown whether testing for respiratory pathogens reduces antibiotic use in settings with different antibiotic prescription policies. Most participants were tested for C-reactive protein, which likely has guided clinical care. In addition, interpreting the findings from multiplex PCR is complex. The detection of respiratory virus does not exclude the presence of bacterial infection because viral-bacterial coinfections are common among children. The detection of a respiratory virus does not always explain the acute symptoms since the finding may be coindicental. We enrolled acutely ill children with an assumed respiratory infection on their arrival at the ED. In selected cohorts, the impact of multiplex PCR testing for respiratory pathogens may be different. The number of children with influenza, M pneumoniae, or B pertussis was low in the study population. Before the study, the proportion of children who received antibiotics in the ED was a little higher than during the study. The intervention in the ED may have influenced the behavior of physicians regarding the treatment of the control group in response to their awareness of the trial.

A retrospective cohort design was used to study the impact of a multiplex respiratory virus panel polymerase chain reaction test in 186 adult patients with suspected influenza-like illness. Decisions regarding continuation of empirical antiviral therapy appear to be impacted by the test. However, the impact on reducing antibiotic use remains unclear.

### Rapid multiplex PCR panels for the management of ventilator-associated pneumonia: pondering strengths and weaknesses [^3154d1ea]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the review by Kreitmann et al. on intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections in immunocompromised patients. The authors nicely discussed conditions associated with immunosuppression in ICU and mechanisms of infections. Their review offers also an up-to-date description of epidemiology and diagnostic–therapeutic management of ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTIs) in this population.

However, we do not agree with the authors' view on the role of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR)-based tests in VA-LRTIs. While they stated that mPCR pneumonia tests are probably less useful for ICU-acquired than for community-acquired infections, we believe they are actually quite the opposite. Recent guidelines on community-acquired pneumonia suggest mPCR testing only "whenever nonstandard antibiotics are prescribed or considered". Conversely, multicenter randomized controlled trials on nosocomial pneumonia showed that mPCR-based tests could increase the sensitivity of microbial sampling and/or shorten the duration of inappropriate antibiotic therapy, supporting their use to improve antibiotic stewardship in ICU.

### Diagnostic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia with syndromic molecular testing: a randomized clinical trial [^346408a3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), are a leading cause of hospital admissions and mortality, with an estimated 489 million incidents and 2.5 million deaths annually worldwide. Despite their substantial value, microbiological diagnosis and targeted treatment are not received by most patients. Although culture-based methods are considered to be a standard approach in the bacteriological diagnosis of CAP, they are labor intensive, detect a pathogen in only 20% to 40% of patients, and are insufficient to influence early decisions on antimicrobial therapy.

Rapid syndromic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based panels have improved pathogen detection, potentially facilitating pathogen-directed treatment, reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics, and shortening hospital length of stay (LOS). Although the potential benefits of rapid PCR panels in CAP are clear, limited evidence currently supports their routine use. A few trials have examined patients with respiratory tract infections using molecular point-of-care tests (mPOCTs) for a combination of viruses and atypical bacteria, which yielded modest and conflicting results on antibiotic use and LOS. A recent randomized clinical trial examined patients with pneumonia using a comprehensive mPOCT and found an increase in result-directed therapy and de-escalation of antibiotics in the mPOCT group. However, the study included a mixture of patients from intensive care units with hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and CAP; thus, the findings may not be specifically applicable to patients with CAP.

In this trial, we aimed to determine whether the judicious use of a syndromic PCR-based panel for rapid testing of CAP in the emergency department (ED) leads to faster, more accurate microbiological test result–based treatment. Findings from this trial can potentially inform future guidelines on the management of CAP.

### Rapid molecular tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other respiratory viruses: a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact studies [^00210bee]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

To determine which rapid test to implement, the overall diagnostic accuracy of a multiplex test may then be more important than its individual pathogen accuracy, whereas in the current diagnostic accuracy reviews, overall sensitivity and specificity are often given per virus instead of per assay. However, it should be noted that judging discrepant viral results similarly for multiplex and singleplex assays will result in poorer diagnostic accuracy, mainly specificity, of multiplex assays. Therefore, when comparing different available rapid molecular assays — for example, Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV and FilmArray — it should always be noted that differences in diagnostic accuracy between these assays can result from testing a different number of viral pathogens while the diagnostic accuracy per individual viral pathogen may be similar.

Former studies assessing the effect of testing with conventional multiplex assays providing results within 24–48 hours showed no effect on antibiotic treatment and hospital length of stay. However, more rapid testing for respiratory viruses might improve the impact on clinical outcomes as results are available before any initial treatment or management is established by the treating physician. To our knowledge, this is the first review to specifically assess the clinical impact of rapid molecular tests, and not rapid antigen tests, without a restriction in the detection of influenza virus and RSV. The included studies, even the high-quality randomized studies, show heterogeneous results. The location of the rapid test, which was at the point of care in only 3 studies, may affect turnaround times and thereby clinical outcomes. Apart from other differences in design, and in analysis and power, differences in the implementation strategy might partially explain these discrepancies. First, education and training of personnel and physicians on the implemented rapid test, its diagnostic accuracy, and its potential effects on clinical outcomes may contribute to its effect on clinical outcomes. Second, a combination of a rapid test and a result-based guideline on subsequent clinical management options might have more impact than a stand-alone diagnostic test, even though the 2 studies describing the implementation of a diagnostic bundle did not show any significant effects of their implementation, which might be partially explained by limited adherence to these guidelines. A complicating factor therein is that identification of a viral pathogen from a respiratory tract sample may not necessarily attribute causation. Third, a combination of a rapid test and another diagnostic as procalcitonin or other biomarker-based assays may increase the persuasiveness of the rapid viral test on whether there is a bacterial or viral causative pathogen. However, current evidence for the effect of the combination of respiratory viral testing and procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is disappointing.

### Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections [^c624f53c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 CFUs/reaction (8333 CFUs/mL). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. The specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Developing molecular amplification methods for rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infections caused by bacterial pathogens [^59a6199b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Current diagnostic methods for bacterial respiratory tract infections are slow and often of marginal value for patient management if the adequacy of the specimen is not confirmed before culture. Molecular amplification tests, which are highly sensitive, can provide results in hours rather than days but may not distinguish colonization from infection unless a quantification step is included. Defining the reference method to be used for evaluating a novel molecular assay, with input from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is critical before initiating development of a potential product. Although expectorated sputum may be the clinician's specimen of choice for testing because of ease of collection, the poor quality of such specimens may pose problems for clinical trials of novel amplification tests. There are still many gaps in our understanding of the interplay between colonization and infection and of the role that amplification tests may play in guiding anti-infective therapy. Thus, the performance parameters of a new diagnostic method should be closely matched to a precisely defined intended use statement.

### The utility of syndromic respiratory pathogen panels: the premise of flexible and customizable approaches [^fed23957]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Viral upper respiratory tract infections are among the most common healthcare problems and reasons for healthcare visits. Although most cases are self-limiting and do not require medical intervention, severe disease can occur, particularly in elderly, immunocompromised, and pediatric patients. Available interventions are limited to antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, as well as vaccines currently recommended for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Seasonal and year-round disease can be caused by various virus groups beyond SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. Symptoms often overlap, and the clinical diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections lacks specificity. As a result, molecular diagnosis has become the gold standard for accurate identification.

Various molecular assays and technologies are available for respiratory viral testing. These include single-target tests, panels for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV, as well as extended panels that multiplex testing for 19 or more respiratory viral and bacterial targets. Current recommendations favor testing, primarily when results inform patient management or infection control decisions. However, testing decisions are influenced by multiple factors, including access, cost, patient symptoms, immune status, healthcare settings, laboratory complexity, and available test options. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed testing for all other respiratory viral pathogens. During respiratory virus season, testing volumes for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV increase. Testing for other respiratory viral pathogens is less common and generally limited to immunocompromised, hospitalized, and pediatric patients.

### The role of rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels in the clinical management of infections in critically ill patients: an experts-opinion document [^393f3dc1]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Commercially available RMMSP typically offer turnaround times of 1–4.5 h. Overall, they enhance microbial detection compared to standard procedures like bacterial culture, potentially speeding up pathogen identification and treatment initiation. RMMSP, when combined with antimicrobial stewardship efforts, play a crucial role in clinical decision-making, however, although some recent publications have shown promising results, their impact on patient clinical and economical outcomes requires further investigation through studies with large sample sizes and preferably clinical trial designs.

RMMSP offer mainly qualitative results, though some provide (semi)quantitative values for specific bacterial targets, and some are suitable for point-of-care testing.

Proper interpretation of PCR detection results is challenging due to the test's ultra sensitivity. This precision enables detection of pathogens or resistance mechanisms, even when present only as colonizers, which may lead to unnecessary treatments. Literature reports overdiagnosis rates of 49% for the mecA gene, 27% for ESBL, and 15–38% for carbapenem resistance genes unrelated to clinical conditions.

Careful interpretation of positive results from RMMSP is crucial, as they may detect colonization or molecular remnants rather than active infection, particularly in non-sterile fluids. This highlights the importance of diagnostic stewardship to differentiate between infection and colonization. Commercial RMMSPs are standardized, encompassing nucleic acid extraction, amplification, detection, and reporting, which minimizes the need for direct specimen handling.

Effective use of these results demands specialized training, encompassing test interpretation, result integration, and patient management. Collaborative protocols and strong partnerships between microbiologists and intensivists are essential. Crucially, PCR findings must be contextualized with pretest probabilities, culture results, and the patient's clinical status.

Table 1 outlines clinical situations where the interpretation of molecular test results may be limited due to insufficient data or clinical biases.

### New developments in rapid diagnostic testing for children [^6ca4f695]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The advent of new diagnostics assays for Group A Streptococcus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus now provide rapid results with increased sensitivity and specificity. Molecular testing is no longer confined to the walls of the laboratory, but moving to the patient in the form of point-of-care tests. In addition, multiplex syndromic panels are allowing broad testing of pathogens associated with a single clinical presentation. This article focuses specifically on rapid diagnostic tests for pathogens most affecting children. Rapid and accurate pathogen detection in children may result in decreased time to optimal antimicrobial treatment and improved patient outcomes.

### Evaluation of a molecular point-of-care testing for viral and atypical pathogens on intravenous antibiotic duration in hospitalized adults with lower respiratory tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^a6529b6c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate whether a molecular point-of-care test (POCT) for viral and atypical pathogens added to routine real-time PCR could reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics in hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) compared with routine real-time PCR.

Methods

In this single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled study, we enrolled hospitalized adults diagnosed with LRTI. Patients were randomized to an intervention group (POCT FilmArray Panel for 20 viruses, atypical pathogens and bacteria plus routine real-time PCR) or a control group (routine real-time PCR for ten pathogens). The primary outcome was duration of intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization. The secondary outcomes included length of stay, cost of hospitalization and de-escalation within 72 hours and between 72 hours and 7 days. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.

Results

Between October 2017 and July 2018, we enrolled 800 eligible patients (398 in the intervention group and 402 in the control group). Duration of intravenous antibiotics in the intervention group was shorter than in the control (7.0 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5.0–9.0) versus 8.0 days (IQR 6.0–11.0); p < 0.001). Length of hospital stay in the intervention group was significantly shorter (8.0 days (IQR 7.0–11.0) versus 9.0 days (IQR 7.0–12.0; p < 0.001) and the cost of hospitalization in the intervention group was significantly lower ($1804.7 (IQR 1298.4–2633.8) versus $2042.5 (IQR 1427.4–2926.2); p 0.002) than control group. More patients in the intervention group achieved de-escalation within 72 hours (7.9%, 29/367 versus 3.2%, 12/377; p 0.005) and between 72 hours and 7 days (29.7%, 109/367 versus 22.0%, 83/377; p 0.024).

Conclusions

Use of molecular POCT testing for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens might help to reduce intravenous antibiotic use in hospitalized LRTI patients.

Microbiological diagnostic stewardship concept and complement to classical microbiological tests

Microbiological diagnostic stewardship programs aim to optimize diagnostic techniques, supporting appropriate, cost-effective clinical, therapeutic, and preventive decision-making. Their implementation can reduce overdiagnosis, promote correct antimicrobial use, and enhance patient safety and care. Effective stewardship requires actions such as developing a service portfolio, establishing multidisciplinary committees, utilizing a laboratory information system, implementing quality assurance, conducting cost-effectiveness assessments, providing education programs for nurses and technicians, and continuously evaluating the program.

### Point-of-care respiratory diagnosis and antibiotic utilization in the emergency department: a prospective evaluation of multiplex PCR [^46cca6c1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Rapid multiplex point-of-care (POC) PCR tests may reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing by quickly identifying viral etiologies in patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI). We evaluated the impact of a rapid (~15min) multiplex PCR test on antibiotic prescribing, provider confidence, patient satisfaction, and emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS).

Methods

We conducted a prospective, single-center study (March 2024-January 2025) enrolling adults presenting to an urban academic ED with ARI symptoms. Participants underwent rapid multiplex PCR testing (BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory Panel), with results provided to clinicians in real time. Antibiotic prescribing, provider and patient perceptions, and ED LOS were assessed through surveys and electronic health record review. A propensity-matched control cohort was used to compare antibiotic prescribing and LOS. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescribing among patients with a confirmed viral etiology; secondary outcomes included overall antibiotic prescribing, ED LOS, and provider-and patient-reported measures.

Results

A total of 200 patients were enrolled (mean age 43years; 56.5% female). Common presenting symptoms included cough (80%), congestion (65%), and sore throat (55%). Patients with confirmed viral infections were significantly less likely to receive antibiotics than those with no detected pathogen (6.5% vs. 20.2%; OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10–0.68; p = 0.009). Overall antibiotic prescribing rates were similar between experimental and control cohorts (14.9% vs. 12.0%; p = 0.392), but median ED LOS was significantly shorter in the experimental group (4.3 vs. 6.5h; OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.59–0.74; p < 0.001). Provider diagnostic confidence was high (76%), and most patients reported high satisfaction with testing (92%).

Conclusions

Rapid multiplex PCR testing was associated with reduced antibiotic prescribing for viral infections, shorter ED LOS, high provider confidence, and high patient satisfaction. These findings support the value of ultra-rapid diagnostics for antimicrobial stewardship and patient-centered care in the ED.

Results from our setting regarding LRTI treatment.

Since 2012, our team has been investigating the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of acute respiratory tract infections in southern Sri Lanka. – We have shown that LRTI is the most common indication for antibacterial use in the inpatient setting for both children and adults. Similarly, we have shown that respiratory tract infections are the most common indication for antibacterial use among outpatients. From 2018 through 2021, we conducted the Respiratory Infection Severity and Etiology in Sri Lanka study, enrolling over 1,000 hospitalized children and adults meeting a clinical case definition for LRTI. We conducted comprehensive etiological testing, including blood cultures, sputum cultures, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal samples for respiratory pathogens, and urine antigen testing for S. pneumoniae, as well as multiplex PCR testing of sputum samples for respiratory pathogens among a subset. Physicians with experience in clinical medicine and infectious diseases reviewed clinical and laboratory data, imaging findings, and etiological testing results to clinically adjudicate the etiology of illness for each patient. Approximately half of our cohort did not have a clear etiology of illness identified, as is commonly seen with LRTIs. However, among those who did have an etiology identified, approximately 50% had a viral etiology, 25% had a bacterial etiology, and 25% had a noninfectious etiology. Over 80% of children and adults with viral etiologies and noninfectious etiologies (as well as bacterial etiologies) received treatment with antibacterials, suggesting a high prevalence of inappropriate antibacterial use in our setting. Low-cost interventions to better diagnose LRTI etiology and target antibacterial treatment may be helpful in our setting and other similar LMIC contexts.

Algorithm-based tools to improve antibacterial prescribing for clinical syndromes.

Algorithm-based tools to improve antibacterial prescribing have been developed for LMICs, especially for acute febrile illness (AFI). These tools are largely based on using patient-level data, with newer strategies incorporating point-of-care (POC) testing to alter the probability of a certain pathogen causing disease. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI) approaches by the WHO were among the first algorithm-based tools developed for LMICs and were created to provide basic syndromic definitions for diagnosis and treatment. – However, the IMCI/IMAI do not capture local epidemiology well, if at all, and are designed to maximize sensitivity for bacterial infection over specificity, with the result that patients may be overtreated with antibacterials.

### Impact of syndromic molecular diagnostics on antimicrobial adequacy and time to therapy in critically ill patients with pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^d1cb109b]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients and is a common reason for ICU admission and antimicrobial initiation worldwide. Accurate and timely identification of the etiologic pathogen is essential to guide early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, minimize unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, and improve clinical outcomes. However, conventional microbiological cultures often have low sensitivity, are affected by prior antibiotic administration, and can require 48–72 h to yield actionable results.

In recent years, molecular diagnostic techniques, particularly multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, have been introduced into clinical practice to address these limitations. These platforms allow for the rapid and simultaneous detection of a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens directly from respiratory specimens, with results typically available within hours. Several syndromic panels also incorporate resistance gene detection, potentially enabling earlier antimicrobial tailoring and stewardship interventions.

Although the theoretical advantages of syndromic PCR are considerable, the clinical impact of these diagnostic tests in ICU patients with pneumonia remains uncertain. While some studies report improved pathogen detection, more frequent and earlier antibiotic de-escalation, and reduced antibiotic duration, others fail to show consistent benefits in terms of mortality or stewardship endpoints. Notably, the time to effective antibiotic administration is an actionable metric in critical care, as delays in initiating appropriate therapy are strongly associated with worse outcomes, including prolonged organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Syndromic PCR may help shorten this interval by providing rapid, targeted results, but the extent to which this translates into clinical benefit remains uncertain. Moreover, concerns persist regarding the potential for overdiagnosis, misinterpretation of colonization, and cost-effectiveness.

Given the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the clinical utility of syndromic molecular diagnostics in critically ill patients with pneumonia, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing these platforms with standard microbiological culture. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, selected as the most objective and patient-centered endpoint. Secondary outcomes included the adequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy and time to effective antibiotic administration, both representing key process-of-care measures linked to prognosis in severe infections. This outcome framework was designed to capture not only the potential downstream impact on survival but also the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of syndromic PCR in the acute management of pneumonia in the intensive care setting.

Conclusion

Results suggest that early use of rm-PCR in pneumonia could reduce unnecessary antimicrobial exposure without compromising the appropriateness of the treatment. Together with an expert advice, this promising diagnostic tool could improve the quality of care and participate in the reduction of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents' use. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results, identify categories of patients that would most benefit from the test, and define precise guidelines to appropriately adjust the empirical therapy based on the results.

### The role of rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels in the clinical management of infections in critically ill patients: an experts-opinion document [^a5659da6]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients has been associated with worse outcomes, including increased in-hospital mortality and morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs. Co-morbidities and the infecting pathogens significantly impact infection severity, leading to severe outcomes. Optimal antibiotic use in ICUs is essential, as 30–60% of antibiotics prescribed are unnecessary or inappropriate, and at least 20% of patients experience adverse effects. While timely treatment is vital for sepsis survival, bacterial resistance complicates effectiveness, contributing to higher mortality. The rise of multi- and pan-drug-resistant pathogens complicates empirical antibiotic selection, often leading to combinations that increase toxicity, costs, and resistance. Since the FDA approved the first respiratory syndromic panel in 2011, molecular syndromic panels have been used to improve diagnosis and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by guiding targeted therapy. Although molecular testing can improve pathogen identification and treatment tailoring and occasionally may replace conventional culture procedures in gastrointestinal infections, it must not replace conventional culture procedures in other scenarios, particularly when phenotypic susceptibility testing is needed. Interpreting molecular syndromic panel results can be complex, as detecting a target does not confirm it as the causative agent, and genotypic resistance markers may not always reflect in vivo expression, causing discrepancies with phenotypic susceptibility. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to widespread use of these panels in clinical microbiology, especially for critically ill patients, where their use should be justified. This document reviews commercially available FDA and/or CE-marked Rapid Multiplex Molecular Syndromic Panels (RMMSP), capable of detecting multiple pathogens (at least five), including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and/or parasites most frequently associated with specific clinical syndromes (e.g. respiratory infections, meningitis, or gastrointestinal diseases), and for some platforms, genotypic markers of antimicrobial resistance with results provided in less than 6 h. In addition, due to the general self-limiting nature of infectious gastrointestinal disease in the majority of cases, these were not included in our evaluation. The goal was to provide updated, practical information on their use, diagnostic timing, and management of infections in critically ill patients, including pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and off-label applications of syndromic panels.

### Rapid multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses reduces time to result and improves clinical care: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0b406bab]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The clinical impact of rapid sample-to-answer "syndromic" multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for respiratory viruses is not clearly established. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate this impact for patients with possible acute respiratory tract infection in the hospital setting.

Methods

We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases from 2012 to present and conference proceedings from 2021 for studies comparing clinical impact outcomes between multiplex PCR testing and standard testing.

Results

Twenty-seven studies with 17,321 patient encounters were included in this review. Rapid multiplex PCR testing was associated with a reduction of - 24.22 h (95% CI -28.70 to -19.74 h) in the time to results. Hospital length of stay was decreased by -0.82 days (95% CI -1.52 to -0.11 days). Among influenza positive patients, antivirals were more likely to be given (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06–1.48) and appropriate infection control facility use was more common with rapid multiplex PCR testing (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.16–2.07).

Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates a reduction in time to results and length of stay for patients overall along with improvements in appropriate antiviral and infection control management among influenza-positive patients. This evidence supports the routine use of rapid sample-to-answer multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses in the hospital setting.

Molecular assays (including rapid molecular assay, multiplex PCR, RT-PCR) — test characteristics and interpretation: These tests have high sensitivity and very high specificity, can be used for both outpatients and hospitalized patients, and RT-PCR assays should be used for hospitalized patients. When influenza activity is low, a negative result has high negative predictive value and is very likely to be a true-negative, especially if an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected < 4 days after illness onset, whereas a positive result has low positive predictive value and a false-positive result is possible. When influenza activity is high, a negative result has low negative predictive value, may be a true-negative in a patient without lower respiratory tract disease, but clinicians should consider potential for a false-negative result, especially if an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected in a hospitalized patient; for hospitalized patients on mechanical ventilation who tested negative on upper respiratory tract specimens, collect lower respiratory tract specimens (endotracheal aspirate, BAL fluid) for testing. When influenza activity is high, a positive result has high positive predictive value and is likely to be a true-positive result.

### Multicenter evaluation of QIAstat-Dx respiratory panel V2 for detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens [^e2a4a2b6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Upper and lower respiratory tract infections are a major cause of hospitalization, and their morbidity and mortality result in a significant economic burden. A variety of respiratory pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, can cause respiratory tract infections. As infections with these pathogens result in very similar clinical symptoms, empirical antimicrobial treatment is often initiated based on the clinical severity and epidemiological season before microbiological confirmation. In addition, hospital outbreaks of infections by (viral) respiratory pathogens are common and are consistently associated with significant morbidity, mortality, high pressure on isolation facilities, and increased health care costs. Thus, the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory tract infections is critical to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy and for the effective implementation of infection control measures.

Over the past 2 decades, advances in routine molecular diagnostics have revolutionized the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. Implementation of multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays has allowed detection of multiple respiratory pathogens in a single test with high sensitivity and specificity. One limitation is the number of fluorophores that can be differentiated by real-time PCR instruments; therefore, a maximum of five respiratory pathogens can generally be detected simultaneously in a single reaction. This means that multiple RT-PCR assays must be performed for each sample to cover the wide variety of pathogens that can cause respiratory tract infections. Recently, however, several molecular-method-based syndromic testing systems have become available that overcome this limitation. These systems can detect up to 22 respiratory pathogens in a single test with a very easy sample-to-answer workflow and a turnaround time of less than 2 h, making them suitable for decentralized or even point-of-care (POC) testing.

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) — diagnostic landscape and multiplex testing: LRTIs are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and span syndromes from community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia to bronchiolitis and pleural space infections; culture detects no pathogens in 40% to 60% of cases, and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) has only recently become standard for viral and limited bacterial targets. The diagnostic gold standard remains culture of sputum, bronchial washes, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, with Gram stain to establish specimen quality and semiquantitative reporting to prioritize organisms. Routine methods are clinically suboptimal because some LRTI pathogens fail to grow and normal flora can yield false positives; NAAT or specialized media with extended incubation may be required for atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, or Bordetella pertussis. Molecular laboratory-developed procedures (singleplex and multiplex) have targeted S. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and B. pertussis, but increased detection raises colonization concerns and lack of standardization limits clinical utility beyond single-center studies. Several multiplex assays (xTAG RVP, xTAG RVP Fast, xTAG respiratory pathogen panel, Verigene Respiratory Pathogens Flex, FilmArray RP and RP2, eSensor RVP, ePlex respiratory pathogen panel) are FDA approved for upper respiratory tract secretions only, and in 2018 assays for lower respiratory specimens received FDA-cleared status.

INTRODUCTION

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), including syndromes such as bronchitis, infective exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia, is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization globally. Historically, bacterial etiologies of LRTI have been the most feared owing to the possibility of fatal outcomes if misdiagnosed and undertreated. The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of LRTI and LRTI mortality. However, the advent of molecular diagnostics has shown that viruses are an important cause of LRTI and are often more commonly identified than bacteria as the primary etiology of infection in both children and adults. – The true etiology of LRTI typically remains unknown in over 50% of patients in both clinical practice and research studies, given limitations associated with current diagnostics and factors such as prior antibiotic use.

Despite the high prevalence of viral LRTIs, antibacterial overuse for LRTI remains high, especially in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC) settings. The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the overuse of antibacterials for viral LRTIs. – The unnecessary use of antibacterials results in negative patient outcomes and fuels downstream antibacterial resistance, which was associated with over 4 million deaths globally in 2019. Most of the deaths due to antibiotic-resistant infections are in LMICs, including sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which also bear the greatest burden of LRTIs. The LMICs thus face the dual challenge of appropriately targeting antibacterials for bacterial LRTIs while reducing inappropriate antibacterials for viral LRTIs.

### The proliferation of multiplex molecular testing for urinary tract infections… [^1afed30e]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Multiplex molecular tests for rapid pathogen detection and determination of antimicrobial resistance genes have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. However, appropriately ordering and interpreting molecular diagnostic tests is challenging, particularly for clinicians without infectious diseases training. Most existing rapid multiplex molecular panels, such as those for bloodstream, respiratory tract, and central nervous system infections, have been subjected to rigorous scientific testing and standardized regulatory approval through the US Food and Drug Administration. 1, 2 And still, these FDA-approved tests only improve clinical outcomes when coupled with guidance on test ordering. and interpretation of results, typically via oversight from an antimicrobial stewardship program.

2 Within this context, the rise in multiplex molecular tests for diagnosis of urinary tract infections is particularly concerning because these tests are not FDA approved, lack scientific evidence of clinical benefit, and are being used most in settings with limited infectious diseases expertise. To describe the current use of urine multiplex molecular tests and potential for patient harm, Hatfield and colleagues3 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention performed a large retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service coverage between 2016 and 2023, including more than 30 million beneficiaries annually. 3 They inferred urine multiplex molecular test use through physician office and laboratory services claims for unspecified multiplex molecular tests with an associated International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision primary diagnosis code indicating UTI.

This study3 highlights several important issues regarding the increasing use of urine multiplex molecular tests. First, widespread and unregulated use of these tests likely causes significant clinical harm to patients through misdiagnosis of UTI and unnecessary antibiotics. Even among patients with signs and symptoms of UTI, there is no rigorous evidence that urine multiplex molecular tests improve diagnosis or clinical outcomes. Two small observational studies6, 7 have described modest clinical benefits but both had methodologic flaws, and one7 was conducted by a company marketing urine molecular tests, suggesting high risk of bias. High utilization of urine multiplex molecular tests in care settings with potentially limited antimicrobial stewardship support, such as nursing homes and urology clinics, becomes especially concerning for increased patient harm through incorrect diagnoses and antibiotic overtreatment.

In conclusion, this study3 provides much needed data to begin addressing the concerning rise in urine multiplex molecular testing. Hopefully, it will be a catalyst for increased scrutiny and regulation of these tests from government agencies and independent and unbiased research into their clinical value. High-quality studies are urgently needed to develop standards for sample collection, processing, laboratory protocols, and reporting of results.

Advantages and disadvantages of implementing a molecular platform for diagnosis of critically ill patients.

Multiplex testing, which enables simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, has become integral to routine diagnostics, offering rapid results to guide patient management. However, these panels are more costly than single-plex tests, and the clinical relevance of some targets has been questioned. There are concerns about broad screening, especially for patients with community-acquired pneumonia, where the relevance of molecular techniques and prognosis remains unclear. While multiplex panels offer high sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value, they should not replace blood cultures and conventional testing. Their limitations include the inability to detect all pathogens, incomplete antibiotic susceptibility data, high costs, and potential false results, with debates about their impact on clinical outcomes. Although they can improve diagnostic efficiency, their cost-effectiveness remains uncertain, highlighting the need for careful evaluation before integration into clinical workflows.

The integration of molecular diagnostic platforms for critically ill patients offers notable advantages, particularly in achieving rapid and precise pathogen identification. However, their diagnostic impact is subject to variability influenced by factors such as local prescribing practices, clinical guidelines, and regional epidemiological trends. Furthermore, considerations such as associated costs, technical complexities, and inherent limitations of these platforms must be critically evaluated to ensure optimal implementation and utility.

The Table 3 summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of the RMMSP.

### D-PRISM: a global survey-based study to assess diagnostic and treatment approaches in pneumonia managed in intensive care [^4fa308ac]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The frequency of microbiological sampling differed between the sub-types of pneumonia, with 52% of respondents always taking samples in CAP but rising to 62% and 74% in HAP and VAP, respectively. However, this was well short of the 100% microbiological sampling in the guidelines for severe CAP and HAP/VAP. Microbiological testing is recommended to guide antimicrobial therapy for severe CAP and nosocomial lower respiratory infections, such as HAP and VAP. However, the strength of these recommendations is generally conditional with low quality of evidence, reflecting the balance between potential benefits and the limitations of current diagnostic methods. It should also be noted that only in 38% of cases of pneumonia is it possible to identify the microorganism causing pneumonia and that truly unbiased molecular detection remains a research tool. The higher sampling rates in HAP and VAP cases may reflect increasing diagnostic uncertainty where non-infectious mimics are more common. The use of deeper lung samples, including mini-BAL and bronchoscopic BAL, was also more common in ventilated HAP and VAP than ventilated CAP, perhaps reflecting greater concern regarding contamination of the proximal respiratory tract in those who have been hospitalized or ventilated for longer. Notably, however, guideline advocacy for invasive diagnostic techniques in this area is caveated by uncertainty as to the balance of risks of bronchoscopy against the benefits of improved antimicrobial stewardship; indeed, the U.S. guidelines weakly advise against invasive sampling.

Conventional microbiology was widely used, although it is notable that a significant proportion of low-and-middle-income respondents did not have this diagnostic modality available. The influence of the recent COVID-19 pandemic could be detected through the widespread availability of single-plex polymerase chain reaction testing. Although multiplex testing was also more widely available than anticipated, this may reflect the respondents' teaching/university hospital bias. While multiplex PCR offers better pathogen detection and more precise treatment options, its impact on patient outcomes remains underexplored. Research suggests that multiplex PCR testing can help start the correct antibiotics earlier and reduce the need for broad-spectrum treatments. However, the strength of this evidence varies; not all studies show the same level of benefit, and it is not yet clear whether this translates into better clinical or microbiological outcomes. Furthermore, although we did not ascertain how frequently these tests were used, many respondents reported barriers to use, especially in lower-income settings where most respondents reported cost and reagent availability as barriers.

### Nucleic acid-based testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^423f8d40]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Research needs for noninfluenza viral diagnostics in suspected CAP emphasize that there is a paucity of high-quality data on patient outcomes and an urgent need for prospective studies to determine the clinical value of nucleic acid–based viral diagnostics in outpatient and inpatient CAP, including pragmatic and implementation studies. Studies are specifically needed to define clinical impact on treatment decisions in patients with severe CAP and in those who are immunocompromised, to evaluate the impact of turnaround time using NAAT technologies, and to assess multiplex NAAT panel target composition, including differently sized panels, panels including separately targeted pathogens such as influenza viruses or SARS-CoV-2, and those that include nonviral pathogens such as atypical bacteria. Health system–integrated clinical reminders after viral testing may enhance NAAT impacts on antimicrobial use patterns but require formal evaluation, and nucleic acid amplification testing has infection-control implications in the hospital setting, especially where patients with severe CAP are managed, and this should be formally investigated. Well-designed pragmatic clinical trials will be instrumental in informing the value of NAATs for noninfluenza viral pathogens, and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of molecular diagnostics, with studies on patient outcomes and pandemic management ongoing.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^072806cc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19 disease, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The tests included in this review concern the identification of current infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is of importance. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia); or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require different patient management, and it is important to be able to identify them. Viral load may also be an indicator of disease severity (Zheng 2020), and whilst the accuracy of antigen and molecular tests have the potential to be affected by participant viral load, the main aim of rapid testing is not to establish viral load. In this review, we therefore consider the role of point‐of‐care tests for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of any severity.

Index test(s)

The primary consideration for the eligibility of tests for inclusion in this review is that they should detect current infection and should have the capacity to be performed at the 'point of care' or in a 'near‐patient' testing role. There is an ongoing debate around the specific use and definitions of these terms, therefore for the purposes of this review, we consider 'point‐of‐care' and 'near patient' to be synonymous, but for consistency and avoidance of confusion, we use the term 'point‐of‐care' throughout.

We have adapted a definition of point‐of‐care testing, namely that it "refers to decentralized testing that is performed by a minimally trained healthcare professional near a patient and outside of central laboratory testing" (WHO 2018), with the additional caveat that test results must be available within a single clinical encounter (Pai 2012). The key criteria for test inclusion are therefore:

### Diagnostic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia with syndromic molecular testing: a randomized clinical trial [^84bb5037]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), are a leading cause of hospital admissions and mortality. Molecular tests have the potential to optimize treatment decisions and management of CAP, but limited evidence exists to support their routine use.

Objective

To determine whether the judicious use of a syndromic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based panel for rapid testing of CAP in the emergency department (ED) leads to faster, more accurate microbiological test result-based treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This parallel-arm, single-blinded, single-center, randomized clinical superiority trial was conducted between September 25, 2020, and June 21, 2022, in the ED of Haukeland University Hospital, a large tertiary care hospital in Bergen, Norway. Adult patients who presented to the ED with suspected CAP were recruited. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the intervention arm or standard-of-care arm. The primary outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Intervention

Patients randomized to the intervention arm received rapid syndromic PCR testing (BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia plus Panel; bioMérieux) of LRT samples and standard of care. Patients randomized to the standard-of-care arm received standard microbiological diagnostics alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 2 primary outcomes were the provision of pathogen-directed treatment based on a microbiological test result and the time to provision of pathogen-directed treatment (within 48 hours after randomization).

Results

There were 374 patients (221 males [59.1%]; median (IQR) age, 72 [60–79] years) included in the trial, with 187 in each treatment arm. Analysis of primary outcomes showed that 66 patients (35.3%) in the intervention arm and 25 (13.4%) in the standard-of-care arm received pathogen-directed treatment, corresponding to a reduction in absolute risk of 21.9 (95% CI, 13.5–30.3) percentage points and an odds ratio for the intervention arm of 3.53 (95% CI, 2.13–6.02; P < .001). The median (IQR) time to provision of pathogen-directed treatment within 48 hours was 34.5 (31.6–37.3) hours in the intervention arm and 43.8 (42.0–45.6) hours in the standard-of-care arm (mean difference, -9.4 hours; 95% CI, -12.7 to -6.0 hours; P < .001). The corresponding hazard ratio for intervention compared with standard of care was 3.08 (95% CI, 1.95–4.89). Findings remained significant after adjustment for season.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this randomized clinical trial indicated that routine deployment of PCR testing for LRT pathogens led to faster and more targeted microbial treatment for patients with suspected CAP. Rapid molecular testing could complement or replace selected standard, time-consuming, laboratory-based diagnostics.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^08beb958]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — upper respiratory specimen collection and labeling considerations emphasize that swab collection of the upper respiratory tract is not uniform, creating uncertainty about whether the specimen is optimal even with NP collections. FDA approval of individual nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), including multiplex assays that also test for other respiratory pathogens, specifically indicates collection and specimen type(s), and failure to adhere to label requirements — unless otherwise approved through a lab developed test (LDT) validation or authorized by the FDA through a subsequent EUA for different collection or specimen type — can lead to inaccurate results and reimbursement denials. For community and outpatient testing, the benefits support the use of alternative collection methods and specimen types, and studies comparing NP against alternative upper respiratory collection methods using a more comprehensive reference method are needed.

### Molecular diagnostics for detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia [^2e4f6a7d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Traditional microbiological methods for detection of respiratory tract pathogens can be slow, are often not sensitive, may not distinguish infection from colonization, and are influenced by previous antibiotic therapy. Molecular diagnostic tests for common and atypical causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia have the potential to dramatically increase the diagnostic yield and decrease the time required to render results. Unfortunately, these tests often lack standardization and are not widely available. Consideration should be given to the development and evaluation of companion molecular diagnostic tests for detection of respiratory pathogens in future clinical trials of antimicrobials intended to treat community-acquired pneumonia.

### Impact of molecular point-of-care testing on clinical management and in-hospital costs of patients suspected of influenza or RSV infection: a modeling study [^67655a96]. Journal of Medical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

At hospital admission, patients suspected of infection with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are placed in isolation, pending the outcome of diagnostics. In a significant number, isolated care proves unnecessary. We investigated the potential impact of molecular point-of-care (POC) diagnostics on patient management and in-hospital costs.

Method

Prospective collection of data on resource utilization within the hospital from consecutive patients 18 years or older presenting at our university medical center with symptoms of respiratory tract infection from December 2016 to April 2017. A cost analysis was conducted using Markov modeling comparing the actual course of events (on the basis of routine diagnostic tests) with two hypothetical scenarios: when POC would impact time to diagnosis only (scenario 1) or on discharge from the hospital, too (scenario 2).

Results

A total of 283 patients were included, of whom 217 (76.7%) were admitted. Influenza and RSV were detected in 31% and 7% of the patients, respectively. Fifty-four percent of patients tested negative, of which 79% were kept in isolated care waiting for test results, with a median duration of 24 hours. Median length of stay was 6.0 days. Mean total in-hospital costs per patient were € 5243. Introducing POC would lower mean costs per patient to € 4904 (scenario 1) and € 4206 (scenario 2). At the hospital level, this would result in a total cost reduction of € 95 937 to € 293 471 in a single influenza season.

Conclusions

Introducing POC testing for patients presenting with symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection can reduce time-to-diagnosis, hospital stay and, thereby, in-hospital costs.

### Multicenter evaluation of the bioFire filmArray pneumonia / pneumonia plus panel for detection and quantification of agents of lower respiratory tract infection [^cbc4dcb6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are clinical conditions that arise throughout the population. Community-acquired pneumonia is estimated to be the most common cause of infectious disease-related mortality in the United States and globally and is a leading cause of hospital and emergency room visits. The highest morbidity and mortality of these illnesses are frequently seen in the elderly, children < 5 years of age, and the immunocompromised. Pneumonia-like illness is also a frequent hospital-acquired infection that can result in increased mortality and unnecessary economic burden.

Bacteria and viruses are the most common etiologies of lower respiratory tract infections. Patients with viral pneumonia may be managed differently than those with bacterial infections, but due to similarities in clinical presentation and symptomatology, it is not possible to distinguish viral from bacterial infections without the aid of laboratory diagnostic testing. Rapid diagnostics for specific entities (and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) and host markers (procalcitonin) exist for the detection of common viral and bacterial illness and/or to aid in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections. These methods alone are frequently inadequate as a means to diagnose and treat pneumonia.

### Molecular diagnostic methods in pneumonia [^edfc0024]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Molecular techniques offer the promise of improving diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. This review focuses on currently used molecular diagnostic techniques for various types of pneumonia and highlights potential future applications of this technology.

Recent Findings

Lower respiratory tract infections result in a high degree of morbidity and mortality, but a definitive microbiologic diagnosis is often not obtained by traditional culture or serologic methods. In addition, culture of certain organisms may be difficult or require extended periods of time. Molecular techniques have the potential to improve diagnostic yield and decrease time to pathogen identification. These techniques are also helpful in the determination of drug sensitivity and the understanding of transmission and outbreaks. Most currently used techniques employ some variation of the polymerase chain reaction. Limitations include high costs, the need for specialized equipment, and problems with false-positive and -negative results.

Summary

Molecular diagnosis of pneumonia has the potential to improve identification of pathogens in patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection. Limitations of molecular techniques currently prevent their widespread use, but future developments will likely lead to inclusion of these tests in routine diagnostic evaluations.

### Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections [^51e8c697]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients with lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice.

Current standard diagnostic methods for respiratory bacteria are culture-based and typically take 24–72 h. Culture also has low sensitivity; a positive microbiological diagnosis may only be made in approximately 30% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. As a wide range of pathogens can cause LRTI, it is common to request a mixture of different diagnostic tests, including culture, antigen testing, and serology, on a number of different specimen types. In contrast, the routine use of viral multiplex real-time PCR (mRT-PCR) assays allows a single respiratory specimen to be screened for a large number of respiratory viruses easily within the working day.

We sought to improve the sensitivity and turn-around time of microbiological diagnosis of LRTI in our centre by developing a quantitative bacterial mRT-PCR approach. At the same time, we wanted to simplify the process by testing the same LRT specimen extract used for viral mRT-PCR and using the same PCR platforms, thus fitting in with our current workflow and minimizing costs. A key requirement was the ability to determine the bacterial load in order to provide information that may be clinically useful in excluding LRT specimen contamination with oral commensal bacteria.

Real-time PCR assays for some common respiratory bacteria have been described, but no single assay covers the wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens required for LRTI diagnosis. Furthermore, some assays have a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity for organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, owing to the use of suboptimal gene targets. Several molecular respiratory pathogen panels are currently commercially available or in development. Typically, these are more expensive than PCRs developed in-house, lack a full range of viral and bacterial targets, are non-quantitative, or require specific testing platforms.

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two mRT-PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of the following eight respiratory bacterial pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis (mRT-PCR 1), and Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii (mRT-PCR 2).

### Nucleic acid-based testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^d000940c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Research Needs

The development of this document revealed a paucity of high-quality data related to the impact of diagnosing noninfluenza viral infections on patient outcomes in suspected CAP. This underscores the urgent need for prospective studies to determine the influence of nucleic acid–based viral diagnostics in the management of outpatient and inpatient CAP, including pragmatic and implementation studies. Studies are specifically needed to determine the clinical impact of these diagnostics on treatment decisions in patients with severe CAP and in those who are immunocompromised. Such studies may reveal the impact of turnaround time using NAAT technologies to diagnose viral pneumonias on important patient outcomes. Studies are also needed to better assess the impact of multiplex NAAT panel target composition. This can allow insight into the clinical benefit of differently sized panels, as well as into those that include pathogens that are often separately targeted (e.g. influenza viruses or SARS-CoV-2) or those that include nonviral pathogens (e.g. atypical bacteria).

Improved clinical identification of common respiratory viral pathogens may promote the development of novel therapies to manage and prevent these infections. Studies demonstrating efficacy of such viral agents could subsequently improve antimicrobial stewardship practices. Relatedly, health system–integrated clinical reminders after viral testing may further enhance NAAT impacts on antibiotic use patterns, although this also requires formal evaluation. Nucleic acid amplification testing has infection-control implications in the hospital setting, especially where patients with severe CAP are managed, and this should be formally investigated. Well-designed pragmatic clinical trials will be instrumental in informing the use of NAATs for noninfluenza viral pathogens. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of molecular diagnostics in the diagnosis, management, and surveillance of viral respiratory infections. Studies to assess the impact of such testing on patient outcomes and pandemic management are ongoing.

### Effect of point of care testing for C reactive protein and training in communication skills on antibiotic use in lower respiratory tract infections: cluster randomised trial [^1aa914de]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Contrasting broad approaches to improved management in general medicine have been emphasised. A disease focused approach seeks to improve diagnosis, whereas the illness focused, patient centred approach emphasises understanding the whole patient and sharing decisions, which may be more contingent on clear information about prognosis rather than making an accurate diagnosis. A combination of these approaches, however, may be required to achieve the best outcome for patients. We evaluated the effect of two interventions on achieving evidence based management of lower respiratory tract infections in primary care.

Lower respiratory tract infection is one of the commonest acute reasons to consult, accounting for 17 million consultations in the European Union and 11 million in the United States each year. Acute bronchitis accounts for 80% of lower respiratory tract infectionsand despite evidence of little or no benefit from antibiotics, up to 80% of patients consulting for this condition are prescribed them. Moreover, lower respiratory tract infection is associated with increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Everyday decisions about whether or what antibiotic to prescribe for lower respiratory tract infection therefore constitute an important part of the burden of antibiotic use that drives antimicrobial resistance.

Diagnostic or disease focused solutions address the limited value of medical history and physical examination in differentiating between pneumonia and self limiting acute bronchitis. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the chances of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, and general practitioners often prescribe to give patients "the benefit of the doubt" in the face of possible pneumonia and possible clinical benefitespecially since routinely requesting chest radiography for all patients with lower respiratory tract infection is neither feasible nor appropriate in most primary care settings. C reactive protein is a promising biomarker for improving the assessment of lower respiratory tract infection in primary care: it performs better in predicting the diagnosis of pneumonia than any individual or combination of clinical symptoms and signs in lower respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, it is feasible and robust as a point of care test, making it the best available biomarker to enhance the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection in primary care. However, there is no evidence from pragmatic trials that testing for C reactive protein safely reduces antibiotic prescribing for lower respiratory tract infection in primary care.

### A multicenter study to assess the performance of the point-of-care RT-PCR cobas SARS-CoV-2&influenza A / B nucleic acid test for use on the cobas liat system in comparison with centralized assays across healthcare facilities in the United States [^67ead74d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A POC RT-PCR test that combined measurement of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza subtypes with performance equivalent to routine centralized testing would provide a critical tool to improve the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and influenza. We found that the performance of the POC SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test was comparable to centralized testing methods. Centralized testing has long been considered the gold standard. With the ease of use and equivalent performance of the POC SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test, we are moving toward a reality in which these assays are an equally valuable option. A study of the POC Cobas Influenza A/B test (an RT-PCR test that detects only the influenza analyte) in the emergency department found that POC testing for influenza was useful in improving several metrics, including the indication for treatment with neuraminidase in positive cases. It is relevant to note that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfection can increase the risk of severe outcomes compared with those infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone, particularly for those coinfected with influenza A. Our study highlights the benefits of molecular multiplex POCTs to help improve the timely differentiation of respiratory diseases that share similar symptoms and support efforts to improve patient management.

### Clinical utility of advanced microbiology testing tools [^12f84585]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the introduction of new technologies has positively impacted both the diagnosis and treatment paradigms for infections. These tools are in the process of revolutionizing clinical microbiology testing in various settings. These include technologies such as matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), multiplex molecular diagnostic panels, and innovations that bring nucleic acid amplification testing to the point of care. The proteomic-based technology MALDI-TOF MS has seen wide adoption, particularly among academic hospitals. While this method still requires isolation and culture of pathogens, MALDI-TOF MS allows for the identification of a specific microbe based upon its unique proteomic fingerprint. MALDI-TOF MS has led to significant time and cost savings, as correct diagnoses are made more rapidly without the need for additional confirmatory tests. Multiplex molecular diagnostic panels are also being introduced more commonly for a variety of conditions, including sepsis and nonspecific syndromes, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) infections. Multiplex assays can combine tests for numerous pathogens and resistance markers in a single panel, which can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis and, in select situations, bypass the need for culture. Furthermore, improvements in engineering and technology have also led to the development of improved point-of-care (POC) tests, which are poised to significantly impact the future treatment paradigm for many infectious conditions, such as viral respiratory infections and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Low-complexity POC tests allow for nonlaboratory personnel (e.g. nurses and physician assistants) to conduct tests at the initial site of care, potentially allowing physicians to administer the therapy at the initial consultation and eliminating the need for follow-up assessments.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^453f20bb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

### C-reactive protein point-of-care testing for lower respiratory tract infections: a qualitative evaluation of experiences by GPs [^51b85cd4]. Family Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore GPs' attitudes to and experiences of introducing C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in primary care.

Methods

Semi-structured interview study with 20 GPs who participated in the IMPAC(3)T randomized trial evaluating the effect of GP use of CRP POCT on management of LRTI. Main outcomes were GPs' experiences and views about CRP POCT in general practice, including its role in guiding antibiotic prescribing decisions and applicability and implementation in daily practice.

Results

GPs expressed mainly positive attitudes. Test results were rapidly available to support diagnostic and therapeutic processes for LRTI and other common infections, enhancing patient and GP confidence in prescribing decisions and empowering GPs to prescribe antibiotics less often. GPs were concerned about responding to ambiguous test results. They regarded financial reimbursement for using the test as essential for successful uptake.

Conclusions

GPs were generally positive about CRP POCT, and they felt that it empowered them to safely prescribe fewer antibiotics for LRTI without alienating their patients. Successful wider implementation should address reimbursement and updating management guidelines to include the place of CRP POCT.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^a14db9e9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

What microbiologic and radiographic diagnostic tests are appropriate if antibiotics are started for patients with possible bacterial coinfection?

Recommendations

Before initiating antibiotics, HCP should attempt to establish a microbiologic diagnosis.
HCP should limit respiratory multiplex PCR tests to ICU patients and patients who require broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.
HCP should restrict repeat microbiologic testing to changes in a patient's clinical status.
HCP should perform a nasal MRSA swab for patients started on anti-MRSA treatment.
HCP should not perform routine testing for fungal infection in the absence of a clinical presentation that raises that concern.
HCP should review the necessity of antibiotics within 48–72 hours, as results from tests become available, and should de-escalate or discontinue antibiotic therapy based on those results and clinical response. Procalcitonin results may aid the de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotic treatments.
HCP should obtain chest radiographs to assess the extent of lung involvement, but daily repeat studies are not indicated. Use of CT of the chest should be reserved for circumstances in which results of the CT may result in a change in clinical management (eg, pulmonary embolus).

Discussion

As noted, HCP should not obtain microbiologic studies for patients without clinical signs and symptoms suggesting a bacterial coinfection. However, in all cases in which antibiotics are started in patients with severe disease (eg, in the ICU) and those requiring broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, HCP should obtain relevant samples, for example, sputum cultures and, as appropriate, lower respiratory PCR for a microbiologic diagnosis. Those tests can help HCP appropriately choose definitive therapy or identify opportunities to de-escalate or stop antibiotic treatments. Rapid multiplex PCR can have a role in antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patientsif clinicians are supported by ASPs to interpret and trust those results. Nasal PCR screening for MRSA allows de-escalation for anti-MRSA therapy (eg, vancomycin) in patients with severe CAP and those with risk factors (eg, recent hospitalization, recent receipt of antimicrobial therapy, or prior isolation of MRSA), and has been shown to have up to 100% negative predictive value, including for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Application of nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory and pneumonia panels in children with severe community-acquired pneumonia [^be06c9e4]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

In children, lower respiratory tract infections might be induced by pathogenic viruses and bacteria in the upper respiratory tract. Teo S.M. et al. reported that the nasopharyngeal microbiome in infants could impact the severity of lower respiratory infection. In addition, a respiratory microbiome study based on qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing could serve as a valid proxy for lower respiratory tract microbiota in childhood pneumonia, which can help to establish diagnostic and treatment strategies. Our study showed that the concordance rate of pathogens detected in the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens was high (96%), and the correlation of pathogen titers was good. When available, lower respiratory tract specimens are more diagnostically efficient than upper respiratory tract specimens (p < 0.001). In the real world, however, obtaining high‐quality lower respiratory tract specimens from children with lower respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, the use of upper respiratory tract specimens combined with highly sensitive pathogenic molecular detection techniques might be a potential diagnostic solution.

We found that clinicians tended to adjust their clinical diagnosis and management strategies when bacterial pathogens were detected in PP. Some bacteria grew in subsequent microbial cultures several days after the PP test. These findings suggest that initial detection by nucleic acid detection techniques such as PP or qPCR might have significant clinical implications in children, especially those suffering from severe CAP.

In our study, 53% (32/60) of children had human rhinovirus detected in their lower respiratory tract specimens, and six children had human rhinovirus (hRV) as the only detected pathogen. In addition, hRV qPCR RNA copies were significantly higher in lower respiratory tract specimens than in upper respiratory tract specimens. Human rhinovirus is the most common cause of respiratory diseases in children, accounting for more than half of acute upper respiratory tract infections, and is increasingly being linked to severe respiratory diseases, especially since molecular diagnostics have been developed. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, it has been observed that SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients coinfected with rhinovirus might be at similar or higher risk for increased clinical severity. Therefore, hRV found in the lower respiratory tract should no longer be viewed as a bystander only.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7dd81a4f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and the resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from: understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection; assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection or people needing critical care; and evaluating whether new biomarker tests can accurately identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or test for past infection and immunity.

We are creating and maintaining a suite of living systematic reviews to cover the roles of tests and patient characteristics in the diagnosis of COVID‐19. This review summarises evidence for the accuracy of rapid antigen and molecular tests, suitable for use at the point of care, as alternatives to standard laboratory‐based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), that are relied on for identifying current infection. If sufficiently accurate, point‐of‐care tests may have a greater impact on public health than RT‐PCR as they do not require the same technical expertise and laboratory capacity. These tests can be undertaken locally, avoiding the need for centralised testing facilities that rarely meet the needs of patients, caregivers, health workers and society as a whole, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. As these are rapid tests, their results can be returned within the same clinical encounter, facilitating timely decisions concerning the need for isolation.

### Nucleic acid-based testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bfddfe4d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Table 7 — Routine PCR versus rapid PCR viral + bacterial testing (Shengchen et al., 2019): A single-center, open-label randomized trial in 800 hospitalized patients with LRTI (398 intervention; 402 control), 57% with a final pneumonia diagnosis, compared POC multiplex PCR for 17 viral and 3 bacterial targets plus routine PCR with routine PCR for 10 viral pathogens. No significant difference was observed for i.v. antibiotic use (92.1% vs. 93.8%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 2.0%; P = 0.38), but the intervention shortened median i.v. antibiotic duration (7.5 vs. 8 d, 95% CI, −2.1 to −0.8 d; P < 0.001), increased antibiotic deescalation within 72 h (7.9% vs. 3.2%; 95% CI, 1.4% to 8.0%; P = 0.005), and reduced median hospital LOS (8 vs. 9 d; 95% CI, −1.6 to −0.4 d; P < 0.001).

### Multicenter evaluation of the bioFire filmArray pneumonia / pneumonia plus panel for detection and quantification of agents of lower respiratory tract infection [^f3625d67]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The occurrence and impact of viral and bacterial coinfections in pneumonia are not well characterized, but recent studies have shown that coinfection is not unusual in community-acquired pneumonia in adults and was responsible for higher morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is anticipated that the PN panel could significantly affect the management of patients with coinfections.

Current algorithms for the diagnosis of pneumonia can include multiple methods; molecular methods are most common for viral agents and many atypical bacteria, and culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Culture suffers from lower sensitivity than molecular methods, in addition to variable methods of interpretation and reporting among and within an institution. Culture can also take an average of 48 to 72 h for actionable results to become available. Implementation of the PN panel will require consideration of appropriate test utilization in individual patient populations, but it has the potential to be a powerful decision-making tool for patient management. This panel could be utilized for rapid de-escalation or initiation of antibiotics and promoting improved patient care outcomes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical impact of this panel and the significance of molecular detection in the absence of culture confirmation. Some of the data from this trial have been examined to determine the potential impact on patient care.

Specimen handling and regulatory notes for influenza tests: Negative results may not rule out influenza, and respiratory tract specimens should be collected as close to illness onset as possible; clinicians should consult the manufacturer's package insert for approved specimen types. Most FDA‑cleared influenza diagnostic tests are approved for upper respiratory tract specimens but not for sputum or lower respiratory tract specimens. Specificities are generally high (> 90%) for all tests compared to RT‑PCR. FDA‑cleared rapid influenza diagnostic tests are CLIA‑waived, and most FDA‑cleared rapid influenza molecular assays are CLIA‑waived depending on the specimen. Rapid influenza molecular assays are described as highly sensitive molecular point‑of‑care tests providing rapid (15–30 minutes) detection of influenza A and B viral RNA in respiratory specimens.

The development and implementation of highly multiplexed molecular diagnostic tests have allowed clinical microbiology laboratories to more rapidly and sensitively detect a variety of pathogens directly in clinical specimens. Current US Food and Drug Administration-approved multiplex panels target multiple different organisms simultaneously and can identify the most common pathogens implicated in respiratory viral, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system infections. This review summarizes the test characteristics of available assays, highlights the advantages and limitations of multiplex technology for infectious diseases, and discusses potential utilization of these new tests in clinical practice.

### FDA perspectives on diagnostic device clinical studies for respiratory infections [^1b88c0ce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Two pathways are described for submission to FDA for clearance of a diagnostic device: a Premarket Application (PMA), which can lead to approval of a diagnostic device, and a Premarket Notification, which can lead to clearance. The latter is often called a 510(k), named for the statute providing for this path. Recent FDA clearance of molecular-based multiplex panels represents the beginning of a new era for the diagnosis of respiratory infections. The ability to test for multiple pathogens simultaneously, accompanied by the increasing availability of molecular-based assays for newly recognized respiratory pathogens will likely have a major impact on patient care, drug development, and public health epidemiology. We provide a general overview of how FDA evaluates new diagnostics for respiratory tract infections and the agency's expectations for sponsors developing new tests in this area.

### Advances in multiparametric molecular diagnostics technologies for respiratory tract infections [^11e2578a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, fungal, and other pathogens and cause millions of deaths each year. Current standard microbiological culture-based tests are laborious and time consuming. Thus, patients are initially treated empirically, leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians and scientists with a review of recently available commercial multiparametric molecular diagnostics tests for the detection of RTIs so that they can be considered for use instead of, or in combination with, traditional culture techniques.

Recent Findings

Several technologies have become commercially available for the multiparametric molecular detection of RTIs in the past decade including tests based on PCR-array, PCR-mass spectrometry, and multiplex qPCR technologies. The majority of these tests are for the detection of viruses, but more recently companies have begun to focus on detection of viruses, bacteria, and associated drug resistances in a single product to maximize the information provided to the clinician by a single test.

Summary

We describe the recent advances in commercial multiparametric molecular diagnostics technologies for the diagnosis of RTIs. Combining the specific and sensitive molecular detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and drug resistances is key if molecular methods are to replace traditional culture. The reliability of the molecular drug-resistance markers chosen, the need for the quantitative detection of some organisms, and throughput are also important considerations for new technology developers.

### Narrative review of primary care point-of-care testing (POCT) and antibacterial use in respiratory tract infection (RTI) [^c9ad769d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global healthcare and economic problem, and should be a priority for all the World's governments. The Director General of the WHO, Margaret Chan, has stated with respect to AMR that — 'No action today means no cure tomorrow'. The UK Chief Medical Officer has, likewise, repeatedly emphasised the threat of AMRand the recently published UK Strategy for AMR has three aims:improving knowledge and understanding of AMR; conserving and stewarding the effectiveness of existing treatments; andstimulating the development of new antibiotics, diagnostics and novel therapies. Substantial new or redeployed funding will be needed in order to deliver this strategy, as the amount spent on research in this area is relatively small. The UK public has recognised the importance of AMR by voting for the challenge of the Longitude Prize 2014 to be to create "a cheap, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use point-of-care diagnostic test for bacterial infections". The aim is to find the test that will have the greatest impact globally on antibiotic resistance and the prize will be open until 2019.

Upper respiratory molecular panels for influenza — "Upper respiratory tract testing for influenza using molecular panels is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude lower tract infections, particularly in critically ill and immunocompromised patients", and is also "not sufficiently sensitive to exclude some strains of influenza (e.g. H1N1 and H5N1) that preferentially infect the lower respiratory tract".

### Impact of point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses on antibiotic use in adults with exacerbation of airways disease [^69523ed6]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The ResPOC study demonstrated that syndromic molecular point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses was associated with early discontinuation of unnecessary antibiotics compared to routine clinical care. Subgroup analysis suggests these changes occur predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease. Use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses is becoming widespread but there is a lack of evidence to inform the choice between multiplex syndromic panels versus POCT for influenza only.

Materials/Methods

We evaluated patients from the ResPOC study with exacerbation of asthma or COPD who were treated with antibiotics. The duration of antibiotics and proportion with early discontinuation were compared between patients testing positive and negative for viruses by POCT, and controls. Patients testing positive for viruses by POCT were compared according to virus types.

Results

118 patient with exacerbation of airways disease received antibiotics in the POCT group and 111 in the control group. In the POCT group 49/118 (42%) patients tested positive for viruses. Of those testing positive for viruses 17/49 (35%) had early discontinuation of antibiotics versus 9/69 (13%) testing negative and 7/111 (6%) of controls, p < 0.0001. Of those positive for viruses by POCT 10/49 (20%) were positive for influenza, 21/49 (43%) for rhinovirus and 18/49 (37%) for other viruses. The proportion with early discontinuation of antibiotics was not different between the virus types (p = 0.34).

Conclusions

This data suggests that syndromic molecular POCT for respiratory viruses should be favoured over POCT for influenza alone in adults with exacerbation of airways disease.

DIAGNOSIS

Because identification of hMPV with cell culture is difficult and serology is useful only in a research setting, molecular techniques have been adopted as the optimal approach to diagnosis. hMPV detection is now incorporated into several commercially available multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays that are typically performed on nasal or nasopharyngeal swab samples. But lower respiratory tract samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum can also be used, with several reports indicating a higher yield for hMPV detection in lower respiratory tract samples as compared with nasal swabs. However, most medical institutions employ, as standard of care, triplex assays that include influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, whereas hMPV testing requires the availability of an assay with a wider panel of viruses that is also more costly. Consequently, hMPV diagnosis in the outpatient or inpatient testing is infrequent, which has impeded a better understanding of the clinical impact of hMPV infection and risk factors for severe disease outcomes in adult populations. Most of the studies in this supplement use molecular testing. Yet, similar to what has been found with RSV, the addition of serologic testing as well as molecular testing of multiple other sample types in future prospective studies may increase the yield of detection and improve our understanding of disease burden.

### Rapid syndromic molecular testing in pneumonia: the current landscape and future potential [^38025e18]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) are all associated with significant mortality and cause huge expense to health care services around the world. Early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial for effective treatment. Syndromic diagnostic testing using novel, rapid multiplexed molecular platforms represents a new opportunity for rapidly targeted antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes and facilitate antibiotic stewardship. In this article we review the currently available testing platforms and discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rapid testing in pneumonia.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — It is important to diagnose the etiology of pneumonia so that treatment can be appropriately targeted, and appropriate strategies put into place to prevent transmission of infectious agents to healthcare providers and other patients. If there is concern about nosocomial acquisition based on local epidemiology, viral testing should be considered at any time during a patient's hospitalization, and viral studies should also be conducted if pneumonia is considered, as viruses may coinfect patients with a bacterial etiology. Multiple viruses can cause pneumonia in febrile ICU patients, including but not limited to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Upper respiratory tract sampling is sufficient for most cases, but in some instances, viruses such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 may only be detected in lower respiratory tract samples, such as those obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal tube aspirate. There are many commercial multiplex NAAT panels available for testing respiratory specimens; specific panel compositions vary, and clinicians will likely use the specific panel available at their center, and potential value of panel-based testing was recognized, as testing for viruses one-by-one will likely increase cost and oftentimes it is not clinically clear a priori which virus might be present. Users should be aware that not all potential causes of pneumonia are encompassed by such panels and that it is possible to detect viruses in a febrile ICU patient that are present but are noncontributory to patient's illness. Ideally, viral respiratory NAAT panels should be rapidly performed, with results used to rapidly direct appropriate use of antimicrobials; implementation science studies are needed to demonstrate safety and value of such an approach, and future implementation science studies should also evaluate the value of lower respiratory tract panels that include viruses, bacteria, and fungi, which were not analyzed here.

### Laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19: current issues and challenges [^42763ff5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks.

The ongoing, unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 globally has emphasized the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of human coronavirus infections in order to limit the spread as well as to appropriately treat those patients who have a serious infection. This commentary has addressed current issues regarding such testing for SARS-CoV-2. For example, an NP rather than OP swab is recommended for early diagnosis or screening because it provides higher diagnostic yields, is better tolerated by the patient, and is safer for the operator. An NP swab can be combined with an OP swab to increase sensitivity but requires twice the number of swabs. Should the NP swabs become scarce, self-collected saliva or nasal washes could be used as an alternative specimen type for epidemiological screening and for the "worried well", who are asymptomatic persons with no exposure history who wish to be tested just to be sure they are not infected. NP swabs would then be reserved for hospitalized patients; those who test negative may need deep sputum or BAL fluid samples collected. The importance of repeated testing or the use of bronchoscopy in patients with severe illness should the first screening test be negative must be understood. The role of rectal swabs in testing patients with late infection or as a test of infectivity/cure is currently not well studied but needs urgent attention. Equally unappreciated is the need for broad screening/testing with molecular testing and/or serological testing in order to determine the true mortality rate as well as other epidemiological markers. Finally, the importance of rapid development of integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices for the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections cannot be overemphasized. These short-turnaround-time (STAT) tests will be very important for real-time patient management and infection control decisions, especially when other less infectious forms of pneumonia are present and respiratory isolate resources are scarce. These assays are safe, simple, and fast and can be used in local clinics and hospitals that already have the needed instruments and that are responsible for identifying and treating such patients.

### Multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples to reduce antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised trial [^480713e4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and one of the leading drivers of antibiotic use in hospitalised patients. However, in many cases, the causative agent is not identified and patients are overtreated with antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics is a major cause of antimicrobial resistance and increases the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection and other antibiotic-related adverse events. Antibacterial resistance is accelerating at an alarming pace and is raising morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. In this scenario, antimicrobial stewardship is recognised as a crucial component in strategies to deal with the threat of antibiotic resistance.

The development of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in automated platforms currently allows rapid screening of non-invasive respiratory specimens, such as sputum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs, for a wide array of respiratory pathogens. Several observational studies have found that comprehensive molecular testing significantly improved pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobial-exposed patients. Two recent studies investigating the efficacy of multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples for antimicrobial stewardship in CAP have yielded conflicting findings.

Current guidelines for CAP do not incorporate multiplex PCR pneumonia panels into their recommendations for initial microbiological diagnostic testing. Furthermore, the guidance regarding conventional microbiological testing methods like sputum culture, blood cultures, and urinary antigen tests lacks consistency and is predominantly grounded in low or very low-quality evidence.

We conducted a randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples plus conventional microbiological testing is safe and more effective than conventional microbiological testing alone for reducing antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with CAP.

### Impact of early detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR assay on clinical outcomes in adult patients [^0e608c6d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Rapid and definitive diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is imperative in patient triage and management. We compared the outcomes for adult patients with positive tests for respiratory viruses at a tertiary care center across two consecutive influenza seasons (winters of 2010–2011 and 2012). Infections were diagnosed by conventional methods in the first season and by multiplex PCR (FilmArray) in the second season. FilmArray decreased the time to diagnosis of influenza compared to conventional methods (median turnaround times of 1.7 h versus 7.7 h, respectively; P = 0.015); FilmArray also decreased the time to diagnosis of non-influenza viruses (1.5 h versus 13.5 h, respectively; P < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression found that a diagnosis of influenza by FilmArray was associated with significantly lower odds ratios (ORs) for admission (P = 0.046), length of stay (P = 0.040), duration of antimicrobial use (P = 0.032), and number of chest radiographs (P = 0.005), when controlling for potential confounders. We conclude that the rapid turnaround time, multiplex nature of the test (allowing simultaneous detection of an array of viruses), and superior sensitivity of FilmArray may improve the evaluation and management of patients suspected of having respiratory virus infections.

### Respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay… [^62ba541f]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

If you include or recommend multiple extraction methods for use with your assay, you should demonstrate extraction quality and efficiency, as well as analytical and clinical performance of your assay with each extraction method and each virus. Specifically, you should demonstrate LoD and reproducibility for each method. You may be able to combine the extraction method variable with each site performance variable.
6. B. i Limit of Detection LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be consistently detected in a defined type of sample. By definition, this concentration must yield an assay value that can be reproducibly distinguished from values obtained with samples that do not contain the analyte. Determination of LoD for multiplex assays follows the same principles as for single analyte assays. During the validation of a test system, you should determine the LoD for each specimen type and each analyte that will be tested in the respiratory viral panel multiplex assay. This can be accomplished by limiting dilutions of infected cell samples into non-infected cell samples. You should confirm the titer of the viruses prior to use in the study, using tissue culture infectious dose 50 units, or alternatively, colony forming units/mL, or plaque forming units/mL. The method for LoD determination includes the re-growth and re-titering of viral stocks. We recommend that you prepare serial dilutions using appropriate pooled negative sample matrixes as diluents that include 3–5 replicates for each dilution. You should report the LoD as the level of virus that gives a 95% detection rate.

Depending on the assay, it might not be necessary to perform a separate LoD determination at the whole range of concentrations for every single specimen type; LoD should be determined for at least the most common and most problematic ones. The LoD may be confirmed by preparing at least 20 additional replicates at the LoD concentration and demonstrating that the virus is detected 95% of the time. You should also evaluate the sensitivity of the test for the influence of microorganism diversity. You should apply the whole process of the test system from sample preparation to amplicon detection when evaluating assay LoD.
