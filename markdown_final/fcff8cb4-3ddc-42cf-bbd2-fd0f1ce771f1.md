## Question

Lipid management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidance on lipid management presented as a polished expert narrative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that LDL-C lowering reduces ASCVD risk in proportion to the absolute reduction. Then, I should verify how to stratify ASCVD risk and align therapy intensity accordingly. Next, I will examine lifestyle as first-line therapy and when to initiate pharmacotherapy. After that, I need to detail statin-first strategies, thresholds for adding nonstatins, and special populations. Finally, I should review monitoring, adherence, and implementation gaps, and close with a concise synthesis that reconciles guideline differences and emphasizes a "lower for longer" approach.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: elevated atherogenic cholesterol (LDL-C and non–HDL-C) is a causal driver of atherosclerosis, and reducing LDL-C lowers ASCVD risk roughly in proportion to the absolute LDL-C reduction, with each ~39 mg/dL reduction conferring about a 22% relative risk reduction in major vascular events over approximately 5 years, and lifetime exposure to lower LDL-C yields even larger relative risk reductions per unit decrease, supporting an early, sustained strategy [^111onMi6] [^117XuUuN] [^111jseTm].

> Wait, let me verify the risk stratification framework before assigning therapy intensity: contemporary guidelines converge on a risk-based approach, typically categorizing patients as low, moderate, high, or very high risk, with very high risk including established ASCVD, diabetes with multiple risk factors or end-organ damage, severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), and sometimes unequivocal subclinical atherosclerosis on imaging; ESC/EAS explicitly recognizes imaging-defined atherosclerosis as very high risk, which aligns with a continuum model rather than a binary primary/secondary prevention dichotomy [^113iixsU] [^112uARWX] [^112QMZmt].

> Hold on, I should verify the treatment goals by risk category so I don't misstate thresholds: for very high risk, targets of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL are standard in US guidance, while ESC/EAS recommends even more aggressive goals of LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline; for high risk, LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL are reasonable; for moderate risk, LDL-C < 130 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 160 mg/dL are typical; importantly, some guidelines emphasize percent reduction rather than absolute targets, reflecting trial evidence and the "lower for longer" principle [^113iixsU] [^112mFCb6] [^116TSrVY] [^113wVuy7] [^115Uzs9s].

> I need to ensure lifestyle therapy is positioned correctly as the foundation for all patients: therapeutic lifestyle changes (heart-healthy diet, weight management, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation) are recommended universally and can yield meaningful LDL-C reductions, though they are often insufficient alone in high- and very high-risk patients, necessitating pharmacotherapy to achieve risk-proportionate LDL-C lowering [^115x5uqj] [^111onMi6].

> Let me think about when to start pharmacotherapy so I don't overgeneralize: statins are first-line for essentially all patients who, after lifestyle therapy, remain above their risk-stratified LDL-C goals or who meet high-risk categories; high-intensity statins are indicated for very high-risk patients (including secondary prevention and severe hypercholesterolemia), moderate-intensity for high-risk primary prevention, and risk-enhanced decision-making for borderline or intermediate risk using tools and, when uncertain, coronary artery calcium scoring to refine net benefit discussions [^115vtFC5] [^112VoFpE] [^112FABwM] [^114Vu9ZA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "treat all adults ≥ 20 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL with high-intensity statins regardless of other risk factors", but I should double-check that nuance: ACC/AHA recommends high-intensity statins for adults 20–75 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, whereas for those older than 75 the intensity should be individualized based on tolerance, comorbidities, and patient preference, so I need to correct that blanket statement and anchor it to the 20–75 age range for high-intensity therapy [^114mpP3Y].

> Next, I should review intensification thresholds so I don't miss the sequence: if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin in very high-risk patients, add ezetimibe; if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin plus ezetimibe, add a PCSK9 inhibitor; VA/DoD explicitly recommends ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitors due to oral administration, generic availability, and uncertain long-term safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, while acknowledging event reduction without mortality benefit in PCSK9 trials; for primary prevention at very high risk, ESC/EAS also supports PCSK9 inhibitor add-on if goals are unmet after statin plus ezetimibe [^115sTb9b] [^1128nRBF] [^111gzTdo] [^111tYf2M] [^114sTAgR] [^111oY3nq].

> I will now examine special populations so I don't overlook important modifiers: in diabetes, treat as high or very high risk depending on additional risk factors and end-organ damage; in older adults, moderate-intensity statins are often reasonable, with shared decision-making and consideration of CAC to refine risk; in women, lifetime risk is substantial and primary prevention is critical; in severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), prioritize triglyceride lowering to prevent pancreatitis and consider icosapent ethyl for ASCVD risk reduction when triglycerides are 135–499 mg/dL with ASCVD or diabetes and multiple risk factors; for suspected familial hypercholesterolemia, use high-intensity statins and escalate promptly to combination therapy [^113iixsU] [^1139u2U3] [^1167Rjd7] [^111g27S2] [^112UD3pm].

> Let me verify monitoring cadence and adherence strategies because implementation often fails here: check a fasting or nonfasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to assess adherence and response, then every 3–12 months as needed; use team-based care, structured follow-up, and adherence tools to close the gap, given persistent underuse of statins and combination therapy in real-world cohorts and the high prevalence of patients not achieving LDL-C thresholds despite treatment [^114mpP3Y] [^113NVo73] [^111LRNyB] [^113Catr8].

> But wait, what if the patient is statin-intolerant or refuses statins despite high risk; I should confirm alternatives: ezetimibe monotherapy is reasonable and cost-effective for statin-intolerant patients, with bempedoic acid or PCSK9 inhibitors as additional options based on risk, access, and patient preference; for persistent hypertriglyceridemia, consider fibrates, prescription omega-3s, or niacin in select scenarios, balancing efficacy and safety, and always revisit adherence and secondary causes before escalating [^112XxH3t] [^111g27S2] [^115sTb9b].

> Hold on, I should verify how to reconcile guideline differences so the plan is coherent: ACC/AHA moved away from numeric LDL-C targets toward percent-reduction and risk-based intensity, whereas NLA and ESC/EAS endorse explicit LDL-C and non–HDL-C goals; practically, both approaches converge on the same clinical actions — higher intensity statins for higher risk, early add-on therapy when above thresholds/goals, and sustained LDL-C lowering — so anchoring to a "lower for longer" principle with shared decision-making resolves apparent discrepancies [^113wVuy7] [^113iixsU] [^112mFCb6] [^115Uzs9s].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure nothing critical is missing: lipid management is risk-stratified, anchored by lifestyle, and driven by statins first with rapid escalation to combination therapy in very high-risk patients; early, sustained LDL-C lowering yields the greatest absolute risk reduction, and systematic monitoring with adherence support is essential to close the implementation gap and translate evidence into outcomes [^111onMi6] [^111jseTm] [^111LRNyB].

Lipid management centers on **risk-based therapy** [^115x5uqj] to reduce ASCVD events, with **statins first-line** [^112VoFpE] and intensification [^115vtFC5] when LDL-C remains above thresholds. Lifestyle is foundational [^114mpP3Y] for all, and **LDL-C lowering is proportional to risk reduction** [^117XuUuN] — lower for longer is better [^112ADuna]. For very high-risk patients, target LDL-C < 70 mg/dL [^113iixsU] (or < 55 mg/dL if feasible) [^112QMZmt] and add ezetimibe [^112iCCYF] or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^111gzTdo] if needed. Monitor lipids 4–12 weeks after changes [^114mpP3Y], then every 3–12 months, and address adherence [^112UDJCb] and secondary causes to close treatment gaps [^111g27S2].

---

## Risk assessment and stratification

- **Risk assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. Pooled Cohort Equations [^113e2uhq], SCORE [^112QMZmt]) to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk and guide therapy intensity [^114Vu9ZA].

- **Risk categories**: Very high risk includes clinical ASCVD, recent ACS, or diabetes with end-organ damage; high risk includes severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL) or diabetes with multiple risk factors [^113iixsU].

- **Risk-enhancing factors**: Consider family history, inflammatory markers, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome to refine risk and treatment decisions [^notfound].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle therapy is **first-line for all patients** [^111g27S2] and should be continued throughout care:

- **Diet**: Emphasize Mediterranean or DASH patterns; reduce saturated fat, trans fats, refined carbs, and added sugars; increase soluble fiber and omega-3 intake.

- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [^notfound].

- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² and waist circumference < 40 in (men) or < 35 in (women).

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^117JEJqa].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### Statins (first-line therapy)

- **Indications**: Initiate based on risk category and LDL-C levels [^113e2uhq]; high-intensity statins for very high risk, moderate-intensity for high risk [^111uQYrr].

- **LDL-C reduction**: High-intensity statins lower LDL-C by ≥ 50% [^115vtFC5]; moderate-intensity by 30–49% [^114Rid8G].

- **Monitoring**: Check lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change [^114mpP3Y], then every 3–12 months.

---

### Non-statin therapies (second-line therapy)

Add non-statins when LDL-C remains above threshold despite maximally tolerated statins:

| **Agent** | **Mechanism** | **Ldl-c reduction** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ezetimibe | cholesterol absorption inhibitor | 15–25% | - LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin [^112iCCYF] <br/> - Or statin intolerance [^1119L2xg] |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | monoclonal antibodies | 50–60% | - LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin + ezetimibe [^117MtwZS] <br/> - Or statin intolerance [^111jseTm] |
| Bempedoic acid | ATP citrate lyase inhibitor | 15–20% | - LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin [^notfound] <br/> - Or statin intolerance |
| Inclisiran | siRNA targeting PCSK9 | 50–60% | - LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin + ezetimibe [^notfound] <br/> - Or statin intolerance |

---

## Treatment targets and goals

- **LDL-C targets**: Very high risk: < 70 mg/dL (or < 55 mg/dL if feasible) [^112mFCb6]; high risk: < 100 mg/dL; moderate risk: < 130 mg/dL [^116TSrVY].

- **Non-HDL-C targets**: Very high risk: < 100 mg/dL; high risk: < 130 mg/dL; moderate risk: < 160 mg/dL [^116TSrVY].

- **Percent reduction**: Aim for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction in very high-risk patients [^112mFCb6].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Treat as high or very high risk; prioritize statins and intensify as needed [^114ge5vY].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Moderate to severe CKD warrants statin therapy; adjust intensity based on tolerance [^notfound].

- **Statin intolerance**: Use ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid as alternatives [^111jseTm].

- **Elderly patients**: Individualize therapy; moderate-intensity statins are often appropriate [^1139u2U3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess adherence, adverse effects, and lipid response at 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose changes [^114mpP3Y], then **every 3–12 months** [^114mpP3Y]. Maintain ongoing assessment of adherence, lifestyle, and lipid control, and intensify therapy if LDL-C remains above threshold [^115sTb9b].

---

## Barriers to effective lipid management

Common barriers include **nonadherence** [^112UDJCb], **statin intolerance** [^113uc8xV], and **limited awareness of risk** [^111LRNyB]. Address these with education, shared decision-making, and team-based care to improve outcomes [^114mRFdm].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides targeting PCSK9 and apo(a) are in development for **very high-risk patients** [^notfound]. Gene therapy approaches are being explored for **familial hypercholesterolemia** [^notfound]. Personalized medicine aims to tailor therapy using **genetic and biomarker data** [^notfound].

---

Lipid management is a **risk-based, stepwise approach** [^115x5uqj] that starts with lifestyle and escalates to statins and non-statins as needed to achieve LDL-C goals. Early, sustained LDL-C lowering reduces ASCVD events — **lower for longer is better** [^115Uzs9s].

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111ykjRF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Emerging therapeutic strategies for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with the metabolic syndrome [^115UMF5W]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in significantly reducing cardiovascular events has been established in many at-risk populations. However, patients with the metabolic syndrome (MS) pose a challenge for clinical management. A high degree of residual risk exists in patients with the MS or diabetes mellitus, and this is of growing importance because of the increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated comorbidities in the world. As the MS has emerged as a major risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and diabetes, targeting treatment to achieve aggressive goals becomes paramount. This article reviews emerging therapeutic strategies for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with the MS.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^112DEs4V]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### Lipid disorders: justification of methods and goals of treatment [^1131nWts]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). While some uncertainty exists about the clinical significance of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, large primary- and secondary-prevention studies aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins have convincingly reduced CHD events and total mortality. Despite the strong clinical evidence and widely publicized treatment guidelines, many hyperlipidemic patients receive inadequate lipid-lowering treatment. This failure to achieve clinical treatment goals may be due to poor physician adherence to treatment guidelines, patient noncompliance, and the presence of concomitant medical conditions that modify typical hyperlipidemia management. This review considers the challenges and available strategies to optimize lipid management in patients at risk for CHD.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### Lipid management in cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines: strategies and tactics for implementation [^114i3PGA]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread dissemination of clinical practice guidelines on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD causes one third of deaths worldwide and almost half of all deaths in the developed world. It is therefore likely that, although some aspects of CVD management have improved, there is still a significant shortfall between what is known about CVD prevention and what is put into action. Twenty-one experts in the field of CVD from around the world attended a focus panel meeting in Marlow-on-Thames, UK (see acknowledgements for a list of meeting participants). These experts were invited to discuss practical strategies and tactics for overcoming barriers to the implementation of guidelines on CVD prevention, and lipid management in particular. This article reviews and updates the key topics presented during the course of the meeting, captures the essence of the group discussions, and summarizes the meeting outcomes. The participants concluded that initial efforts to implement CVD prevention guidelines more effectively are best directed at high-risk patients who have already been identified. Once current patients achieve their targets, more attention can be paid to finding untreated patients at risk. Recommendations from the expert panel included: Harmonize guidelines; focus on common areas of consensus rather than state-of-the-art science. Remove the boundary between primary and secondary prevention and focus on level of overall risk. Help policy makers understand the different components of CVD. Include professional societies from different specialties in guideline development and implementation, to increase ownership and decrease fragmentation of guideline committees.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^114mHAPQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patient-centered dyslipidemia management — NLA Expert Panel framework emphasizes that recommendations support, not replace, clinical judgment and highlight patient participation and the evidence base. "Clinical recommendations aim to assist clinicians in making decisions about the best strategies for management of a condition, taking into account potential benefits and risks of the available options". The recommendations are "intended to inform, not replace, clinical judgment", and "A patient-centered approach dictates that clinical judgment take into account the circumstances, objectives, and preferences of each individual patient". "The patient should be an active participant in the process… including potential risks and side effects, as well as benefits and costs", and "Patient-provider collaboration in treatment decisions tends to improve long-term adherence". The panel's consensus is that accumulated evidence "warrants a modest refinement of previous lipid-related risk management strategies", and the evidence base "emphasized results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate lipid-altering interventions on clinical ASCVD events (mainly myocardial infarction, coronary death, and stroke), including subgroup assessments and pooled analyses", while acknowledging that many questions remain and RCT evidence "may have uncertain relevance to particular patients" due to highly selected trial populations.

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^115x5uqj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — definition and risk-based management states that dyslipidemia has traditionally been defined as one or more of the following: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL, or triglycerides (TGs) ≥ 200 mg/dL; in patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) or elevated risk for CVD, even "normal" lipids levels warrant intervention for CVD risk reduction. Treatment of dyslipidemia involves lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering drugs, and management has shifted toward managing dyslipidemia in the context of overall risk for CVD; much of the evidence is based on CV risk reduction and does not require lipid levels for inclusion criteria. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) addresses treatment and management strategies focusing upon an individual's risk factors and event history among patients at risk for CVD morbidity and mortality.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Management of cardiovascular risk: the importance of meeting lipid targets [^111wNdmE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention focus on optimization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, developments in the field of preventive cardiology have included new guidelines for women and for familial hypercholesterolemia; a risk assessment algorithm incorporating the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); and clinical trial data confirming the efficacy of aggressive lipid management. Within secondary prevention in particular, there is a need for more widespread use of intensive statin therapy to achieve low LDL cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for recurrent events. Within primary prevention, individuals with diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, or elevated hsCRP also are at increased risk and may warrant treatment with aggressive lipid-modifying therapy. In this article, we provide an update on recent guidelines, risk algorithms, and trials related to the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

Introduction and rationale

Despite considerable improvements in medical care over the past 25 years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major public health challenge. In Europe, CVD is responsible for nearly 50% of all deaths and is the main cause of all disease burden, with management costs estimated at €192 billion annually. However, with the increasing incidence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), this burden is projected to escalate dramatically. At a time when Europe, like other developed regions, is faced with the need to contain expenditure, urgent action is needed to address this critical problem.

Current best treatment including lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy aimed at lowering plasma concentrations of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reducing blood pressure, and preventing thrombotic events fails to 'normalize' risk in people at high risk of CVD (i.e. SCORE > 5% for CVD deathor 10-year Framingham risk score > 20% for CVD events). Individuals with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are at very high risk of recurrent events: ∼10% occur within the first 6–12 months, and ∼20–30% within 2 years. As the risk of recurrent events in statin-treated coronary heart disease (CHD) patients increases incrementally with each additional feature of the metabolic syndrome, this implies that other CV risk factors beyond LDL-C may deserve attention. These risk factors may be modifiable, e.g. non-LDL-C dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and abdominal obesity, or non-modifiable, e.g. age and gender. Therapeutic interventions targeted to the former group clearly hold potential for reducing this high CV risk that persists even with optimal treatment of LDL-C.

PCSK9 inhibitors — research needs for combination therapy and treatment intensity: There is a need for continued investigation of the long-term safety of treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors combined with statins with or without ezetimibe and the unknown safety of prolonged periods of very low LDL-C; topics include what is the optimal combination of lipid-lowering treatments or achieved LDL-C level for the largest reduction in CV events (e.g., adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximally-tolerated statin plus ezetimibe versus moderate-dose statins plus ezetimibe), what is the comparative effectiveness of high-dose statin plus ezetimibe, high-dose statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor, and high-dose statin plus ezetimibe plus PCSK9 inhibitor (triple therapy) in higher risk patients, and what is the optimal duration of more aggressive treatment in higher risk patients including whether ACS patients on high-dose statins should continue indefinitely or be titrated downward after a period of time.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered", although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence". Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted", and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients".

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^1128nRBF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — intensification strategies and recommendations for higher risk patients are described as follows: In higher risk patients, several approaches have been proven to reduce non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to moderate-dose statins, but there is "no direct evidence to support the superiority of a single approach for intensification of lipid-lowering therapy" between maximizing statin dose, adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statin, or adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximum-dose statin with or without ezetimibe. The guideline states, "We recommend the combination of maximally tolerated statins and ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitors", noting that statins and ezetimibe are administered orally and are widely available as generic products, whereas PCSK9 inhibitors have unknown long-term safety profiles, are administered as subcutaneous injections "once or twice a month", are "significantly more costly", and require education on proper use while achieving comparable or less relative risk reductions. For patients at higher risk already receiving a maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe, "addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor is suggested to reduce recurrent non-fatal events".

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^111CDvVj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

Primary prevention context in women — event patterns and need: Although women without previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are at lower absolute short- to intermediate-term event risk compared to men for a given age, lifetime risk is higher among women, and approximately 70% of myocardial infarctions in the United States are first events, approximately 15% are fatal during hospitalization, and nearly 50% of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside a hospital. Primary prevention strategies are critical to reduce mortality and morbidity for both at-risk women and men.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^114sdCdu]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The safe and optimal treatment of plasma lipids within the secondary prevention population is key to reducing the increasing burden of CVD in society. However, given the paucity of evidence for the frequency of ongoing monitoring, there is a clear need for further research in these two key areas of its management. This will improve patient care while optimising costs in an evidence-based manner.

PCSK9 inhibitor outcomes in high-risk patients — systematic review data: In eight trials, PCSK9 inhibitors reduced the risk of CVD events in high-risk patients (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.8–0.92) without effecting CV or all-cause mortality; control treatments varied, including placebo and a statin with or without ezetimibe. A more recent review found reduced risk of CV events (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79–0.89), non-fatal MI (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74–0.93), and any type of stroke (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65–0.85), with no effect on mortality.

Prospective comparative study of risk prediction strategies — among intermediate-risk populations, CAC scoring using ultrafast computed tomography has been shown to improve the AUC for diagnosis by about 5% and result in a net reclassification of about 15–20% of patients; however, CAC scoring will also falsely label seven patients at high risk for a coronary event for every true high risk patient identified, and only prospective studies that directly compare conventional risk assessment and CAC scoring versus conventional risk assessment only will truly answer this question, though such studies would require very large populations (n = 30,000).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114mRFdm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association patient-centered dyslipidemia management emphasizes that an elevated level of atherogenic cholesterol is a root cause of atherosclerosis and that reducing elevated levels will lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; when lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality, and non-lipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed. Care should follow a patient-centered approach in which the initial step is a determination of the patient's risk for an ASCVD event and the patient should be an active participant in shared decision making. Lifestyle counseling is a key element, and if lifestyle therapies are insufficient to achieve desired atherogenic cholesterol levels, evidence-based drug therapy, particularly moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be considered; if goal levels are not achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, combining a statin with a second (and sometimes a third) agent may be considered for selected patients. Alternative strategies may be needed for patients who are statin intolerant or who prefer not to use statin therapy, and regular patient and lipid follow-up is warranted; treatment goals and periodic monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels are important tools. The scope of these recommendations also includes lifestyle therapies, groups with special considerations (children and adolescents, women, older patients, certain ethnic and racial groups, patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and patients with residual risk despite statin and lifestyle therapies), and strategies to improve patient outcomes by increasing adherence and using team-based collaborative care.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Lipids and CVD management: towards a global consensus [^117JEJqa]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80–90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24–37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

### Managing dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^115CgYx7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in all patients. However, these agents are more cost-effective in high-risk patients whose absolute risk of CAD is greater than that of low-risk patients. Furthermore, from preliminary data, it appears that there is greater risk reduction in those subjects achieving lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (ie, lower is better). The identification and aggressive treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), emphasize that patients with CAD, diabetes, or global risk of CAD > 20% over 10 years and LDL-C levels > 130 mg/dL should receive drug therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels to < 100 mg/dL. The recent results of the United Kingdom's Heart Protection Study (HPS) strongly suggest that even those with CAD or who are at high risk and LDL-C levels > 100 mg/dL would benefit from drug therapy. Although optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, recent studies show only about 20% of such patients meet these goals. Thus, a large treatment gap remains that needs to be overcome if we are to continue to make significant inroads into preventing further morbidity and mortality in these high-risk subjects. Of therapeutic options available currently and for the near future, statins remain the most effective and well-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapies include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. However, none of these is, in general, sufficiently effective as an initial agent to achieve these more aggressive LDL-C goals in the high-risk patient. However, combination therapy with a statin and 1 of these other lipid-lowering agents is useful in patients who are unable to achieve lipid goals on monotherapy. A number of agents for reducing LDL-C levels currently in development may be available in the near future, including 2 new statins: pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin, which is in the later stages of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and allows more patients to meet lipid goals. Ezetimibe, the first of an entirely new class of LDL-C-lowering agents that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, also appears to offer significant therapeutic value. It is anticipated that these new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby further reducing the morbidity and mortality of CAD.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^114ge5vY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### Dyslipidemia: management using optimal lipid-lowering therapy [^112Sbrqw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current approaches and explore emerging research related to dyslipidemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2004-April 2012) was searched for randomized controlled trials using the terms dyslipidemia and lipid-lowering therapy or statin (> 1000 hits). Separate searches (MEDLINE, Google) identified meta-analyses (2010–2011), disease prevalence statistics, and current consensus guidelines (2004-July 2011). Additional references were identified from the publications reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles on large multicenter trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk recommend the attainment of specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) target values, based on an individual's 10-year risk of coronary heart disease or global risk. For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy. Although fibrates or niacin improves overall lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia who are receiving statin therapy, their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk remains questionable and their use raises safety and tolerability concerns.

Conclusions

Intensifying lifestyle changes and statin dose should be utilized first in patients not achieving their LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^111uQYrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^1142XBF7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of ASCVD, it remains a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Central to ASCVD prevention is effective lipid-lowering, which reduces both the onset of disease and the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in those with established disease. However, translating these evidence-based strategies into routine clinical practice presents several challenges. Achieving guideline-directed lipid management can be complicated by factors such as patient intolerance, individual variability in response to therapy, and the presence of risk-enhancing factors that are not always neatly addressed by current guidelines.

Moreover, many commonly encountered clinical scenarios — as depicted in the aforementioned case examples — require nuanced, patient-centered approaches that extend beyond standard recommendations. The rapidly evolving landscape of LLTs, including the development of novel agents such as PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and inclisiran, provides clinicians with new tools to tailor treatments, but also necessitates a deeper understanding of when and how to use these therapies effectively. This review has aimed to bridge the gap between guideline-directed care and real-world clinical complexities, offering practical insights into managing patients with challenging lipid disorders. By contextualizing current recommendations and highlighting emerging treatment options, we hope to empower clinicians to make informed, individualized treatment decisions that improve outcomes for their patients. As the field of lipidology continues to evolve, it is crucial that healthcare providers employ both established and emerging therapies to reduce ASCVD risk and enhance patient care.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^115htaqc]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacologic therapy for ASCVD prevention — When managing dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, it is important to determine whether the approach involves primary or secondary prevention; the latter involves individuals with known clinical ASCVD. Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for individuals without known ASCVD who are considered to be at high risk. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered if the LDL-C target is not met, and there may be a need for treatment intensification using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or other therapies based on individualized response if the LDL-C target is not met after initial treatment. AACE suggests targeting LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and there is limited evidence to support treatment goals of < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for most individuals.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^115Uzs9s]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

National Lipid Association guidance for adult low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the #1 cause of death in the United States, and LDL-C is described as a causal factor that should be monitored and may be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. The objective is to summarize numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C. Methods systematically reviewed guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other organizations, and key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application. The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and shared decision-making to improve adherence; the resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care. The conclusion states that integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding, supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116TSrVY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA Part 1 recommendations — ASCVD risk categories define atherogenic cholesterol goals and thresholds to consider drug therapy as follows: Low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors; consider other risk indicators) targets Non–HDL-C < 130 and LDL-C < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 or LDL-C ≥ 160. Moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors; consider quantitative risk scoring and other risk indicators) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 or LDL-C ≥ 130. High risk (≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or a quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 or LDL-C ≥ 100. Very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage) sets goals Non–HDL-C < 100 and LDL-C < 70, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 or LDL-C ≥ 70. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Evidence for a combined approach to the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia [^114q7jQi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The recognition that hypertension and dyslipidemia coexist more often than would be expected by chance and that their combination increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) has important implications for patient management. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and healthy individuals with multiple CVD risk factors — including concomitant dyslipidemia and hypertension-are the primary focus of updated treatment guidelines for CVD prevention. There is a need for a treatment paradigm shift from the diagnosis and treatment of individual CVD risk factors to the assessment and management of total CVD risk. Goals for each CVD risk factor need to be intensified when multiple sources of risk are present. Patients who have no overt disease but who have multiple CVD risk factors are now understood to be at high risk and should be the target of aggressive primary preventive strategies to avert unnecessary morbidity and mortality. It is also becoming clear that CVD risk factors interact at the level of the endothelium to promote atherosclerosis. Furthermore, recent clinical trials, including those assessing atherosclerotic progression and CVD endpoints, have demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions targeted at multiple risk factors for CVD.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111jseTm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is a major causal factor in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated a dose‐dependent log‐linear relationship between plasma LDL‐C concentrations and risk of ASCVD events; this relationship is replicated in Mendelian randomization studies. In addition to the magnitude of LDL‐C exposure, long‐term exposure to persistently elevated LDL‐C is recognized as a key contributor to a person's ASCVD risk.

Management of LDL‐C levels is central to ASCVD prevention strategies, beginning with the recommendation of a heart‐healthy lifestyle for all individuals. In those at increased ASCVD risk, pharmacologic lipid‐lowering therapy is advocated, with statin therapy recommended as the first‐line agent for both primary and secondary prevention. However, for many high‐risk patients with elevated LDL‐C, individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), and/or those who have limiting statin‐associated adverse effects, nonstatin therapies as part of a multidrug regimen are often needed to achieve LDL‐C thresholds.

Pooled analyses of lipid‐lowering therapies have shown a linear association between achieved LDL‐C levels and absolute coronary heart disease event rates. Every 1.0‐mmol/L (39‐mg/dL) reduction in LDL‐C confers an ≈22% reduction in the risk of major vascular events, with the lower threshold beyond which benefit ceases yet to be defined. Nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies to assist with LDL‐C reduction are now available. Current American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Multisociety and European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines recommend the addition of ezetimibe and/or anti‐PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) monoclonal antibodies to statins in individuals who require further LDL‐C lowering according to the level of risk. Since the publication of the most recent guidelines, bempedoic acid, an ATP‐citrate lyase inhibitor, and inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that targets PCSK9 mRNA, have received regulatory approval for LDL‐C lowering in combination with statins, with pending cardiovascular outcome studies in the case of inclisiran. To acknowledge these new nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies, in 2022, the ACC published an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) statement to provide guidance on their use across various ASCVD risk groups.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116U8Lqy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — patients younger than 40 years: The CPG applies to patients aged 40 years or older, and shared decision making about the uncertain benefit and risks is the only recommended strategy for patients younger than age 40 who are interested in lipid testing and management. Cardiovascular events and mortality are very low in the under 40 age group. In a French heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) registry, only 7% had a lifetime history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which increased to 17% when revascularization was included, and including revascularization, 4% of the registry had a cardiovascular event before age 40. A Spanish registry showed that of the 15% of HeFH patients with cardiovascular event history, only 1.3% were age 40 or under when they had their first event. While statin therapy is reasonable for patients under age 40, there are no randomized primary prevention trials to demonstrate or quantify benefit, and shared decision making is even more essential in the absence of direct evidence.

NLA recommendations — older adults with dyslipidemia: In primary prevention, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of < 130 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL are appropriate targets, and after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended whenever feasible; the NLA high-risk thresholds are ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event using the Pooled Cohort Equations and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator, and in patients ≥ 65 years of age with uncertainty about drug therapy it is reasonable to recommend moderate intensity statin therapy when there is 1 or more major ASCVD risk factor or when risk exceeds 15% or 10% by the respective calculators; in situations requiring additional objective information, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring may be considered and a score of zero in asymptomatic patients may suggest that non-pharmacologic approaches are reasonable; for those ≥ 80 years of age with atherogenic lipoproteins above goals, a provider-patient discussion should be undertaken and if statin intolerance is the primary issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens including low intensity or non-daily moderate intensity statin therapy, low dose statin combination therapy with ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, or non-statin monotherapy, and in general, we recommend that providers try to achieve at least a 30% LDL-C reduction.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^113BK1pT]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112UD3pm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

Defining the Problem: LDL‐C Control Is Not Sufficient in Contemporary Practice

The Burden of

Cardiovascular disease represents the leading cause of death globally and in the United States, and its prevalence is predicted to grow substantially in the coming years. In 2020, ≈19 million deaths were attributed to cardiovascular disease worldwide, an increase of 18.7% over 10 years. Of these deaths, > 80% were attributable to ASCVD. Morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease are associated with significant economic burden, with average annual direct and indirect costs in the United States between 2017 and 2018 estimated as $378 billion.

Elevated LDL‐C remains 1 of the top 3 modifiable risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease burden and represents a significant challenge for health care systems. In the United States, the prevalence of elevated LDL‐C is high, with an estimated 28% of adults having levels ≥ 130 mg/dL between 2015 and 2018. Overall prevalence of ASCVD in 2019 in the United States was estimated as 24 million, ≈10% of the total population > 21 years of age.

Multiple studies have shown that it is not only the magnitude of LDL‐C elevation but also the duration of exposure to elevated LDL‐C (or apolipoprotein B lipoproteins), or "LDL‐years", that is associated with ASCVD risk. Therefore, the timing of the implementation of strategies to decrease lipid levels is key to slowing the progression of atherosclerotic plaques and reducing the risk of ASCVD events. The potential effectiveness of earlier intervention to reduce exposure is supported by the observation that isolated populations who maintain lifetime exposure to low plasma levels of LDL‐C have a low lifetime risk of ASCVD. Similarly, a meta‐analysis of Mendelian randomization studies demonstrated that prolonged exposure to lower LDL‐C beginning early in life is associated with a significant reduction in risk of cardiovascular events compared with shorter‐term exposure through statin treatment initiated later in life.

Evidence for the Underuse of Lipid‐Lowering Therapies in Clinical Practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of > 600 000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of ≈1.5 million patients with a history of ≥ 1 major ASCVD event reported that > 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2‐year period, two‐thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received treatment intensification. Recently, an interim report of the European SANTORINI (Treatment of High and Very High Risk Dyslipidemic Patients for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Europe: A Multinational Observational Study) to assess the management of high‐risk and very high‐risk patients after publication of the ESC/EAS 2019 guidelines showed that combination therapy was used in just 27.3% of patients, of whom 17.1% received statin plus ezetimibe, and 4.1% received an anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibody plus oral lipid‐lowering therapy.

Summary and recommendations — non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors state that medication non-adherence is common and associated with worse outcomes and higher health system costs, and improvement depends on early recognition and a sustained, coordinated team effort to prevent and address it. Central to adherence is the quality of the provider–patient relationship, with better communication empirically linked to positive outcomes including patient satisfaction. Effective provider–patient dialogue provides increased opportunities for patients to understand their condition and engage with weighing therapy risks and benefits, and providers can improve outcomes by focusing on public policy, outpatient practice redesigns that leverage electronic health record capability, and patient-specific interventions such as explaining consequences of non-adherence, suggesting ways to improve adherence, introducing team-based care, and defining roles and responsibilities to deliver optimally improved patient-centered outcomes.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^116Pvgxk]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well established. Lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) are a cornerstone in the management of ASCVD risk by causing significant reductions in LDL-C and adverse cardiovascular events. The growing arsenal of LLT, from statins to newer therapies like proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and bempedoic acid, provides clinicians with a robust toolkit to tailor treatment based on patient-specific risk profiles. Statins remain the foundational therapy, backed by decades of evidence supporting their efficacy in both primary, and secondary prevention of ASCVD. However, statin intolerance and the need for more aggressive LDL-C reduction in high-risk individuals have driven the development of nonstatin alternatives. These nonstatin therapies expand treatment options for those in need of greater LDL-C lowering or who cannot tolerate statins. In addition, they enhance LDL-C clearance and offer new opportunities for combination therapy, achieving greater reductions in LDL-C levels than monotherapy alone. As guidelines continue to evolve, integrating these therapies into clinical practice allows for more individualized approaches to lipid management to improve outcomes for patients at risk of ASCVD.

### Effectiveness of aggressive management of dyslipidemia in a collaborative-care practice model [^115VSkfY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The Cardiovascular Risk Identification and Treatment Center was established in 1997, adopting a collaborative-care clinic model for the purpose of improving the management of high-risk patients with dyslipidemia. This was a retrospective analysis of 417 high-risk patients with ≥ 1 year of follow-up laboratory data. Analysis included changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio; lipoprotein goal achievement; Framingham risk score; liver function; and cardiovascular events. At baseline, 66% of patients had coronary heart disease (CHD) or equivalent risk, 45% were not receiving dyslipidemia therapy, and 29% were on statin monotherapy. After 3 years in the program, 56% were receiving combination therapy, 41% were on monotherapy, and 2% were not on therapy. The 3 most common treatment regimens were statin plus niacin (36%), statin alone (22%), and niacin alone (14%). All lipoproteins improved from baseline (p < 0.001). Overall, 62% to 74% of patients reached singular lipid goals and 35% achieved combined lipid goals. Patients with Framingham 10-year CHD risk of > 20% were reduced from 6% to < 1%. Only 29 patients (7.0%) had a cardiovascular event, including 5 (1.0%) who experienced a myocardial infarction. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transferase elevation > 3 times normal occurred in 1% of patients. In conclusion, a collaborative-care practice model adopting individualized, aggressive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies is highly effective in achieving lipid goals, is sustainable, and is safe. Furthermore, this approach yields reduced projected 10-year CHD risk. A low rate of cardiovascular events was observed.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113KaHZB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^116VM5QC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Rates of prescribing of anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies among eligible patients in the United States are low; a 2019 study of electronic health record data from the National Patient‐Centered Clinical Research Network reported that < 1% of patients with dyslipidemia, LDL‐C ≥ 130 mg/dL, or coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease were prescribed these therapies.

Real‐world studies have limitations, including confounding factors, such as selection bias, variability in treatment responses, and adherence (eg, statin avoidance because of concerns around the risk of increased blood glucose and other statin‐associated adverse effects, including statin‐associated muscle symptoms). Nonetheless, these and other published studies provide substantive evidence to support the need for improved LDL‐C management in clinical practice to reduce the risk of ASCVD events.

### Optimal management of lipids in diabetes and metabolic syndrome [^112S8hz4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome frequently have higher triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and more particles containing apolipoprotein B (ApoB); this combination contributes significantly to their cardiovascular risk. Optimal management of dyslipidemia and increased atherosclerotic risk requires a fundamental understanding of diabetic dyslipidemia, the clinical evidence for different interventional strategies, and the potential benefit of achieving therapeutic targets. For this review, we considered guidelines, recent reviews, and clinical trial results. The features of dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are linked metabolically and are related to central adiposity and insulin resistance. Levels of ApoB and HDL cholesterol are particularly important markers of risk. Guidelines broadly agree that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol should be reduced below population average levels. Additional or secondary strategies in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome are to decrease non-HDL cholesterol, ApoB and/or LDL particle concentration, to increase HDL cholesterol, and to reduce triglycerides. Lifestyle changes and statins are the bedrock of treatment, although second-line treatment using fibrates or niacin will likely benefit many patients with residual risk. Ezetimibe, too, has a favorable effect on lipid profile and inflammatory biomarkers of risk. Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome has a distinct profile, suggesting the need for a tailored therapy that targets the key features of lowered HDL cholesterol and raised triglycerides, in addition to the primary antiatherogenic strategy of lowering ApoB-containing lipoproteins, such as LDL. With the prominent failure of some recent intervention trials, new therapeutic strategies-particularly safe and effective means to raise HDL-are needed to manage dyslipidemia in this high-risk population.

Statins

Lipid lowering with statin therapy has been the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of ASCVD over the past 3 decades. High‐intensity statins can reduce LDL‐C levels by ≥ 50%, which has been shown to reduce the risk of major ASCVD events significantly. Magnitude of LDL‐C lowering directly relates to efficacy; however, a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials and data from JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) confirm wide variation in the degree of LDL‐C reduction achieved among individuals treated with statins.

In terms of safety, statins are generally well tolerated, but statin‐associated adverse effects occur in some patients. Most frequent are statin‐associated muscle symptoms, reported to affect between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 people treated with standard doses. Statin‐associated muscle symptoms, or fear of statin‐associated muscle symptoms, are key factors leading to statin discontinuation or nonadherence, which remain challenging in clinical practice and contribute to adverse ASCVD outcomes. Statins can also cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis and modestly increase the risk of new‐onset diabetes in individuals with predisposing risk factors, including those with prediabetes. This does not detract from recommendations to use statins in this population, given the associated reduction in ASCVD risk.

Effectiveness of non-statin monotherapy for primary prevention — statin discontinuation and trial priorities: Most discontinuation of statin therapy is attributed to presumed statin myopathy, and while many patients tolerate the same statin when re-challenged, some are reluctant to resume a statin, leaving limited evidence-based options for primary prevention in those who cannot take statins; there is a need for clinical trials of alternative lipid-lowering agents, with medications suitable for study including ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and icosapent ethyl, and because of the low cost of generic ezetimibe, studies of ezetimibe monotherapy for primary prevention would offer the highest potential benefit.

Addressing the Continuum ofRisk

To fully realize the potential of available and future LDL‐C–lowering therapies, we propose an approach of earlier identification and more aggressive treatment of individuals at the highest risk of ASCVD events. LDL‐C management should consider each patient's risk across the continuum of ASCVD, including subclinical atherosclerosis, the degree of desired LDL‐C lowering, the role of pharmacotherapy, and LDL‐C targets or thresholds (Figure 4). Although statins form the backbone of therapy, achieving a > 50% reduction in LDL‐C levels with high‐intensity statins is often insufficient for patients at the highest risk of ASCVD events; thus, it is key to identify high‐risk patients for whom a statin is only the beginning of a multidrug regimen to lower their ASCVD risk aggressively. For patients at very high risk who require LDL‐C lowering of ≥ 50%, there should be a consideration for early, upfront combination lipid‐lowering therapy and therapy titration every 4 to 12 weeks until LDL‐C goals are achieved. Use of fixed‐dose formulations may circumvent some of the barriers associated with LDL‐C lowering, such as medication adherence and polypharmacy.

Non–LDL‐C targets, such as lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, pose a residual risk of ASCVD and should also be addressed. Emerging therapies targeting lipoprotein(a) include small interfering RNAs, olpasiran and SLN360, and an antisense oligonucleotide, pelacarsen, which has also been reported to reduce lipoprotein(a) by up to 80% while modestly reducing LDL‐C in phase 2 studies, Evinacumab and the antisense oligonucleotide, olezarsen (IONIS‐APOCIII‐LRx), are being investigated for the reduction of triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins. However, a comprehensive discussion of these novel agents is beyond the scope of this review.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults [^1119L2xg]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^116uqt2p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

Key Points for Practice
- A nonfasting plasma lipid profile can be obtained to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C in adults 20 years and older who are not on lipid-lowering therapy.
- Maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.
- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. The updated guideline also includes recommendations for nonstatin lipid-lowering agents that can be used as statin add-ons to meet recommended LDL-C thresholds. A cornerstone of the guideline is to emphasize a heart-healthy lifestyle for all patients.

A healthy lifestyle reduces ASCVD risk at all ages and can reduce the development of risk factors in younger patients. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended.

MONITORING RESPONSE TO THERAPY Based on high-quality RCTs, fasting lipid measurement should be repeated four to 12 weeks after starting the statin or making a dose adjustment to assess adherence and response to LDL-C–lowering medications and lifestyle changes. Following that, lipid measurement should be repeated every three to 12 months as needed.
