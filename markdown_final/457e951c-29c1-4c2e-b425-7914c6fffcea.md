alzheimer's amyloid

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease, integrating evidence, controversies, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biology and aggregation states of Aβ. Then, I should verify the historical amyloid cascade hypothesis and its genetic support. Next, I will examine conflicting evidence and alternative models. After that, I need to review clinical trial data and biomarker dynamics. Then, I should consider current diagnostic frameworks and the risk of overdiagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, probabilistic model and outline clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment, making sure I double-check key claims against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the biological foundation: Aβ is generated by sequential proteolysis of APP into monomers that can assemble into oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils forming plaques; I initially thought plaques were the only hallmark, but wait, I should verify that paired helical filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau (NFTs) are co-equal pathological hallmarks in AD, which they are, and that soluble oligomeric species are strongly implicated in synaptic toxicity, whereas monomers may have physiological roles, so I need to be careful not to overstate toxicity for all species [^113aMzDY] [^112RwHw6] [^116GAoN8].

> Next, I should review the amyloid cascade hypothesis and its strongest evidence; rare autosomal dominant mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 increase Aβ42 production and cause early-onset AD, and Down syndrome with triplication of APP shows early Aβ accumulation, which together provide compelling causal evidence in familial contexts; mechanistically, Aβ is thought to trigger tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, linking the two hallmark pathologies in a temporal sequence, but I need to ensure I note that this linear model fits autosomal dominant AD better than sporadic AD [^113aMzDY] [^115xtRG5] [^114HDLHW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I will now examine conflicting data that challenge a purely Aβ-centric model: many cognitively normal older adults harbor Aβ pathology, some clinically diagnosed AD cases lack significant Aβ, and tau correlates more tightly with neurodegeneration and symptoms than Aβ in sporadic disease; moreover, tau pathology can precede Aβ in medial temporal regions, suggesting independent initiation with later synergy rather than a strict Aβ-first cascade, so I should double-check that these observations are consistently reported across cohorts and modalities [^111wYUVY] [^111MHvQi] [^114nhFo1] [^114HDLHW].

> I need to check the clinical trial landscape next; numerous anti-Aβ agents failed to show robust clinical benefit, yet recent monoclonal antibodies like lecanemab and donanemab reduced amyloid and slowed decline modestly in early disease, supporting a contributory but not singular causal role; instrumental variable meta-analyses suggest that while amyloid lowering is achievable, clinical effects are small and heterogeneous, reinforcing that Aβ is necessary but not sufficient and that timing and co-pathologies matter; I should confirm that regulatory approvals have been controversial and contingent on continued evidence generation [^112jMz7o] [^113jBy1r] [^115iDht9].

> Let me consider biomarker dynamics and staging; Aβ accumulation can begin 15–30 years before symptoms, tau changes follow, and neurodegeneration and clinical decline occur later, but I should verify that this sequence is probabilistic rather than deterministic and that some individuals show discordant patterns, including tau-first or amyloid-negative profiles, which complicate a universal Aβ-first model; the dynamic biomarker model remains useful for staging but should not be over-interpreted as causal inevitability [^116VKMH2] [^114nhFo1] [^1176m98F].

> I should confirm the diagnostic implications; current frameworks define AD biologically by the presence of Aβ and tau, extending the label to preclinical and prodromal states, but this risks overdiagnosis because Aβ positivity alone does not equal imminent dementia and many non-amyloid factors contribute to cognitive decline; amyloid PET and now plasma assays improve detection, yet results must be integrated with clinical context to avoid misclassification and overtreatment [^115443fd] [^1157Mn1U] [^113aa7AF] [^11456SEX].

> But wait, what if Aβ is only a trigger and downstream processes drive neurodegeneration; I need to ensure I incorporate synergistic Aβ–tau interactions, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, vascular contributions including CAA, and systemic factors such as APOE, gut microbiome, and impaired clearance; converging data indicate Aβ and tau act synergistically rather than independently, and that multi-hit models better explain sporadic AD heterogeneity than a linear cascade [^113x3v1k] [^115qPP9X] [^112cPWK3] [^116MJ679] [^113ThGho] [^114p5CPt].

> Let me synthesize a balanced model; the most defensible position is that Aβ is necessary but not sufficient, acting as an early trigger in many cases, especially autosomal dominant AD, while sporadic AD reflects a probabilistic interplay wherein Aβ's causal weight varies with genetics, age, vascular health, and co-pathologies; this probabilistic model aligns with genetic stratification, biomarker heterogeneity, and trial outcomes, and it cautions against assuming uniform benefit from anti-amyloid therapy across all patients [^114HDLHW] [^116GAoN8] [^115iDht9].

> I should double-check clinical implications for diagnosis; in specialized settings, combining plasma Aβ42/p-tau217 with MRI, tau PET, and clinical assessment improves diagnostic confidence and staging, but results must be interpreted in the context of age, comorbidities, and risk tolerance, especially given the potential for incidental amyloid positivity and the limited specificity of amyloid in older adults [^113aa7AF] [^11456SEX] [^112gjwx9].

> For treatment, I need to ensure I emphasize precision and timing; anti-amyloid antibodies may confer modest slowing in carefully selected early-stage patients, but benefits are limited and ARIA risks are nontrivial, particularly in APOE ε4 carriers; therefore, patient selection, risk mitigation, and realistic expectations are essential, and combination or sequential strategies targeting tau, neuroinflammation, vascular factors, and synaptic integrity should be prioritized to address the multifactorial nature of disease [^114G7Gq5] [^115iDht9] [^11773xcz] [^112BafMi].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that the field has moved beyond a rigid amyloid cascade toward a systems view in which Aβ remains a key early driver in some, a contributor in others, and a bystander or epiphenomenon in yet others; this nuanced stance best reconciles genetic causality in familial disease, biomarker trajectories, trial failures and partial successes, and the clinical heterogeneity of sporadic AD, guiding more personalized, multi-target approaches to diagnosis and therapy [^114HDLHW] [^116GAoN8] [^115iDht9].

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is a **key pathogenic driver** of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with strong genetic, biomarker, and mechanistic evidence supporting its central role [^116GAoN8] [^114NhURw]. Aβ accumulates years before symptoms, forming plaques and triggering tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration [^116VKMH2] [^114nhFo1]. Anti-amyloid therapies (e.g. lecanemab, donanemab) **modestly slow decline** in early AD, confirming pathogenic relevance but highlighting the need for earlier intervention and combination strategies [^11773xcz] [^115iDht9]. Aβ remains necessary but not sufficient; tau, neuroinflammation, and vascular factors also contribute, so future treatments should target multiple pathways [^113x3v1k] [^112BafMi].

---

## Biochemistry and aggregation of amyloid-β

- **Production**: Aβ is generated from APP by β- and γ-secretases; Aβ42 aggregates more readily and is more toxic [^117PH3ZX].
- **Aggregation**: Monomers → oligomers → fibrils → plaques; oligomers are especially synaptotoxic [^112RwHw6].
- **Plaques**: Extracellular aggregates are a hallmark of AD, though oligomers may be more directly toxic [^117PH3ZX].

---

## Historical amyloid cascade hypothesis

The **original hypothesis** posits that Aβ accumulation triggers tau pathology, synaptic loss, and neurodegeneration [^113jBy1r]. Genetic support from **APP/PSEN mutations** and **Down syndrome** strengthens the causal link to Aβ [^113aMzDY]. However, **limitations** include poor correlation between plaques and cognition, tau-independent neurodegeneration, and frequent trial failures, indicating additional pathogenic factors [^1176EkYH].

---

## Recent evidence supporting amyloid-β's role

- **Genetics**: Rare protective variants in APP (e.g. A673T) reduce Aβ and AD risk, supporting causality [^111r5C4A].
- **Biomarkers**: Aβ accumulation precedes symptoms by 10–20 years and correlates with downstream tau and neurodegeneration [^117RSzL4].
- **Imaging**: Amyloid PET predicts progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic AD [^notfound].
- **Therapeutics**: Anti-amyloid antibodies (lecanemab, donanemab) reduce Aβ and modestly slow cognitive decline in early AD [^11773xcz] [^115iDht9].

---

## Controversies and challenges

- **Heterogeneity**: Sporadic AD is multifactorial; Aβ alone does not explain all cases [^114HDLHW].
- **Timing**: Benefits appear limited in symptomatic stages; earlier intervention may be needed [^113VVr7m].
- **Side effects**: ARIA and other adverse events complicate therapy, especially in APOE ε4 carriers [^114G7Gq5].
- **Alternative hypotheses**: Tau, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and vascular factors likely contribute [^112BafMi] [^115qPP9X].

## Current therapeutic strategies targeting amyloid-β

| **Therapeutic approach** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Monoclonal antibodies | - Lecanemab <br/> - Donanemab | Clear Aβ plaques | Modest slowing of decline in early AD [^11773xcz] |
| BACE inhibitors | - Verubecestat <br/> - Elenbecestat | Reduce Aβ production | - Mixed results <br/> - Cognitive worsening at high inhibition [^111uyCtf] |
| γ-secretase modulators | Semagacestat | Modulate Aβ production | - Limited efficacy <br/> - Side effects [^notfound] |

## Future directions and research priorities

- **Early intervention**: Treat before symptoms, guided by biomarkers [^114quFad].
- **Combination therapies**: Target Aβ, tau, neuroinflammation, and vascular factors [^notfound].
- **Precision medicine**: Tailor therapy to genetic and biomarker profiles [^114NhURw].
- **Biomarker development**: Improve plasma assays and imaging for earlier detection [^113aa7AF].

Amyloid-β is a **central pathogenic driver** of AD, with converging genetic, biomarker, and therapeutic evidence. Anti-amyloid therapies validate its role but reveal the need for earlier, personalized, and combination approaches to address the disease's complexity [^115iDht9].

The dominant hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) aetiology, the neuropathological guidelines for diagnosing AD and the majority of high-profile therapeutic efforts, in both research and in clinical practice, have been built around one possible causal factor, amyloid-β (Aβ). However, the causal link between Aβ and AD remains unproven. Here, in the context of a detailed assessment of historical and contemporary studies, we raise critical questions regarding the role of Aβ in the definition, diagnosis and aetiology of AD. We illustrate that a holistic view of the available data does not support an unequivocal conclusion that Aβ has a central or unique role in AD. Instead, the data suggest alternative views of AD aetiology are potentially valid, at this time. We propose that an unbiased way forward for the field, beyond the current Aβ-centric approach, without excluding a role for Aβ, is required to come to an accurate understanding of AD dementia and, ultimately, an effective treatment.

### Β-amyloid peptides and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease [^111arYL5]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Many lines of evidence support that β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. But despite much effort the molecular mechanisms of how Aβ contributes to AD remain unclear. While Aβ is generated from its precursor protein throughout life, the peptide is best known as the main component of amyloid plaques, the neuropathological hallmark of AD. Reduction in Aβ has been the major target of recent experimental therapies against AD. Unfortunately, human clinical trials targeting Aβ have not shown the hoped-for benefits. Thus, doubts have been growing about the role of Aβ as a therapeutic target. Here we review evidence supporting the involvement of Aβ in AD, highlight the importance of differentiating between various forms of Aβ, and suggest that a better understanding of Aβ's precise pathophysiological role in the disease is important for correctly targeting it for potential future therapy.

### The role of amyloid β in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^11797uC4]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

The amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is widely considered to be the major toxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a condition which afflicts approximately 36 million people worldwide. Despite a plethora of studies stretching back over two decades, identifying the toxic Aβ species has proved difficult. Debate has centred on the Aβ fibril and oligomer. Despite support from numerous experimental models, important questions linger regarding the role of the Aβ oligomer in particular. It is likely a huge array of oligomers, rather than a single species, which cause toxicity. Reappraisal of the role of the Aβ fibril points towards a dynamic relationship with the Aβ oligomer within an integrated system, as supported by evidence from microglia. However, some continue to doubt the pathological role of amyloid β, instead proposing a protective role. If the field is to progress, all Aβ oligomers should be characterised, the nomenclature revised and a consistent experimental protocol defined. For this to occur, collaboration will be required between major research groups and innovative analytical tools developed. Such action must surely be taken if amyloid-based therapeutic endeavour is to progress.

Principles to consider for AD research moving forward

The field has yet to achieve the challenge laid down by Robert Katzman in 1986; to understand the cause of disease before we can hope to prevent it. We propose the following key points be critically considered and embraced going forward as the field looks to meet this challenge:
There is a significant body of new data in the field, much of which leads to questions surrounding the accuracy of current consensus diagnostic criteria for AD and the validity of the amyloid hypothesis supporting them. Although this does not negate the possibility that Aβ status could predict dementia risk and play some role in disease aetiology, it does question the perceived centrality of its role in all AD. Considering this, it is incorrect to perpetuate the idea Aβ causes disease or accurately defines it as a priori fact.
Considering the amyloid hypothesis is struggling to account for the complexity of AD, research into treatment, prediction, diagnosis and aetiology should work to incorporate the contribution of many disease risk factors in an unbiased manner. Thus, studies of humans (and preclinical models) should not solely consider Aβ-positive individuals (and, in doing so call such individuals 'AD'), but should instead continue to include clinically identified AD cohorts irrespective of risk factors or pathology, then attempt to parse the data according to unbiased approaches.
The enormous effort to relate Aβ biomarkers to risk has not yet been met by studies of other possible biomarkers, such as neuroinflammation, vascular factors and synaptic/neurodegeneration markers. Future investment in longitudinal biomarker research must be more equally distributed.
AD dementia may, ipso facto, be a synaptic disorder. The field must consider the mechanistic pathways to synapse dysfunction and loss are many and varied. To prevent the risk of confirmation bias, studies looking into the mechanistic drivers underlying the contribution of AD risk factors to pathogenesis should aim to do so using unbiased approaches.
Results from future clinical trials will, naturally, have a major influence on research directions. We caution against over-interpretation of clinical trial data as definitive proof of the validity of any hypothesis of AD aetiology (Box 2). In particular, extrapolating results from studies in autosomal dominant AD cohorts to the wider AD spectrum must only be done with extreme caution.
More attention must be placed on understanding the subtleties and complexities of cognitive decline. Integrating the neuroscience and psychology of learning and memory, systems physiology, cardiovascular biology and endocrinology, immunology and more into the field could revolutionise our understanding of disease. As eloquently relayed, considering the person as a whole is critical to successful intervention, a view we reiterate could be extended to disease nosology, aetiology and diagnosis.

### Ten challenges of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease [^113zjiph]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The inability to effectively halt or cure Alzheimer's disease (AD), exacerbated by the recent failures of high-profile clinical trials, emphasizes the urgent need to understand the complex biochemistry of this major neurodegenerative disease. In this paper, ten central, current challenges of the major paradigm in the field, the amyloid hypothesis, are sharply formulated. These challenges together show that new approaches are necessary that address data heterogeneity, increase focus on the proteome level, use available human patient data more actively, account for the aging phenotype as a background model of the disease, unify our understanding of the interplay between genetic and non-genetic risk factors, and combine into one framework both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease.

### Is brain amyloid production a cause or a result of dementia of the Alzheimer's type? [^1142u4P6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis has guided much of the research into Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the last 25 years. We argue that the hypothesis of amyloid-β (Aβ) as the primary cause of dementia may not be fully correct. Rather, we propose that decline in brain metabolic activity, which is tightly linked to synaptic activity, actually underlies both the cognitive decline in AD and the deposition of Aβ. Aβ may further exacerbate metabolic decline and result in a downward spiral of cognitive function, leading to dementia. This novel interpretation can tie the disparate risk factors for dementia to a unifying hypothesis and present a roadmap for interventions to decrease the prevalence of dementia in the elderly population.

Box 1: Long-held assumptions supporting the hypothetical current consensus diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease

Assumption 1

Aβ and tau pathologies are, combined, a specific marker of AD dementia with Aβ pathology upstream of tau and other AD-associated pathologies.

Assumption 2

AD is a single homogenous disorder in which individuals with early-onset familial or early-onset sporadic AD (onset at < 65 years of age) and late-onset familial or late-onset sporadic AD (onset at > 65 years of age) have the same disease.

### Is amyloid-β harmful to the brain? Insights from human imaging studies [^111wYUVY]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Although the amyloid-β protein associated with the Alzheimer's disease plaque has been detectable in living people for over a decade, its importance in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is still debated. The frequent presence of amyloid-β in the brains of cognitively healthy older people has been interpreted as evidence against a causative role. If amyloid-β is crucial to the development of Alzheimer's disease, it should be associated with other Alzheimer's disease-like neurological changes. This review examines whether amyloid-β is associated with other biomarkers indicative of early Alzheimer's disease in normal older people. The preponderance of evidence links amyloid-β to functional change, progressive brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. Individuals at greatest risk of decline seem to be those with evidence of both amyloid-β and findings suggestive of neurodegeneration. The crucial question is thus how amyloid-β is related to brain degeneration and how these two processes interact to cause cognitive decline and dementia.

### The amyloid-β pathway in Alzheimer's disease [^116GAoN8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Breakthroughs in molecular medicine have positioned the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway at the center of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. While the detailed molecular mechanisms of the pathway and the spatial-temporal dynamics leading to synaptic failure, neurodegeneration, and clinical onset are still under intense investigation, the established biochemical alterations of the Aβ cycle remain the core biological hallmark of AD and are promising targets for the development of disease-modifying therapies. Here, we systematically review and update the vast state-of-the-art literature of Aβ science with evidence from basic research studies to human genetic and multi-modal biomarker investigations, which supports a crucial role of Aβ pathway dyshomeostasis in AD pathophysiological dynamics. We discuss the evidence highlighting a differentiated interaction of distinct Aβ species with other AD-related biological mechanisms, such as tau-mediated, neuroimmune and inflammatory changes, as well as a neurochemical imbalance. Through the lens of the latest development of multimodal in vivo biomarkers of AD, this cross-disciplinary review examines the compelling hypothesis- and data-driven rationale for Aβ-targeting therapeutic strategies in development for the early treatment of AD.

### Beyond amyloid: getting real about nonamyloid targets in Alzheimer's disease [^115Hd73n]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2013). Low credibility.

For decades, researchers have focused primarily on a pathway initiated by amyloid beta aggregation, amyloid deposition, and accumulation in the brain as the key mechanism underlying the disease and the most important treatment target. However, evidence increasingly suggests that amyloid is deposited early during the course of disease, even prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, targeting amyloid in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), as past failed clinical trials have done, may be insufficient to halt further disease progression. Scientists are investigating other molecular and cellular pathways and processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis. Thus, the Alzheimer's Association's Research Roundtable convened a meeting in April 2012 to move beyond amyloid and explore AD as a complex multifactorial disease, with the goal of using a more inclusive perspective to identify novel treatment strategies.

### Beyond amyloid-β: reevaluating its physiological role to find safe therapies against Alzheimer's disease [^113B8cEu]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

This commentary critically examines the long-standing emphasis on amyloid-β (Aβ)-based therapies in Alzheimer's disease (AD), despite numerous clinical trial failures. It highlights the urgency to reassess research methodologies and challenges the initiation of anti-Aβ trials in preclinical stages of the disease without conclusive proofs of their safety and efficacy. Instead, a comprehensive approach that considers Aβ's physiological roles and addresses AD complex nature is suggested, encouraging the idea that clinical trial failures may result from targeting the wrong mechanism. Evidence-based scientific research is needed to advance with AD treatment, moving beyond the current conception of Aβ hypothesis.

### The amyloid cascade hypothesis: an updated critical review [^1176EkYH]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Results from recent clinical trials of antibodies that target amyloid-β (Aβ) for Alzheimer's disease have created excitement and have been heralded as corroboration of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, while Aβ may contribute to disease, genetic, clinical, imaging and biochemical data suggest a more complex aetiology. Here we review the history and weaknesses of the amyloid cascade hypothesis in view of the new evidence obtained from clinical trials of anti-amyloid antibodies. These trials indicate that the treatments have either no or uncertain clinical effect on cognition. Despite the importance of amyloid in the definition of Alzheimer's disease, we argue that the data point to Aβ playing a minor aetiological role. We also discuss data suggesting that the concerted activity of many pathogenic factors contribute to Alzheimer's disease and propose that evolving multi-factor disease models will better underpin the search for more effective strategies to treat the disease.

### Role of amyloid-β and tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease: confuting the amyloid cascade [^116zDqLy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The "Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis" has dominated the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field in the last 25 years. It posits that the increase of amyloid-β (Aβ) is the key event in AD that triggers tau pathology followed by neuronal death and eventually, the disease. However, therapeutic approaches aimed at decreasing Aβ levels have so far failed, and tau-based clinical trials have not yet produced positive findings. This begs the question of whether the hypothesis is correct. Here we have examined literature on the role of Aβ and tau in synaptic dysfunction, memory loss, and seeding and spreading of AD, highlighting important parallelisms between the two proteins in all of these phenomena. We discuss novel findings showing binding of both Aβ and tau oligomers to amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), and the requirement for the presence of this protein for both Aβ and tau to enter neurons and induce abnormal synaptic function and memory. Most importantly, we propose a novel view of AD pathogenesis in which extracellular oligomers of Aβ and tau act in parallel and upstream of AβPP. Such a view will call for a reconsideration of therapeutic approaches directed against Aβ and tau, paving the way to an increased interest toward AβPP, both for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and elaborating new therapeutic strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

What causes Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Theories regarding the etiology of the common, late‐onset, sporadic form of AD vary greatly, based in part on the very different methods used to probe the disease. Although evidence of both extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is needed to officially diagnose AD, there are longstanding arguments about which of these initiates the pathology, for example, with the genetics of autosomal dominant AD favoring the amyloid hypothesis, whereby the initial creation of Aβ 42 peptides subsequently "drives" tau pathology and neuronal degeneration, while the perspective from neuropathological studies of sporadic AD (sAD) document tau inclusions a decade before the appearance of amyloid deposition, countering this view. The current review aims to integrate multiple perspectives on AD etiology from divergent methodologies, including new data from fluid biomarkers and macaque models that are transforming our understanding of the earliest stages of sAD pathology.

### Three dimensions of the amyloid hypothesis: time, space and' wingmen' [^114XSZkz]. Nature Neuroscience (2015). Medium credibility.

The amyloid hypothesis, which has been the predominant framework for research in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been the source of considerable controversy. The amyloid hypothesis postulates that amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is the causative agent in AD. It is strongly supported by data from rare autosomal dominant forms of AD. However, the evidence that Aβ causes or contributes to age-associated sporadic AD is more complex and less clear, prompting criticism of the hypothesis. We provide an overview of the major arguments for and against the amyloid hypothesis. We conclude that Aβ likely is the key initiator of a complex pathogenic cascade that causes AD. However, we argue that Aβ acts primarily as a trigger of other downstream processes, particularly tau aggregation, which mediate neurodegeneration. Aβ appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, to cause AD. Its major pathogenic effects may occur very early in the disease process.

### Questions concerning the role of amyloid-β in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^112cPWK3]. Acta Neuropathologica (2018). Low credibility.

How can the relatively poor spatial correlation of amyloid plaques to NFTs, synapse loss and neurodegeneration be explained in a theory maintaining amyloid is primary in aetiology? One theory, with growing support, holds that Aβ deposition may trigger prion-like seeding and propagation of tau pathology in functionally connected areas. However, the spreading of aggregated tau does not necessarily require the presence of amyloid deposits, and tau may enhance the deposition and toxicity of Aβ. Theoretically AD could begin through self-propagation of Aβ aggregates via a prion-like seeding mechanism, followed by propagation of disease through the aforementioned mechanisms (e.g. Aβ could be the 'trigger' and tau the 'bullet'). Other possible explanations are discussed in Supplementary Material 1.3.

Several caveats accompany theories seeking to explain Aβ's role in these complex ways. Most involve Aβ pathology appearing before other AD-associated pathologies, which is not yet definitive (see next section). Additionally, much of the debate has shifted to the relationship of soluble oligomeric Aβ and tau to disease, rather than insoluble species, questioning the aetiological relevance of insoluble protein deposits. As mentioned earlier, theories regarding soluble Aβ and tau await a better understanding of their nature in vivo. Otherwise, a major caveat is the lack of in vivo investigation of other possible markers of the clinical AD phenotype, beyond Aβ and tau. We discuss promising alternatives below and under Question 4.

We also note that Aβ deposition occurs in the cerebrovasculature (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)) as well as in the brain parenchyma. CAA is present in up to 85–95% of individuals with AD, with 25% of AD brains having moderate-to-severe CAA. Importantly, some cortical atrophy in AD may be a consequence of CAA, suggesting CAA may be an independent contributor to cognitive and pathological alterations in AD, despite it often being left out of the aetiological discussion. CAA is discussed in more detail in Supplementary Material 1.3.

The extension of hypothetical diagnostic guidelines to preclinical and prodromal states

The push to extend hypothetical diagnostic criteria for AD to preclinical and prodromal phases may be premature whilst the assumptions underlying the criteria remain unproven

In 2011 recommendations were published for identifying prodromal ('mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD ') and preclinical ('AD-pathophysiological process ') stages of AD. Subsequently, proposals that these stages could be identified using in vivo 'biomarker' evidence of Aβ and tau pathology, irrespective of cognitive changes, have emerged.

The recent NIA-AA commissioned workgroup consolidated these proposals, and spoke of an 'Alzheimer's continuum'. This was defined as: "… individuals with biomarker designation of either AD or Alzheimer's pathologic change ", wherein "biomarker designation of AD " refers to in vivo evidence of Aβ and tau pathology and "Alzheimer's pathologic change " refers to in vivo evidence of Aβ pathology alone (with normal tau biomarkers). In this system, evidence of abnormal tau and/or neurodegeneration biomarkers, in the absence of Aβ pathology, are defined as "non-AD pathologic change". Importantly, the IWG have also proposed guidelines for the identification of these states with the use of biomarkers, but are less definitive than the NIA-AA workgroup on the primacy of Aβ measurements. They still allow for the possibility that those with evidence of tau pathology, in the absence of amyloid, are also at-risk for AD dementia. As noted, the two advisory bodies are, however, harmonised on the concept of using the label 'Alzheimer's' when Aβ and tau pathology are found, irrespective of the cognitive diagnosis.

Implications of Questions 1–5: the risks of labelling 'Aβ pathology' as 'Alzheimer's'

Many findings raise questions regarding the central role of Aβ in all AD: until this is resolved, caution is needed

This kind of genuine objectivity, while seemingly a necessary quality of any scientist in his field, is systemically virtually precluded now more than 100 years later. In a modern era where science has to be sold to funding agencies in order for careers to be maintained if not advanced, where adherence to schools of thought is nakedly prejudicial, and where fealty to senior scientists has less to do with scholarship and innovation than political stratagem, it is somewhat refreshing to peruse the translated works. Moreover, Alzheimer was anything but a self-promoter, as the name of the disease that now bears his name was not put forth by Alzheimer, but his contemporary and boss at the University of Munich, Emil Kraepelin (Figure 1.4). Alzheimer, for his part, went to great lengths to include the observations of others in his descriptions:

Castellani and Perry

Our motive for raising questions about the position of Aβ in AD nosology, aetiology and diagnosis is not to suggest Aβ has no role in AD, nor to suggest that therapeutically targeting Aβ may not ultimately prove to have some benefit. We do not refute a role for Aβ in AD aetiology and we draw no such conclusion here. We have, for example, already reviewed its role as one of the secondary damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) that generate proinflammatory cytokines through activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a number of diseases. In other words, the role of Aβ in health and disease remains an important basis of continuing research.

It is not yet known, however, exactly why Aβ accumulates in some individuals. For sporadic AD, the prevailing theory suggests failing clearance mechanisms, whereas in familial AD, altered proteolytic processing of APP may be the culprit, with the caveat not all autosomal dominant AD mutations have the same catalytic effect. Alternatively, amyloid plaque pathology could be a " general type of tissue reaction " to a number of factors, as suggested some eight decades ago.

### Alzheimer's disease: a general introduction and pathomechanism [^113kFrXA]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which affects more than 35 million people worldwide with increasing tendency. Satisfying therapies and prevention are not available. Since the first description of the fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease in 1907, however, major findings on the molecular mechanisms have been reported. Current clinical trials target diverse aspects and principles of AD, such as the generation and aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ). Extracellular amyloid plaques, predominantly consisting of Aβ, and intracellular neurofibrillar tangles, formed by hyperphosphorylated tau, are the major pathological hallmarks in the brain of AD patients. AD is consequently one of about 40 identified amyloidoses - protein misfolding diseases, which share as their main pathogenic mechanism the aberrant deposition of endogenous proteins as amyloid fibrils. This article aims principally to introduce AD and its identified key players, to summarize classic and recent publications on the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, and to discuss challenges that need to be faced for the development of improved therapeutic strategies.

### Metals, membranes, and amyloid-β oligomers: key pieces in the Alzheimer's disease puzzle? [^113tD9Pz]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 100 years, there has been an exponential increase in our understanding of the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This growth in knowledge has largely stemmed from the intensification of research into AD which has occurred over the past three decades and the incorporation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis as the generally accepted dogma of AD pathogenesis. While at times contentious, the notion that AD arises from aberrations in amyloid-β (Aβ) production and degradation has led to a number of significant breakthroughs in the way in which AD is currently diagnosed and in the attempts at disease modifying therapies, from investigations into the underlying factors mediating the aggregation of Aβ to the development of therapeutic strategies and measures of neuroimaging allowing Aβ burden to be monitored within the AD-affected brain. This review focuses on some of the recent work we have conducted toward elucidating the role of Aβ in AD.

### Questions concerning the role of amyloid-β in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^111JnhZm]. Acta Neuropathologica (2018). Low credibility.

In this context, it is important to note also that although Aβ is often considered deleterious, no consensus exists yet on whether it is harmful, helpful or just a bystander. Some have suggested it is an antibacterial and antiviral, seals blood–brain barrier leaks and has roles in learning and memory, amongst other important physiological functions, some of which could explain its deposition in the aging brain. As we and others have previously pointed out, little is known about these roles, the physiological functions of the APP protein and other cleavage products of APP, or the physiological roles of presenilin proteins beyond APP processing. This is not to say that Aβ, or specific species of Aβ, do not also have deleterious functions, but that their role may be dynamic and more complex than toxicity alone. Further studies along these themes may help put Aβ's role in disease in a different context.

### Questions concerning the role of amyloid-β in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^111MHvQi]. Acta Neuropathologica (2018). Low credibility.

In one study, cognitively unimpaired individuals with SNAP were found to be indistinguishable from amyloid positive individuals by both imaging and clinical criteria, as well as risk factor assessments. Furthermore, separation of PART from AD has been disputed on the grounds that no neuropathological, genetic or clinical criteria differentiate such cases from early AD. These arguments, debated in references, are consistent with clinical AD sometimes being independent of Aβ pathology. In this context it is important to note that both Aβ and non-Aβ pathologies associated with dementia account for less than half of all late-life cognitive decline, suggesting the field has barely scratched the surface of potential causes or contributors to cognitive decline, beyond histologically visible lesions.

In summary, the previous two sections illustrate (1) that cohorts of cognitively normal individuals can show Aβ and tau pathologies, implying amyloid deposition is not necessarily causal; (2) that other cohorts diagnosed as 'non-AD' dementias can exhibit amyloid plaques and tau tangles, implying these lesions are not unique to AD, and (3) Aβ-negative cohorts diagnosed clinically as AD dementia can instead exhibit other pathologies, indicating pathogenic pathways to AD dementia unrelated to amyloid.

One could eliminate these discrepancies by ignoring the clinical diagnosis and relying solely on the presence of Aβ (± tau) pathology to define AD dementia. However, as we have discussed, the literature is not this simple. Further understanding by the field, on which rational therapy depends, must face this issue.

### Amyloid-β and tau – a toxic pas de deux in Alzheimer's disease [^113XV6RR]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Amyloid-β and tau are the two hallmark proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Although both amyloid-β and tau have been extensively studied individually with regard to their separate modes of toxicity, more recently new light has been shed on their possible interactions and synergistic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease towards being a crucial partner of amyloid-β. As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-β toxicity.

### The amyloid hypothesis, time to move on: amyloid is the downstream result, not cause, of Alzheimer's disease [^111ei9KY]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2014). Low credibility.

The "amyloid hypothesis" has dominated Alzheimer research for more than 20 years, and proposes that amyloid is the toxic cause of neural/synaptic damage and dementia. If correct, decreasing the formation or removing amyloid should be therapeutic. Despite discrepancies in the proposed mechanism, and failed clinical trials, amyloid continues to be considered the cause of a degenerative cascade. Alternative hypotheses must explain three features: (i) why amyloid toxicity is not the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), (ii) what alternative mechanisms cause the degeneration and dementia of AD, and (iii) why increased amyloid accumulates in the brain in AD. We propose that AD, which occurs in elderly, already vulnerable brains, with multiple age-related changes, is precipitated by impaired microvascular function, resulting primarily from decreased Notch-related angiogenesis. With impaired microvasculature, a lack of vascular endothelial-derived trophic factors and decreased cerebral blood flow cause the atrophy of neural structures. Therapeutic strategies should focus on supporting normal angiogenesis.

Question 2: Are there individuals diagnosed clinically with AD, but who have no Aβ and tau pathology?

Answer: Some individuals clinically diagnosed with AD do not have Aβ pathology

Discrepancies between the clinical phenotype and the neuropathology of disease have long been known. Alzheimer's second case, for instance, was one of plaque-only dementia, lacking tau tangles. However, it was not until formal neuropathological guidelines were in place that systematic studies shed light on how widespread these discrepancies are. Reviewing the relationship of the clinical and neuropathological diagnosis across 919 subjects at National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Centres from 2005 to 2010, Beach demonstrated a sensitivity of diagnosis ranging from 70.9 to 87.3% and specificity of 44.3–70.8%. Importantly, a substantial proportion (39%) of their 'non-AD' dementia diagnoses exhibited AD histopathology, a finding corroborated in other studies. Other significant findings were that a number of clinical AD diagnoses had low levels of Aβ pathology and that 17 of 88 cases not meeting pathological criteria for AD were diagnosed with AD regardless.

### Intracellular amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease [^113xSir1]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

The primal role that the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has in the development of Alzheimer's disease is now almost universally accepted. It is also well recognized that Abeta exists in multiple assembly states, which have different physiological or pathophysiological effects. Although the classical view is that Abeta is deposited extracellularly, emerging evidence from transgenic mice and human patients indicates that this peptide can also accumulate intraneuronally, which may contribute to disease progression.

### The amyloid cascade hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease: an appraisal for the development of therapeutics [^112a5NEs]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2011). Medium credibility.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis, which posits that the deposition of the amyloid-β peptide in the brain is a central event in Alzheimer's disease pathology, has dominated research for the past twenty years. Several therapeutics that were purported to reduce amyloid-β production or aggregation have failed in Phase III clinical testing, and many others are in various stages of development. Therefore, it is timely to review the science underpinning the amyloid cascade hypothesis, consider what type of clinical trials will constitute a valid test of this hypothesis and explore whether amyloid-β-directed therapeutics will provide the medicines that are urgently needed by society for treating this devastating disease.

### Revisiting the role of brain and peripheral A β in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^111NJNut]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Amyloid beta (Aβ) is an intricate molecule that interacts with several biomolecules and/or produces insoluble assemblies and eventually the nonphysiological depositions of its alternate with normal neuronal conditions leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is formed through the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Significant efforts are being made to explore the exact role of Aβ in AD pathogenesis. It is believed that the deposition of Aβ in the brain takes place from Aβ components which are derived from the brain itself. However, recent evidence suggests that Aβ derived also from the periphery and hence the Aβ circulating in the blood is capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the role of Aβ derived from the periphery is largely unknown so far. Therefore, Aβ origin determination and the underlying mechanisms of its pathological effects are of considerable interest in exploring effective therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to provide a novel insight into AD pathogenesis based on Aβ in both the brain and periphery and highlight new therapeutic avenues to combat AD pathogenesis.

### Synergy between amyloid-β and tau in Alzheimer's disease [^113x3v1k]. Nature Neuroscience (2020). High credibility.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with both extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. For many years, the prevailing view of AD pathogenesis has been that changes in Aβ precipitate the disease process and initiate a deleterious cascade involving tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Beyond this 'triggering' function, it has been typically presumed that Aβ and tau act independently and in the absence of specific interaction. However, accumulating evidence now suggests otherwise and contends that both pathologies have synergistic effects. This could not only help explain negative results from anti-Aβ clinical trials but also suggest that trials directed solely at tau may need to be reconsidered. Here, drawing from extensive human and disease model data, we highlight the latest evidence base pertaining to the complex Aβ-tau interaction and underscore its crucial importance to elucidating disease pathogenesis and the design of next-generation AD therapeutic trials.

### Therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease [^115KtuYv]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and ultimately fatal neurological disorder for which there is no effective treatment at present. The disease is characterized pathologically by cerebral plaques that contain the amyloid-beta peptide and thread-like neuronal structures composed of the microtubule-associated protein TAU. Both amyloid-beta and TAU are thought to be crucial to pathogenesis, but compelling evidence supports amyloid-beta as the 'prime mover'. The main efforts for developing therapeutics are therefore focused on preventing amyloid-beta production, aggregation or downstream neurotoxic events. The progress of these and other approaches raises the hope that effective agents for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease will be available in the near future.

### Perspectives on the amyloid-beta cascade hypothesis [^1139fTjk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2004). Low credibility.

For the better part of the past two decades, studies on the molecular, biochemical and cellular mechanisms of Alzheimer disease have focused on amyloid-beta protein, the major proteinaceous component of senile plaques. In fact, the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis has come to dominate the field both in terms of proposed disease mechanism as well as potential for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we look at the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis from the perspective of pathology, cell biology, and genetics. In all cases, alternate interpretations of old data as well as new evidence indicates that amyloid-beta, far from being the harbinger of disease, actually occurs secondary to more fundamental pathological changes and may even play a protective role in the diseased brain. These findings bring into serious doubt the validity of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis as the central cause of Alzheimer disease and, consequently, the potential usefulness of therapeutic targets against amyloid-beta.

### The road to restoring neural circuits for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [^115zkyZa]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive loss of memory and cognition, for which there is no cure. Although genetic studies initially suggested a primary role for amyloid-in Alzheimer's disease, treatment strategies targeted at reducing amyloid-have failed to reverse cognitive symptoms. These clinical findings suggest that cognitive decline is the result of a complex pathophysiology and that targeting amyloid-alone may not be sufficient to treat Alzheimer's disease. Instead, a broad outlook on neural-circuit-damaging processes may yield insights into new therapeutic strategies for curing memory loss in the disease.

### Alzheimer's disease [^113aMzDY]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Research advances have enabled detailed understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the hallmarks of the disease — ie, plaques, composed of amyloid beta (Abeta), and tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, as our knowledge increases so does our appreciation for the pathogenic complexity of the disorder. Familial Alzheimer's disease is a very rare autosomal dominant disease with early onset, caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes, both linked to Abeta metabolism. By contrast with familial disease, sporadic Alzheimer's disease is very common with more than 15 million people affected worldwide. The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is unknown, probably because the disease is heterogeneous, caused by ageing in concert with a complex interaction of both genetic and environmental risk factors. This seminar reviews the key aspects of the disease, including epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as recent developments and controversies.

### Pathology and pathways of Alzheimer's disease with an update on new developments in treatment [^113kyxbH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

As our understanding of the complex pathology of Alzheimer's disease improves, more targets for therapy emerge. These include the actions of beta amyloid, the inflammatory cascade, pathobiology of tau proteins' conversion to neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative neuronal damage, and neurotransmitter depletion. Many agents now under investigation target the early stages of the disease process, aiming to prevent or slow the development of symptoms. This article reviews the current understanding of the course and pathology of Alzheimer's disease as it relates to emerging therapies, then summarizes some promising current research directions in primary prevention, secondary prevention, and treatment.

### The unexpected role of a β 1–42 monomers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^117PH3ZX]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related disease, and it has become a very serious social and health problem with the increase of life expectancy. Indeed, the risk of AD increases dramatically in individuals above the age of 70, and it is predicted that the incidence of the disease could further increase by 3-fold over the next 50 years.

Extracellular amyloid plaques formed by aggregated amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed by polymers of altered tau protein are the two main pathological hallmarks of the disease.

According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, a series of clues indicate that the accumulation of Aβ in the brain is the primary and early event that induces neuronal degeneration, characterized by accumulation of conformational altered and aggregated tau protein.

Aβ, a 39–43 residue polypeptide, is cleaved from the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by β- and γ -secretases and consists of a largely hydrophilic N-terminal domain (1–16) and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain. The predominant Aβ species end at 40 and 42 residues; the latter shows a greater propensity for aggregation and is considerably more neurotoxic because of two additional hydrophobic amino acids.

Although many details in the pathogenesis of AD remain elusive, Aβ has been proposed as a biomarker and a drug target for the therapy, being expected to ameliorate the accuracy of early diagnosis, and to investigate the influence of drugs on Aβ removal and aggregation. The neurotoxic entity and relevance of each conformational form of Aβ to AD pathology is still under debate; Aβ oligomers are considered the major killer form of the peptide but a role for fibrillary form of Aβ to neurotoxicity cannot be ignored. Monomers instead have been proposed to be involved in physiological process. Their role in the pathogenesis of AD is unknown. Here we reviewed some different effects mediated by monomers and oligomers on mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.

### Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease [^117S9j3F]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia worldwide. While neuritic plaques consisting of aggregated amyloid-beta proteins and neurofibrillary tangles of accumulated tau proteins represent the pathophysiologic hallmarks of AD, numerous processes likely interact with risk and protective factors and one's culture to produce the cognitive loss, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functional impairments that characterize AD dementia. Recent biomarker and neuroimaging research has revealed how the pathophysiology of AD may lead to symptoms, and as the pathophysiology of AD gains clarity, more potential treatments are emerging that aim to modify the disease and relieve its burden.

### The amyloid-β pathway in Alzheimer's disease [^116VKMH2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia, affecting ~45.0 million individuals worldwide and is ranked as the fifth leading cause of death globally. In the United States alone, an estimated 5.8 million individuals live with AD dementia today, and this number is expected to grow to 13.8 million by 2050. Similarly, in Western Europe, dementia affects ~2.5% of people aged 65–69 years, escalating to about 40% of those aged 90–94 years, and by 2050, there will likely be up to 18.9 million patients with dementia in Europe and 36.5 million in East Asian countries.

To date, drugs approved for the treatment of AD are labeled for the disease's clinical dementia stage and target the neurochemical systems underlying cognitive dysfunction and behavioral symptoms, with only short-term symptomatic effects. In the last 25 years, translational studies — including experimental animal and human neuropathological, genetic, and in vivo biomarker-based evidence — support a descriptive hypothetical model of AD pathophysiology characterized by the upstream brain accumulation of Aβ species and plaques, which precedes spreading of tau, neuronal loss and ultimately clinical manifestations by up to 20–30 years. Such multi-dimensional evidence led to reshaping the conceptual framework of AD, into a clinical-biological construct along a continuum that spans preclinical, prodromal, and eventually dementia stages.

### Pathways to Alzheimer's disease [^111r5C4A]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Recent trials of anti-amyloid agents have not produced convincing improvements in clinical outcome in Alzheimer's disease; however, the reason for these poor or inconclusive results remains unclear. Recent genetic data continue to support the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease with protective variants being found in the amyloid gene and both common low-risk and rare high-risk variants for disease being discovered in genes that are part of the amyloid response pathways. These data support the view that genetic variability in how the brain responds to amyloid deposition is a potential therapeutic target for the disease, and are consistent with the notion that anti-amyloid therapies should be initiated early in the disease process.

### Questions concerning the role of amyloid-β in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^1157Mn1U]. Acta Neuropathologica (2018). Low credibility.

There has always been an inherent risk of using Aβ pathology to define disease. Placing any individual with 'abnormal' levels of Aβ under the 'Alzheimer's' banner risks including individuals that may never develop AD dementia, or excluding individuals destined to develop it. For example, had in vivo biomarkers been available to indicate Sister Mary's abnormal amyloid plaque levels in life she may have been, under the recently proposed criteria, a candidate for clinical AD trials, despite hindsight telling us she would never have developed cognitive decline. A more complex, unbiased and multifaceted approach to disease prediction could have identified Sister Mary's unlikely progression.

Furthermore, applying disease labels without previously determining if these pathologies truly represent a specific disease severely limits research investigating unifying theories in which individuals with or without other certain pathologies (such as hippocampal sclerosis, tauopathy, neurodegeneration, Lewy bodies, Aβ, etc.), are, aetiologically, part of the same disease spectrum, with Aβ pathology being just one marker, albeit somewhat unreliable, for dementia risk.

With these thoughts in mind, throughout this article we have deliberating avoided, where possible, using terms such as 'AD neuropathology', the 'neuropathological hallmarks of disease', or some other variation, to refer to Aβ and/or tau pathology. Instead we have referred to them individually as 'amyloid plaque' or 'Aβ' pathology, 'tau' or 'NFT' pathology, or AD-related/associated, where appropriate. The reason should be evident: we are not yet convinced (based on current and emerging data) they alone can account for the complexity of clinical AD dementia, or are unique markers of AD dementia, particularly in the absence of symptomatic changes. The use of such terms buys into this assumption as a priori fact.

### Current thinking on the mechanistic basis of Alzheimer's and implications for drug development [^117RSzL4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the aggregation and accumulation of two proteins in the brain, amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. Aβ and tau begin to buildup 15–20 years before the clinical onset of AD dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that preventing or decreasing the amount of aggregated forms of both Aβ and tau in the brain can serve as potential disease-modifying treatments for AD.

In this review, current understanding of the epidemiology, genetics, pathology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is outlined, before its clinical presentation and current treatment strategies are discussed. Finally, the review discusses how our enhanced understanding of Alzheimer pathogenesis, including the recognition of a protracted preclinical phase, is informing new therapeutic strategies with the aim of moving from treatment to prevention.

### Anti-a β therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease: the need for a paradigm shift [^113VVr7m]. Neuron (2011). Low credibility.

Most current Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies in advanced phases of development target amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) production, aggregation, or accumulation. Translational models suggest that anti-Aβ therapies may be highly effective if tested as agents to prevent or delay development of the disease or as therapies for asymptomatic patients with very early signs of AD pathology. However, anti-Aβ therapeutics are currently being tested in symptomatic patients where they are likely to be much less effective or ineffective. The lack of alignment between human clinical studies and preclinical studies, together with predictions about optimal trial design based on our understanding of the initiating role of Aβ aggregates in AD, has created a treatment versus prevention dilemma. In this perspective, we discuss why it is imperative to resolve this dilemma and suggest ways for moving forward in the hopes of enhancing the development of truly effective AD therapeutics.

### The abeta hypothesis: leading us to rationally-designed therapeutic strategies for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer disease [^116iEpHB]. Brain Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been increasingly referred to as the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) cascade hypothesis. This subtle rephrasing reflects the acknowledgment that there is debate within the field as to whether Abeta aggregates other than Abeta deposited as classic amyloid fibrils could trigger the pathological cascade that results in neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Despite this semantic shift, which highlights one enigmatic aspects of AD, the evidence supporting the Abeta hypothesis of AD is extensive. More importantly the Abeta hypothesis of AD has led and will continue to lead to the development of rationale therapeutic strategies that are likely to either prevent or treat this devastating disease. In this review, the evidence supporting the Abeta hypothesis and the recent advances in anti-Abeta therapy are discussed.

### The case for rejecting the amyloid cascade hypothesis [^114dJGN3]. Nature Neuroscience (2015). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a biologically complex neurodegenerative dementia. Nearly 20 years ago, with the combination of observations from biochemistry, neuropathology and genetics, a compelling hypothesis known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis was formulated. The core of this hypothesis is that it is pathological accumulations of amyloid-β, a peptide fragment of a membrane protein called amyloid precursor protein, that act as the root cause of AD and initiate its pathogenesis. Yet, with the passage of time, growing amounts of data have accumulated that are inconsistent with the basically linear structure of this hypothesis. And while there is fear in the field over the consequences of rejecting it outright, clinging to an inaccurate disease model is the option we should fear most. This Perspective explores the proposition that we are over-reliant on amyloid to define and diagnose AD and that the time has come to face our fears and reject the amyloid cascade hypothesis.

### Anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^116Hzrwh]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

AMYLOID‐β AS A TREATMENT TARGET AND CURRENT BIOMARKERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

The accumulation of Aβ plaques in the brain is thought to be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD, followed by the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. These pathological hallmarks lead to neuronal dysfunction, inflammation and ultimately neuronal death. Whilst these core pathological features of AD are well established, their exact role in disease progression is still under investigation. It is unclear whether the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau protein is a cause or consequence of the disease. Nevertheless, targeting the accumulation of Aβ in the brain is currently the most prevalent approach to AD disease‐modifying treatments.

Diagnosing AD can be challenging, as the symptoms of the disease are similar to those of other forms of dementia and very early clinical signs overlap with physiological cognitive changes due to older age. Traditionally, the diagnosis of AD was based on clinical criteria, including a progressive amnestic syndrome and impairment of normal daily activities. However, the accuracy of clinical diagnoses is limited, with at least 20% of patients diagnosed with AD based on clinical criteria having no underlying AD pathology. Biomarkers for AD have been developed to aid in diagnosis and monitor disease progression. Currently available biomarkers are cerebrospinal fluid Aβ and tau protein levels, as well as Aβ and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. These biomarkers have shown promise in identifying individuals with underlying AD pathology, including in early stages of the disease. However, these biomarkers are invasive and difficult to scale.

### Alzheimer's disease: strategies for disease modification [^1172ugJH]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2010). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is the largest unmet medical need in neurology. Current drugs improve symptoms, but do not have profound disease-modifying effects. However, in recent years, several approaches aimed at inhibiting disease progression have advanced to clinical trials. Among these, strategies targeting the production and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide - a cardinal feature of Alzheimer's disease that is thought to be important in disease pathogenesis - are the most advanced. Approaches aimed at modulating the abnormal aggregation of tau filaments (another key feature of the disease), and those targeting metabolic dysfunction, are also being evaluated in the clinic. This article discusses recent progress with each of these strategies, with a focus on anti-amyloid strategies, highlighting the lessons learned and the challenges that remain.

Conclusions

Over the recent decades, translational and multi-disciplinary studies — from (epi)genetic, to biological, and to biomarker-based clinical investigations — have contributed to unveiling the biochemical, physiological, and pathophysiological features of the Aβ pathway, including its spatial and temporal dynamics throughout the AD continuum. All point to the Aβ pathway as a hallmark of disease pathophysiology rather than a passive readout of the disease process. As discussed above, anatomical and biomarker-based studies of familial and sporadic AD provide critical genetic and molecular evidence about the initiation of the Aβ pathway decades before the onset of the symptoms and upstream to other pathophysiological hallmarks of AD.

These advances in biology have culminated in the identification of tangible therapeutic molecular targets for AD in order to slow disease progression at the earliest possible clinical and preclinical stages. Progress in drug R&D has also been accelerated by the validation of Aβ biomarkers-based outcomes and endpoints and for different context(s)-of-use, including patient diagnosis for clinical trials, target engagement of drug candidates, and proof-of-mechanism. Implementation of biomarker-guided pipelines contributes to explaining why the first generation of compounds targeting Aβ aggregation species and with putative disease-modifying effect reached late-stage development and exhibited phase II and phase III failures. However, the field needs to fully uncover the physiological functions of the Aβ pathway, as well as the upstream molecular orchestrators of its dyshomeostasis in AD. Aβ homeostasis undergoes a complex interplay consisting of highly conserved feedback loops and interactions among an array of quality control mechanisms and protein clearance pathways across cells, tissues, and body systems. Understanding this hierarchical organization across tissues and body systems and its decline with aging and in an individual, genetically determined fashion will be essential to comprehensively target the Aβ cycle for preventive strategies. New multi-modal imaging integrative approaches coupled with molecular imaging and fluid biomarkers hold the potential to unravel the spatial and temporal coordinates the Aβ pathways dynamics and to map the critical genetic and biological factors influencing sub-population clinical and pathophysiological trajectories.

Within this conceptual framework, Aβ-oriented therapies will be more and more scaled to the disease stage and biological inter-individual differences for time-sensitive and effective pathway (a mechanism)-based preventive strategies for AD, aligned with the precision medicine paradigm.

The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis as a Framework for Therapeutic Development in Alzheimer's Disease

The predominant mechanistic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged from the key observation that amyloid plaques are a constant neuropathological feature of the disease, as originally described by Alzheimer in early-onset cases and by Fischer in late-onset cases. Alzheimer and Fischer were careful not to attribute amyloid plaques a definitive causative role in the neurodegenerative process underlying the dementia cases they described. A notion that amyloid plaques cause AD emerged in the 1960s, after the rediscovery of their work, modern neuropathological studies at the time, and the recognition that cases of early and late-onset dementia both feature amyloid plaques neuropathology. This notion positioned amyloid plaques as a logical target for experimental therapies in AD. Although amyloid plaques may or may not be viewed as the ultimate cause of AD, preclinical studies and longitudinal clinical investigations have provided undisputable evidence that amyloid β 1–42 (Aβ) accumulation is a key early pathophysiological event in AD, in great part supported by the introduction of brain amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). The "amyloid cascade hypothesis" poses that Aβ accumulation is a central early pathogenic event in AD and leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment through its induction of aberrant accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. According to its original conception, a high rate of Aβ accumulation disrupts calcium homeostasis and induces tau hyperphosphorylation, which is highly neurotoxic and forms paired helical filaments that accumulate in the form of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. In 2018, an NIH/NIA-commissioned working group led by experts in the field of AD experimental therapeutics introduced a contemporary view of the "amyloid cascade hypothesis", in which Aβ accumulation occurs slowly over years, which helps to explain the presence of Aβ without degeneration or cognitive impairment, as surprisingly found in early PET amyloid imaging studies in humans. This allows understanding AD as a sequential pathobiological process, not equivalent to a clinical syndrome or a neuropathological state. Thus, this contemporary view of the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" constitutes a pragmatic theoretical framework to maximize the chances of successfully identifying effective disease-modifying therapies, amenable to use even in prodromal or pre-symptomatic stages (Fig. 1). This view aligns with current available data, but alternate hypotheses of neurodegeneration in AD, in which amyloid an/or tau do not play a significant pathobiological role are possible.

### A systemic view of Alzheimer disease-insights from amyloid-β metabolism beyond the brain [^116MJ679]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and is currently incurable; existing treatments for AD produce only a modest amelioration of symptoms. Research into this disease has conventionally focused on the CNS. However, several peripheral and systemic abnormalities are now understood to be linked to AD, and our understanding of how these alterations contribute to AD is becoming more clearly defined. This Review focuses on amyloid-β (Aβ), a major hallmark of AD. We review emerging findings of associations between systemic abnormalities and Aβ metabolism, and describe how these associations might interact with or reflect on the central pathways of Aβ production and clearance. On the basis of these findings, we propose that these abnormal systemic changes might not only develop secondary to brain dysfunction but might also affect AD progression, suggesting that the interactions between the brain and the periphery have a crucial role in the development and progression of AD. Such a systemic view of the molecular pathogenesis of AD could provide a novel perspective for understanding this disease and present new opportunities for its early diagnosis and treatment.

### Alzheimer's disease beyond amyloid: strategies for future therapeutic interventions [^112BafMi]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thirdly, amyloid β and tau protein may synergistically and simultaneously cause pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid β enhances phosphorylation, truncation, and aggregation of tau protein, whereas tau protein further induces the production of amyloid β species. The effective suppression of only one of these two factors is probably insufficient to produce a clinical benefit. Thus an approach targeting them simultaneously or sequentially may be necessary to affect the course of the disease.

Finally, although the amyloid hypothesis and tau pathology are supported by considerable genetic and biomarker studies, the data from failed clinical trials suggest that other potential targets should be explored.

### Alzheimer's disease [^116D1ZsZ]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

In this Seminar, we highlight the main developments in the field of Alzheimer's disease. The most recent data indicate that, by 2050, the prevalence of dementia will double in Europe and triple worldwide, and that estimate is 3 times higher when based on a biological (rather than clinical) definition of Alzheimer's disease. The earliest phase of Alzheimer's disease (cellular phase) happens in parallel with accumulating amyloid β, inducing the spread of tau pathology. The risk of Alzheimer's disease is 60–80% dependent on heritable factors, with more than 40 Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic risk loci already identified, of which the APOE alleles have the strongest association with the disease. Novel biomarkers include PET scans and plasma assays for amyloid β and phosphorylated tau, which show great promise for clinical and research use. Multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials suggest cognitive benefits in participants with increased risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors do not directly affect Alzheimer's disease pathology, but can still contribute to a positive outcome in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Promising pharmacological treatments are poised at advanced stages of clinical trials and include anti-amyloid β, anti-tau, and anti-inflammatory strategies.

### The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis [^115qPP9X]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

To promote new thinking of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examine the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Pathologically, AD is characterized by progressive neuronal loss and biochemical abnormalities including mitochondrial dysfunction. Conventional thinking has dictated that AD is driven by amyloid beta pathology, per the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis. However, the underlying mechanism of how amyloid beta leads to cognitive decline remains unclear. A model correctly identifying the pathogenesis of AD is critical and needed for the development of effective therapeutics. Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely linked to the core pathological feature of AD: neuronal dysfunction. Targeting mitochondria and associated proteins may hold promise for new strategies for the development of disease-modifying therapies. According to the Mitochondrial Cascade Hypothesis, mitochondrial dysfunction drives the pathogenesis of AD, as baseline mitochondrial function and mitochondrial change rates influence the progression of cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: The Amyloid Cascade Model does not readily account for various parameters associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A unified model correctly identifying the pathogenesis of AD is greatly needed to inform the development of successful therapeutics. Mitochondria play a key and central role in the maintenance of optimal neuronal and synaptic function, the core pathological feature of AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be the primary cause of AD, and is a promising target for new therapeutic strategies.

### Clinical role of brain PET in Alzheimer disease in the era of disease-modifying therapies [^11456SEX]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, with an estimated 6.9 million Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer dementia today, with this number projected to grow to 13.8 million by 2060. Amyloid and τ accumulation underpin our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD, with the abnormal accumulation of these proteins leading to neurodegeneration. With the recent approval of antiamyloid monoclonal antibody therapies for patients with early-stage Alzheimer disease by the Food and Drug Administration, there is renewed energy and focus on brain imaging for diagnosis, triage, and monitoring of patients with neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, PET imaging of amyloid and τ has revolutionized our understanding of dementia progression and staging, and influences patient management in the clinical setting. We aim to update radiologists on the evolving role of amyloid and τ PET in clinical practice, emphasizing the need for standardized workflows and the integration of molecular imaging data with other disease biomarkers. We also discuss the clinical implications of amyloid and τ PET, including their impact on diagnosis and treatment decisions, as well as the challenges of reimbursement and workforce capacity. With recent shifts in the AD management landscape, it is crucial for radiologists to keep abreast of recent advances in clinical practice, thereby ensuring effective patient care.

### The role of the gut microbiome in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology [^114p5CPt]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review aims to provide an overview of the existing understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in the Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

Recent Findings

Recent research has highlighted the significant role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via the gut-brain axis. However, the precise mechanisms by which gut microbiome and its microbial metabolites influence brain function are not clearly understood. Various factors, such as diet, drugs, lifestyle, stress, and microbial infections can provoke an imbalance in the gut microbiome homeostasis, known as dysbiosis. This dysbiosis impacts intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability, elevating pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover, the gut microbiome generates neurotransmitters, amyloids, neurotoxins, and metabolites, which may play a role in systemic inflammation and in the disruption of physiological barriers.

Summary

In the past decade, advancements in microbiome analysis technologies and bioinformatics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in Alzheimer's disease. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal regulatory role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and closely interacts with its pathogenesis, encompassing inflammation, amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, tauopathy, and co-pathologies.

### Alzheimer's disease clinical trial update 2019–2021 [^116qxJc2]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The current clinical trial landscape targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reviewed in the context of studies completed from 2019 to 2021. This review focuses on available data for observational and phase II/III clinical trial results, which will have the most impact on the field. ClinicalTrials.gov, the United States (US) comprehensive federal registry, was queried to identify completed trials. There are currently 226 interventional clinical trials and 51 observational studies completed, suspended, terminated, or withdrawn within our selected time frame. This review reveals that the role of biomarkers is expanding and although many lessons have been learned, many challenges remain when targeting disease modification of AD through amyloid and tau. In addition, to halt or slow clinical progression of AD, new clinical and observational trials are focusing on prevention as well as the role of more diverse biological processes known to influence AD pathology.

### A β 34 is a BACE1-derived degradation intermediate associated with amyloid clearance and Alzheimer's disease progression [^117TTjty]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In the AD field, research has traditionally focused on the conversion of APP into Aβ42 peptides leading to pathological amyloid plaque deposition in the brain and cognitive decline during the clinical progression of the disease. In recent years, however, emerging literature now identifies amyloid clearance as an important paradigm to better understand amyloid imbalances in sporadic AD patients.

BACE1 is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD and several inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials for their potential to slow or halt the production of neurotoxic Aβ peptides. In order to attenuate disease progression in individuals with existing amyloid plaques, Aβ production would need to be inhibited by at least 95% since deposition is expected to be fast in Aβ+ individuals, even at lowered rates of newly produced Aβ. Recently, current treatment approaches have been challenged based upon reports of disappointing results and adverse effects from BACE inhibitor trials (press release, 25 October 2018, Is there a role for BACE inhibition in Alzheimer's treatment?, Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference).

### The amyloid cascade hypothesis: a conclusion in search of support [^115rP4uH]. The American Journal of Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis as the etiological underpinning of Alzheimer disease (AD) is supported by a large body of literature, the most influential of which are genetic studies of the 1980s and 1990s. Other evidence includes the neuropathology of Down syndrome, apparent toxicity of oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ), interactions with apolipoprotein E, and the analogy of cardiac amyloidosis. On the other hand, there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity among the rare familial AD kindreds, which tempers extrapolation to sporadic AD. Oligomer biology is still in the theoretical realm, with no clinical validation. Apolipoprotein E support for the amyloid cascade and other inferences from the literature are somewhat circular in their logic. Analogy with amyloidoses might also consider secondary amyloidosis, driven by systemic inflammation and treated by treating the underlying etiology. Much of the remaining literature supporting the amyloid cascade is dominated by hypothesis-generating studies. Importantly, we now have a developing evidence base from controlled clinical trials that can potentially inform the issue of Aβ as a cause or driver of disease in sporadic AD. Emerging data provide clear evidence of target engagement. Clinical outcome, however, has been either marginally positive or similar to placebo. Assuming these findings hold, it appears that Aβ neither drives nor mitigates the disease process.

1 Introduction

1.1. Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β (Aβ) molecular pathology in the brain

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD neuropathology (Fig. 1) is characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques (composed primarily of aggregated Aβ peptides) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein) in the brain of people affected by the disease. Recent evidence indicates that other cellular and subcellular mechanisms also contribute to AD pathogenesis and progression.

AD molecular pathology begins with accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ peptides in the brain years to decades before onset of cognitive deficits. Recognition of this protracted presymptomatic period, dubbed preclinical AD, and slow clinical progression of the disease has important implications for risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment with emerging disease-modifying therapies. The role of Aβ as an early driver of AD pathobiology is strongly supported by human genetics, clinical pathology, and experimental research. Aβ peptides (Fig. 2) comprise a family of amyloidogenic cleavage products derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that is widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types throughout the body. Abnormal Aβ deposition in the brain is associated with pathogenic protein aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, and neurotoxicity. Aβ amyloidopathy also triggers other pathogenic cascades — including tau proteinopathy, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration — that are closely associated with clinical signs, symptoms, and progression of the disease.

### The unexpected role of a β 1–42 monomers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^116AKNzq]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) has been proposed as a biomarker and a drug target for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurotoxic entity and relevance of each conformational form of Aβ to AD pathology is still under debate; Aβ oligomers are considered the major killer form of the peptide whereas monomers have been proposed to be involved in physiological process. Here we reviewed some different effects mediated by monomers and oligomers on mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis such as autophagy and tau aggregation. Data reported in this review demonstrate that Aβ monomers could have a major role in sustaining the pathogenesis of AD and that AD therapy should be focused not only in the removal of oligomers but also of monomers.

Aβ Biochemical Properties from Monomers through Higher Aggregation States, Including Plaques

After being generated as soluble monomers, Aβ is found in several different intermediate aggregation states, including dimers and trimers, soluble oligomers, and protofibrils, until it forms fibrils that accumulate in plaques, typically viewed as an AD neuropathological hallmark (Fig. 4). Understanding the biology and interlinked dynamics of these intermediate assemblies and their bio-activity, in either physiological and pathophysiological conditions, is essential from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective.

Aggregation species of Aβ can exist as monomers, dimers, oligomers, protofibril, fibril and amyloid plaques. These species exist in steady state where one form can convert to another in a bidirectional manner. The species are characterized by aggregate size, conformation state and solubility, with fibril and amyloid plaque being insoluble. Adapted with permission from ref.

### Alzheimer disease as a clinical-biological construct-an international working group recommendation [^114s3VcE]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Alzheimer's disease:

- Definition: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment.
- Pathophysiology: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two primary pathophysiological mechanisms: the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, neuroinflammation, characterized by alterations in the functional responses of microglia and astrocytes and dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease worldwide is estimated at 598.97 per 100,000 population.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include advancing age, a family history of the disease, and a genetic predisposition, particularly the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.
- Disease course: Clinically, Alzheimer's disease presents with progressive memory decline as well as cognitive deficits with executive dysfunction, language, visual perceptual difficulties, apraxia, and agnosia. Emotional and behavioral symptoms may also emerge in the moderate-to-severe stages of the disease.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition with no known cure. The prognosis is typically poor as the disease progressively worsens over time. The life expectancy following a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can vary between 3 to 10 years, with age being a significant predictor.

### The probabilistic model of Alzheimer disease: the amyloid hypothesis revised [^114HDLHW]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

The current conceptualization of Alzheimer disease (AD) is driven by the amyloid hypothesis, in which a deterministic chain of events leads from amyloid deposition and then tau deposition to neurodegeneration and progressive cognitive impairment. This model fits autosomal dominant AD but is less applicable to sporadic AD. Owing to emerging information regarding the complex biology of AD and the challenges of developing amyloid-targeting drugs, the amyloid hypothesis needs to be reconsidered. Here we propose a probabilistic model of AD in which three variants of AD (autosomal dominant AD, APOE ε4-related sporadic AD and APOE ε4-unrelated sporadic AD) feature decreasing penetrance and decreasing weight of the amyloid pathophysiological cascade, and increasing weight of stochastic factors (environmental exposures and lower-risk genes). Together, these variants account for a large share of the neuropathological and clinical variability observed in people with AD. The implementation of this model in research might lead to a better understanding of disease pathophysiology, a revision of the current clinical taxonomy and accelerated development of strategies to prevent and treat AD.

### The amyloid-β oligomer hypothesis: beginning of the third decade [^112j86Qg]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

As evidenced by the increasing number of publications concerning AβOs in the past 5 years, and the consistency in data supporting a toxic role for AβOs, the AβO hypothesis for AD pathogenesis has garnered considerable support and acceptance. Accordingly, the number of AβO-targeting therapeutics in the AD pipeline has begun to increase. We believe that this emerging interest in AβO targeting will prove beneficial to the treatment and diagnosis of AD. These efforts potentially can extend to a broader proportion of the population, given the evidence for a role for AβOs in other diseases in addition to AD. Ultimately, for these efforts to result in therapeutic and diagnostic benefits, further advances in AβO structure-function studies are needed. Continued investment into this and other research involving AβOs will enable the closing of critical gaps, thereby paving a smoother and shorter path from bench to bedside.

### Calcium in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: too much, too little or in the wrong place? [^112AFzwo]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the molecular genetics and biochemical pathology of Alzheimer's disease has progressed tremendously in the past decade. The metabolism of amyloid beta-peptide is being unraveled, and specific anti-amyloid therapies are now in clinical trials worldwide. The precise biophysical structure of the amyloid beta-peptide that causes neuronal dysfunction remains under investigation, as does the interaction between amyloid peptides and tau hyperphosphorylation, but these two molecules likely play key roles in neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Despite these advances, the cell biology of neuronal dysfunction and cell death in the Alzheimer's disease brain remains poorly understood. This brief review will explore the role of calcium (Ca2+) in neuronal death occurring during Alzheimer's disease. The evidence for glutamate receptor-mediated Ca;2+ overload, or excitotoxicity, and other derangements of Ca2+ homeostasis in cell culture and animal models of Alzheimer's disease is reviewed. Finally, we raise the possibility that some of the neuronal death observed in Alzheimer's disease might be associated with a reduction in rather than an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, an idea with potentially important therapeutic implications.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) surrounded by dystrophic neurites and neurofibrillary tangles. The discovery that certain early-onset familial forms of AD may be caused by an enhanced production of Aβ peptides, led to the hypothesis that amyloidogenic Aβ is intimately involved in the AD pathogenic process. Aβ is derived by proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP).

### Testing the amyloid cascade hypothesis: prevention trials in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease [^114quFad]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been increasingly challenged. Here, we aim to refocus the amyloid cascade hypothesis on its original premise that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is the primary and earliest event in AD pathogenesis as based on current evidence, initiating several pathological events and ultimately leading to AD dementia.

Background

An ongoing debate about the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis for AD has been triggered by clinical trials with investigational disease-modifying drugs targeting Aβ that have not demonstrated consistent clinically meaningful benefits.

Updated Hypothesis

It is an open question if monotherapy targeting Aβ pathology could be markedly beneficial at a stage when the brain has been irreversibly damaged by a cascade of pathological changes. Interventions in cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for dementia, during amyloid-only and pre-amyloid stages, are more appropriate for proving or refuting the amyloid hypothesis. Our updated hypothesis states that anti-Aβ investigational therapies are likely to be most efficacious when initiated in the preclinical (asymptomatic) stages of AD and specifically when the disease is driven primarily by amyloid pathology. Given the young age at symptom onset and the deterministic nature of the mutations, autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) mutation carriers represent the ideal population to evaluate the efficacy of putative disease-modifying Aβ therapies.

Major Challenges For The Hypothesis

Key challenges of the amyloid hypothesis include the recognition that disrupted Aβ homeostasis alone is insufficient to produce the AD pathophysiologic process, poor correlation of Aβ with cognitive impairment, and inconclusive data regarding clinical efficacy of therapies targeting Aβ. Challenges of conducting ADAD research include the rarity of the disease and uncertainty of the generalizability of ADAD findings for the far more common "sporadic" late-onset AD.

Linkage To Other Major Theories

The amyloid cascade hypothesis, modified here to pertain to the preclinical stage of AD, still needs to be integrated with the development and effects of tauopathy and other co-pathologies, including neuroinflammation, vascular insults, synucleinopathy, and many others.

### Alzheimer's disease severity, objectively determined and measured [^1176m98F]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Alzheimer disease (AD) is now recognized to span a spectrum of impairment from normal cognition to dementia, with changes in biomarkers that capture various aspects of the underlying neuropathology. AD develops over decades, and has a long prodromal period. The clinical manifestations of AD are often evident only after many years of accumulating neuropathology.

A multitude of AD biomarkers including those derived from brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and neuropsychological testing have been identified which provide distinct information about the pathophysiology and clinical course of AD. A highly influential theoretical model has provided a framework for conceptualizing the pathological cascade of AD. This dynamic biomarkers model proposes that the pathologic cascade of AD begins with abnormal amyloid processing, resulting in build-up of amyloid beta protein (Aβ 1–42) in the brain, accelerating tau deposition, which in combination has neurotoxic effects resulting in cellular dysfunction and death, brain atrophy, and impaired neuropsychological function. This process culminates in clinical symptoms and functional disability.

### Evidence for a novel neuronal mechanism driving Alzheimer's disease, upstream of amyloid [^116ZmDZa]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the subject of intense research for decades, primarily with a focus on the β‐amyloid hypothesis, in which β‐amyloid accumulation initiates a cascade of neurodegeneration leading to the characteristic symptoms of memory loss, cognitive impairment and confusion. The presence of this marker is a major factor in the formal diagnosis of AD. However, the β‐amyloid pathological cascade itself, and closely associated changes, are recognized as highly complex, involving multiple mechanisms including tau phosphorylation, defective mitochondrial function, ionic imbalances, dysfunctional autophagy, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation and impaired brain energy metabolism.

This Perspective presents an alternative approach where we discuss a possible mechanism upstream of this multifactorial, but familiar, scenario and consider the properties of the interconnecting subcortical cell groups that have been increasingly recognized as the first to degenerate at the start of AD. Identification of the features that differentiate these neurons from the rest of the brain could provide valuable insight into the basic process underlying AD, and point the way to an eventual means of preventing the β‐amyloid cascade from being initiated.

### A data-driven study of Alzheimer's disease related amyloid and tau pathology progression [^114nhFo1]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized at the molecular level by the accumulation of two specific protein-based pathologies within the brain: amyloid plaques, composed of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These pathologies combine to create a toxic environment that drives neurodegeneration via neuronal and synaptic loss, leading to cognitive impairment. While Aβ and tau have been recognized as the primary signature of Alzheimer's disease, the causal relationship between these two pathologies is not fully understood. The prevailing view set forth by the amyloid cascade hypothesis is that the accumulation of Aβ peptides is the main causative event triggering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with tau-based NFTs, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following as a result.

Importantly, the amyloid cascade hypothesis does not require that Aβ occurs first in all Alzheimer's disease cases. Tau-based NFTs are well known to accumulate within the medial temporal lobe (MTL; includes entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala) in most individuals by their fifth or sixth decade in an age-related process that is independent of Aβ. Therefore, rather than occurring first, Aβ is thought to facilitate the spread of tau beyond the MTL. How this occurs is not well understood due to the spatial disconnection between Aβ accumulation, which usually begins in the parietal, cingulate and frontal regions in the neocortex, and age-related tau accumulation in the MTL. These pathologies may initiate independently and only interact when Aβ eventually spreads to the MTL. It is also possible that tau in the MTL somehow initiates neocortical Aβ, although a recent study in genetically identical twins supports the causal effect of Aβ on tau rather than the opposite. A third possibility is that tau spreads beyond the MTL in some casesand may interact locally with neocortical Aβ, which then amplifies tau. Taken together, these possibilities suggest that there may be two basic subtypes of pathology progression in Alzheimer's disease: an 'amyloid-first' variant, in which widespread Aβ plaques precede neocortical NFTs, and a 'tau-first' variant, in which early neocortical NFTs precede widespread Aβ.

Beyond Aβ peptides and the APP metabolism

Although the data described above clearly support the amyloid cascade hypothesis, it is necessary to keep in mind that the biological characterization of GWAS-defined genes was initially done by assessing their impacts on models specifically developed for this hypothesis. There is, therefore, a significant bias, potentially leading to tautological reasoning and a priori exclusion of other, potentially important pathophysiological pathways. This is especially true since most GWAS-defined genes are involved in major cell signalling pathways and have pleiotropic functions, which are poorly evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models with specific read-outs. In addition, the functions of these genes are often not fully understood, and some of these unknown functions may be essential for their involvement in AD pathophysiology. This is also true for the most recognized actors of AD pathophysiology, such as APP or Tau. For instance, our knowledge of APP's physiological functions are still very fragmented and often revolve about Aβ toxicity, while ignoring the potential functions of APP other than producing Aβ. Furthermore, APP metabolism produces other catabolites with roles potentially as important as that of Aβ. Our knowledge on the role of Tau in AD is also fragmented. We are thus unable to explain how Aβ peptides — despite being a part of the amyloid cascade — may participate in the neuron-to-neuron propagation of Tau pathology. In conclusion, the impact of GWAS-defined genes on AD pathophysiology has so far been mostly studied in the context of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. This is clearly a limitation considering the increasing number of new genetic risk factors, which may potentially lead to the identification of not only Aβ toxicity-dependent mechanisms, but also Aβ-independent mechanisms (potentially linked to Tau).

### Alzheimer's disease outlook: controversies and future directions [^115iDht9]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

For the first time, reductions in cerebral β-amyloid pathology load and rate of cognitive and functional decline have been achieved in Alzheimer's disease, through pharmacological intervention in randomised controlled trials. However, the results from phase 3 randomised controlled trials of anti-β amyloid monoclonal antibodies are interpreted in different ways, with some experts supporting a clinically meaningful disease-modifying effect, and others judging insufficient benefit-to-risk ratio and opposing market authorisation. In the final paper of this Series, we discuss these contrasting views, all of which wish to contribute to improvements in the quality of life of people with, or at risk of, Alzheimer's disease. We contrast the efficacy, societal costs, and generalisability of monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease to biologics for other conditions (eg, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis) and set this debate in the larger context of modern personalised medicine. We discuss current practice implications, future developments directed to β-amyloid and non-amyloid targets that might have more clinical efficacy and less adverse effects for those with the disease, and large-scale prevention interventions for those at risk.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is an established central player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with distinct apoE isoforms exerting diverse effects. apoE influences not only amyloid‐beta and tau pathologies but also lipid and energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, cerebral vascular health, and sex‐dependent disease manifestations.

### Will PET amyloid imaging lead to overdiagnosis of Alzheimer dementia? [^112gjwx9]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia, affects millions of elderly Americans and represents a growing problem with the aging of the population. There has been an increasing effort for improved and earlier diagnosis for AD. Several newly developed radiolabeled compounds targeting β-amyloid plaques, one of the major pathologic biomarkers of AD, have recently become available for clinical use. These radiopharmaceuticals allow for in vivo noninvasive visualization of abnormal β-amyloid deposits in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Amyloid PET imaging has demonstrated high sensitivity for pathologic cerebral amyloid deposition in multiple studies. Principal drawbacks to this new diagnostic test are declining specificity in older age groups and uncertain clinical role given lack of disease-modifying therapy for AD. Although there is strong evidence for the utility of amyloid PET in certain situations, detailed in a set of guidelines for appropriate use from the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the question of overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of a disease that would result in neither symptoms nor deaths, using this new medical tool needs to be carefully considered in light of efforts to secure reimbursement for the new technology that is already widely available for use as a clinical tool.

### The amyloid hypothesis in Alzheimer disease: new insights from new therapeutics [^112jMz7o]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2022). High credibility.

Many drugs that target amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer disease (AD) have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. However, four anti-Aβ antibodies have been shown to mediate the removal of amyloid plaque from brains of patients with AD, and the FDA has recently granted accelerated approval to one of these, aducanumab, using reduction of amyloid plaque as a surrogate end point. The rationale for approval and the extent of the clinical benefit from these antibodies are under intense debate. With the aim of informing this debate, we review clinical trial data for drugs that target Aβ from the perspective of the temporal interplay between the two pathognomonic protein aggregates in AD - Aβ plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles - and their relationship to cognitive impairment, highlighting differences in drug properties that could affect their clinical performance. On this basis, we propose that Aβ pathology drives tau pathology, that amyloid plaque would need to be reduced to a low level (~20 centiloids) to reveal significant clinical benefit and that there will be a lag between the removal of amyloid and the potential to observe a clinical benefit. We conclude that the speed of amyloid removal from the brain by a potential therapy will be important in demonstrating clinical benefit in the context of a clinical trial.

### Positive feedback loops in Alzheimer's disease: the Alzheimer's feedback hypothesis [^116SyvKc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

THE AMYLOID CASCADE HYPOTHESIS

Since 1992, the amyloid cascade hypothesis has played the prominent role in seeking to explain the onset, progression, and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It proposes that the over-production and/or decreased degradation and subsequent deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) is the initial pathological event in AD. A range of subsequent events then follow: Aβ oligomer and plaque formation, activation of microglia and astrocytes, chronic inflammation, increased levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, elevated intracellular calcium, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation, neuronal loss, and ultimately dementia. A simple, though typical, representation of the amyloid cascade is shown in Fig. 1. A wealth of evidence supports the involvement of all these processes, and more, in AD. While there is thus little doubt that each of the steps shown in Fig. 1 are key events in AD, it is now apparent that numerous positive feedback loops also occur, requiring modification of the amyloid cascade hypothesis to a system of loops, rather than a linear process.

Fig.1
The Amyloid cascade.

A cascade is defined as: "a small waterfall, typically one of several that fall in stages down a steep rocky slope", or, more pertinently here, "A succession of devices or stages in a process, each of which triggers or initiates the next". Both these definitions imply that information flow can only travel in one direction, as water can only flow downhill, otherwise known as a directed acyclic graph. The amyloid cascade is thus a unidirectional process, where initial stress causes an increase in total Aβ (Aβ 42 in particular), leading to a succession of processes and eventually dementia. In this model, perturbations to the healthy system can only lead to changes downstream of the location of the perturbation. For example, increased oxidative stress could cause tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation, but not remove Aβ oligomers. This concept of unidirectional flow of information is inaccurate, however, since it is now apparent that there are a variety of positive feedback loops in AD, where processes downstream in the cascade can stimulate processes upstream, leading to amplification of the initial perturbation. It is thus no longer tenable to frame AD as a cascade. Here I give examples of positive feedback loops in AD to illustrate this. The aim of this review is not to give a comprehensive overview of AD pathways — rather it is to show that diverse positive feedback loops are present in AD and to discuss their implications for the disease and its possible therapies.

### Effect of reductions in amyloid levels on cognitive change in randomized trials: instrumental variable meta-analysis [^115JF9oe]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Amyloid plaques and oligomers are hypothesized to cause a cascade of pathological events resulting in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Motivated by the amyloid cascade hypothesis, a primary aim of many new treatments for the prevention or management of Alzheimer's disease has been to reduce amyloid β levels in the brain. Although the presence of amyloid plaques and oligomers in the brain is highly correlated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the mechanisms by which amyloid might mediate neuronal pathology are currently not well understood. To date, no anti-amyloid treatments have progressed sufficiently to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration (the regulatory agency for pharmaceuticals in the United States). Drugs have targeted various amyloid species — amyloid plaques, amyloid oligomers, and soluble oligomers — and have been performed in populations with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, as well as earlier stages of disease (prodromal Alzheimer's disease). Most trials targeting amyloid failed to produce positive results in either early or late stages of the disease. The negative findings from these trials have prompted skepticism about amyloid's role in neuronal disease, and many have instead argued that amyloid could be a marker for other disease processes and therefore is not a viable drug target.

### Pathways to personalized medicine-embracing heterogeneity for progress in clinical therapeutics research in Alzheimer's disease [^11773xcz]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1.2.1 Targeting single biology in multifactorial disease

Focusing on only one biological feature (e.g. Aβ) in a complicated disease without accounting for others may lead to disappointing results in outcomes. For example, the new anti‐amyloid immunotherapies can lower AD's Aβ biomarkers down to normal or near‐normal levels with secondary effects of lowering tau biomarkers too. However, this appears to only modestly slow the progression of dementia, not stop it. Demonstration of any clinical benefits of amyloid reduction is an important and hard‐won scientific advance, but it also underscores that AD's dementia progression is due to more than Aβ, and there is also heterogeneity in treatment responses. Multipronged approaches will be necessary.

### Tracking the earliest pathologic changes in Alzheimer disease [^113jfrJZ]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

A current challenge in Alzheimer disease (AD) research is to identify the sequence of pathologic changes that occurs during preclinical stages of disease in advance of cognitive decline. The timing of appearance of the 2 pathologic hallmarks of AD-amyloid deposition and tau-mediated neurodegeneration-is a particular topic of debate, with researchers drawing on a broad range of genetic, neuroimaging, fluid biomarker, animal, and autopsy studies to piece together the series of events ultimately leading to the plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive deficits that define AD.

TABLE 1
Evolution of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) concept, definition, and diagnostics among the key players involved in nosography in the three key periods of AD history (1900s–1910s, 1960s–1980s, and 2010s–2020s).

The historical debates between Alzheimer and Fischer regarding the significance of extended tau pathology and the unitary neuritic plaque are still relevant in discussions of AD neuropathological features today. In the 1960s–1980s, it was discovered that high levels of NFTs and neuritic plaques, along with neuronal loss, are correlated characteristics of early‐ and late‐onset AD using more sensitive staining, quantitative, and correlative approaches. A consensus emerged that high levels of these neuropathological features were paralleling characteristic neuropathological lesions of AD. However, there is still ongoing debate about the relative importance of β‐amyloid and tau pathology, as well as low and intermediate levels of pathology for disease classification. On the one hand, the β‐amyloid cascade hypothesis, proposed since 1992, centers on a deterministic biological model of AD, which received numerous supporting evidence. This model impacted the NIA–AA 2012 neuropathological criteria, where the presence of neuritic plaques without NFTs represents the first levels of AD neuropathological changes. Some authors still prefer to refer to a different nosological category (pathological aging) for these cases. It is important to note that some dimensions of parenchymal β‐amyloid pathology (diffuse plaques) are not considered a defining AD neuropathological characteristic. Conversely, the lack of specificity of NFTs limits its usefulness as the sole defining feature of AD, and numerous limitations of the β‐amyloid cascade hypothesis have emerged. This led to alternative probabilistic models, including but not limited to β‐amyloid, especially for sporadic AD. Current neuropathological and PET findings also highlight that tau pathology, more than β‐amyloid pathology, is a better correlate of neurodegeneration and symptoms, and a better stratifier of clinical prognosis in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Neuropathologists have been debating the nosological classification of isolated NFTs: some argue that it is part of AD, while others suggest it may be a distinct condition called primary age‐related tauopathy. The 2023 AA β‐amyloid‐centered definition of AD aligns with the β‐amyloid cascade hypothesis and departs from previous views from Alzheimer, Roth, and Terry, who emphasized the importance of tau pathology or the combination of β‐amyloid and tau pathology at high levels as characteristic neuropathological features of AD. A distant parallel can be drawn with Fischer's sphaerotrichia, which focused on neuritic plaques. However, Fischer emphasized the clinical features of sphaerotrichia and the low frequency of neuritic plaques in asymptomatic individuals (6%) to classify it as a disease.

### Alzheimer's disease [^111r1qvj]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

An estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.

### Clinical amyloid imaging [^117VMwCw]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Amyloid plaques, along with neurofibrillary tangles, are a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, amyloid PET radiotracers have been developed and approved for clinical use in the evaluation of suspected neurodegenerative disorders. In both research and clinical settings, amyloid PET imaging has provided important diagnostic and prognostic information for the management of patients with possible AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and other challenging diagnostic presentations. Although the overall impact of amyloid imaging is still being evaluated, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging and Alzheimer's Association Amyloid Imaging Task Force have created appropriate use criteria for the standard clinical use of amyloid PET imaging. By the appropriate use criteria, amyloid imaging is appropriate for patients with (1) persistent or unexplained MCI, (2) AD as a possible but still uncertain diagnosis after expert evaluation and (3) atypically early-age-onset progressive dementia. To better understand the clinical and economic effect of amyloid imaging, the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study is an ongoing large multicenter study in the United States, which is evaluating how amyloid imaging affects diagnosis, management, and outcomes for cognitively impaired patients who cannot be completely evaluated by clinical assessment alone. Multiple other large-scale studies are evaluating the prognostic role of amyloid PET imaging for predicting MCI progression to AD in general and high-risk populations. At the same time, amyloid imaging is an important tool for evaluating potential disease-modifying therapies for AD. Overall, the increased use of amyloid PET imaging has led to a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of this imaging modality and how it may best be used with other clinical, molecular, and imaging assessment techniques for the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative disorders.

### Successes and failures: the latest advances in the clinical development of amyloid-β-targeting monoclonal antibodies for treating Alzheimer's disease [^117V4iQg]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulated that the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) was the first step of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process. Effective reduction of Aβ plaque load by numerous drug candidates, among which anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, has produced discussible clinical successes and several failures. It was questioned whether Aβ may be the principal AD pathogenic factor and a valid therapeutic target and if targeting Aβ different species could make the difference.

Areas Covered

This review article summarized successes and failures of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody therapy for AD, delineating the latest advances for their clinical development also according to their target engagement and downstream biomarkers.

Expert Opinion

The preliminary success of the recent Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of lecanemab, donanemab, and remternetug, and lessons learned from the failure of previous anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies RCTs, provided critical evidence to support the role of Aβ in AD pathogenesis. The loss of free Aβ instead of an Aβ toxicity may promote AD neuropathology. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses (i.e. increases in Aβ 1–42) may indicate a potential benefit of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in AD and downstream biomarkers should be considered for providing comprehension in cognitive and clinical efficacy of future AD RCTs.

### STING deletion protects against amyloid β-induced Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis [^114kFXGd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

While immune dysfunction has been increasingly linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, many major innate immune signaling molecules have yet to be explored in AD pathogenesis using genetic targeting approaches.

METHODS

To investigate a role for the key innate immune adaptor molecule, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), in AD, we deleted Sting1 in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD‐related amyloidosis and evaluated the effects on pathology, neuroinflammation, gene expression, and cognition.

RESULTS

Genetic ablation of STING in 5xFAD mice led to improved control of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, alterations in microglial activation status, decreased levels of neuritic dystrophy, and protection against cognitive decline. Moreover, rescue of neurological disease in STING‐deficient 5xFAD mice was characterized by reduced expression of type I interferon signaling genes in both microglia and excitatory neurons.

DISCUSSION

These findings reveal critical roles for STING in Aβ‐driven neurological disease and suggest that STING‐targeting therapeutics may offer promising strategies to treat AD.

Highlights

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) deficiency in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease‐related amyloidosis results in decreased amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and altered microglial activation status.
Protection against amyloidosis in STING‐deficient 5xFAD mice is associated with decreased expression of genes involved in type I IFN signaling, improved neuronal health, and reduced levels of oxidative stress.
Loss of STING in 5xFAD mice leads to improved spatial learning and memory.

### Detection of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease through breath biomarkers [^1124Qm9j]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative brain disorder and the major cause of dementia in the world today. 1 In the United States alone, more than 5 million people have AD, a number expected to exceed 14 million by 2060. 2 AD is a contributing factor and a major cause of death in the U.S. population that is 65 years of age or older. 3 The cost for health care is staggering and projected to be > $500 billion annually in the United States by the year 2040. 4 The pathophysiology contributing to AD typically begins decades before any signs of cognitive dysfunction. 5 Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the pathological hallmarks of late stage AD. 6 Early diagnosis for risk of AD during the prodromal phase has driven the development of molecular biomarkers, many of which have focused on the chemistry of Aβ. 7

Efforts to treat AD have also focused on molecular processes contributing to the Aβ cascade hypothesis. This longstanding hypothesis promotes the idea that AD is caused by plaques formed by the aggregation and deposition of Aβ protein in brain parenchyma and the cascade of neuropathology that follows including tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, small vessel disease, neuronal death, and dementia. 8 A battery of biomarkers was developed for this cascade to assess key molecules in blood and cerebrospinal fluid together with cognitive and neuroimaging measures to follow disease progression and efficacy of new therapeutics. 9 Indeed, amyloid biomarkers are entry criterion in most late phase disease modifying clinical trials. 10 Unfortunately, the Aβ cascade hypothesis and the many attempted treatments thereof have failed the public. The fundamental premise of the cascade hypothesis is in question as there have been numerous failed clinical trials for disease modifying therapies targeting Aβ. 11, 12, 13

### BACE inhibitor clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease [^111uyCtf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The amyloid hypothesis posits that the amyloid-β aggregates in the brain initiate a cascade of events that eventually lead to neuron loss and Alzheimer's disease. Recent clinical trials of passive immunotherapy with anti-amyloid-β antibodies support this hypothesis, because clearing plaques led to better cognitive outcomes. Orally available small molecule BACE1 inhibitors are another approach to slowing the buildup of plaques and thereby cognitive worsening by preventing the cleavage of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) into amyloid-β peptide, the major component of plaques. This approach is particularly attractive because of their ease of use, low cost, and advanced clinical stage. However, although effective in preventing amyloid-β production in late-stage clinical trials, BACE inhibitors have been associated with early, non-progressive, likely reversible, cognitive decline. The clinical trials tested high levels of BACE inhibition, greater than 50%, whereas genetics suggest that even a 30% inhibition may be sufficient to protect from Alzheimer's disease. Aside from AβPP, BACE1 cleaves many other substrates in the brain that may be contributing to the cognitive worsening. It is important to know what the cause of cognitive worsening is, and if a lower level of inhibition would sufficiently slow the progress of pathology while preventing these unwanted side effects. Should these side effects be mitigated, BACE inhibitors could rapidly move forward in clinical trials either as a primary prevention strategy in individuals that are at risk or biomarker positive, or as a maintenance therapy following amyloid clearance with an anti-amyloid antibody.

### The mitochondrial secret (ase) of Alzheimer's disease [^113c1P2P]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by progressive decline in memory and cognition and pathologically by extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits and intraneuronal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau. Since its proposal in 1992, the amyloid cascade hypothesis implicates Abeta overproduction as a causative event in disease pathogenesis, and this thinking has predominated the field's understanding of AD pathogenesis and the development of potential therapeutics (i.e. Abeta-reducing agents). Though Abeta has been shown to induce AD pathology, unanswered questions for sporadic AD development suggests this hypothesis is best applied to familial disease only. The more recent mitochondrial cascade hypothesis is supported by data showing that early impairments of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress may precede Abeta overproduction and deposition. However, the development of Abeta-reducing agents continues. Unfortunately, these agents have not been efficiently tested for their effect on one of the earliest AD pathologies, i.e., mitochondrial dysfunction. This paper will review supporting data for the amyloid and mitochondrial cascade hypotheses, reports of the effects of secretase inhibitors on AD-phenotypic cells and animals, and begin to look at a potential role for gamma-secretase, which is localized to mitochondria, in AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.

### Identification of neurotoxic cross-linked amyloid-β dimers in the Alzheimer's brain [^1139m5mM]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary structure of canonical amyloid-β-protein was elucidated more than 30 years ago, yet the forms of amyloid-β that play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis remain poorly defined. Studies of Alzheimer's disease brain extracts suggest that amyloid-β, which migrates on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of ∼7 kDa (7kDa-Aβ), is particularly toxic; however, the nature of this species has been controversial. Using sophisticated mass spectrometry and sensitive assays of disease-relevant toxicity we show that brain-derived bioactive 7kDa-Aβ contains a heterogeneous mixture of covalently cross-linked dimers in the absence of any other detectable proteins. The identification of amyloid-β dimers may open a new phase of Alzheimer's research and allow a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease, and how to monitor and treat this devastating disorder. Future studies investigating the bioactivity of individual dimers cross-linked at known sites will be critical to this effort.

### FDA clears first blood test used in diagnosing… [^113aa7AF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease, a brain disorder known to slowly destroy memory and thinking skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks, is progressive, meaning that the disease gets worse over time. In most people with Alzheimer's disease, clinical symptoms first appear later in life. Amyloid plaques in a patient's brain are a hallmark sign of Alzheimer's disease. While amyloid plaques can occur in other diseases, being able to detect the presence of plaque, along with other evaluations, helps the doctor determine the probable cause of the patient's symptoms and findings. These plaques can be detected and visualized using amyloid positron emission tomography brain scans, often years before clinical symptom onset, to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. PET scans, however, are a costly and time-consuming option and expose patients to radiation.

The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1–42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient's brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. In this clinical study, 91. 7% of individuals with Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio positive results had the presence of amyloid plaques by PET scan or CSF test result, and
97. 3% of individuals with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or CSF test result. Less than 20% of the 499 patients tested received an indeterminate Lumipulse G pTau217/β-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio result. These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired.

The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information. False negative results could result in additional unnecessary diagnostic tests and potential delay in effective treatment. Importantly, the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic test and other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options.

### Amyloid-β and tau: the trigger and bullet in Alzheimer disease… [^115xtRG5]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Pathological Aβ species accumulate in the brain because of simple genetic insults, such as the rare amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations that cause familial early-onset AD, and the presence of apolipoprotein E4, the protein product of the ε4 allele of the APOE gene, which is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Complex genetic interactions and environmental risks, indicated here as other factors, also contribute to the accumulation of toxic Aβ species in late-onset AD. Toxic Aβ species stimulate formation of pathological tau by modulating protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate tau phosphorylation and by inducing tau misfolding. Toxic forms of tau mediate the synaptic dysfunction and neuron death that underlie memory and cognitive impairment in AD, so the signature adverse effects of Aβ require tau. The defining features of Alzheimer disease include conspicuous changes in both brain histology and behavior.

The AD brain is characterized microscopically by the combined presence of 2 classes of abnormal structures, extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, both of which comprise highly insoluble, densely packed filaments. The soluble building blocks of these structures are amyloid-β peptides for plaques and tau for tangles. Amyloid-β peptides are proteolytic fragments of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein, whereas tau is a brain-specific, axon-enriched microtubule-associated protein. The behavioral symptoms of AD correlate with the accumulation of plaques and tangles, and they are a direct consequence of the damage and destruction of synapses that mediate memory and cognition. Unless new, disease-modifying drugs become available soon, the number of AD cases in the United States could increase more than 2-fold by the middle of the 21st century.
4.

Plaque accumulation in hybrid mice that were either tau null or contained 1 tau gene was identical to the parental APP strain that contained 2 tau genes. Remarkably, loss of either 1 or 2 tau genes protected hybrids against the learning and memory deficits and excitotoxicity characteristic of the parental APP strain. 8 These results imply that Aβ initiates a pathway that leads to tau-dependent synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, they raise the possibility that the cognitive and memory loss associated with AD can be prevented or decelerated by reducing the level of tau in the brain.

### Aducanumab (marketed as aduhelm) information… [^117CVmJN]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Aduhelm is an amyloid beta-directed antibody indicated to treat Alzheimer's disease. Aduhelm is approved under the accelerated approval pathway, which provides patients with a serious disease earlier access to drugs when there is an expectation of clinical benefit despite some uncertainty about the clinical benefit. Accelerated approval is based upon the drug's effect on a surrogate endpoint — an endpoint that reflects the effect of the drug on an important aspect of the disease — where the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is expected, but not established, to predict clinical benefit. In the case of Aduhelm, the surrogate endpoint is the reduction of amyloid beta plaque. The accelerated approval pathway requires the company to verify clinical benefit in a post-approval trial. If the sponsor cannot verify clinical benefit, FDA may initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug.

### Cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid (1–42) in Alzheimer disease… [^117Gbq79]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

We then studied whether CSF-β-amyloid level changes during the course of disease. In the AD group, CSF-β-amyloid levels did not significantly differ between baseline and the first follow-up investigation at approximately 10 months. The corresponding values were 422 ± 170 pg/mL at baseline and 406 ± 145 pg/mL at the first follow-up visit in the EAD subgroup, and 845 ± 255 pg/mL at baseline and 840 ± 265 pg/mL at the first follow-up visit in the LAD subgroup. There were also highly significant correlations between baseline and first follow-up visit CSF-β-amyloid levels, and the coefficient of variation between baseline and follow-up levels was low. The apoE ϵ4 allele frequency was 41% in the AD group and 19% in the control group.

Thus, alternatively, a reduction of CSF-β-amyloid level in patients with AD may be secondary to an aggregation in the amyloid deposits and SP, decreasing the amount of β-amyloid that can be secreted to extracellular space and thereby resulting in lower levels remaining in CSF, as suggested previously. 38 However, alternative explanations include reduced production or secretion of β-amyloid in AD brains. These findings show that CSF-β-amyloid levels are stable for each patient, ie, that the summarized biological and methodological variations for CSF-β-amyloid level are low. Furthermore, these findings suggest that low CSF-β-amyloid levels are present during the earlier stages of the disease, but because relatively few patients with MMSE scores below 15 were included, we cannot exclude that CSF-β-amyloid level changes late in the course of the disease.

Evidence from several reports45–48 suggests that the degree of neuronal and synaptic49 degeneration, degree of neurotransmitter disturbances, 50 and density of neurofibrillary tangles and SP in the cortex46, 48, 51–55 are more severe in patients with EAD than in those with LAD. In contrast, the degree of concomitant cerebrovascular pathologic findings.

### FDA approves treatment for adults with Alzheimer's disease… [^114G7Gq5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Disease or Condition Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder affecting more than 6. 5 million Americans that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. While the specific causes of Alzheimer's are not fully known, it is characterized by changes in the brain — including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles — that result in loss of neurons and their connections. These changes affect a person's ability to remember, think and speak. Effectiveness The efficacy of Kisunla was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The patients had confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease.

1736 patients were randomized 1: 1 to receive700 mg Kisunla every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, and then 1400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo for a total of up to 72 weeks. The treatment was switched to placebo based on a prespecified reduction in amyloid levels measured by positron emission tomography at Week 24, Week 52, and Week 76. Safety Information The prescribing information includes a boxed warning for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. ARIA most commonly presents as temporary swelling in areas of the brain that usually resolves over time and may be accompanied by small spots of bleeding in or on the surface of the brain. ARIA usually does not have symptoms, although serious and life-threatening events rarely can occur. Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic and serious ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers.

Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to beginning treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. There is risk of infusion-related reactions, with symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting and changes in blood pressure, and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. The most common side effects of Kisunla were ARIA and headache. See full prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Kisunla. Designations The FDA granted this application Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations.
