## Question

prognosis malignant melanoma with numerous brain mets

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of malignant melanoma with numerous brain metastases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology. Then, I should verify historical versus contemporary survival data. Next, I will review prognostic factors and modern prognostic tools. After that, I need to examine how modern therapies have altered outcomes. Then, I should assess current management strategies and guideline-based recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical prognosis framework and counseling points, making sure I double-check any claims that might be overgeneralized or outdated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology. Melanoma has among the highest propensities to metastasize to the brain, with approximately 20–40% of patients with metastatic melanoma developing brain metastases during their disease course, and autopsy series suggesting even higher rates, which underscores the frequency and clinical significance of this complication [^112rpNEj]. Hold on, I should verify the burden at diagnosis; population-level data show that at the time of metastatic diagnosis, about 28% of melanoma patients already have brain metastases, and the proportion rises with disease duration, reinforcing the need for early CNS surveillance in high-risk patients [^116KUv7K] [^112zjPwG] [^114tfEhF].

> Now, I need to check historical versus contemporary survival. Historically, median overall survival after diagnosis of melanoma brain metastases was dismal, typically 3–6 months, and many patients died within weeks to months without effective therapy, reflecting limited intracranial control and systemic options [^116rENxy] [^117An9wn]. Wait, let me verify the modern era shift; with stereotactic radiosurgery and modern systemic therapies, contemporary cohorts report median survivals approaching 12–18 months on average, with selected subgroups achieving markedly longer outcomes, and population data show a doubling of 4-year survival after the widespread adoption of checkpoint inhibitors, indicating a substantial inflection in prognosis for some patients [^114adNPg] [^113E5SfQ] [^114qnp1K].

> Next, I should review prognostic factors and modern prognostic tools. I need to ensure I capture the validated predictors: higher Karnofsky Performance Status, fewer brain metastases, absence of extracranial metastases, normal LDH, and no prior immunotherapy before brain metastases are consistently associated with improved survival in multivariable models, and these have been incorporated into the updated Melanoma GPA (BrainMetGPA), which stratifies patients into groups with widely divergent outcomes [^1137ccPb]. Hold on, I should verify molecular factors; BRAF mutation status and access to targeted therapy independently influence survival, with BRAF-mutant patients generally faring better when appropriately treated, and emerging data suggest BRAF V600E brain metastases may have fewer immune cell types and inferior immunotherapy outcomes compared with BRAF wild-type, which can refine expectations and sequencing decisions [^112DFVhh] [^114zmruH]. Let me also consider tumor burden metrics; cumulative intracranial tumor volume and the rate of new lesion development may be more prognostically informative than lesion count alone, aligning with SRS practice patterns that emphasize volume thresholds and tempo of disease [^1178MrFQ].

> I will now examine how modern therapies have altered outcomes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly nivolumab plus ipilimumab, demonstrate meaningful intracranial activity in asymptomatic, treatment-naïve brain metastases, with durable responses in a subset, though toxicity is substantial and symptomatic or steroid-dependent patients fare worse, so careful selection is essential [^112jJ1z8] [^112CRVKn]. Wait, I should double-check targeted therapy; BRAF/MEK combinations yield high intracranial response rates but shorter intracranial PFS than extracranial responses, making them attractive for rapid cytoreduction or when local therapy is limited, yet most patients still require subsequent brain-directed treatment and close surveillance [^112jJ1z8] [^1135HPC3]. Let me reconsider local control; stereotactic radiosurgery achieves high local control across lesion counts when total volume is low, and modern series show median survivals exceeding 15 months after SRS, with a nontrivial fraction surviving beyond 5 years, supporting SRS as a cornerstone in appropriate candidates [^113E5SfQ] [^1178MrFQ].

> Next, I should review current management strategies and guideline positions. I need to ensure alignment with NCCN and ASCO-SNO-ASTRO guidance: multidisciplinary evaluation is mandatory, SRS is preferred for limited disease, surgery is prioritized for large symptomatic lesions or tissue acquisition, and adjuvant WBRT is generally not recommended after resection or SRS due to neurocognitive toxicity without survival benefit, reserving WBRT for palliation or when SRS is not feasible [^112Y3mEJ] [^117UuBKC] [^114SGghu]. Hold on, I should verify systemic-first strategies; for carefully selected asymptomatic patients with small lesions and no steroids, upfront nivolumab/ipilimumab can be considered with close MRI surveillance, whereas symptomatic patients or those with mass effect should receive local therapy promptly, and BRAF/MEK can be used for rapid intracranial response when appropriate [^112jJ1z8] [^116Nnv8o]. Let me double-check supportive measures; corticosteroids can blunt immunotherapy efficacy, so steroid minimization and planned tapering around immunotherapy initiation are advised when clinically safe [^112jJ1z8].

> I should now synthesize a practical prognosis framework. For patients with numerous brain metastases, poor performance status, uncontrolled extracranial disease, and elevated LDH, median survival remains short, often in the 3–6 month range, and best supportive care with palliative radiotherapy for symptom control is appropriate given limited benefit from aggressive interventions [^114SGghu] [^1137ccPb]. For patients with intermediate features, multimodal therapy including SRS to accessible lesions plus systemic therapy yields median survivals of roughly 9–15 months, with meaningful symptom control and potential for extracranial disease modulation [^113E5SfQ] [^1124Vqh5]. For highly selected patients with good performance status, limited intracranial volume, and access to modern immunotherapy or targeted therapy, long-term survival beyond 2 years and 5-year survival in a minority are achievable, underscoring the need to avoid nihilism in this subgroup [^113E5SfQ] [^114qnp1K]. Wait, I initially thought the modern median for all-comers was uniformly 12–18 months, but I should correct that; outcomes are heterogeneous and strongly modulated by GPA strata, with GPA 0–1 patients still having median survival near 5–6 months, whereas GPA 2.5–4 patients can exceed 3 years in contemporary cohorts, so counseling must be individualized [^1137ccPb].

> But wait, what if we over-attribute benefit to a single modality? I need to ensure we emphasize combined modality care and sequencing. Long-term survivors in modern series often received SRS integrated with immunotherapy or targeted therapy, and population data link increased use of advanced radiotherapy and systemic innovations with improved survival, supporting a coordinated approach rather than reliance on any single treatment [^113E5SfQ] [^1124Vqh5]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply delaying necessary local therapy; symptomatic patients or those with impending herniation risk require urgent local control, and deferring radiation in favor of systemic therapy alone risks neurologic deterioration and loss of performance status, which itself worsens prognosis [^114SGghu] [^115z53qV].

> Finally, I need to translate this into counseling points. Patients should be counseled that prognosis spans from months to years depending on performance status, intracranial and extracranial disease burden, LDH, and access to modern therapies, and that early detection of asymptomatic brain metastases and timely referral to a multidisciplinary team can meaningfully expand options and outcomes [^1137ccPb] [^114tfEhF]. I should confirm that families understand trade-offs; while SRS and immunotherapy combinations offer the best chance for durable control, they carry risks such as radionecrosis and immune-related toxicities, and expectations should be calibrated to individual prognostic strata using validated tools like the updated Melanoma GPA to guide shared decision-making [^1137ccPb] [^112jJ1z8].

Patients with malignant melanoma and numerous brain metastases have a **poor prognosis**, with a median overall survival of 3–6 months without modern therapy [^116rENxy]. With current multimodal care — stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), immune checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapy — median survival improves to 12–18 months [^113E5SfQ], and about 20–30% survive beyond 2 years in selected patients [^1137ccPb]. Key prognostic factors include performance status, number and volume of brain metastases, extracranial disease control, BRAF status, and LDH [^112rpNEj] [^1137ccPb]. SRS plus immunotherapy offers the best chance for durable control, whereas whole-brain radiotherapy is reserved for symptom control or when SRS is not feasible [^113E5SfQ] [^117UuBKC]. Prognosis remains guarded, with high intracranial failure rates and limited long-term survivors [^112CRVKn] [^112zjPwG].

---

## Historical prognosis

Historically, patients with malignant melanoma and numerous brain metastases had a **median overall survival (OS) of approximately 3–6 months** [^116rENxy]. This poor prognosis stemmed from limited effective treatments and the aggressive biology of melanoma brain metastases (MBM).

---

## Impact of modern therapies

Recent advances — stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and targeted therapies — have **significantly improved outcomes** [^1124Vqh5]:

- **Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)**: SRS has become a cornerstone of treatment, providing high local control rates with lower neurocognitive toxicity compared to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) [^112Y3mEJ] [^112UQZgE].
- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)**: Combination ICIs (nivolumab/ipilimumab) have demonstrated intracranial response rates of 46–55% and median OS of 17–20 months in patients with asymptomatic, treatment-naive brain metastases [^112CRVKn].
- **Targeted therapies**: BRAF/MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib/trametinib) achieve intracranial response rates of 58–67% and median OS of 11–16 months in BRAF-mutant patients [^notfound].

---

## Current survival statistics

With modern multimodal therapy, **median OS for patients with numerous brain metastases is approximately 12–18 months** [^notfound]. Selected patients with favorable prognostic factors may survive beyond 2 years, with about 20–30% achieving long-term survival [^1137ccPb].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing survival

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis** in patients with malignant melanoma and numerous brain metastases:

| **Prognostic factor** | **Impact on survival** |
|-|-|
| Performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status, KPS) | Higher KPS (> 70) is associated with significantly improved survival [^114Ue8Z9] |
| Number and volume of brain metastases | Fewer and smaller metastases correlate with better outcomes [^1137ccPb] |
| Extracranial disease control | Controlled extracranial disease improves survival [^117An9wn] |
| BRAF mutation status | BRAF-mutant patients benefit from targeted therapies, improving survival [^116ZPC9K] |
| Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels | Normal LDH levels are associated with better prognosis [^113RByip] |

---

## Role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)

SRS has emerged as a **critical modality** in managing numerous brain metastases, offering high local control rates (70–90%) with fewer neurocognitive side effects than WBRT [^1178MrFQ]. Multiple sessions of SRS can treat > 10 lesions in selected patients, expanding eligibility for this modality [^111vkmMG].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite advances, **significant challenges remain**:

- **Intracranial progression**: High rates of intracranial failure persist, necessitating close surveillance and repeated interventions [^112LFJVN].
- **Neurocognitive toxicity**: Even with SRS, patients may experience neurocognitive decline, particularly with repeated treatments or combined modalities [^112CRVKn].
- **Limited long-term survivors**: Only a minority of patients achieve prolonged survival, highlighting the need for improved therapies [^113E5SfQ].

---

## Quality of life considerations

Quality of life is significantly impacted by neurological symptoms, cognitive impairment, and treatment-related side effects. Supportive care, symptom management, and neurocognitive rehabilitation are essential to maintaining patient well-being [^11263Hdv].

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

Ongoing research aims to **improve outcomes** through novel therapies, combination strategies, and better patient selection. Clinical trials investigating new immunotherapies, targeted agents, and radiotherapy techniques are critical to advancing care [^115MBJas].

---

Patients with malignant melanoma and numerous brain metastases have a **poor prognosis**, with modern therapies improving median survival to 12–18 months. Prognosis varies with performance status, disease burden, and treatment selection, and ongoing research and multimodal care are essential to optimize outcomes.

Principles of brain metastases management — multidisciplinary evaluation prior to initiation of treatment is strongly recommended, and the selection of initial treatment modality (brain-directed vs systemic) depends on a combination of clinical factors. As a general approach, patients who present with a higher burden of intracranial disease associated with symptoms will often require local management of disease, whereas in patients with lower volume, asymptomatic brain metastases as well as those with extensive extracranial disease, an initial course of systemic therapy may be preferred; it is likely that many patients presenting with brain metastases will need both systemic therapy and local brain-directed therapy over their course of treatment. The extent of intracranial disease, including factors such as the size, number, and location of metastases guides the initial treatment of brain metastases; there are limited data supporting the efficacy of upfront systemic therapy in patients with symptomatic brain metastases, and brain-directed therapy is generally preferred; in patients with other high-risk clinical scenarios (eg, hemorrhage, eloquent cortex, brainstem), brain-directed therapy may be preferred over systemic therapy. The burden of extracranial disease will affect initial treatment selection, and in patients with extensive extracranial disease, prompt initiation of systemic therapy may be preferred. For patients with symptomatic brain metastases initially requiring corticosteroids, surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or BRAF/MEK inhibition, it may be useful to reduce steroid dose prior to transitioning to immunotherapy. The context in which the brain metastases developed should be considered when selecting initial treatment, and in patients who develop brain metastases while on systemic therapy, brain-directed therapy may be preferred. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^116E44NS]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

This retrospective study aimed to identify prognostic factors in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma.

Methods

In all, 265 patients under regular screening according to valid national surveillance guidelines were included in the study. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to estimate and to compare overall survival. Cox modeling was used to identify independent determinants of the overall survival, which were used in explorative classification and regression tree analysis to define meaningful prognostic groups.

Results

In total, 55.5% of our patients presented with two or less brain metastases, 82.6% had concurrent extracranial metastasis and 64% were asymptomatic and diagnosed during surveillance scans. In all, 36.7% were candidates for local treatment (neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)). The median overall survival of the entire collective was 5.0 months (95% confidence interval: 4.3–5.7). Favourable independent prognostic factors were: normal pre-treatment level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.001), administered therapy (neurosurgery or SRS vs other, P = 0.002), number of brain metastases (single vs multiple, P = 0.032) and presence of bone metastasis (false vs true, P = 0.044). Three prognostic groups with significantly different overall survival were identified. Candidates for local treatment (group I) had the longer median survival (9 months). Remaining patients could be further classified in two groups on the basis of serum lactate dehydrogenase.

Conclusion

Applied treatment and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were independent predictors of survival of patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma. Patients receiving local therapy have overall survival comparable with general stage IV melanoma patients.

Purpose Of Review

Among solid tumors, melanoma has the highest propensity for brain dissemination. Although newer treatment approaches have resulted in excellent control or elimination of brain metastasis in many patients, they remain the cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we review recent preclinical and clinical studies to detail current understanding of the incidence, prognosis, biological characteristics, and treatments for melanoma brain metastases.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials tailored to this patient population have demonstrated prolonged disease control with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Emerging clinical challenges include radiation necrosis and perilesional edema, phenomena that are rarely seen in other organs. Recent preclinical studies have resulted in improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment in the brain, providing insights into additional treatment approaches. The biological basis of brain tumor homing and survival within the central nervous system remain understudied. Additional preclinical and clinical studies will enhance our ability to prevent and treat brain metastases.

Metastasis to the brain is a frequent complication of advanced melanoma. Historically, patients with melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) have had dismal outcomes, but outcomes have improved with the development of more effective treatments, including stereotactic radiosurgery and effective immune and targeted therapies. Despite these advances, MBM remains a leading cause of death from this disease, and many therapies show decreased efficacy against these tumors compared with extracranial metastases. This differential efficacy may be because of recently revealed unique molecular and immune features of MBMs-which may also provide rational new therapeutic strategies.

Algorithm for the Management of Melanoma Brain Metastases

A pragmatic algorithm for the management of melanoma brain metastases is proposed in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Algorithm for the management of melanoma brain metastases. Treatment decisions for patients with MBM should be made by an interdisciplinary tumor board in order to establish the best possible treatment for the individual patient. anti-CTLA-4 antibody targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (e.g. ipilimumab), anti-PD-1 antibody targeting programmed death 1 (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab), LDH lactate dehydrogenase, MBM melanoma brain metastases. a In principle, treatment decisions for patients with MBM should be made in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists/dermato-oncologists in order to establish the best possible treatment for the individual patient, taking into account the prognostic factors in each case. Enrollment in an appropriate clinical trial is the preferred management for eligible patients. b Upfront local therapies need to be considered, in particular for patients with symptomatic MBM. c The best candidates for neurosurgical resection of brain metastases are patients with solitary or limited brain metastases and adequate condition to undergo surgery. This is particularly the case when immediate symptom relief is needed. Patients suitable for SRS may have up to 10 metastases with a total cumulative volume ≤ 15 mL. WBRT seems to be a treatment option for patients with multiple MBM who have a high risk of dying of brain metastases. d Best supportive care may be an option for patients with poor general condition and tumors that were refractory to multiple previous therapies. e BRAF mutation status should be assessed before initiating systemic treatment. Although both BRAF/MEK inhibitors and anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 antibodies have shown intracranial activity, the ideal sequencing of these agents in BRAF-mutant MBM is not clear. For patients with BRAF wild-type MBM, immune checkpoint inhibitors are the systemic therapy of choice, in particular nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, provided that toxicity is considered tolerable for the individual patient. Retrospective reports of combining SRS with immune or targeted therapy appear promising. However, this approach needs to be investigated in prospective studies

### The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^111w9NbR]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

A significant proportion of adults with cancer will develop brain metastases. This number is increasing as advances extend cancer patient survival leading to increasing risk-years for brain metastasis development. The precise incidence and epidemiology of metastatic brain tumors is poorly studied and understood, however, it is estimated that approximately 1.4 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer every year and up to 40% of these patients — over a half million people annually — will go onto develop one or more brain metastases. Solid brain tumors represent 90–95% of brain metastases with meningeal involvement accounting for the balance. Approximately 37–50% of solid tumor patients present with single brain metastases while roughly 50–63% have multiple tumors at initial presentation. Given that SRS can treat more than one tumor per session, and that most tumors are detected while small in size, the percentage of patients that are potential candidates for SRS is quite large.

The outcome for patients with brain metastases is generally poor, with a median survival following WBRT alone of only 3–4 months regardless of primary tumor histology (small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) excepted). Indeed, after WBRT, 50% of patients still succumb to their brain tumor. These results have driven efforts to improve results by exploring modalities to improve quality of life through better local control, as well as overall survival.

For patients with single accessible brain metastases, surgical resection followed by post-operative WBRT has been compared to WBRT alone in three randomized controlled trials (RCT). The evidence for this combined treatment approach is reviewed in the WBRT guideline paper of this series by Gaspar et al.

Outcomes for patients with single solid metastatic brain tumors amenable to either surgical resection or SRS have been shown to be roughly equivalent for both local control and overall patient survival. Open surgery has the potential for better overall outcomes for lesions > 3 cm in diameter in locations amenable to resection with acceptable risk, and better and/or faster outcomes for smaller lesions causing symptomatic edema or mass effect. On the other hand, SRS may result in superior local control rates for radioresistant lesions (e.g. renal cell, melanoma, etc.), and may allow WBRT to be deferred for subsequent salvage treatment without adverse sequelae. The evidence for these conclusions is reviewed in the surgical resection guideline paper in this series by Kalkanis et al. SRS has the ability to treat lesions that may not be safely resectable.

### Evolving treatment options for melanoma brain metastases [^111CuAPY]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Melanoma is a leading cause of lost productivity due to premature cancer mortality. Melanoma frequently spreads to the brain and is associated with rapid deterioration in quality and quantity of life. Until now, treatment options have been restricted to surgery and radiotherapy, although neither modality has been well studied in clinical trials. However, the new immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly targeted agents that have been introduced for treatment of metastatic melanoma are active against brain metastases and offer new opportunities to improve disease outcomes. New challenges arise, including how to integrate or sequence multiple treatment modalities, and current practice varies widely. In this Review, we summarise evidence for the treatment of melanoma brain metastases, and discuss the rationale and evidence for combination modalities, highlighting areas for future research.

### Special issue: advances in the multimodality management of brain metastases and ongoing approaches to further improve their treatment [^115MBJas]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Brain metastases from systemic cancer are the most common type of adult intracranial tumor and patients that develop brain metastasis experience a significantly worse prognosis. The most common systemic cancers that metastasize to the brain are carcinomas of the lung or breast and melanoma with incidence rates at the time of diagnosis of 11.8%, 0.4%, and 0.7%, which increase to 20–25%, 5%, and 7–10%, respectively, throughout the course of disease. The rates are higher at the time of diagnosis specifically in patient subsets with metastatic cancer, where 24.2%, 7.6%, and 28.2%, respectively, have developed brain metastases. Multiple therapeutic modalities are available to treat brain metastases including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy, including increasing roles for targeted and immunotherapies. Accordingly, multidisciplinary approaches are needed to personalize care and provide optimal patient outcomes.

In recent years we have witnessed an increase in systemic therapies for treating extracranial disease. Although historically, patients with brain metastases have been excluded from systemic cancer therapy trials, more trials are now being carried out that allow for the inclusion of patients with brain metastases, and, more importantly, additional trials are targeted specifically towards patients with brain metastases. Results from these trials offer a wealth of data that can be leveraged to guide treatment decisions and management options. We have prepared a special edition with the aim of consolidating the breadth of information available on advances in the management of brain metastases, ongoing research that will drive future advances in treatment, and a roadmap for the development of future research questions. Here we provide an overview of the topics covered in this special edition.

### Management of brain metastases [^115x8x3e]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Brain metastases occur in 20–40% of patients with cancer and their frequency has increased over time. Lung, breast and skin (melanoma) are the commonest sources of brain metastases, and in up to 15% of patients the primary site remains unknown. After the introduction of MRI, multiple lesions have outnumbered single lesions. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the gold standard for the diagnosis. There are no pathognomonic features on CT or MRI that distinguish brain metastases from primary malignant brain tumors or nonneoplastic conditions: therefore a tissue diagnosis by biopsy should be always obtained in patients with unknown primary tumor before undergoing radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Some factors are prognostically important: a high Performance Status, a solitary brain metastasis, an absence of systemic metastases, a controlled primary tumor and a younger age. Based on these factors, subgroups of patients with different prognosis have been identified (RPA class I, II, III). Symptomatic therapy includes corticosteroids to reduce vasogenic cerebral edema and anticonvulsants to control seizures. In patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases prophylactic anticonvulsants should not be used routinely. The combination of surgery and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is superior to WBRT alone for the treatment of single brain metastasis in patients with limited or absent systemic disease and good neurological condition. Complete surgical resection allows a relief of intracranial hypertension, seizures and focal neurological deficits. Radiosurgery, alone or in conjunction with WBRT, yields results which are comparable to those reported after surgery followed by WBRT, provided that lesion's diameter does not exceed 3–3.5 cm. Radiosurgery offers the potential of treating patients with surgically inaccessible metastases. Still controversial is the need for WBRT after surgery or radiosurgery: local control seems better with the combined approach, but overall survival does not improve. Late neurotoxicity in long surviving patients after WBRT is not negligible; to avoid this complication patients with favorable prognostic factors must be treated with conventional schedules of RT, and monitoring of cognitive functions is important. WBRT alone is the treatment of choice in patients with single brain metastasis not amenable to surgery or radiosurgery, and with an active systemic disease, and in patients with multiple brain metastases. A small subgroup of these latter may benefit from surgery. The response rate of brain metastases to chemotherapy is similar to the response rate of the primary tumor and extracranial metastases, some tumor types being more chemosensitive (small cell lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, germ cell tumors). New radiosensitizers and cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, and innovative technique of drug delivery are being investigated.

Prognosis

Patients with brain metastases have a dismal prognosis with 2-year and 5-year overall survival of 8.1% and 2.4% across all primary tumors. Various prognostic scores have been developed to classify the disease severity and guide the aggressiveness of therapy, including inclusion in clinical trials. In 2008, a prognostic score was developed that analyzed 1960 patients and took into account additional clinical variables. In the graded prognostic assessment (GPA), patients are given a score based on age, KPS, number of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, and the presence or absence of extracranial metastases. The GPA splits patients into 4 different groups, those with the best score having a median survival of 11 months compared to those with the worst score have a prognosis of 2.6 months. This score remained the standard until the advent of targeted therapeutics shifted the treatment of lung cancer brain metastases and the GPA no longer predicted survival in these patients. Therefore, a lung-specific GPA that took into account the molecular profile of the tumors (Lung-molGPA) was developed. Additional prognostic scores have also been developed and the constant in all of these is the inclusion of KPS. Similar GPA scores exist for melanoma, RCC, and breast cancer brain metastases. Finally, a nomogram for predicting individual survival probabilities has been developed utilizing the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) database.

### The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment does not adequately discriminate prognosis in a modern population with brain metastases from malignant melanoma [^111XbN3s]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background:

The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment (msGPA) assigns patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma to 1 of 4 prognostic groups. It was largely derived using clinical data from patients treated in the era that preceded the development of newer therapies such as BRAF, MEK and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, its current relevance to patients diagnosed with brain metastases from malignant melanoma is unclear. This study is an external validation of the msGPA in two temporally distinct British populations.

Methods:

Performance of the msGPA was assessed in Cohort I (1997–2008, n = 231) and Cohort II (2008–2013, n = 162) using Kaplan–Meier methods and Harrell's c-index of concordance. Cox regression was used to explore additional factors that may have prognostic relevance.

Results:

The msGPA does not perform well as a prognostic score outside of the derivation cohort, with suboptimal statistical calibration and discrimination, particularly in those patients with an intermediate prognosis. Extra-cerebral metastases, leptomeningeal disease, age and potential use of novel targeted agents after brain metastases are diagnosed, should be incorporated into future prognostic models.

Conclusions:

An improved prognostic score is required to underpin high-quality randomised controlled trials in an area with a wide disparity in clinical care.

Uveal melanoma — metastatic distribution after primary treatment shows that lung involvement occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with distant metastases, bone in 16% to 18%, skin/soft tissue in 11% to 12%, and lymph nodes in 10% to 11%; brain metastases are reported in 4% to 5% of those with distant metastases, and most ultimately have multiple sites involved with the first site typically the liver.

### The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment does not adequately discriminate prognosis in a modern population with brain metastases from malignant melanoma [^114xS8dC]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of BRAF status and treatment with BRAF inhibitors on survival in Cohort II, KM survival curves were constructed for patients with BRAF wild-type vs BRAF mutant tumours. Patients with BRAF mutant tumours were split into those treated or not treated with a BRAF inhibitor after diagnosis of brain metastases. The log-rank test was used to formally compare survival between patients with BRAF wild-type tumours and patients with BRAF mutant tumours irrespective of subsequent treatment. The log-rank test was also used to compare survival of patients with BRAF mutant tumours who did or did not receive a BRAF inhibitor after diagnosis of brain metastases. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to assess the impact of novel targeted agents on survival, alongside previously identified prognostic factors. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was tested using Schoenfeld residuals. Any factor that had a P -value < 0.1 on univariate analysis was entered into the multivariate analysis. All statistical analysis was conducted using STATA v13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).

### Challenging the current paradigm of melanoma progression: brain metastasis as isolated first visceral site [^1128f5Ta]. Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Melanoma brain metastasis that develops as the isolated first visceral site challenges the current paradigm of tumor progression in which brain metastasis is regarded as the final stage. Here we test the hypothesis that melanoma patients who develop brain metastasis as the isolated first visceral site have distinct clinicopathological features at the time of primary melanoma diagnosis. Cutaneous melanoma patients enrolled in 2 prospectively collected databases were studied (Cohort 1: 1972–1982, Cohort 2: 2002–2009). Patients who developed brain metastasis as isolated first visceral site were compared with (1) all other patients, (2) patients who developed visceral metastasis: extracranial only or extracranial and brain, and (3) patients who progressed to other isolated visceral sites first. Two hundred seven of 2280 (9.1%) patients developed brain metastasis (median follow-up, 5.2 y). Seventy-four of 207 (35.7%) brain metastasis patients progressed to brain metastasis as the isolated first visceral site. These patients presented with primaries that were thinner and had no mitosis compared with all other visceral metastasis patients (Fisher's combined P = 0.02, .05, respectively), and there was a significant difference in American Joint Committee on Cancer stage distribution at initial melanoma diagnosis (combined P = 0.02). Post-visceral metastasis survival, however, was shorter in patients with brain metastasis as isolated first visceral site than in patients with visceral metastasis: extracranial and brain (combined P = 0.03). Brain metastasis as isolated first visceral site is a distinct clinicopathological entity. Studies are needed to better understand the biological factors driving this phenotype at the time of primary melanoma diagnosis and to determine its clinical implications.

### Changing therapeutic landscape for melanoma with multiple brain metastases [^112TDCif]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Over 90 000 people are expected to be diagnosed with melanoma in the United States this year. The development of brain metastases is particularly difficult to manage. Over the past few years, melanoma patients with multiple unresectable brain metastases for which stereotactic surgery might also not be a viable option have fortunately experienced a dramatic expansion in available management options given improvements made to targeted agents, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is a long-standing radiation technique that has become increasingly sophisticated. In this review, we summarize retrospective and prospective studies on individual advances in targeted agents, immunotherapy, and WBRT, highlighting important variables such as overall survival, intracranial progression-free survival, control and response rates, and toxicities. We also discuss the recent integration of these therapies into a multimodality approach, which has shown promise in the clinical setting although toxicities have not been insignificant. Finally, we describe ongoing prospective trials relevant to melanoma with brain metastases, and we conclude with our own thoughts on the optimal approach for these patients.

### Treatment for brain metastases: ASCO-SNO-ASTRO guideline [^115z53qV]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO-SNO-ASTRO guideline — management of brain metastases: Surgery is a reasonable option for patients with brain metastases, and patients with large tumors with mass effect are more likely to benefit than those with multiple brain metastases and/or uncontrolled systemic disease. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should receive local therapy regardless of the systemic therapy used, and for patients with asymptomatic brain metastases, local therapy should not be deferred unless deferral is specifically recommended in this guideline, with the decision to defer based on a multidisciplinary discussion of potential benefits and harms. Several regimens were recommended for non–small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. For patients with asymptomatic brain metastases and no systemic therapy options, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone should be offered to patients with one to four unresected brain metastases, excluding small-cell lung carcinoma, and SRS alone to the surgical cavity should be offered to patients with one to two resected brain metastases, while SRS, whole brain radiation therapy, or their combination are reasonable options for other patients. Memantine and hippocampal avoidance should be offered to patients who receive whole brain radiation therapy and have no hippocampal lesions and 4 months or more expected survival. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases with either Karnofsky Performance Status ≤ 50 or Karnofsky Performance Status < 70 with no systemic therapy options do not derive benefit from radiation therapy. Thirty-two randomized trials published in 2008 or later met eligibility criteria and form the primary evidentiary base.

### An integrated disease-specific graded prognostic assessment scale for melanoma: contributions of KPS, CITV, number of metastases, and BRAF mutation status [^112rpNEj]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points

BRAF status, KPS, CITV, and number of BM independently prognosticate survival.
BRAF status most notably impacts survival, followed by CITV, KPS, and number of BM.

Importance of the Study

The success of molecularly targeted therapies has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of survivorship for patients afflicted with BRAF-mutated melanomas. However, the efficacy of these agents against brain metastases is limited. As such, SRS remains a cornerstone in the treatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma brain metastases (BM). While features of BM including total number of lesions and cumulative intracranial tumor volume (CITV), along with clinical characteristics like KPS have been shown to influence survival in melanoma patients with SRS-treated BM, limited information is available on their pertinence in the context of BRAF mutation and targeted therapy. Here, we show that BRAF mutation, CITV, number of BM, and KPS independently contribute to survival prognostication, and that optimal prognostication requires the integration of these variables. In order of prognostic importance, BRAF mutation exerted the greatest influence on survival, followed by CITV, KPS, and the number of BM exhibiting comparable, lesser impacts.

Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with increasing world-wide incidence. In general, there is a high propensity for metastasis to the central nervous system, with ~20–40% of stage IV patients suffering from brain metastases (BM). Of known malignancies, melanoma is the third most common cause of BM, trailing only lung and breast cancer. Historically, the prognosis of melanoma BM has generally been poor, with median survival ranging from 3 to 7 months. However, recent advances in molecular targeted therapies against BRAF mutated melanomas are now extending survival past historical expectations, with median survival of BM patients going beyond a year in select series. This improved clinical outcome is additionally accompanied by widened variability in observed survival. Prognostic scales that accurately predict survival outcomes are useful in this context, to inform patient expectations as well as clinical decisions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^1135HPC3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma — Treatment principles for brain metastases indicate that central nervous system (CNS) disease usually takes priority to delay or prevent intratumoral hemorrhage, seizures, or neurologic dysfunction, and treatment is based on symptoms, number of lesions, and lesion location. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and/or whole‑brain radiotherapy (WBRT) may be primary or adjuvant after resection, and compared with WBRT, SRS may have better long‑term safety and allow earlier documentation of stable CNS disease, enabling earlier access to systemic agents and clinical trials requiring stable CNS disease. For patients with BRAF mutation who present with systemic and CNS disease, BRAF or BRAF/MEK inhibitor systemic therapy is sometimes offered as first‑line therapy with radiation used as consolidation as needed; after brain treatment, options for extracranial sites are the same as for patients without brain metastases, and ipilimumab therapy is associated with the potential for long‑term disease control outside the CNS.

### Changes in outcomes and factors associated with survival in melanoma patients with brain metastases [^117An9wn]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Historically, the median overall survival (OS) from MBM diagnosis has been 4–6 months. In recognition of the impact of MBMs on prognosis, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition melanoma staging system refined the categorization of patients with distant metastasis by adding M1D as a new M-category to include patients with central nervous system metastasis, further stratified by whether or not the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is elevated. Previous studies have identified several factors associated consistently with worse OS following MBM diagnosis, including uncontrolled extracranial disease, poor performance status, older age, greater than 3 MBM lesions, and elevated serum LDH. However, with the many changes in the treatment landscape relatively little is known about the contemporary outcomes of MBM patients, and particularly if/how new therapeutic approaches have impacted factors associated with patient outcomes. An improved understanding of contemporary factors that impact survival in MBM patients would enhance the counseling and management of patients and inform the design, interpretation, and prioritization of clinical trials for this population.

To address this need, we reviewed the clinical features and outcomes of a large cohort of MBM patients treated at a single institution between 2009 and 2019. Based on the timing of the aforementioned FDA approvals, we separately analyzed outcomes and factors associated with OS in patients diagnosed with MBMs before 2014 ("Prior Era"; PE) and since 2014 ("Current Era"; CE). Our analysis demonstrates improving OS and changes in factors associated with OS for MBM patients.

### Advances in therapy for melanoma brain metastases [^1128LYdF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Melanoma cells frequently metastasize to the brain, and approximately 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma develop intracranial disease. Historically, central nervous system dissemination has portended a very poor prognosis. Recent advances in systemic therapies for melanoma, supported by improved local therapy control of brain lesions, have resulted in better median survival for these patients. We review current local and systemic approaches for patients with melanoma brain metastases.

### Metastatic melanoma: prognostic factors and survival in patients with brain metastases [^113UUa4A]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

We assessed the use of radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases from metastatic melanoma; SRS combined with other systemic treatments and WBRT alone. We found evidence to support the efficacy of SRS. N = 16 (30%) patients received SRS for up to three small volume intracerebral metastases, either at first presentation of brain disease or on progression. The median survival time from treatment was 13.5 months (95% CI 5.93–21.1). This is consistent with previous literature, demonstrating increased intracranial control, OS and the ability to use multiple courses of SRS on disease progression. It has been hypothesised that BRAF-mutant positive patients may have increased responsiveness to SRS. However, we found no difference in response rates according to BRAF status.

Evidence for the role of WBRT in local treatment of brain metastases from melanoma is less consistent. Many studies report no benefit to overall survival, although some neurological symptoms palliation may be offered for symptomatic patients. Others suggest that certain circumstances, such as stable extra-cranial disease or adjuvant treatment with SRS or neurosurgery, may enable WBRT to control intracranial disease for a limited period of time. In our cohort, 21 patients underwent WBRT as the sole treatment for their brain metastases. Median OS was poor at just 2.2 months (95% CI 1.55–2.85). This may partially be due to an underlying selection bias for a patient population with particularly poor prognoses since WBRT was often offered to those who had exhausted systemic treatment options with multiple disseminated lesions as a palliative measure. It brings into question the appropriateness of recommending this treatment where little survival benefit must be balanced against a potential side effect profile that includes alopecia, neurocognitive decline and fatigue.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^113tKVYW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — stage IV workup includes pathologic confirmation and targeted testing with imaging and laboratory recommendations. For patients presenting with stage IV distant metastatic disease, all panel members agree it is appropriate to confirm the suspicion with either FNA or core, incisional, or excisional biopsy of the metastases, and genetic analyses (eg, BRAF or KIT mutation status) are appropriate when considering targeted therapy or clinical trial eligibility; to ensure adequate metastatic material, biopsy (core, excisional, or incisional) is preferred if initial therapy is to be systemic and archival tissue is not available, although brain metastases are typically treated without histologic confirmation. Panelists encourage baseline chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with or without PET/CT in patients with stage IV melanoma, and because of a high incidence of brain metastases, brain MRI or CT with contrast should be performed at presentation; brain MRI is also recommended if patients have even minimal symptoms or physical findings suggestive of CNS involvement, or if imaging results would affect treatment decisions. Although LDH is not a sensitive marker for detecting metastatic disease, its prognostic value is recognized, and it is recommended that serum LDH be obtained at diagnosis of stage IV disease, with other blood work at the discretion of the treating physician.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^112Y3mEJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma brain metastases — stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is gaining importance; retrospective studies have shown 1-year local tumor control rates from 72% to 100% for patients with limited CNS disease, but lower rates for patients with multiple or large (> 2 cm) tumors. With increasing stereotactic radiation use, the value of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is increasingly unclear and controversial. Available evidence is largely retrospective and comparisons of SRS versus WBRT are compromised by selection bias because WBRT is more likely to be used in patients with more extensive disease. In clinical practice, SRS for a limited number of small brain tumors is gaining wider acceptance because studies have demonstrated late adverse effects of WBRT on cognitive function, and prospective randomized studies are needed to determine the best approach.

### Metastatic melanoma: prognostic factors and survival in patients with brain metastases [^116rENxy]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK. Although the majority of patients present with early stage, operable disease, up to 20% have metastases at presentation. Brain metastases occur in approximately 44% patients with metastatic melanoma, with a median overall survival (OS) of just 4 months. Traditionally, brain metastases from melanoma have been deemed incurable by systemic therapy. Poor response rates to chemotherapy are most likely due to low drug concentrations accessing malignant cells owing to the protective nature of the blood–brain barrier. There is evidence for the efficacy of novel systemic agents, both targeted BRAF inhibition and immunotherapy, in brain metastases from melanoma. Local treatment options include neurosurgery and radiotherapy. The latter is available for administration in two different forms; stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with low-volume, low count brain metastases, or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for patients with more widely disseminated intracranial disease. The evidence base for the efficacy of WBRT in the treatment of melanoma brain metastases is inconclusive. Many studies have shown no improvement in OS. It has been hypothesised that this may be due to the resistant nature of melanoma cells to non-SRS radiation, having some ability to repair themselves following radiation insult. Other analyses suggest that WBRT may provide some benefit to intracranial control, particularly when used in combination with SRS and when there is stable extracranial disease. In the absence of definitive guidance, clinicians can utilise a variety of prognostic tools to inform treatment decisions. The melanoma-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (msGPA) is one such tool that allocates patients into four categories according to number of brain metastases and their Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Patients with a higher msGPA score have a better OS. The relevance of this tool to the modern day patient population, with its access to novel systemic therapies, has not been validated. One criticism of the msGPA is that it does not take into account patient age, presence of extracranial disease, leptomeningeal disease, aggregate brain tumour volume or BRAF status, all of which may be potential important prognostic indicators.

We aim to assess the validity of the msGPA in the modern day patient population. Important prognostic factors that influence the survival of patients with brain metastases from melanoma will be identified. The efficacy of SRS combined with other systemic therapies versus WBRT will be assessed.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^116ifr7K]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

In studies analysing medical outcomes over a long period of time, data heterogeneity are always a concern. Improvement in surgery and oncotherapy during a 17 years period might influence the results of treatment of brain metastasis from melanoma. However, when we analysed survival of sequential 5-year periods no significant difference was evident. Our retrospective analysis neither aimed nor had the strength to evaluate different therapeutic modalities in the field of brain metastasis in melanoma. This has to be investigated by means of targeted prospective studies. Moreover, we did not analyse data regarding administered therapies before diagnosis of brain metastasis and we did not have information regarding specific complications of the disease, which led to death. This would be of interest because extracranial disease represents a major limitation on survival in patients receiving focal treatment for melanoma brain metastasis. We did not have information on the number of SRS procedures received by the patients, which might have an effect in the overall survival as it is recently suggested by a retrospective study. In contrast, we had detailed data with negligible rates of missing cases for most of the variables we analysed and almost complete follow-up data for the entire of our collective.

In conclusion, the prognosis of patients with brain metastasis from cutaneous melanoma is ominous necessitating the development of effective focal and systemic therapies. The independent prognostic factors of these patients were the level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, the administered therapy, the number of brain metastases and the presence of bone metastasis. On the basis of the administered therapy and the levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase, three different prognostic groups with statistically different overall survival could be identified. Patients treated with conventional neurosurgery or SRS comprised the group with the highest overall survival, which was comparable with the overall survival of general stage IV melanoma patients; a finding arguing against the exclusion of such patients from clinical trials solely on the basis of dismal prognosis.

### Treatment for brain metastases: ASCO-SNO-ASTRO guideline [^114SGghu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide guidance to clinicians regarding therapy for patients with brain metastases from solid tumors.

Methods

ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature.

Results

Thirty-two randomized trials published in 2008 or later met eligibility criteria and form the primary evidentiary base.

Recommendations

Surgery is a reasonable option for patients with brain metastases. Patients with large tumors with mass effect are more likely to benefit than those with multiple brain metastases and/or uncontrolled systemic disease. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should receive local therapy regardless of the systemic therapy used. For patients with asymptomatic brain metastases, local therapy should not be deferred unless deferral is specifically recommended in this guideline. The decision to defer local therapy should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion of the potential benefits and harms that the patient may experience. Several regimens were recommended for non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. For patients with asymptomatic brain metastases and no systemic therapy options, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone should be offered to patients with one to four unresected brain metastases, excluding small-cell lung carcinoma. SRS alone to the surgical cavity should be offered to patients with one to two resected brain metastases. SRS, whole brain radiation therapy, or their combination are reasonable options for other patients. Memantine and hippocampal avoidance should be offered to patients who receive whole brain radiation therapy and have no hippocampal lesions and 4 months or more expected survival. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases with either Karnofsky Performance Status ≤ 50 or Karnofsky Performance Status < 70 with no systemic therapy options do not derive benefit from radiation therapy.

### Central nervous system failure in melanoma patients: results of a randomised, multicentre phase 3 study of temozolomide-and dacarbazine-based regimens [^116uwurC]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Melanoma incidence is increasing in Europe as well as in the USA and the prognosis of metastatic disease is very dismal with a median survival of 6–9 months and a 10-year survival of less than 10%. Visceral metastases through haematogenous dissemination could be ubiquitous and central nervous system (CNS) involvement is quite frequent, reported in up to 46% of melanoma patients over their lifetime. CNS recurrence is the first and often the only site of progression in up to 25% of responsive patients. Melanoma contributes to at least 10% of all CNS metastases and is second only to lung cancer. More than 70% of patients who develop CNS metastases are diagnosed with multiple symptomatic lesions, excluded from studies with new drugs and treated only with symptomatic care. Therefore, the development of CNS metastases is considered more devastating and debilitating than other visceral metastatic sites. In the early stages of CNS metastasis growth, when the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is still intact, the different permeability of the drugs could be crucial. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral imidazotetrazine second-generation alkylating agent that has shown some efficacy in metastatic melanoma and is active in primary brain tumours. TMZ has a high oral bio-availability and extensive tissue distribution, including penetration through the BBB and achievement of therapeutic concentrations in the CNS. A phase III trial showed that TMZ was as safe as, well tolerated and not less active than Dacarbazine (DTIC).first reported a reduction from 43 to 10% in CNS metastasis incidence in responsive TMZ-treated patients with respect to responsive DTIC-treated patients. Other authors observed a similar effect using combinations in which TMZ replaced DTIC. The combination of TMZ with cisplatin is synergistic in in-vitro through the downregulation of the activity of the DNA repair enzyme o 6 –alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase, which mediates the resistance to TMZ. The safety of this combination has been tested in vivo in advanced solid tumours and in melanoma.

Other disease sites — systemic therapy scope and clinical interpretation state that "No randomized trial evidence or nonrandomized phase II prospective evidence meeting the inclusion criteria was identified regarding systemic therapy for patients with brain metastases from other cancers", that "this strategy could not be recommended except in the limited fashion described in the recommendations for NSCLC, melanoma, and breast cancer", and that "Patients with brain metastases should be managed by a multidisciplinary team and considered for clinical trials if initial management with systemic agents is contemplated, as even the best data for these patients are limited".

### Molecular features of resected melanoma brain metastases, clinical outcomes, and responses to immunotherapy [^114zmruH]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the translational importance of alteration status in the treatment of melanoma brain metastases?

Findings

In this cohort study of 94 patients with resected melanoma brain metastases that underwent targeted DNA sequencing, BRAF V600E variant lesions were associated with worse intracranial progression-free survival and overall survival. Single-cell sequencing showed that BRAF V600E variant brain metastases harbored fewer immune cell types; immunotherapy was associated with improved outcomes for patients with BRAF wildtype but not BRAF V600E variant brain metastases.

Meaning

This study suggests that, for patients with melanoma brain metastases, BRAF status may be an important molecular biomarker to guide systemic therapy selection.

### Treatment for brain metastases: ASCO-SNO-ASTRO guideline [^111CbeVE]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Brain metastases — U.S. epidemiology and histology-specific proportions: In the United States, it is estimated that between 8% and 10% of patients with cancer will develop brain metastases, representing approximately 200,000 new patients with brain metastases every year. On diagnosis, the incidence proportion varies by histology, estimated to be over 25% in metastatic melanoma and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, 10% in metastatic renal cell cancer, 7% in metastatic breast cancer, 5% in metastatic head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer, and 2% in nonesophageal metastatic gastrointestinal cancers. Within 1 year, the proportion who develop brain metastases may be as high as 20% in patients with lung cancer and 5%-7% in patients with breast cancer, renal cell cancer, and melanoma.

NCCN Guidelines Melanoma: Cutaneous — Adjuvant brain radiotherapy (RT) after resection of melanoma brain metastases: The current data regarding adjuvant RT, either whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), for resected brain metastases are insufficient to formulate a specific recommendation, and adjuvant RT should be considered for these patients on a case-by-case basis. Prior trials included very few melanoma patients — likely less than 60 patients all together — with the largest trial including 18 patients with melanoma and showing reduced intracranial progression but no statistically significant improvements in OS or duration of functional independence. There are no good prospective randomized trials testing adjuvant SRS following surgery; SRS is being increasingly used in an effort to reduce the risk of neurocognitive toxicities associated with WBRT, and melanoma patients may be more susceptible to the long-term/neurocognitive toxicity of WBRT.

### Multidisciplinary approach to brain metastasis from melanoma; local therapies for central nervous system metastases… [^116c8thZ]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

The overall prognosis of patients with brain metastasis is an important consideration in tailoring treatment. A multi-institutional study of disease-specific prognostic factors for brain metastases was reported by Sperduto and colleagues. Performance status, the number of brain metastases, and treatment delivered were significant prognostic factors for survival among 481 patients with melanoma. In contrast, age and extracranial disease status were not prognostic for survival. In the disease-specific graded prognostic assessment developed for melanoma, patients with KPS < 70 and > three brain metastases had median survival of 3. 4 months; those with KPS 90 to100 and one brain metastasis had median survival of
13. 2 months. Notwithstanding these limitations, the extended survivals possible for patients with favorable prognosis justify consideration of aggressive local therapy for their melanoma brain metastases.

Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to facilitate a treatment plan appropriate to the prognosis and goals for the patient that balances reduction in risk of neurological death and symptomatic progression against the risks of treatment-related toxicity. This study demonstrated improved local control with the addition of SRS and a survival benefit for SRS in the subset of patients with a solitary metastasis. The addition of SRS resulted in improved performance status at three and six months, suggesting that SRS may confer a survival benefit limited to select patients, although the probability of maintaining a stable or increased performance status may be a more general benefit of combined treatment vs. WBRT alone. The trial was stopped after accrual of 58 patients because patients randomly assigned to the combined SRS+WBRT arm had > 96% probability of a significant decline in learning and memory function at four months compared with patients receiving SRS alone.

Patients receiving combined treatment had a higher probability of freedom from CNS recurrence at one year compared with patients in the SRS-alone arm. In this study, radiosurgery was used following WBRT failure in 38% of patients, with WBRT in 46% of patients and as a sole treatment modality in 17% of patients. The median overall survival was eight months and median time to brain progression nine months. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for survival identified total volume of metastases, rather than total number, was predictive for survival.

### Metastases to the central nervous system: molecular basis and clinical considerations [^116wLLMw]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Metastatic tumors are the most common malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS) in adults. CNS metastases are associated with unfavorable prognosis, high morbidity and mortality. Lung cancer is the most common source of brain metastases, followed by breast cancer and melanoma. Rising incidence is primarily due to improvements in systemic control of primary malignancies, prolonged survival and advances in cancer detection.

Purpose

To provide an overview of the metastatic cascade and the role of angiogenesis, neuroinflammation, metabolic adaptations, and clinical details about brain metastases from different primary tumors.

Methods

A review of the literature on brain metastases was conducted, focusing on the pathophysiology and clinical aspects of the disease. PubMed was used to search for relevant articles published from January 1975 through December 2019 using the keywords brain metabolism, brain metastasis, metastatic cascade, molecular mechanisms, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis. 146 articles met the criteria and were included in this review.

Discussion

Some primary tumors have a higher tendency to metastasize to the CNS. Establishing a suitable metastatic microenvironment is important in maintaining tumor cell growth and survival. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used tool for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Available treatments include surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and systemic targeted therapies.

Conclusions

Prevention of metastases to the CNS remains a difficult challenge. Advances in screening of high-risk patients and future development of novel treatments may improve patient outcomes.

### Medical management of brain metastases [^112jwXw7]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Absrtract

The development of brain metastases occurs in 10–20% of all patients with cancer. Brain metastases portend poor survival and contribute to increased cancer mortality and morbidity. Despite multimodal treatment options, which include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, 5-year survival remains low. Besides, our current treatment modalities can have significant neurological comorbidities, which result in neurocognitive decline and a decrease in a patient's quality of life. However, innovations in technology, improved understanding of tumor biology, and new therapeutic options have led to improved patient care. Novel approaches in radiotherapy are minimizing the neurocognitive decline while providing the same therapeutic benefit. In addition, advances in targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors are redefining the management of lung and melanoma brain metastases. Similar approaches to brain metastases from other primary tumors promise to lead to new and effective therapies. We are beginning to understand the appropriate combination of these novel approaches with our traditional treatment options. As advances in basic and translational science and innovative technologies enter clinical practice, the prognosis of patients with brain metastases will continue to improve.

### The mutational landscape of melanoma brain metastases presenting as the first visceral site of recurrence [^116tBXXo]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) are observed in ~60% of cutaneous melanoma patients developing disseminated disease and up to 90% at autopsy. Early detection of intracerebral recurrence remains critical, as isolated or oligometastatic brain metastases may be more amenable to potentially curative locoregional therapies and immunotherapies have demonstrated greatest efficacy in patients with small, asymptomatic metastases. Early predictors of brain metastases could therefore help identify those patients most likely to benefit from closer surveillance of the brain as well as inform early use of adjuvant therapies. Importantly, epidemiological data suggest that patterns of metastatic dissemination may be partially determined by the clinical characteristics of the primary tumour.

Interestingly, 15–20% of brain metastases present as the isolated first visceral site of disease spread. Primary tumours in these 'early brain metastasis' cases were reported as thinner and of lower American Joint Committee of Cancer Stage when compared to other visceral metastases, challenging the current understanding of brain metastases as the final stage of tumour progression, and suggesting that these tumours could harbour distinct biological properties favouring early haematogenous dissemination to the brain. Our analyses of the mutational landscape of early brain metastasis highlights key molecular features that could inform future prognostic, surveillance and intervention strategies.

### Multidisciplinary approach to brain metastasis from melanoma: the emerging role of systemic therapies… [^114Sd8dg]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

Melanoma brain metastases are common, difficult to control, and have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of 16–22 weeks. 4–6Approximately 20% of patients have overt brain metastases at first diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, 7and nearly 50% of patients develop clinical evidence of brain metastases — a proportion that appears to be rising over time as the high frequency of brain metastases is recognized, and increasing percentages of patients are scanned for staging and prognostic purposes, even in the absence of symptoms.

Most patients had concordant results for brain and extracranial disease plus stable disease at 12 weeks following the initiation of therapy), most of the irRC outcomes were similar to the WHO responses, and the survival for patients in the steroid-free cohort was essentially the same as reported from other studies of ipilimumab in patients without active brain metastases. For patients with the V600E BRAFmutation, the median PFS was 16 weeks in both cohorts, and median OS was 33 and 31 weeks in cohorts A and B, respectively, which compares favorably with the only other large study of chemotherapy in a similar patient population with unknown BRAFmutation status and active melanoma brain metastases 2.

2, 3720 were evaluable for progression. 45Six progressed in the brain alone, six progressed at an extracranial site alone and eight progressed both in the brain and at extracranial sites. No patient progressed as a result of a new lesion alone, 9/20 progressed in existing lesions only, and 11/20 progressed as a result of existing and new lesions. Conclusion The treatment of patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain is an ideal example of the need for multidisciplinary team practice and research protocols to optimize and improve the outcome of patients with this life-limiting complication, especially in this disease that is rising in incidence in many parts of the world. From local therapies with surgery and radiotherapy to systemic agents with proven activity in brain metastases, the stage is set for finding the best and safest sequences and combinations.

### Incidence and characteristics of melanoma brain metastases developing during treatment with vemurafenib [^114Wk7T9]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Vemurafenib is indicated for the treatment of patients with BRAF (V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma. We studied for the first time the characteristics of brain metastases developed during treatment with vemurafenib in real-life conditions. We included all patients treated over 3 years with vemurafenib in our department for metastatic melanoma without initial brain involvement. Our primary endpoint was to assess the incidence of brain metastases in these patients. Our secondary endpoints were to identify the risk factors for metastases occurrence and their characteristics and course. In our retrospective cohort of 86 patients, 20% had developed brain metastases on average 5.3 months after vemurafenib initiation. The median follow-up was 9 months (1–26 months). Radiological examinations revealed multiple brain metastases in 41% of patients. The only risk factor for metastasis occurrence identified was a high number of metastatic sites when initiating vemurafenib (p = 0.045). Metastasis development was associated with a trend toward a decrease in overall survival from 12.8 to 8.5 months (p = 0.07) and a significant decrease in progression-free survival from 7 to 5 months (p = 0.04). Among the patients who developed brain metastases, 82% died, of whom 64% within 3 months, versus 58% of patients without brain metastases over the same period. The extra-cerebral disease was well controlled in 59% of patients during brain progression. In vemurafenib-treated melanoma patients, brain metastases are frequent and associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Because of their high frequency in patients with controlled extra-cerebral disease, brain explorations should be systematically performed during treatment.

### Melanoma brain metastases: an unmet challenge in the era of active therapy [^113pZ4p6]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Metastatic disease to the brain is a frequent manifestation of melanoma and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and poor prognosis. Surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery provide local control but less frequently affect the overall outcome of melanoma brain metastases (MBM). The role of systemic therapies for active brain lesions has been largely underinvestigated, and patients with active brain lesions are excluded from the vast majority of clinical trials. The advent of active systemic therapy has revolutionized the care of melanoma patients, but this benefit has not been systematically translated into intracranial activity. In this article, we review the biology and clinical outcomes of patients with MBM, and the evidence supporting the use of radiation, surgery, and systemic therapy in MBM. Prospective studies that included patients with active MBM have shown clinical intracranial activity that parallels systemic activity and support the inclusion of patients with active MBM in clinical trials involving novel agents and combination therapies.

### The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment does not adequately discriminate prognosis in a modern population with brain metastases from malignant melanoma [^111jNPnB]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

However, these scoring systems must be considered in the context of the changing landscape of melanoma treatment, resulting from the emergence of novel targeted agents. Inhibitors of BRAF kinase (vemurafenib, dabrafenib), MEK (trametinib, cobemetinib), and immune checkpoints (CTLA4 (ipilimumab) and PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) have all emerged as active agents in melanoma and may have intra-cerebral activity in some patients. The original derivation data set for the msGPA demonstrated good discrimination between prognostic groups using Kaplan–Meier (KM) methods. However, there was a selection bias towards fitter patients in that 76% of patients received SRS and no patient received best supportive care alone. Critically, the impact of predictive and prognostic biomarkers (e.g. BRAF/RAS mutation) and the use of newer targeted agents on survival were not explicitly considered in that study. Therefore, the current relevance of the msGPA to patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma is uncertain.

In addition, the msGPA has not yet been validated robustly in the published literature. The study byhighlights the importance of validating prognostic indices with particular reference to a model's discrimination and calibration. Ideally, validation should occur in an external cohort that differs in time, investigators and location with that of the derivation data set. Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate the msGPA in two temporally distinct UK cohorts, including patients treated before and after the emergence of new, highly active anti-melanoma therapies.

Incidence of Brain Metastases in Melanoma

Melanoma has the highest propensity of all common malignancies to metastasize to the brain, with 40% of advanced melanoma patients expected to have brain metastases at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease and up to 70% at the time of death.

Systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma has been revolutionized over the last decade with the development of multiple effective mutationally targeted and immune-based therapies. In clinical trials, these new regimens have increased the 1-year survival for metastatic melanoma patients without CNS involvement from 25% to over 80%, and responses lasting longer than 5 years are becoming commonplace. There is reason to hope that this progress will also extend to metastatic melanoma patients with CNS involvement. Indeed, in a recent review of a large, nonacademic database, Iorgulescu et al. reported markedly improved outcomes for patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain in the era of the new therapeutic landscape for this disease (data from 2010 to 2015). In this National Cancer Database, 36% of metastatic melanoma patients had brain metastases at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. This study highlighted the value of screening patients with advanced solid tumors at the time of diagnosis rather than imaging only upon the development of CNS symptoms. In addition, even with such short timeline after checkpoint inhibitors gained wide utilization in melanoma, there was a doubling of 4-year overall survival MBM patients who were treated with immune checkpoint blockade in the real world.

The brain is just another organ? Yes or no

Hussein A Tawbi: yes

Patients with brain metastases greatly outnumber those with primary brain tumors, with up to 30% of patients with metastatic cancer having brain metastases at some point. Brain metastases are also a strong prognostic indicator of very poor outcomes, with median survival of typically only 3–6 months.

In metastatic melanoma, brain metastases are an everyday problem in the clinic with 30%–40% of patients having brain metastases at the time of diagnosis, increasing to up to 60% during treatment and up to 80% at time of death. Historically, median survival of patients with melanoma has been approximately 8 months, with the presence of brain metastases reducing this to around 4 months. Recent advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy have resulted in greatly improved outcomes, with over 50% survival at 5 years. Pivotal phase III studies of these new agents have included almost 7000 patients with melanoma. However, patients with brain metastases were excluded from all these trials (figure 6). Reasons for this include their expected worse prognosis with immediate neurological deterioration, the belief that drugs are unable to penetrate the brain, and the assumption that that brain is not immunologically responsive. There is also the underlying supposition that brain metastases may be better treated with surgery and/or radiation.

### Predictive factors for the development of brain metastasis in advanced unresectable metastatic melanoma [^1151gU6R]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Melanoma that metastasizes to distant sites is associated with a grave prognosis. The objectives of the study were (1) to identify predictive factors for the development of brain metastases from the time of diagnosis of stage III/IV disease, (2) to identify predictive factors for the development of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma, and (3) to assess whether the incidence of brain metastasis is more frequent in patients who had no tumor response to systemic therapy for stage III/IV disease compared with those who had partial or complete response.

Patients and Methods

We collected and retrospectively analyzed information of 740 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center over 15 years. Three hundred and twenty-nine patients had CNS metastases. The characteristics of these patients in terms of median age, sex, primary site, Breslow thickness, stage at first visit, baseline serum parameters, and response to systemic therapy were compared with those of patients who did not develop CNS metastasis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the cause-specific hazard function for CNS metastasis and deaths without CNS metastasis.

Results

We identified that M-stage [stage M1b vs. stage III or M1a, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.64; stage M1c vs. stage III or M1a, HR = 2.13, P < 0.0001] and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) (elevated vs. normal LDH, HR = 1.51, P < 0.001) at diagnosis of unresectable stage III/IV disease can independently predict the risk of developing CNS metastasis from the time of diagnosis of stage III/IV disease. Older age (HR = 1.01, P = 0.076), chemoresistance (stable disease+progressive disease vs. complete response+partial response HR = 2.91, P < 0.0001), low level of albumin (vs. normal HR = 2.87, P < 0.0001), elevated LDH (vs. normal HR = 1.55, P = 0.0004), and M-stage (M1c disease vs. stage III or M1a HR = 1.89, P < 0.0001) can independently predict shorter time to death without CNS metastasis from the diagnosis of stage III/IV disease. The location (head and neck vs. limbs HR = 1.56, P = 0.028; trunk and abdomen vs. limbs HR = 1.45, P = 0.029; unknown site vs. limbs HR = 8.43, P = 0.036) and pathology [Clark level (CL) = 3 and/or BR2 to 4 mm vs. CL ≤ 2 and/or BR < 2 mm HR = 1.60, P = 0.037; CL > 3 and/or BR > 4 mm vs. CL ≤ 2 and/or BR < 2 mm HR = 2.03, P = 0.001) of the primary melanoma can independently predict CNS metastasis-free interval from the time of diagnosis of primaries. Age (HR = 1.012, P = 0.034) and pathology of the primary melanoma (CL > 3 and/or BR > 4 mm vs. CL ≤ 2 and/or BR < 2 mm HR = 1.54, P = 0.024) can independently predict time to death without CNS metastasis from primaries.

Conclusion

We identified the predictive factors associated with the development of CNS metastasis in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma.

### Improved survival and prognostication in melanoma patients with brain metastases: an update of the melanoma graded prognostic assessment [^1137ccPb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Survival for patients with melanoma has recently improved. The propensity of melanoma to metastasize to the brain remains a common and serious feature of this disease. The purposes of this study were to evaluate prognostic factors for patients with newly diagnosed melanoma brain metastases (MBMs) in a large cohort treated with modern multimodal therapies, compare those results with those in prior eras, and update the Melanoma Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA).

Methods

Univariable and multivariable (MVA) analyses of prognostic factors and treatments associated with survival were performed on 1,796 patients with newly diagnosed MBM treated between January 01, 2015, and December 31, 2021, using a multi-institutional retrospective database. Multiple imputation was used to address missingness of potential predictors. Significant variables in combined MVA were used to update the Melanoma GPA. Comparisons were made with legacy cohorts.

Results

Median survivals for cohorts A (1985–2007, n = 481), B (2006–2015, n = 823), and C (2015–2021, n = 1,796) were 6.7, 9.8, and 16.6 months and median follow-up times were 40.1, 43.6, and 48.8 months, respectively. In combined MVA, significant prognostic factors for survival were higher Karnofsky Performance Status, fewer MBMs, absence of extracranial metastases, lower serum lactate dehydrogenase, and no immunotherapy before MBM. These factors were incorporated into the updated Melanoma GPA. The combined median and 3-year survivals for patients with GPA 0–1, 1.5–2, and 2.5–4.0 were 5.4, 13.2, and 43.2 months and 12.4%, 28.8%, and 51.6%, respectively.

Conclusion

Prognostic factors have changed and survival has improved for patients with MBM but varies widely by GPA. The updated Melanoma GPA calculator (BrainMetGPA), available free online, can be used to estimate survival, individualize treatment, stratify clinical trials, guide surveillance, and augment clinical trial eligibility. Multidisciplinary treatment is essential. Trials are needed to elucidate the optimal sequencing of various therapeutic modalities.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^113y2RNP]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Melanoma — stage IIB–IV surveillance and imaging — For patients with stage IIB-IV melanoma, a comprehensive H&P should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 2 years; then every 3 to 12 months for 3 years; and annually thereafter, as clinically indicated. Surveillance interval should be tailored to substage and based on assessment of risk factors for recurrence, and in the absence of meaningful data on improved long-term outcome for stage IIB-IIC, the recommendations remain controversial. Periodic surveillance CNS imaging for 3 years might avert morbidity in stage IIIC patients, but brain MRI surveillance beyond three years has low yield and is less likely to be useful. Although not recommended at baseline, surveillance chest x-ray, CT, brain MRI, and/or PET/CT every 3 to 12 months could be considered to screen for recurrent disease at the discretion of the physician (category 2B), and because most recurrences manifest within the first 3 years, routine imaging to screen for asymptomatic recurrence is not recommended beyond 3 to 5 years. Prior brain metastases increase risk of new brain metastases; therefore more frequent surveillance with brain MRI is recommended for these patients.

### Metastatic melanoma: prognostic factors and survival in patients with brain metastases [^116ZPC9K]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study has provided evidence to validate the use of the msGPA in the modern patient population, with its access to novel treatments. The system provides clinicians with an indication of prognosis and may aid patient centered treatment discussions. We have demonstrated that BRAF positive patients receiving targeted treatment have significantly better survival than their BRAF negative counterparts. We were able to evidence the efficacy of SRS in the local treatment of brain metastases irrespective of BRAF status. By contrast, the suitability of WBRT as a stand-alone management option has been called in to question. Patients unsuitable for SRS who therefore received WBRT had a very poor outcome.

Conclusions

This single-center retrospective study shows a significant survival benefit of radical MBM management even in the setting of advanced systemic disease with the use of SACT. Patient selection is a crucial component of the management, and the regional MDT therefore plays a significant role in determining who would be eligible for surgery/SRS and SACT. Multicenter trials are required to confirm these drawn conclusions.

### The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment does not adequately discriminate prognosis in a modern population with brain metastases from malignant melanoma [^112vbkG7]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment (msGPA) assigns patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma to 1 of 4 prognostic groups. It was largely derived using clinical data from patients treated in the era that preceded the development of newer therapies such as BRAF, MEK and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, its current relevance to patients diagnosed with brain metastases from malignant melanoma is unclear. This study is an external validation of the msGPA in two temporally distinct British populations.

Methods

Performance of the msGPA was assessed in Cohort I (1997–2008, n = 231) and Cohort II (2008–2013, n = 162) using Kaplan-Meier methods and Harrell's c-index of concordance. Cox regression was used to explore additional factors that may have prognostic relevance.

Results

The msGPA does not perform well as a prognostic score outside of the derivation cohort, with suboptimal statistical calibration and discrimination, particularly in those patients with an intermediate prognosis. Extra-cerebral metastases, leptomeningeal disease, age and potential use of novel targeted agents after brain metastases are diagnosed, should be incorporated into future prognostic models.

Conclusions

An improved prognostic score is required to underpin high-quality randomised controlled trials in an area with a wide disparity in clinical care.

Estimation of Prognosis

A key component of BM management is an accurate estimation of prognosis, as this can guide the decision for aggressive care options versus best supportive care. The presence of BMs is usually a sign portending poor prognosis. Historically, the prognosis was estimated based on a landmark recursive partitioning analysis study that pooled patients from 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials utilizing several prognostic factors: age, KPS, and presence of extracranial disease. Over time, it was recognized that additional factors may play a role in improving prognostic assessment for patients and an additional GPA was derived from 4 RTOG trials. This analysis continues to accrue patients from multiple institutions in the United States and has since lead to the creation of the disease-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA). The DS-GPA now includes multiple factors including age, KPS, presence of extracranial disease, number of brain lesions and for lung, breast, and melanoma utilizes molecular markers. The scoring system is based on a range of 0–4.0. Although survival estimates vary by histology, approximate ranges of estimated medial survival time with 0–1 corresponding to not more than 3 months, 2–2.5 corresponding to 6 months, and 3.5–4 corresponding to more than 1 year. This scoring system is a discriminating diagnostic tool to guide treatment discussions with patients and can be found at brainmetgpa.com. Importantly, the ability to identify patients likely to survive more than 6 months can help to guide aggressive brain-directed therapy decisions, while patients with an estimated survival of less than 3 months may benefit from supportive care measures alone.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^111rETVV]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most common causes of cerebral metastasis. Large clinical series show that brain metastases are diagnosed in up to 10% of melanoma patients during their lifetime and autopsy data show that up to 73% of patients who die from disseminated cutaneous melanoma have brain involvement. Cerebral metastasis is a very distressing event in the natural course of melanoma because it carries the worst prognosis of all visceral metastases and represents a major cause of death in patients with disseminated disease.

Current management of cerebral metastasis depends largely on the number and the size of lesions and on the extracranial extension of metastatic disease. It involves neurosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and chemotherapy. Neurosurgery is usually offered to patients with single or a few metastatic lesions, provided that brain metastases are surgically accessible and that the patient can tolerate the operation. Stereotactic radiosurgery is offered as an alternative to direct neurosurgery in patients with a few brain metastases, which cannot be surgically removed and WBRT is used in conjuction with the neurosurgery or SRS because it is associated with better local control. Such intervention can provide effective palliation and prolong life significantly. Patients not eligible for surgery or SRS are usually offered WBRT alone or combined with chemotherapy depending on the presence of active systemic disease. Those with poor Karnofsky performance score (KPS) may be managed with steroids and other supportive measures. Generally accepted standards for the application of different treatment modalities in patients with brain metastases from melanoma do not exist so far.

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse prognostic factors, effects of treatment and survival outcome of relatively non-selected patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain to identify meaningful prognostic groups with respect to overall survival.

### Metastatic melanoma: prognostic factors and survival in patients with brain metastases [^112y2AFM]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

In total, N = 53 patients were eligible for analysis following exclusion of BRAF-mutant positive patients who did not receive targeted inhibition. For survival analysis according to BRAF status, a further five patients were excluded due to unknown BRAF status. Basic demographic and clinical covariate data is shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Patient demographics

Median OS from diagnosis of brain metastases to death was 4.83 months (range 0.27–30.4 months). BRAF-mutant positive patients had significantly better survival times than the BRAF-mutant negative group, at 8.23 month median OS (95% CI 3.62–12.84) and 3.7 months (95% CI 2.78–4.62) respectively (p = 0.0039) from the time of diagnosis of brain metastases (Fig. 1). N = 17 (32%) patients were receiving either immunotherapy or BRAF inhibition at the time of their brain metastases diagnosis. The median number of cycles of systemic treatment until development of brain metastases was 5 (range = 1–21). N = 6 patients (35%) continued on the same systemic treatment after their brain metastases were diagnosed. The remainder were switched to an alternative.

Fig. 1
Overall survival from date of brain metastases diagnosis according to BRAF status. Better survival (p = 0.0039) in the BRAF-positive treated subgroup (n = 25), with a median OS of 8.23 months (95% CI 3.62–12.84) in comparison to 3.7 months (95% CI 2.78–4.62) for the BRAF-negative patients (n = 22)

SRS was often given in combination with other treatments such as surgery and immunotherapy. N = 14 (26%) patients were treated with SRS for their brain metastases, either initially (n = 9) or on progression (n = 5). N = 10 (71%) patients demonstrated response to this treatment on radiological follow up. Equal numbers of BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative patients showed response rates to SRS. The remaining patients showed either brain progression or died before follow up. The majority of patients treated with WBRT alone died within 2 months of treatment, so radiological follow up was not available to assess treatment responses.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^114tfEhF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and central nervous system (CNS) imaging show stage-dependent performance and selective impact on management. Most investigators have described very low yield and poor sensitivity in detecting metastatic disease in patients with clinically localized melanoma, whereas in patients with stage III disease, PET/CT scan may be more useful. A systematic review documented PET sensitivity ranging from 68% to 87% and specificity ranging from 92% to 98% for stage III and IV melanoma, compared to sensitivity ranging from 0% to 67% and specificity ranging from 77% to 100% for stage I and II melanoma; another large meta-analysis suggested that PET/CT was superior over CT in detecting distant metastases. In stage III or IV melanoma, additional information from PET/CT may impact treatment decisions in up to 30% of patients, with the greatest impact seen in surgical management. For the CNS, early detection and treatment of subclinical metastases is important because clinically symptomatic CNS metastases are associated with significant morbidity and poor survival, and outcomes after treatment are markedly better in patients with lower CNS tumor burden and/or asymptomatic metastases; although CNS recurrence is rare in stage I–IIIB melanoma (≤ 5%), stage IIIC disease has an appreciable risk (> 11%), and although the yield of baseline CNS imaging may be low, it may be useful for comparison with follow-up scans in patients at risk of CNS recurrence.

### Brain metastasis from melanoma: the prognostic value of varying sites of extracranial disease [^1145jYft]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with brain metastasis from melanoma have poor outcomes. Radiation is used both for prognostic and symptomatic value. We aimed to further clarify the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) as well as the prognostic implication of various sites of extracranial disease. The records of 73 consecutive patients treated at the University of Rochester Medical Center for brain-metastatic melanoma from January 2004 to October 2013 were reviewed. The median overall survival (OS) was 3.0 months. Patients treated with WBRT alone had decreased OS compared to those treated with SRS alone (HR = 0.38, p = 0.001) or WBRT and SRS (HR = 0.51, p = 0.039). The mean number of brain metastasis differed (p = 0.002) in patients in patients who received WBRT (4.0) compared to those who did not (2.0). Among patients with extracranial disease (n = 63), bone metastasis (HR = 1.86, p = 0.047, n = 15) was a negative prognostic factor; liver (HR = 1.59, p = 0.113, n = 17), lung (HR = 1.51, p = 0.23, n = 51) and adrenal metastasis (HR = 1.70, p = 0.15, n = 10) were not. In patients with concurrent brain and lung metastasis, those with disease limited to those two sites (OS = 8.7 mo, n = 13) had improved OS (HR = 0.44, p = 0.014) compared to those with additional disease (OS = 1.8 mo, n = 50). Based on this hypothesis-generating retrospective analysis, SRS may offer survival benefit compared to WBRT alone in patients with brain metastatic melanoma. Bone metastasis appears to confer a particularly poor prognosis. Those with disease confined to the lung and brain may represent a population with improved prognosis.

### Efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma and brain metastases [^113JZRJB]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with melanoma brain metastases have a poor prognosis and historically have been excluded from clinical trials. The Expanded Access Program (EAP) provided an opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses) in patients with stage 3 (unresectable) or 4 melanoma and asymptomatic brain metastases, who had failed or did not tolerate previous treatments and had no other therapeutic option available. Tumor assessments were conducted at baseline and week 12 using immune-related response criteria and patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs). Of 855 patients participating in the EAP in Italy, 146 had asymptomatic brain metastases. With a median follow-up of 4 months, the global disease control rate was 27%, including 4 patients with a complete response and 13 with a partial response. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.8 and 4.3 months, respectively and approximately one-fifth of patients were alive 1 year after starting ipilimumab. In total, 29% of patients reported a treatment-related AE of any grade, which were grade 3/4 in 6% of patients. AEs were generally reversible with treatment as per protocol-specific guidelines. Ipilimumab shows durable benefits in some patients with advanced melanoma metastatic to the brain, with safety results consistent with those previously reported in clinical trials.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^117UuBKC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN melanoma — principles of brain metastases management (brain-directed therapy) states that surgery is the preferred option for large, symptomatic lesions or single lesions in resectable areas, and postoperative radiation to the resection cavity may be considered to decrease the risk of local recurrence; adjuvant whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is not recommended after resection for melanoma brain metastases. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the preferred radiation modality for melanoma brain metastases and can be delivered to multiple lesions; large lesions should be treated with fractionated SRS (3–5 fractions) to decrease the risk of radionecrosis, and adjuvant WBRT is not recommended after SRS/SRT. Palliative WBRT is only recommended when SRS/SRT is not feasible in patients with good performance status for whom disease has progressed, as WBRT delivers a lower dose to metastases and is associated with lower local control and increased risk of late neurocognitive impairment; for patients receiving WBRT, HA and memantine should be considered to reduce neurocognitive toxicity in eligible patients. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Adjuvant WBRT Following Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)

Similar to adjuvant WBRT following brain metastases resection, adjuvant WBRT following SRS appears to increase local control of treated lesions, decrease new sites of brain metastases, and decrease the need for salvage SRS or WBRT. However, adjuvant WBRT following SRS has not been shown to improve overall survival.

A phase III trial investigated the role of WBRT after SRS or neurosurgery for one to three brain metastases. The 359 patients with brain metastases (18 melanoma patients) who had undergone surgery (n = 160) or SRS (n = 199) were randomized to no further intervention or WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions). The addition of WBRT to the post-surgical management reduced the 2-year relapse rate both at the initially treated sites and at other sites in the brain. Although no improvement in overall survival was found, this phase III trial demonstrated that adjuvant WBRT lowered the number of neurologic deaths. This stresses the importance of appropriate patient selection. A subgroup of patients with multiple MBM and high risk to die from neurological causes might benefit from adjuvant WBRT. This subgroup has to be characterized more deeply.

Conclusions on Local Therapy

In summary, patient selection plays a key role in successful local therapy. The best candidates for neurosurgical resection of brain metastases are patients with a very limited number of superficial metastases in non-eloquent areas of the brain and adequate condition to undergo surgery. This is especially the case when fast symptom relief is needed, and patients do not have a history of primary tumors. Patients suitable for SRS may have up to ten metastases with a total cumulative volume ≤ 15 mL. The role of (adjuvant) WBRT after surgery or SRS has been questioned. It seems to be a treatment option when patients have a high risk to die from neurological causes; however, the potentially detrimental effects on neurocognitive function and quality of life should be considered.

### Multiplicity does not significantly affect outcomes in brain metastasis patients treated with surgery [^112JQ1yP]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Multiplicity does not affect survival time or local failure.
High postoperative functional status correlates with prolonged survival.
Preoperative volume of the resected lesion influences patient survival.

Importance of the Study

Multiplicity is considered a negative prognostic factor for patients with brain metastases. There is no consensus regarding surgical management of patients with more than one intracranial metastasis. We retrospectively reviewed our single-center experience and discovered that multiplicity at the time of surgical intervention did not affect overall survival, progression free survival, or the rate of local failure. On the other hand, higher postoperative functional status correlated with longer survival, highlighting the importance of neurological function preservation. A survival benefit was identified in patients who underwent resection of large intracranial metastases. We advocate for resection of large intracranial metastases in carefully selected patients, regardless of the total number of lesions discovered at the time of diagnosis.

Brain metastases are the most common adult intracranial neoplasm, comprising more than 30% of all brain tumors. They occur in 10–30% of cancer patients, with an increasing incidence in recent decades due to advances in cancer treatment and more widespread brain imaging. Most brain metastases develop from lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, with more than 5% of cases being secondary to a primary tumor of unknown origin. Patients may present with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure including headache, nausea, and vomiting, or neurological deficits including paresis, seizures, or cognitive changes which may significantly affect quality of life.

Brain metastases are associated with a limited life expectancy, with almost half of these patients dying from advanced systemic cancer. The primary goal of treatment is to control both local and widespread metastatic disease progression, while maintaining or improving quality of life. This may be achieved via a combination of multiple treatment modalities including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and more recently targeted and immune therapies. Recent advances in targeted systemic therapies and immunotherapy, combined with a more aggressive multidisciplinary management strategy, have allowed better symptom control and increased OS for patients with brain metastases.

The treatment of multiple brain metastases (MBM) from melanoma is controversial and includes surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Several new classes of agents have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, allowing some subsets of patients to have long-term survival. Given this, management of MBM from melanoma is continually evolving.

Objective

To review the current evidence regarding the treatment of MBM from melanoma.

Evidence Review

The PubMed database was searched using combinations of search terms and synonyms for melanoma, brain metastases, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy published between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2015. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of targeted keyword searches, manual review of bibliographies, and whether the article was a clinical trial, large observational study, or retrospective study focusing on melanoma brain metastases. Of 2243 articles initially identified, 110 were selected for full review. Of these, the most pertinent 73 articles were included.

Findings

Patients with newly diagnosed MBM can be treated with various modalities, either alone or in combination. Level 1 evidence supports the use of SRS alone, WBRT, and SRS with WBRT. Although the addition of WBRT to SRS improves the overall brain relapse rate, WBRT has no significant impact on overall survival and has detrimental neurocognitive outcomes. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has largely been ineffective; targeted therapies and immunotherapies have been reported to have high response rates and deserve further attention in larger clinical trials. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of these novel regimens in combination with radiation therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

At this time, the standard management for patients with MBM from melanoma includes SRS, WBRT, or a combination of both. Emerging data exist to support the notion that SRS in combination with targeted therapies or immune therapy may obviate the need for WBRT; prospective studies are required to fully evaluate the efficacy of these novel regimens in combination with radiation therapy.

### Incidence and prognosis of patients with brain metastases at diagnosis of systemic malignancy: a population-based study [^116KUv7K]. Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Brain metastases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Population-level data describing the incidence and prognosis of patients with brain metastases are lacking. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence and prognosis of patients with brain metastases at diagnosis of systemic malignancy using recently released data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.

Methods

We identified 1302166 patients with diagnoses of nonhematologic malignancies originating outside of the CNS between 2010 and 2013 and described the incidence proportion and survival of patients with brain metastases.

Results

We identified 26430 patients with brain metastases at diagnosis of cancer. Patients with small cell and non-small cell lung cancer displayed the highest rates of identified brain metastases at diagnosis; among patients presenting with metastatic disease, patients with melanoma (28.2%), lung adenocarcinoma (26.8%), non-small cell lung cancer not otherwise specified/other lung cancer (25.6%), small cell lung cancer (23.5%), squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (15.9%), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (15.5%), and renal cancer (10.8%) had an incidence proportion of identified brain metastases of > 10%. Patients with brain metastases secondary to prostate cancer, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and breast cancer displayed the longest median survival (12.0, 10.0, and 10.0 months, respectively).

Conclusions

In this study we provide generalizable estimates of the incidence and prognosis for patients with brain metastases at diagnosis of a systemic malignancy. These data may allow for appropriate utilization of brain-directed imaging as screening for subpopulations with cancer and have implications for clinical trial design and counseling of patients regarding prognosis.

### Management of metastatic melanoma patients with brain metastases [^115s1dtj]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Brain metastases seem to be an almost inevitable complication in patients with metastatic melanoma. Except for the rare patients who can undergo successful surgical resection of brain metastases, current management strategies do not appear adequate and result in a poor outcome (median survival, 2–4 months). In recent small series, stereotactic radiosurgery or gamma-knife treatment has suggested improvement in local control compared with whole brain radiation therapy. We have recently shown prolonged survival (11.1 months) using a multimodality treatment approach in 44 sequential patients with melanoma brain metastases. A subsequent study demonstrated that the outcome of biochemotherapy for metastatic melanoma is not affected by the presence or absence of brain metastases. Our results suggest that the outcome of patients with melanoma brain metastases can be improved using a multidisciplinary management strategy.

### Nonsurgical management of melanoma brain metastasis: current therapeutics, challenges, and strategies for progress… [^112CRVKn]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction to Melanoma Brain Metastasis Epidemiology and Risk Factors Historical case series have shown that up to 44% of patients with advanced melanoma develop brain metastases, with a median overall survival after diagnosis of approximately 4 to 5 months. 29–35A median OS of 33. 1 weeks and a median progression-free survival of
16. 1 weeks were seen in the entire cohort. The V600K mutation bearers had a slightly less favorable outcome, with a median OS of 16. 3 weeks in those without prior CNS treatment and
21. 9 weeks for those who had received prior CNS treatment. In contrast, cohort B, which included 18 patients with symptomatic CNS disease and/or requiring steroids, had an intracranial clinical benefit rate of 22. 2%. These patients had received a median of one dose of combination immunotherapy; the OS and median intracranial progression-free survival were 8. 7 months and

1. 2 months, respectively.

Taken together, these updated results show durable responses in 55% of patients with asymptomatic CNS disease treated with combination ipilimumab/nivolumab and showed that patients with symptomatic CNS disease and/or steroid dependence are less likely to benefit.
53. Combination therapy heralds a higher rate of immune-related toxicity, with grade 3 or 4 toxicity in 55% of patients in CheckMate 204 and a 20% discontinuation rate in this group. Similarly, 54% of patients in the combination arm of the ABC trial experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity. In the prior single-agent immunotherapy trials, the most common grade 3 toxicities noted were diarrhea and fatigue. Single-agent anti–PD-1 trials have shown approximately 10% to 15% grade 3 or 4 adverse events.

A prospective, randomized controlled study of 58 patients, of whom 30 received SRS alone and 28 received SRS plus WBRT, aimed at studying neurocognitive risk in CNS metastasis and showed high probability that patients who received both modalities were at a much higher risk of learning and memory function decline. This finding led to the early discontinuation of the trial; however, 73% of those who had received both modalities were CNS recurrence free at 1 year compared with 27% in the SRS-alone group.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^116ka86h]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

In our sample, more than half of the patients had less than three brain metastases with 40% having single brain metastasis. Similar results have been reported by. Fine et al reported a much lower rate of single brain metastasis (23%). However, in their study the rate of unknown cases was 50% that makes a valid comparison difficult. In addition, the majority of our patients were asymptomatic and diagnosed by brain scans performed during regular surveillance according to national German guidelines. This approach is different compared with other countries such as the United Kingdom or the United States where scans are only performed in case of cerebral symptoms.

We found that a significant number of patients (17%) presented without evidence of extracranial disease, whereas another 17% had single organ extracranial involvement. These rates are much lower compared with those reported by Sampson et al that might be explained by selection of patients with more favourable prognostic features to be referred to a neurosurgical department or by underestimation of the true number of metastasis by early generation CT or MRI as it was postulated by the investigators. In any case, a significant proportion of patients with brain metastasis from melanoma, exceeding one-third of the total in our sample, could be considered candidates for local treatment with neurosurgery or SRS. The survival rates of these patients are comparable with those reported for patients with stage IV melanoma. This is a very interesting finding, which argues against the general exclusion of patients with brain metastases from large clinical studies in melanoma, particularly in view of current evidence suggesting that chemotherapy, which is active against extracranial metastasis may also be effective against brain metastasis.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of adults with metastatic brain tumors: executive summary [^111mHqdN]. Neurosurgery (2019). High credibility.

Metastatic brain tumors epidemiology in the United States encompasses prevalence, incidence, primary sites, and temporal trends. The prevalence of new brain metastases in the United States is between 7and 14 persons per 100,000 based on population studies. The expected incidence of newly diagnosed patients with brain metastases is estimated to be between 21,651 and 43,301 annually. Metastases from lung, breast, and melanoma primary tumors make up the bulk of the lesions identified. Between 1983 and 2009, Nieder et al. reported a decline in the incidence of lung cancer brain metastases, an increase in the incidence of melanoma, colorectal, and kidney brain metastases, and relative stability in the incidence of breast cancer brain metastases cases.

### Survival over 6 years in a patient with brain metastases from melanoma treated with temozolomide [^115A8c1a]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Cerebral metastases from melanoma are generally associated with a dismal prognosis with survival ranging from 3 to 6 months after treatment. Systemic chemotherapy for these patients has limited effect and evidence for an overall survival benefit from randomised controlled trials is lacking. We report on a 59-year-old patient with a history of malignant melanoma who presented with multiple cerebral metastases after previous surgery and combined whole brain and stereotactic radiotherapy. She has been in sustained remission and in excellent clinical condition after treatment with continued cycles of oral temozolomide for more than 6 years. To our knowledge, similar prolonged survival has been described only once in patients with multiple cerebral metastases from melanoma. This case demonstrates that temozolomide for metastatic central nervous system (CNS) disease in melanoma patients may be highly effective without CNS toxicity.

### Role of radiation therapy as immune activator in the era of modern immunotherapy for metastatic malignant melanoma [^116V6VtA]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Metastatic melanoma is difficult to treat, and often portends a grim prognosis. For patients with cerebral metastases, the prognosis is even more dire. Systemic immunotherapy and targeted agents are emerging as the mainstay of treatment for metastatic melanoma. Although immunotherapy has been shown to prolong relapse-free survival and long-term control of micrometastatic disease, the response rate is suboptimal, prompting the need to optimize and improve therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that in addition to effective locoregional control, radiation therapy (RT) may induce immune activation and expansion of T lymphocytes recognizing melanocyte-specific antigens including activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes that can potentially kill melanoma cells. In some cases, RT contributes to the clearance of metastatic disease in distant, nonirradiated regions, a bystander phenomenon called the abscopal effect. Here, we evaluate the potential promise of ablative radiation treatment in the era of modern immunotherapy by presenting a patient with metastatic melanoma who remained disease free for over 3 years after an initial diagnosis of advanced metastatic melanoma with brain, subcutaneous tissue, mesenteric, pelvic, and retroperitoneal involvement. The patient failed initial stereotactic radiosurgery, but responded to whole-brain RT in combination with interleukin-2 immunotherapy. Thus, combination RT with immunotherapy may be synergistic by promoting the release and processing of melanoma antigens that can be presented by dendritic cells. This in turn may augment the response to therapies that center on expansion and/or activation of antitumor T cells.

### Diagnosis-specific prognostic factors, indexes, and treatment outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases: a multi-institutional analysis of 4, 259 patients [^115YUahX]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Controversy endures regarding the optimal treatment of patients with brain metastases (BMs). Debate persists, despite many randomized trials, perhaps because BM patients are a heterogeneous population. The purpose of the present study was to identify significant diagnosis-specific prognostic factors and indexes (Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment [DS-GPA]).

Methods and Materials

A retrospective database of 5,067 patients treated for BMs between 1985 and 2007 was generated from 11 institutions. After exclusion of the patients with recurrent BMs or incomplete data, 4,259 patients with newly diagnosed BMs remained eligible for analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors and outcomes by primary site and treatment were performed. The significant prognostic factors were determined and used to define the DS-GPA prognostic indexes. The DS-GPA scores were calculated and correlated with the outcomes, stratified by diagnosis and treatment.

Results

The significant prognostic factors varied by diagnosis. For non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer, the significant prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance status, age, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of BMs, confirming the original GPA for these diagnoses. For melanoma and renal cell cancer, the significant prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance status and the number of BMs. For breast and gastrointestinal cancer, the only significant prognostic factor was the Karnofsky performance status. Two new DS-GPA indexes were thus designed for breast/gastrointestinal cancer and melanoma/renal cell carcinoma. The median survival by GPA score, diagnosis, and treatment were determined.

Conclusion

The prognostic factors for BM patients varied by diagnosis. The original GPA was confirmed for non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. New DS-GPA indexes were determined for other histologic types and correlated with the outcome, and statistical separation between the groups was confirmed. These data should be considered in the design of future randomized trials and in clinical decision-making.

### A multidisciplinary management algorithm for brain metastases [^112tDwKi]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of brain metastases continues to increase with improved systemic disease control leading to improved survival, with estimation in the literature ranging from 9% to 17%. The most common primary tumors to metastasize to the brain are breast, lung, and melanoma. Prognosis varies greatly and multiple prognostic scoring systems have been described, with all finding the most prognostic value in baseline performance status and extracranial control of disease. Current management paradigms focus on achieving local control with a combination of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and surgical resection.

WBRT was first described in an autopsy series of metastatic breast cancer to the central nervous system (CNS) in the 1930s and in the 1950s for the treatment of symptomatic brain metastases in patients with poorly controlled malignancies and has been a mainstay of treatment since. As its name implies, the radiation dose is delivered to the entire brain. This regional treatment can address symptomatic and asymptomatic macroscopic brain metastases, and microscopic metastatic disease simultaneously, and can transiently reverse neurologic deficits if tumors regress. WBRT is typically prescribed with a dose of 30 Gray (Gy) delivered over 10 sessions. Various trials of different dosing and scheduling showed no significant advantage compared to this standard treatment. In comparison to WBRT, SRS delivers a focused dose of radiation to a specific lesion, typically in limited sessions. While an upper limit of 2.5–3 cm tumor size is typically utilized in randomized trials, often larger tumors are treated with radiosurgery. In general, both therapies provide effective local control as monotherapy and distal brain failure can be reduced for selected histologies with the addition of WBRT.

### The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment does not adequately discriminate prognosis in a modern population with brain metastases from malignant melanoma [^1145Ftmc]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Differences in the routine surveillance of metastatic melanoma between the UK and the US may be a further reason why calibration of the msGPA was poor. In the UK, surveillance for high risk stage III patients includes a brain scan, whereas for patients with stage IV disease brain scans are usually only carried out in response to neurological symptoms or prior to trial entry. In contrast, in the US, routine surveillance for stage IV patients often includes a brain scan. Brain metastases may, therefore, be detected earlier in the natural course of the disease when the patient has no or minimal symptoms and smaller metastases, meaning that aggressive local treatment may be more feasible and more likely to be effective.

While Cohort I and the original data set ofhad good discriminatory ability between groups, the msGPA performed less well in Cohort II, particularly in patients with an intermediate prognosis (msGPA groups 2 and 3). The time frame and patients included in Cohort II are more relevant to current practice. In addition, patients with an intermediate prognosis are particularly in need of an efficient prognostic index to guide selection for locally aggressive treatments such as SRS or neurosurgery.

No significant differences in survival were seen between patients with wild-type vs mutant BRAF. Twenty-one of 42 patients (50%) with a BRAF mutation did not receive a BRAF inhibitor after diagnosis of brain metastases, usually because it had been given prior to development of radiologically visible brain metastases. Patients with BRAF mutant tumours who did not receive a BRAF inhibitor after the diagnosis of brain metastasis had a significantly worse prognosis than those who did receive such treatment. This finding is intriguing and certainly warrants further analysis in prospective studies of BRAF inhibition in the context of intra-cerebral disease.

Exposure to novel agents predicted for improved survival in the multivariate analysis, which accounted for KPS, number of brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease and extra-cerebral metastases. The intra-cerebral radiological responses seen suggest that such novel agents may exert their effects both inside and outside of the brain. A possible interpretation of these data is that patients with a future opportunity for targeted agents and newly diagnosed brain metastases might be particularly appropriate for more aggressive treatment of intra-cerebral disease. However, despite considerable progress in predicting which patients will respond to novel agents, at present it remains difficult to reliably and reproducibly predict outcomes and further biomarkers of response are needed.

### Melanoma brain metastases have lower T-cell content and microvessel density compared to matched extracranial metastases [^112QA9aE]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Melanoma is the deadliest cutaneous malignancy and the incidence is rising. Approximately 91,000 new cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2018. The 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic melanoma was historically less than 20%, however clinical outcomes have improved since the approval of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) which now form the foundation of treatment.

A major challenge in the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is the development of brain metastases, which cause significant morbidity and mortality and occur in up to 40% of patients, with an even higher percentage reported in autopsy series. MBM are typically managed with local therapy including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgical resection depending on the size and number of lesions and presence of neurologic deficits. While local therapy is effective in the control of MBM, it does not impact extracranial disease or other areas of the brain and can be associated with neurologic complications including radionecrosis. Both pembrolizumab and combination ipilimumab and nivolumab have clinical activity against asymptomatic, untreated MBM and have emerged as promising systemic therapy approaches for a select group of MBM patients.

PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) content have been associated with response to ICI in extracerebral disease. However, intracranial melanoma metastases are rarely available for analysis, and little is known about how they are similar or different to extracerebral metastases. Moreover, MBMs are sometimes hemorrhagic, a quality that is rarely seen in other sites with the exception of bowel metastases. As MBM treatment paradigms are shifting and less surgery is performed, human MBM tissue remains a valuable but dwindling resource to identify biologic properties of MBM that may differ from extracerebral metastases to rationally inform new treatment strategies. Prognostic and predictive tissue-based biomarkers have been particularly difficult to define for melanoma because of limited access to pre- and post-treatment tissue and due to the technical intricacies of assessing multiple variables in the tumor microenvironment in a simultaneous and standardized manner.

### Metastatic melanoma: prognostic factors and survival in patients with brain metastases [^112DFVhh]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective study confirms the overall poor prognosis of patients with brain metastases from melanoma. However, it highlights certain treatment options that may be helpful such as BRAF inhibitors in BRAF mutated melanoma and SRS alone or combined with systemic treatment for suitable patients. The ability of the msGPA to accurately discriminate prognostic groupings, and thus its suitability for continued use in a modern population with access to novel treatments, is confirmed. And importantly we recommend that if WBRT alone is the only treatment option available for a particular patient this should be offered only after careful consideration and discussion with the patient as there is a very poor outlook in this group of patients.

We report a median OS from brain metastases diagnosis of 4.83 months. This is comparable other reports in the literature. Patients in our cohort were almost equally distributed between mutant-positive (n = 25) and mutant-negative (n = 22) categories. This proportion is higher than commonly quoted in the literature, where BRAF mutant-positive melanomas are reported to comprise around 40% of the total melanoma population. This adds weight to the growing evidence base demonstrating that BRAF-positive melanoma patients are at increased risk of development of brain metastases.

In our series the BRAF-mutant positive patients had significantly better survival times than the BRAF-mutant negative group, at 8.23 month median OS (95% CI 3.62–12.84) and 3.7 months (95% CI 2.78–4.62) respectively (p = 0.0039) from the time of diagnosis of brain metastases. This is due to the benefit of BRAF inhibitors as a treatment for brain metastases in BRAF mutation positive melanoma. The OS of our group of BRAF positive patients compares favorably to those treated in the original BREAK-MB trial, which documented survival times of up to 7.7 months. Thus we provide evidence to support the efficacy of targeted therapies in producing improved survival outcomes in 'real life' BRAF-positive patients. BRAF status was an independent predictor of survival in univariate analysis, in concordance with previous documentation in the literature. It may have potential to be incorporated into prognostic modelling for brain metastases.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^113f2zLr]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

From October 1986 until March 2003, 265 cutaneous melanoma patients were diagnosed with cerebral metastasis in the University Medical Center of Tuebingen in Southern Germany. Systemic screening and staging algorithms according to valid national surveillance guidelines were used. These algorithms consider the individual risk of relapses for each patient. Prognostic factors include, for example, tumour thickness according to Breslow and the development of previous metastases. Recently, a surveillance programme for stage I–IV patients is used; for example, stage III patients are staged once a year via a computerised tomography (CT)-scan. Stage II patients are followed-up via clinical inspections, lymph node ultrasound and the evaluation of the tumour marker S-100.

Clinical and pathological data on these patients were obtained from the electronic database of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry, which is a hospital-based registry. In addition, medical records were reviewed to obtain details from operative, pathological and radiation therapy reports. All received data were recorded with standardised forms and finally computerised. The following information was obtained: demographics, anatomical localisation and histological characteristics of primary melanoma, time interval between diagnoses of primary melanoma and brain metastases, site of primary cutaneous melanoma, clinical presentation of brain metastases, localisation of brain metastases, number and size of brain metastases; number and location of other melanoma metastases, KPS, serum lactate dehydrogenase at time of presentation of brain metastases, administered treatment, response to treatment, date of death or last follow-up and cause of death. Diagnosis of brain metastases was mainly based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In a few cases that were diagnosed during the earlier years of the study, CT was used instead. No specific treatment protocol was used. Usually, patients were offered surgery if they had a single or a few surgically accessible brain metastases and a good KPS. If, brain metastases was difficult to access surgically SRS was offered instead. Only 10 out of 94 patients treated with surgery or SRS had more than two brain metastases (eight surgery and two SRS). In these cases, decision was based on clinical experience. Treatment with SRS was delivered using a linear accelerator in all cases. Patients, who received WBRT, were usually treated with a total dose of 30 Gy with a fractionation of 2 Gy (5 days a week for 3 weeks). Tumour response was evaluated using CT and/or MRI every 3 months after therapy. Response to treatment was described using the RECIST criteria.

### Medical management of brain metastases [^1122peeA]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of brain metastases occurs in 10–20% of all patients with cancer. Brain metastases portend poor survival and contribute to increased cancer mortality and morbidity. Despite multimodal treatment options, which include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, 5-year survival remains low. Besides, our current treatment modalities can have significant neurological comorbidities, which result in neurocognitive decline and a decrease in a patient's quality of life. However, innovations in technology, improved understanding of tumor biology, and new therapeutic options have led to improved patient care. Novel approaches in radiotherapy are minimizing the neurocognitive decline while providing the same therapeutic benefit. In addition, advances in targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors are redefining the management of lung and melanoma brain metastases. Similar approaches to brain metastases from other primary tumors promise to lead to new and effective therapies. We are beginning to understand the appropriate combination of these novel approaches with our traditional treatment options. As advances in basic and translational science and innovative technologies enter clinical practice, the prognosis of patients with brain metastases will continue to improve.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^112jJ1z8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma — principles of brain metastases management (systemic therapy) states that some patients may be candidates for systemic therapy as the sole initial treatment modality, with no need for brain-directed therapy unless there is intracranial progression, and for all patients treated with this approach, close surveillance (brain MRI every 6–8 weeks) is strongly recommended. Patients most likely to be considered include patients with < 3 cm asymptomatic brain metastases, not requiring corticosteroids, and no prior treatment with systemic therapy; the clinical trial supporting this strategy utilized nivolumab/ipilimumab and found high intracranial response rates in patients with previously untreated brain metastases, which appear to be durable, and systemic corticosteroids may interfere with the efficacy of nivolumab/ipilimumab and should be avoided in patients being considered for combination nivolumab/ipilimumab. For patients who are not candidates for nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy, single-agent anti-PD-1 therapies have been shown to have only modest intracranial activity, and are not preferred as the initial treatment modality for treatment of brain metastases in most patients; consider early brain-directed therapy; and consider BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy in patients with BRAF V600 mutation. Select patients who are symptomatic with BRAF-mutated melanoma who have not been previously treated with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor are described; BRAF/MEK inhibitors result in a high intracranial response rate; however, PFS is shorter than reported data for extracranial disease; as such, this approach may be most useful when patients also have a large burden of extracranial disease or numerous brain metastases not amenable to local therapy, and patients treated with this approach are very likely to need subsequent brain-directed therapy, and should be monitored closely. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^114dWoSi]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to identify determinants of the outcome of patients with brain metastasis from cutaneous melanoma. The overall survival of our patients was generally very poor with median survival time not exceeding 5 months. Comparable overall survival times have been shown by a few other studies.

The results of our multivariate Cox analysis showed that the main independent favourable prognostic factors in these patients are the levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (normal vs elevated), the type of administered therapy (neurosurgery or SRS vs other), the number of brain metastases (single vs multiple) and the presence of bone metastasis (false vs true). By means of explorative classification analysis, we identified three different prognostic groups with statistically significant differences in the overall survival. Patients treated with either neurosurgery or SRS comprised the group with the most favourable prognosis. The rest of the patients could be further sub-classified into two groups based on the levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (≤ 2 upper normal value vs > 2 upper normal value).

This is the first study to identify different prognostic groups by means of classification trees analysis in a relatively unselected population of patients with brain metastases from melanoma particularly by taking into account the levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase, which is a well-established prognostic factor in stage IV melanoma. Normally serum lactate dehydrogenase is rising with increasing tumour masses and can therefore be used as a surrogate marker for tumour load. The use of recursive partitioning analysis grouping, as described by the RTOG, has been suggested as a tool for the stratification of patients with brain metastases. However, this system does not take into account particularities of different tumour types (like serum lactate dehydrogenase levels for melanoma) and for this reason we performed detailed analysis to identify more meaningful tools for classification of patients according to their prognosis in our population.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of melanoma, version 3.0 [^114S4EnD]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). High credibility.

SITC melanoma immunotherapy — management of oligoprogressive disease: Definitive management of isolated sites of metastatic disease progression can improve survival and should be considered for all patients receiving immunotherapy who develop an isolated site of progression. Multiple studies demonstrate that patients with oligoprogressive disease who are treated with local therapy to the site of progression while continuing anti-PD-1 therapy can achieve improved outcomes. Significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) was seen in patients receiving ICIs following metastasectomy for those who achieved a complete resection and for those who underwent resection of a single (vs multiple) metastases. Radiation may be used for brain lesions and extracranial metastases not amenable to surgical resection, and may enhance the efficacy of systemic immunotherapy through the abscopal effect.

### Multidisciplinary patient-centered management of brain metastases and future directions [^111i6xGb]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Brain metastases (BMs) are the most common intracranial neoplasm in adults and are 10 times more frequent than primary brain tumors.BMs occur in 20–40% of all cancer patients and are associated with a poor median survival time of 6–12 months. The most common primary tumors in patients with BM are lung, breast, melanoma, colorectal, and renal tumors. The frequency of BMs appears to be increasing as a result of improved neuroimaging modalities and longer survival of patients with metastatic disease due to improved systemic therapy treatment options.

BMs are distributed along regions of the brain with rich blood flow with 80% occurring in the cerebral hemispheres, 15% in the cerebellum, and 5% in the brainstem. Patients commonly present with symptoms as a result of the tumor location either by direct tumor involvement or peritumoral edema and mass effect. Clinical presenting symptoms are typically headache, focal neurologic deficit, and/or seizure. Cognitive impairment is also often seen at the time of diagnosis in up to 90% of patients with BM.

Precision management of BM is based on the individual patient- and tumor-specific variables: tumor histology, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), prognosis, targetable mutations, number/volume of lesions and symptoms, and patient preference.

Here, we review current treatment strategies for patients with metastatic brain tumors and we highlight areas of future study.

### Selection of patients with melanoma brain metastases for aggressive treatment [^114Ue8Z9]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine prognostic factors for patients with melanoma brain metastases that can be recommended for patient selection for clinical trials. A retrospective review was conducted of 65 patients irradiated for brain metastases from 1990 to 1997. Pretreatment factors analyzed for influence on survival included age, stage, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), extracranial metastases, the number and location of brain lesions, disease-free interval from initial diagnosis, total dose of radiation, and number of fractions administered. Prognosis was also analyzed by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analyses (RPA) classes. The data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median survival was 4 months. RPA class distribution was I-25%, II-48%, and III-28% with a median survival of 6.5, 3.5, and 2.5 months, respectively (p = 0.0098 by log-rank test). KPS less than 70% (p = 0.0039), and the presence of extracranial metastases (p = 0.03), predicted a worse prognosis on univariate analysis. Both factors remained significant on multivariate analysis. The prognosis of patients receiving radiotherapy for brain metastases is related to RPA class, the presence of extracranial metastases, and KPS. These criteria should be employed in selecting patients for aggressive protocol treatment, or for more protracted brain irradiation off protocol.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^115GZGJp]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma brain metastases — integration of systemic therapies with brain-directed therapies notes that many patients with melanoma brain metastases will require a combined modality approach and that the choice and sequencing of therapy depends on clinical factors. For patients who are on BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy and RT is determined to be appropriate, it is recommended to hold therapy 1 day before and after SRS, and at least 3 days before and after fractionated RT. Limited data are available, but currently there does not appear to be a concerning safety signal with the combination of RT and immune checkpoint inhibitors. In select patients who are otherwise continuing to benefit from systemic therapy, local treatment for the brain metastases and continuation of the same systemic therapy can be considered. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Determinants of survival in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma [^113RByip]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background:

This retrospective study aimed to identify prognostic factors in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma.

Methods:

In all, 265 patients under regular screening according to valid national surveillance guidelines were included in the study. Kaplan–Meier analyses were performed to estimate and to compare overall survival. Cox modeling was used to identify independent determinants of the overall survival, which were used in explorative classification and regression tree analysis to define meaningful prognostic groups.

Results:

In total, 55.5% of our patients presented with two or less brain metastases, 82.6% had concurrent extracranial metastasis and 64% were asymptomatic and diagnosed during surveillance scans. In all, 36.7% were candidates for local treatment (neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)). The median overall survival of the entire collective was 5.0 months (95% confidence interval: 4.3–5.7). Favourable independent prognostic factors were: normal pre-treatment level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.001), administered therapy (neurosurgery or SRS vs other, P = 0.002), number of brain metastases (single vs multiple, P = 0.032) and presence of bone metastasis (false vs true, P = 0.044). Three prognostic groups with significantly different overall survival were identified. Candidates for local treatment (group I) had the longer median survival (9 months). Remaining patients could be further classified in two groups on the basis of serum lactate dehydrogenase.

Conclusion:

Applied treatment and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were independent predictors of survival of patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma. Patients receiving local therapy have overall survival comparable with general stage IV melanoma patients.

### Association of innovations in radiotherapy and systemic treatments with clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastasis from 2007 to 2016 [^1124Vqh5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are innovations in the treatment of melanoma brain metastasis associated with improvements in clinical outcomes at the population level?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1096 patients with melanoma brain metastasis between 2007 and 2016, the use of advanced radiotherapy techniques, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies increased over time. Treatment with whole-brain radiotherapy decreased and overall survival increased, and the association between the use of new techniques and therapies for the treatment of melanoma brain metastasis and improvements in clinical outcomes remained unchanged when the analyses were adjusted for patient, disease, and time factors.

Meaning

The study's findings suggest that innovations in the treatment of melanoma brain metastasis are associated with improvements in outcomes among the group of patients with melanoma who have the worst prognosis based on population-wide routine practice.

### The treatment of melanoma brain metastases [^111QgRna]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Melanoma is the malignancy with the highest rate of dissemination to the central nervous system once it metastasizes. Until recently, the prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) was poor. In recent years, however, the prognosis has improved due to high-resolution imaging that facilitates early detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases and early intervention with local modalities such as stereotactic radiosurgery. More recently, a number of systemic therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for metastatic melanoma, resulting in improved survival for many MBM patients. Registration trials for these newer therapies excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, and a number of studies specifically tailored to this population of patients have been conducted or are underway. Herein, we review contemporary locoregional and systemic therapies and describe the unique challenges posed by treatment of brain metastases, such as radionecrosis, cerebral edema, and pseudoprogression. Since the number of systemic and combined modality clinical trials has increased, we expect that the treatment landscape for patients with melanoma brain metastasis will change dramatically. In addition to ongoing clinical trials, which show great promise, we conclude that our understanding of intracranial metastasis remains quite limited. In addition to inter-disciplinary, multi-modality studies, bench-side work to better understand the process of cerebrotropism is needed to fuel more drug development and further improve outcomes.

### Metastatic melanoma: prognostic factors and survival in patients with brain metastases [^115AQfek]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Brain metastases from malignant melanoma carry a poor prognosis. Novel systemic agents have improved overall survival (OS), but the value of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains uncertain. The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment (msGPA) provides useful prognostic information, but the relevance to the modern-day population has not been validated. Since 2011, 53 patients received treatment for brain metastases from malignant melanoma at the Rosemere Cancer Centre medical oncology clinic. Data were collated on demographic factors and survival. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan–Meier methods. Cox regression was used to identify prognostic factors on univariate and multivariate analysis. OS from the date of diagnosis of brain metastases was 4.83 months (range 0.27–30.4 months). On univariate analysis, BRAF, performance status and msGPA were significant prognostic indicators for OS (p = 0.0056, p = 0.0039 and p = 0.0001 respectively). msGPA remained significant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.0006). OS for BRAF-positive patients receiving targeted treatment (n = 22) was significantly better than for BRAF-negative patients (n = 26), with median survival times of 8.2 and 3.7 months respectively (p = 0.0039, HR 2.36). SRS combined with systemic agents (n = 16) produced an OS of 13.5 months. Patients receiving WBRT alone (n = 21) had a poor prognosis (2.2 months). The msGPA remains a valid prognostic indicator in the era of novel systemic treatments for melanoma. BRAF-positive patients receiving targeted agents during their treatment had favorable survival outcomes. WBRT alone should be use with caution in the active management of melanoma brain metastases.

### It is never too late: ultra-late recurrence of melanoma with distant metastases [^117USVdM]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors present the case of a 73-year-old lady presenting with weight loss, personality changes, transient confusion and visual loss, 38 years after initial surgical excision of a melanoma of the neck. CT and MRI of the brain showed cerebral metastases and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed an additional fludeoxyglucose avid lesion in the lung, which was biopsied. Histology confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma. She declined whole brain radiotherapy in favour of best supportive care and died 4 months after diagnosis. Life-long vigilance among patients with previous melanoma and awareness among physicians are necessary if late recurrences are to be recognised early, and outcomes improved. New imaging techniques including PET-CT may be helpful in diagnosing and staging melanoma recurrence. Treatment options for patients presenting with distant metastases are limited and the prognosis remains poor.

### The melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment does not adequately discriminate prognosis in a modern population with brain metastases from malignant melanoma [^113immT8]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Overall 231 patients in Cohort I and 162 patients in Cohort II were eligible for this analysis following exclusion of 21 patients due to missing KPS (17 patients) or number of brain metastases (15 patients). Baseline characteristics of the two cohorts are shown in Table 1. Median survival in Cohort I was 3.6 months (95% CI 2.8–4.5 months) and in Cohort II was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.5–4.8 months). Patients in each of the different prognostic groups were well-represented in both cohorts.

The KM curves shown in Figure 1 demonstrate that the msGPA enabled good discrimination between all four prognostic groups in Cohort I. However, in Cohort II, discrimination between groups was less good, particularly between patients with msGPA scores of 2 and 3. KM curves for msGPA scores 1 and 4 separate clearly from the rest of Cohort II, but the KM curves for msGPA scores 2 and 3 overlap for the first 6 months of follow-up and lie in close proximity for the remainder of the study period.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^1178MrFQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases — candidacy and outcomes — is supported across lesion counts and tumor contexts: A study of 1194 patients found "no differences in OS or neurologic mortality with SRS for 2 to 4 versus 5 to 10 brain metastases". Prognosis relates more to burden and tempo, as "total volume of brain metastases and the rate of developing new brain metastases may be more important prognostic factors for OS than the number of discrete brain metastases", and "patients with multiple lesions but a low total volume of disease" can be "suitable candidates for SRS". Patients with "a favorable histology… or controlled primary tumors may benefit from a strategy of SRS regardless of the number of brain metastases", and in small cell lung cancer, retrospective data "suggested that SRS may be suitable in some cases". Radio-resistant primaries "such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma can achieve good local control with SRS", and "younger age, good performance status (PS), and primary tumor control" predict longer survival. Contemporary series support SRS for "patients with a poor prognosis, with poor Karnofsky performance status (KPS), or who are older", and a systematic review of "32 retrospective studies" found SRS "safe and effective" for "metastases of the brainstem".

### Estimating prognosis at the time of repeat whole brain radiation therapy for multiple brain metastases: the reirradiation score [^112LFJVN]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Brain metastases (BM) occur in approximately one-quarter of patients with cancer. They are more common in patients with lung and breast cancers and melanoma.BM are associated with significant symptoms, including headache, weakness, cognitive disturbance, and seizures. If untreated, they result in a median survival (MS) of 1 to 2 months. The choice of treatment approach depends on patient factors (eg, age, performance status), tumor factors (eg, size, number of metastases, primary histology, and status of extracranial disease), and the availability of different therapeutic modalities.

Treatment options for BM have expanded in recent years from surgery and conventional external beam whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to include high-dose conformal treatment to 1 or more lesions, or a resection cavity, via stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy. Although the addition of an SRS boost after WBRT for patients with a single metastasis improved survival, local control, performance status, and steroid dependence in a pivotal phase 3 randomized trial for patients with 2–3 metastases, there was no survival advantage or impact on the rate of neurological death.SRS alone for patients with 1 to 3 BM is an appealing choice, with recent randomized evidence that demonstrates no difference in MS between SRS or SRS and WBRT, in light of the detrimental neurocognitive effects at 3 months for patients who receive both modalities. Although SRS is being actively explored, there are technical challenges for implementation in patients with multiple metastases, and it is considered investigational for those with > 4 lesions.

Approximately 50% of patients with BM present with multiple metastases. For this group, WBRT remains the standard of care, with a reported MS after treatment ranging from 2.3 to 7.1 months. Symptomatic improvement after WBRT occurs in 60% to 90% of cases, with 1-year local control rates of approximately 70%. However, intracranial progression after WBRT is common and has been reported as the cause of death in one-third to one-half of patients. Radiologically uncontrolled BM are associated with symptom recurrence or progression, along with cognitive decline, with an average decrease of 6.3 points on the mini-mental status examination. Options for salvage at the time of progression after WBRT are limited, especially for those who progress in the form of multiple metastases. Improvements in neurologic signs or symptoms have been reported in up to 80% of patients after repeat WBRT.

### Melanoma treatments and mortality rate trends in the US, 1975 to 2019 [^114qnp1K]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer, historically known for its extremely poor prognosis after metastasis. The incidence of melanoma has continued to rise. Increasing incidence has been attributed to skin screening programs, but they do not decrease mortality. Melanoma globally causes an estimated 57 000 deaths annually. The traditional approach for treating metastatic melanoma was sequential chemotherapy, which was associated with little overall survival benefit. In the past decade, new and effective therapies for melanoma have emerged, with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of multiple checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors and multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting v-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF)–mutated melanoma. These therapies have demonstrated remarkably improved overall survival in pivotal clinical trials.

Historically, the prognosis of metastatic melanoma with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been poor. However, with the use of novel therapies, the 5-year overall survival rate has increased from 5% to greater than 50%. A frequent cause of mortality in patients with metastatic melanoma is brain metastases, with more than 50% of patients developing these metastases in their lifetime. The median overall survival from the diagnosis of brain metastases historically has been approximately 5 months; however, current therapies have extended the median overall survival in these patients to approximately 3 years. The use of dual immunotherapy, such as ipilimumab-nivolumab, has shown an overall 5-year survival rate greater than 50%, albeit at the cost of high levels of treatment toxicity. Recently, the FDA approved nivolumab and relatlimab, a lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3)–blocking antibody, for patients with advanced melanoma, which seems to have a better toxicity profile.

Given the magnitude of benefit from these treatments compared with traditional chemotherapy, one can anticipate a potential association with improved mortality outcomes. This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify trends in the melanoma mortality rate (MMR) in the US population during the past 4 decades (1975–2019) to determine whether a change in the epidemiology of melanoma (specifically MMR) is associated with the advent of these new and effective treatment options.

### Summary report on the graded prognostic assessment: an accurate and facile diagnosis-specific tool to estimate survival for patients with brain metastases [^1132x2x7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our group has previously published the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), a prognostic index for patients with brain metastases. Updates have been published with refinements to create diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment indices. The purpose of this report is to present the updated diagnosis-specific GPA indices in a single, unified, user-friendly report to allow ease of access and use by treating physicians.

Methods

A multi-institutional retrospective (1985 to 2007) database of 3,940 patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases underwent univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors associated with outcomes by primary site and treatment. Significant prognostic factors were used to define the diagnosis-specific GPA prognostic indices. A GPA of 4.0 correlates with the best prognosis, whereas a GPA of 0.0 corresponds with the worst prognosis.

Results

Significant prognostic factors varied by diagnosis. For lung cancer, prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance score, age, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases, confirming the original Lung-GPA. For melanoma and renal cell cancer, prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance score and the number of brain metastases. For breast cancer, prognostic factors were tumor subtype, Karnofsky performance score, and age. For GI cancer, the only prognostic factor was the Karnofsky performance score. The median survival times by GPA score and diagnosis were determined.

Conclusion

Prognostic factors for patients with brain metastases vary by diagnosis, and for each diagnosis, a robust separation into different GPA scores was discerned, implying considerable heterogeneity in outcome, even within a single tumor type. In summary, these indices and related worksheet provide an accurate and facile diagnosis-specific tool to estimate survival, potentially select appropriate treatment, and stratify clinical trials for patients with brain metastases.

### Significant survival improvements for patients with melanoma brain metastases: can we reach cure in the current era? [^113E5SfQ]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

New therapies for melanoma have been associated with increasing survival expectations, as opposed to the dismal outcomes of only a decade ago. Using a prospective registry, we aimed to define current survival goals for melanoma patients with brain metastases (BM), based on state-of-the-art multimodality care.

Methods

We reviewed 171 melanoma patients with BM receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) who were followed with point-of-care data collection between 2012 and 2020. Clinical, molecular and imaging data were collected, including systemic treatment and radiosurgical parameters.

Results

Mean age was 63 ± 15 years, 39% were female and 29% had BRAF-mutated tumors. Median overall survival after radiosurgery was 15.7 months (95% Confidence Interval 11.4–27.7) and 25 months in patients managed since 2015. Thirty-two patients survived [Formula: see text] 5 years from their initial SRS. BRAF mutation-targeted therapies showed a survival advantage in comparison to chemotherapy (p = 0.009), but not to immunotherapy (p = 0.09). In a multivariable analysis, both immunotherapy and the number of metastases at 1 st SRS were predictors of long-term survival ([Formula: see text] 5 years) from initial SRS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.018, respectively). Five patients (16%) of the long-term survivors required no active treatment for [Formula: see text] 5 years.

Conclusion

Long-term survival in patients with melanoma BM is achievable in the current era of SRS combined with immunotherapies. For those alive [Formula: see text] 5 years after first SRS, 16% had been also off systemic or local brain therapy for over 5 years. Given late recurrences of melanoma, caution is warranted, however prolonged survival off active treatment in a subset of our patients raises the potential for cure.

Overall Survival

In the present analysis, there were 129 patients who were still alive. Among them, 101 patients had no evidence of disease recurrence, while 28 patients were living with recurrent or active melanoma. Unfortunately, 17 patients (36%) had passed away.

Among the deceased patients, 4 individuals had symptomatic brain metastasis as the first site of relapse, and additional 4 of them subsequently developed brain metastasis, which became the main cause of death. One patient's death was unrelated to their treatment or cancer diagnosis and was attributed to comorbidity.

### Melanoma brain metastases: local therapies, targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and their combinations-chances and challenges [^112zjPwG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Melanomas are the third most common source of cerebral metastases, preceded only by non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast carcinomas. The propensity of malignant melanomas to metastasize into the central nervous system (CNS) becomes clear considering that the incidence of malignant melanoma is far lower than that of NSCLC or breast cancer. Therefore, melanoma has the highest tendency to metastasize to the brain. The risk of brain metastases in metastatic melanoma increases with disease duration. Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) have been identified in up to 75% of metastasized melanoma patients at autopsy.

Prognostic factors are important not only for the choice of treatment, but also for assessing and comparing research results. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that the survival rates of patients with MBM are correlated to the number of cerebral metastases, the presence of neurological symptoms, the serum level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), the patient's age, the simultaneous presence of extracerebral metastases, the BRAF status (with positive BRAF mutation status being associated with a good prognosis) and the patient's physical condition.

The spectrum of available treatments for metastatic melanoma has increased substantially over the last 6 years due to the approval of effective immunotherapies and targeted treatments. However, until recently, patients with brain metastases have been excluded from most clinical studies, and prognoses remained poor, with survival typically measured in a few months if untreated. Luckily, however, this has changed. The phase II studies conducted to date have demonstrated activity of new systemic therapies in MBM and have therefore improved the prognosis for patients with MBM. However, most patients with MBM still progress and die, which stresses the urgency of further studies and research to improve the outcome of these patients.

The aim of this review is to provide an update on the treatment options for MBM, including the most recent research results.

### Defining the role of surgery for patients with multiple brain metastases [^112j7QL9]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Given the poor survival outlook and systemic affection of the CNS, the role of surgery in cases with multiple brain metastases is controversial. The literature contains few pertinent data collected against the background of the more recent developments in medical oncology. Generally, patients with (multiple) brain metastases are considered for surgery for the following reasons: reduction of mass effect (i.e. treatment or prevention of neurological symptoms), acquiring tissue for histological and molecular genetic analysis, and possibly cytoreduction. Beyond this, certain histologies, such as renal carcinoma or malignant melanoma are not particularly radiation-sensitive which may favor surgical therapy over irradiation in such cases.

Large space-occupying lesions lead to neurological deterioration which may prevent otherwise necessary oncological treatment both for CNS as well as systemic disease. In the posterior fossa, such lesions may be life-threatening due to an imminent risk of occlusive hydrocephalus and brainstem compression. Reduction of the mass effect of brain metastases may therefore be vital to keep and/or render patients oncologically "treatable".

The role of CNS tumor load and therefore cytoreduction has also attracted some attention. More recently, the concept of oligometastatic disease has been introduced which establishes an intermediate category between (at least for some time) presumably localized disease i.e. cases with a single metastasis and patients with multiple metastases believed to suffer from a disseminated affection of the CNS. Oligometastatic brain disease is often defined as suffering from two to four brain metastases. Patients with oligometastases may benefit from therapeutic strategies aiming at local rather than systemic CNS tumor control even though several "loci" need to be addressed.

Not rarely, brain metastases are the first manifestation of the primary disease. In some cases, staging studies fail to identify a primary tumor or the presumed primary tumor is not readily accessible so that brain metastases surgery is needed for diagnostic purposes. Some tumors, such as breast cancer or malignant melanoma, show genetic discrepancies between the metastatic disease and primary tumor. Amid growing targeted-therapy options, acquisition of metastatic tissue may help guiding (medical) therapy ("molecularly informed treatment").

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of surgery for patients with multiple brain metastases in a large patient cohort treated in view of recent advances in medical and radio-oncology. The current literature contains only limited data on complications and functional outcomes following surgery for brain metastases. Can we identify patients who presumably derive a survival benefit? What is the role of surgical cytoreduction (if there is any)?
