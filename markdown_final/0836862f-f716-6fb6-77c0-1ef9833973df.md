## Question

pathophysiology Type 1 DM

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and the autoimmune paradigm. Then, I should verify the staging framework and how β-cell mass and function decline over time. Next, I will examine genetic susceptibility, followed by environmental triggers and the immune effector mechanisms. After that, I need to consider β-cell vulnerability and heterogeneity, including endotypes and the role of insulin resistance. Finally, I will integrate these into a coherent model and note clinical implications and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental definition so I don't gloss over basics: type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell–mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and a predisposition to ketoacidosis. This is the canonical view supported by contemporary reviews and seminal seminars [^33a2d7f3] [^a0444308].

> Wait, let me verify the staging framework because mislabeling stages will confuse the entire narrative. The modern schema recognizes presymptomatic stages: Stage 1 with two or more islet autoantibodies and normoglycemia, Stage 2 with dysglycemia, and Stage 3 with symptomatic hyperglycemia; some proposals include a Stage 0 of genetic risk without autoimmunity, and Stage 4 for established disease with minimal residual β-cell function. Importantly, at clinical onset, roughly 60–90% of β-cell mass is already lost, which explains the abrupt symptomatic presentation despite a long prodrome [^802c0e28] [^568cafd9] [^948be312].

> I need to check the genetic architecture next. HLA class II variants, particularly DR and DQ, account for about half of the heritable risk, while over 50 non-HLA loci contribute smaller effects; polygenic risk scores built from GWAS are increasingly used to stratify risk and reveal mechanistic heterogeneity, though ancestry representation remains a challenge for equitable translation [^b55d6bb0] [^563bc58b] [^573bf6a8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation without addressing triggers. Environmental factors are implicated by rising incidence in genetically stable populations, discordant twin pairs, and migration studies; candidate triggers include viral infections (notably enteroviruses), early diet, the gut microbiome, and perinatal factors, but no single factor explains the epidemic, and many associations are modest and inconsistent, underscoring multifactorial and heterogeneous causation [^cce4cab7] [^71658e39] [^d4812ae6].

> I will now examine the immune effector mechanisms, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating any single pathway. Autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are central, with CD8+ T cells mediating direct β-cell killing and CD4+ T cells orchestrating the response; autoantibodies to insulin, GAD65, IA-2, and ZnT8 are diagnostic markers rather than primary cytotoxic effectors; insulitis is patchy and peaks around diagnosis, waning thereafter even as β-cell function continues to decline; innate immunity and inflammatory cytokines amplify and sustain the attack, and defects in regulatory T cells contribute to failed tolerance [^6354a55d] [^053ca991] [^56bd34f3].

> But wait, what if the β-cell itself is not merely a passive victim? Emerging data support a model wherein β-cell stress, intrinsic vulnerability, and altered antigen presentation can initiate or amplify autoimmunity; this β-cell–centric view helps explain why immunotherapy alone often delays rather than halts disease and suggests that combining immune modulation with β-cell protective or regenerative strategies may be necessary [^e99fd93d] [^95dab7a7].

> Let me consider heterogeneity and endotypes, because this is where precision medicine hopes to intervene. Age of onset, speed of progression, autoantibody profiles, and concomitant insulin resistance vary widely; some adults with autoimmune diabetes retain residual β-cell function (LADA), while others exhibit features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes ("double diabetes"), complicating classification and implying distinct pathobiologies that may respond differently to therapy [^364a9dfe] [^c5075baa] [^a47d9739].

> I should confirm the exocrine pancreas angle, since it often gets overlooked. Pancreatic volume is reduced even before multiple autoantibodies appear, and exocrine insufficiency may coexist in a subset, suggesting parallel or early injury beyond islets; this could reflect shared developmental or inflammatory pathways, though mechanisms remain under investigation [^43060cf9].

> Next, I should review how these elements integrate into a coherent model. In genetically susceptible individuals, environmental triggers perturb β-cells and immune tolerance, leading to autoantibody seroconversion and progressive β-cell loss; the tempo is shaped by the intensity of autoimmunity, baseline β-cell mass, and metabolic stressors such as insulin resistance, which can unmask dysglycemia earlier; clinically, this culminates in symptomatic hyperglycemia when insulin secretory capacity falls below the physiologic threshold, often precipitated by intercurrent illness or growth spurts [^802c0e28] [^871eca6c] [^e6065b16].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical implications so the pathophysiology connects to bedside decisions. Early detection via autoantibody screening in high-risk individuals enables staging and consideration of disease-modifying therapy such as teplizumab to delay Stage 3, while C-peptide testing helps distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes when phenotypes overlap; recognizing double diabetes and insulin resistance informs adjunctive strategies and may influence cardiometabolic risk management, and ongoing research into β-cell imaging and biomarkers aims to personalize interventions and track response [^805a3c31] [^7fd4116c] [^c5075baa] [^f1bb3148].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that most cases are autoimmune and a minority are idiopathic; I should double-check that ratio. While some sources describe a small proportion of antibody-negative, idiopathic cases, the prevailing view in contemporary cohorts and reviews is that the vast majority of clinically recognized type 1 diabetes is autoimmune, with idiopathic forms being rare exceptions rather than a major category, so I should correct that earlier overstatement and align with the autoimmune paradigm as dominant [^33a2d7f3] [^a0444308].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties that could reshape our model. The specific environmental triggers remain elusive, the threshold and timing of irreversible β-cell loss vary between individuals, and we lack robust, noninvasive measures of functional β-cell mass; resolving these gaps will be essential to move from delayed progression to true prevention or restoration of endogenous insulin production [^cce4cab7] [^f1bb3148].

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an **autoimmune disease** in which T cells destroy pancreatic β-cells, causing absolute insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia [^33a2d7f3]. The process unfolds in **distinct stages**: genetic susceptibility (notably HLA-DR/DQ) [^b55d6bb0] sets the stage; environmental triggers (e.g. enteroviruses) [^3e36a77c] initiate autoimmunity; autoantibodies (GAD65, IA-2, insulin, ZnT8) appear years before symptoms [^805a3c31]; insulitis and progressive β-cell loss follow [^6354a55d]; and clinical diabetes emerges when ~80–90% of β-cells are destroyed [^03daf0bd]. Key drivers include autoreactive CD8+ T cells, cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis, and impaired regulatory T-cell function [^6354a55d] [^053ca991] [^56bd34f3]. The resulting insulin deficiency causes hyperglycemia, ketosis, and lifelong insulin dependence [^b070044d].

---

## Genetic susceptibility

- **HLA genes**: HLA-DR and HLA-DQ account for ~50% of genetic risk; specific haplotypes (e.g. DR3/4-DQ8) confer high risk, while others (e.g. DR15-DQ6) are protective [^b55d6bb0].
- **Non-HLA genes**: Over 50 loci contribute, including INS, PTPN22, CTLA4, and IL2RA, affecting immune regulation and β-cell function [^563bc58b].
- **Polygenic risk scores**: Integrate multiple variants to quantify risk and reveal molecular heterogeneity [^573bf6a8].

---

## Environmental triggers

Environmental factors interact with genetic risk to **initiate autoimmunity** [^cce4cab7]. Viral infections — especially enteroviruses (e.g. coxsackievirus B) — are strongly implicated, with seasonal clustering and detection of viral RNA in islets [^3e36a77c] [^def64667]. Dietary factors, such as early cow's milk exposure, vitamin D deficiency, and the gut microbiome, are under investigation but remain inconclusive [^cce4cab7]. Geographic and seasonal variations in incidence support an environmental contribution [^71658e39].

---

## Autoimmune destruction of β-cells

- **Autoantibodies**: GAD65, IA-2, insulin, and ZnT8 autoantibodies appear years before hyperglycemia and mark ongoing β-cell autoimmunity [^805a3c31].
- **T-cell mediated destruction**: Autoreactive CD8+ T cells infiltrate islets (insulitis) and destroy β-cells; CD4+ T cells provide help and amplify the response [^6354a55d].
- **Cytokines**: IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β induce β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction [^053ca991].
- **Regulatory T-cell dysfunction**: Impaired tolerance permits unchecked autoimmunity [^56bd34f3].

---

## Stages of disease progression

| **Stage** | **Characteristics** |
|-|-|
| Stage 1 | Multiple autoantibodies; normoglycemia; 5-year diabetes risk ~44% [^568cafd9] |
| Stage 2 | Dysglycemia; 5-year risk ~75% [^568cafd9] |
| Stage 3 | Clinical diabetes; ~80–90% β-cell loss; insulin required [^03daf0bd] |

---

## Metabolic consequences

Insulin deficiency drives **hyperglycemia** by impairing glucose uptake and increasing hepatic output, and it also causes **ketosis** from unchecked lipolysis and ketogenesis, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis if untreated [^5b5cf107]. Catabolism of protein and fat produces weight loss and fatigue [^b070044d].

---

## Heterogeneity and endotypes

T1DM shows **significant heterogeneity** in age of onset, progression, and treatment response [^364a9dfe]. Emerging endotypes reflect distinct genetic, immunologic, and metabolic profiles, supporting precision medicine approaches [^573bf6a8].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Early detection**: Autoantibody screening enables presymptomatic diagnosis and risk stratification [^805a3c31].
- **Immunotherapy**: Teplizumab delays progression in stage 2, marking a shift toward disease-modifying therapy [^e26c21e4].
- **Insulin therapy**: Lifelong insulin is essential; pumps and continuous glucose monitoring improve outcomes [^584cb156] [^9b817b18].

---

T1DM arises from **autoimmune β-cell destruction** driven by genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation, progressing through presymptomatic stages to insulin-dependent diabetes; understanding this pathophysiology underpins early detection, immunotherapy, and individualized care [^33a2d7f3].

As our knowledge of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes increases, so does our appreciation for the pathogenic complexity of this disease and the challenges associated with its treatment. Many new concepts about the pathogenesis of this disorder have arisen. The role of genetics versus environment in disease formation has been questioned, and the basis on which type 1 diabetes is characterised and diagnosed is the subject of much debate. Additionally, the care and treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes has seen a rapid evolution; with genetically engineered insulins, glucose monitoring devices, and algorithms all contributing to a decrease in disease-related complications. We focus this seminar on these changing views, and offer a new perspective on our understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and on principles for therapeutic management of patients with this disorder.

### Heterogeneity and endotypes in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^364a9dfe]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Despite major advances over the past decade, prevention and treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remain suboptimal, with large and unexplained variations in individual responses to interventions. The current classification schema for diabetes mellitus does not capture the complexity of this disease or guide clinical management effectively. One of the approaches to achieve the goal of applying precision medicine in diabetes mellitus is to identify endotypes (that is, well-defined subtypes) of the disease each of which has a distinct aetiopathogenesis that might be amenable to specific interventions. Here, we describe epidemiological, clinical, genetic, immunological, histological and metabolic differences within T1DM that, together, suggest heterogeneity in its aetiology and pathogenesis. We then present the emerging endotypes and their impact on T1DM prediction, prevention and treatment.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism resulting in hyperglycaemia and is classified into clinical categories, or types, based on pathophysiology. Type 1 diabetes has traditionally been characterized by the clinical presentation of insulin‐dependent diabetes in childhood or adolescence, although it can present at any age. Individuals with type 1 diabetes typically have classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia upon initial presentation. These symptoms are often accompanied by ketosis and, particularly in paediatric cases, diabetic ketoacidosis. Most of these cases of type 1 diabetes represent a near‐absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmune‐mediated destruction of pancreatic β‐cells. However, type 1 diabetes also encompasses individuals with a less aggressive autoimmune attack who initially retain some β‐cell function, and individuals who have absolute insulin deficiency but no clinical evidence of autoimmunity (termed idiopathic type 1 diabetes). This classic phenotypic presentation has often been relied on for diagnosing and classifying type 1 diabetes. However, increasing insights into the variability of factors that influence susceptibility, progression, pathogenesis, and phenotypic characteristics of type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease, suggesting the need to reconsider the traditional clinical classification of this condition. This need is further highlighted by increasing efforts to develop practical screening methods to diagnose type 1 diabetes at pre‐symptomatic stages due to the recent approval of teplizumab treatment to delay the onset of symptomatic type 1 diabetes in these individuals.

3.3 Heterogeneity and classification of type 1 diabetes (endotypes)

Although diagnosis of diabetes is typically made using these measures of dysglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, subsequent classification into a diagnostic category dictates ongoing management and screening recommendations. Though clinical presentation often guides this classification, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases, making it difficult to categorise many individuals at the time of diagnosis. Several of these clinical features, such as complexity of genetic risk factors, age at onset, severity of hyperglycaemia at presentation, rate of disease progression, and co‐existing insulin resistance and obesity, lead to numerous variations in the phenotypic presentation of clinical disease (see Figure 1).

Recent efforts have been made to better define the mechanistic drivers of this heterogeneity in terms of disease endotypes in type 1 diabetes in an attempt to connect these observable variable phenotypic characteristics to the underlying biology driving these differences. While distinct combinations of different phenotypic features can provide insight into differences in pathologic mechanisms, a disease endotype is defined as having a unique pathophysiology. The existence of and guidelines for distinguishing distinct type 1 diabetes endotypes is still a matter of debate. However, accumulating evidence suggests that several of the heterogeneous phenotypic features in individuals with type 1 diabetes (see Table 2) point toward distinct endotypes. Defining these underlying mechanistic differences will be an important framework moving forward as efforts are made to identify how to best treat individuals with different endotypes, particularly as new treatments for type 1 diabetes emerge, including newly approved immune‐modulating and cellular therapies.

### Type 1 diabetes [^a0444308]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by insulin deficiency and resultant hyperglycaemia. Knowledge of type 1 diabetes has rapidly increased over the past 25 years, resulting in a broad understanding about many aspects of the disease, including its genetics, epidemiology, immune and β-cell phenotypes, and disease burden. Interventions to preserve β cells have been tested, and several methods to improve clinical disease management have been assessed. However, wide gaps still exist in our understanding of type 1 diabetes and our ability to standardise clinical care and decrease disease-associated complications and burden. This Seminar gives an overview of the current understanding of the disease and potential future directions for research and care.

### Type 1 diabetes: current concepts in epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical care, and research [^dca7b5e1]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2012). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease mediated by a combination of genetic and environmental triggers resulting in lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets, destruction of beta cells, and lifelong dependency on exogenous insulin. Although T1D is prevalent (1 in 300) and its incidence is steadily increasing worldwide (3% per year), the exact gene-environment interactions precipitating the disease remain unknown. Living with T1D is challenging for patients, families, and caregivers. Because of the relative paucity of pediatric endocrinologists, general pediatricians and other subspecialists may occasionally be faced with the task of managing diabetes-related complaints. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the natural history, pathophysiology, and contemporary management of T1D. In addition, recent advances in T1D research are discussed.

### Type 1 diabetes [^33a2d7f3]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells. Individuals with type 1 diabetes are reliant on insulin for survival. Despite enhanced knowledge related to the pathophysiology of the disease, including interactions between genetic, immune, and environmental contributions, and major strides in treatment and management, disease burden remains high. Studies aimed at blocking the immune attack on β cells in people at risk or individuals with very early onset type 1 diabetes show promise in preserving endogenous insulin production. This Seminar will review the field of type 1 diabetes, highlighting recent progress within the past 5 years, challenges to clinical care, and future directions in research, including strategies to prevent, manage, and cure the disease.

### Genetics, pathogenesis and clinical interventions in type 1 diabetes [^d7576871]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder afflicting millions of people worldwide. Once diagnosed, patients require lifelong insulin treatment and can experience numerous disease-associated complications. The last decade has seen tremendous advances in elucidating the causes and treatment of the disease based on extensive research both in rodent models of spontaneous diabetes and in humans. Integrating these advances has led to the recognition that the balance between regulatory and effector T cells determines disease risk, timing of disease activation, and disease tempo. Here we describe current progress, the challenges ahead and the new interventions that are being tested to address the unmet need for preventative or curative therapies.

### Type 1 diabetes [^9b817b18]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Over the past decade, knowledge of the pathogenesis and natural history of type 1 diabetes has grown substantially, particularly with regard to disease prediction and heterogeneity, pancreatic pathology, and epidemiology. Technological improvements in insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors help patients with type 1 diabetes manage the challenge of lifelong insulin administration. Agents that show promise for averting debilitating disease-associated complications have also been identified. However, despite broad organisational, intellectual, and fiscal investments, no means for preventing or curing type 1 diabetes exists, and, globally, the quality of diabetes management remains uneven. This Seminar discusses current progress in epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of type 1 diabetes, and prospects for an improved future for individuals with this disease.

2 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE 1 DIABETES

With this increasing appreciation for the heterogeneity of factors contributing to type 1 diabetes progression, the model of type 1 diabetes development initially proposed by George Eisenbarth in 1986 and updated over the years has continued to be a valuable framework for discussing these variable factors that influence the pathogenesis and progression of type 1 diabetes (Figure 1). Even before the onset of β‐cell‐directed autoimmunity, several factors can variably contribute to an individual's susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. These factors include developmental differences in establishing functional β‐cell mass, as well as genetic risk, which can be modified by environmental and intrinsic factors within the pancreas and β‐cells. The initiation of β‐cell‐directed autoimmunity is presumably triggered by an event or events in susceptible individuals that result in the development of islet autoantibodies, leading to the loss of functional β‐cell mass. The subsequent progression of type 1 diabetes is delineated into distinct stages. Pre‐symptomatic stages include Stage 1, marked by the presence of two or more islet autoantibodies without dysregulated glucose metabolism; and Stage 2, where autoantibodies are accompanied by dysglycaemia. In Stage 3, individuals exhibit symptoms, and this is typically the stage when type 1 diabetes is diagnosed and insulin therapy is initiated, with an estimated 60%–90% of β‐cells lost at the time of presentation. With ongoing loss of β‐cells over the ensuing months to years, long‐standing type 1 diabetes also exhibits distinct pathologic features. However, despite this ongoing β‐cell loss, many individuals continue to secrete small amounts of insulin years after diagnosis. However, many questions remain regarding the ongoing role of heterogeneous combinations of genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors that may influence disease progression, autoimmune mechanisms, and clinical presentations, resulting in significant clinical and pathological variability. Recently, a Stage 0 phase has been proposed, characterized by genetic risk but no currently defined changes in the islets or immune infiltration.

3 CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF TYPE 1 DIABETES

3.1 Diagnostic categories of diabetes

Although increasing insights into the genetic, metabolic, and pathophysiologic heterogeneity of diabetes are leading to reconsideration of traditional clinical classifications of diabetes, the following diagnostic categories are still used to guide the clinical management of diabetes (Table 1).
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β‐cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, and represents about 5%–10% of diagnosed cases of diabetes. However, this category also includes individuals with latent autoimmune diabetes (also termed Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults) who initially retain some β‐cell function due to a slower autoimmune process, as well as individuals with idiopathic type 1 diabetes who have absolute insulin deficiency but no evidence of autoimmunity (autoantibody negative). Although evidence of autoimmunity is a hallmark of classifying type 1 diabetes, this classification can be further complicated by the co‐existence of features of these other "types" of diabetes. These diagnostic distinctions, including difficulties and considerations in classifying type 1 diabetes, are discussed further below.
Type 2 diabetes represents most cases (90%–95%) and is caused by relative insulin deficiency due to the inability of pancreatic β‐cells to compensate for the increased metabolic demand of peripheral insulin resistance, leading to a progressive decline in functional β‐cell mass.
Gestational diabetes is caused by relative insulin deficiency due to pregnancy‐induced insulin resistance, resulting in dysglycaemia during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, and is seen in an estimated 6%–15% of pregnancies.

Abstract

Type 1 diabetes is characterised by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β‐cells, leading to an absolute or near‐absolute insulin deficiency. Although traditionally associated with childhood onset, it can manifest at any age, and it is increasingly recognised that there is significant heterogeneity in its clinical presentation. This review examines the intricate interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and autoimmune mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. The role of clinical phenotype, along with diagnostic and clinical measurements of autoantibodies and C‐peptide, in the classification of type 1 diabetes is discussed, alongside the challenges in diagnosing and classifying the disease. Emerging insights from studies into the heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes phenotypes and mechanistic endotypes underscore the need for refined diagnostic criteria, particularly in identifying autoimmunity in individuals initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The impact of obesity and insulin resistance on disease progression and clinical management is also examined. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of type 1 diabetes, highlighting critical areas for future research and potential therapeutic approaches tailored to individual patient profiles.

Plain Language Summary

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body does not produce insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Traditionally thought to start in children and young adults, type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. However, many factors contribute to when someone develops type 1 diabetes and how rapidly the disease progresses, including a person's combination of genetic factors, including specific genes that can either be protective or high‐risk for the development of type 1 diabetes. Although it is widely assumed that a triggering event or events initiate the autoimmune process, the trigger or triggers remain unknown. However, it is this autoimmune process that causes progressive destruction of insulin‐producing Β‐cells in the pancreas that eventually leads to high blood sugar and the diagnosis of diabetes. Although we have several tools to diagnose and classify diabetes, including measuring autoimmune markers (antibodies) in the blood, there is significant variation in how individuals with type 1 diabetes can present, which can make recognizing and appropriately treating type 1 diabetes more challenging. Finding better ways to characterize the unique characteristics of each subgroup of individuals may provide new insights into how we can best tailor treatment to each of these patient groups.

### Prevention of type 1 diabetes: the time has come [^7a00f0ed]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus has completely changed our view of this disease in the past 25 years-from an acute, fulminant disease, to a chronic, autoimmune process. Information on genetic and serologic markers has increased our ability to identify individuals at risk. Prospectively gathered data indicate that, with a combination of immunologic and metabolic studies, children with a 6-year risk of disease higher than 90% can be identified due to an ongoing immune process. They differ from children with overt disease only in the time it will take for glucose levels to rise above a diagnostic threshold. Therapies to change the progression of beta-cell loss have been tested in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. With improved predictive capabilities and agents that can have longer-lasting effects than those tested more than 10 years ago, new prevention studies are underway. These studies are large and costly but the risks posed by such interventions compare favorably with those of developing hyperglycemia and of future complications portended by the diagnosis of diabetes. In this Review we discuss risk-stratification techniques and how they are applied, other diagnostic criteria, and outcomes from diabetes-prevention trials.

### Type 1 diabetes: translating mechanistic observations into effective clinical outcomes [^6881be8f]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains an important health problem, particularly in western countries, where the incidence has been increasing in younger children. In 1986, Eisenbarth described T1D as a chronic autoimmune disease. Work over the past three-and-a-half decades has identified many of the genetic, immunological and environmental factors that are involved in the disease and have led to hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis. Clinical trials have been conducted to test these hypotheses but have had mixed results. Here, we discuss the findings that have led to our current concepts of the disease mechanisms involved in T1D and the clinical studies promoted by these studies. The findings from preclinical and clinical studies support the original proposed model for how T1D develops but have also suggested that this disease is more complex than was originally thought and will require broader treatment approaches.

### Type 1 diabetes [^a3908a34]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes accounts for only about 5–10% of all cases of diabetes; however, its incidence continues to increase worldwide and it has serious short-term and long-term implications. The disorder has a strong genetic component, inherited mainly through the HLA complex, but the factors that trigger onset of clinical disease remain largely unknown. Management of type 1 diabetes is best undertaken in the context of a multidisciplinary health team and requires continuing attention to many aspects, including insulin administration, blood glucose monitoring, meal planning, and screening for comorbid conditions and diabetes-related complications. These complications consist of microvascular and macrovascular disease, which account for the major morbidity and mortality associated with type 1 diabetes. Newer treatment approaches have facilitated improved outcomes in terms of both glycaemic control and reduced risks for development of complications. Nonetheless, major challenges remain in the development of approaches to the prevention and management of type 1 diabetes and its complications.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^e03aa309]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by an immune-mediated depletion of β-cells that results in lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin. While both type 1 and type 2 diabetes result in hyperglycemia, the pathophysiology and etiology of the diseases are distinct and require us to consider each type of diabetes independently. As such, this position statement summarizes available data specific to the comprehensive care of individuals with type 1 diabetes. The goal is to enhance our ability to recognize and manage type 1 diabetes, to prevent its associated complications, and to eventually cure and prevent this disease.

### The case for an autoimmune aetiology of type 1 diabetes [^e348711c]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) develops when there are insufficient insulin-producing beta cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. The prevailing view has been that T1D is caused by immune-mediated destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. However, several recent papers have challenged the long-standing paradigm describing T1D as a tissue-specific autoimmune disease. These authors have highlighted the gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the aetiology of T1D in humans. Here we review the evidence and argue the case for the autoimmune basis of human T1D. In particular, recent analysis of human islet-infiltrating T cells brings important new evidence to this question. Further data in support of the autoimmune basis of T1D from many fields, including genetics, experimental therapies and immunology, is discussed. Finally, we highlight some of the persistent questions relating to the pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes that remain to be answered.

Stages of type 1 diabetes with variability due to heterogeneity. This graph illustrates the functional β‐cell mass throughout the stages of type 1 diabetes (green curve), with influences from heterogeneity due to genetic, environmental, and developmental factors that can impact the establishment of β‐cell mass and functional maturation (blue curve). Genetic risk and potential environmental factors may influence susceptibility to the triggering event or events that initiate the β‐cell‐directed autoimmune process, with ongoing effects on the intensity of the autoimmune attack (grey curve) and contribution of insulin resistance (orange arrows) on timing of symptomatic presentation with dysglycaemia (blue dots) and hyperglycaemia (red dots). The blue, green, and grey shaded areas and curves represent the remaining insulin secretory capacity of β‐cells, with time on the x ‐axis representing a broad range (which could be months or years, depending on the factors influencing the heterogeneity of the disease process and presentation).

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

### Type 1 diabetes [^26d8ef46]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetes mellitus type 1:
- **Definition**: T1DM is an endocrine disorder characterized by T-cell mediated autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in insulin deficiency with resultant hyperglycemia and a predisposition to ketoacidosis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The cause of T1DM is mostly autoimmune destruction of beta cells of the pancreas (70–90%) and idiopathic (10–30%).
- **Epidemiology**: The annual incidence of T1DM in the US is 22.9 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Environmental triggers in genetically predisposed people lead to the production of autoantibodies against insulin-producing islet beta cells of the pancreas resulting in autoimmune destruction of these cells. This leads to insulin insufficiency and overt hyperglycemia, T1DM and its complications, diabetic ketoacidosis, altered mental status, coma, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: On average, the life expectancy of a person with T1DM is approximately 12 years less than the general population.

### Current and future efforts toward the prevention of type 1 diabetes [^370672dd]. Pediatric Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in our understanding of the natural history of 'pre-type 1' diabetes as well as in the post diagnosis period. For now, an inability to successfully prevent the disease limits screening outside of the research setting. While studies of both humans with various levels of risk for type 1 diabetes as well as animal models for the disease have increased our understanding of the disorder, the development of a safe and effective therapeutic intervention capable of reversing or preventing type 1 diabetes remains elusive. Worldwide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention studies have been undertaken and both past and current studies are extensively reviewed in this manuscript. Intervention studies in new-onset and established type 1 diabetes patients have to date shown fairly limited success with most effects seen within the first 6–12 months post therapy. Long-term outcome remains to be determined. Improved and innovative trial designs, more rapid testing of both antigen specific and combination therapies in different populations (at-risk, new-onset, and established type 1 diabetes), continuing to fill the mechanistic voids in the etiopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and the development of validated biomarkers will hasten efforts toward reversing and preventing the disease. For successful prevention, therapy must be safe and must target not only effective control of the autoimmune process culminating in type 1 diabetes but also protection or replacement of lost β-cell function.

Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose affecting more than 422 million people worldwide and is increasing in incidence. Here, we focus on the role of the immune system in beta cell damage and destruction in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). T1D represents 10–15% of all diabetes, and diagnosis occurs more often in children but can also occur in adulthood. The incidence of T1D is rising; between 2001 and 2009, there was a 21% increase in prevalence in people under the age of 20 years, and it is expected that 5 million people in the USA will have T1D by 2050. T1D is the result of insufficient production of insulin due to damage and destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islet by one's own immune system. Here, we review what is currently known about immune mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and describe the emerging therapies for the prevention and treatment of T1D.

### Beneficial autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^2ed077f7]. Trends in Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

The trigger that leads to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes is currently unknown. It is well established that the pathophysiology of the disease is biphasic. In the first stage, leukocytes infiltrate the pancreatic islets in a response that does not cause damage. In the second phase, which occurs only in diabetes-prone individuals and strains, autoreactive T cells acquire aggressive potential and destroy the majority of the pancreatic islets. Rodents and humans exhibit a physiological ripple of apoptotic beta-cell death shortly after birth, which induces an adaptive autoimmune response towards islet-antigens, both in diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and in mice that do not develop diabetes. Here, we propose that the early T cell-mediated autoimmune response towards islet-antigens is physiological, purposeful and beneficial.

### Non-invasive imaging of functional pancreatic islet β-cell mass in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^f1bb3148]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterised by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta‐cells resulting in insulin deficiency. Evaluation of novel immunomodulatory therapies to prevent beta‐cell destruction requires reliable methods to measure functional beta‐cell mass which are currently unavailable.
The current study has demonstrated, for the first time, that manganese‐enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can provide a potential non‐invasive imaging technique to assess the functional beta‐cell mass in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
This has important implications for the investigation of the pathophysiology of diabetes, the monitoring of disease progression and the assessment of novel beta‐cell preserving therapeutic interventions.

4 SUMMARY AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES

Type 1 diabetes resulting from β‐cell‐directed autoimmunity can occur at any age. While traditionally thought to have its onset in childhood or adolescence, it is now clear that insulin deficiency accompanied by islet‐directed autoimmune markers may occur in adults, including older adults. This review highlights how other features, such as baseline β‐cell mass, age at presentation, obesity, and insulin resistance, can lead to heterogeneity in clinical presentation and may possibly reflect differences in the underlying pathophysiology. Classification may be challenging due to similar clinical phenotypes in some forms of monogenic diabetes and other types of insulin deficiency that are not associated with islet‐directed autoimmune markers. Furthermore, our current nomenclature, "type 1 diabetes", "Type 2 diabetes", or "gestational diabetes", is limited and not based on underlying pathophysiology.

Questions in need of further research include:
How do factors such as insulin resistance influence the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and classification? Does obesity and insulin resistance impact the islet‐directed autoimmunity, or is it simply the result of greater insulin demands in the setting of a limited β‐cell mass? Such questions are often relevant in adolescents who have obesity, islet‐directed autoimmunity and are not completely insulin deficient.
How to identify biomarkers beyond C‐peptide and autoantibodies that provide insight into the pathophysiology, disease progression, or improve the classification of type 1 diabetes?
How does the field address the heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes in immune modulation trials and screening of the general population to identify those at risk for type 1 diabetes?
Should therapeutic approaches differ in various forms or endotypes of type 1 diabetes? For example, should insulin and a GLP‐1 receptor agonist be combined for those with autoantibodies who also have obesity and insulin resistance? If so, does earlier treatment with insulin, particularly in children, help prolong β‐cell mass preservation?

### Cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^86efbb86]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recently updated their position statement on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to include additional focus on cardiovascular risk; improved management of risk factors in T1DM is also needed. There are important differences in the pathophysiology of CVD in T1DM and T2DM. Hyperglycaemia appears to have a more profound effect on cardiovascular risk in T1DM than T2DM, and other risk factors appear to cause a synergistic rather than additive effect, so achievement of treatment targets for all recognized risk factors is crucial to reducing cardiovascular risk. Here we discuss the evidence for addressing established cardiovascular risk factors, candidate biomarkers and surrogate measurements, and possible interventions.

What Is Type 1 Diabetes

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which an individual's immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As the autoimmune attack on beta cells progresses over time, the body is increasingly unable to produce insulin until a critical threshold is crossed and overt clinical symptoms of glucose dysregulation manifest. The resulting complications from the disease and its management can include potentially fatal diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypoglycemia in the short term and retinopathy (eye), nephropathy (kidney), neuropathy (nerve), and cardiovascular (heart) disease in the long term. The pathophysiology of T1D progresses at variable rates through several distinct stages, ultimately resulting in the requirement for insulin replacement therapy to survive (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Decline of beta cell function across stages of T1D. Progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D) resulting from autoimmune attack on pancreatic beta cells. Stage 1 is the presence of two or more islet autoantibodies with normoglycemia; stage 2 is the presence of two or more autoantibodies with dysglycemia; stage 3 involves the presence of two or more autoantibodies, dysglycemia, and the onset of symptomatic disease. Exogenous insulin is required after the onset of stage 3 T1D when remaining beta cell function is no longer able to meet the body's insulin requirements. Established T1D, often with complete insulin deficiency, is commonly called stage 4 T1D

Stage 1 T1D represents the activation of the autoimmune attack against pancreatic beta cells and is marked by the presence of two or more islet autoantibodies. In stage 2, the effects of beta cell destruction are visible as dysglycemia on clinical tests, such as the oral glucose tolerance test. Stage 3 T1D occurs when beta cell destruction has progressed so far that the remaining insulin production capabilities can no longer support normal functions. While some ability to produce insulin typically remains at the onset of stage 3 T1D, exogenously administered insulin is required to survive. Stage 3 T1D is marked by the presence of islet autoantibodies, dysglycemia on clinical tests, and clinical symptoms of diabetes, including increased urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), weight loss, fatigue, DKA, and others. Beta cell destruction continues after onset of stage 3 disease and initiation of insulin therapy, often progressing to complete insulin deficiency, referred to by some as stage 4 T1D.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^4567bc8f]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Current perspectives in the prevention or cure for type 1 diabetes.

What are our current perspectives of treating or preventing type 1 diabetes and what are the projected timelines? The most basic approach and also ultimate goal is to tackle the disease at its root, to eliminate the cause for type 1 diabetes. This could theoretically occur by genetic modification of genes that predispose an individual to type 1 diabetes, or the products of those genes, as well as by eliminating environmental factors, such as those being studied in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) trial. This has proven to be a very complicated approach, as we have learned over the past two decades that type 1 diabetes is a polygenetic and multifactorial disease. We now know that many genes, protective as well as enhancing, contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, which makes it exceedingly difficult to therapeutically modify all of their products in a suitable way. From the studies of George Eisenbarth, it is clear that, in addition to the genetic predisposition, other environmental factors are also implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Among them, viral infections are of significant interest, and their potential roles will be discussed later on. It is therefore possible that multiple and unique pathways can lead to type 1 diabetes and that the pathogenesis of the disease is heterogeneous in nature. Thus, eliminating or modifying all of the factors that cause type 1 diabetes will be difficult, unless the field can focus on a few key molecules absolutely essential for type 1 diabetes development.

### Diabetes mellitus polygenic risk scores: heterogeneity and clinical translation [^573bf6a8]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus encompasses several disorders, each with differing clinical presentation, prognoses and pathophysiology. Distinct polygenic architectures underlie type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and govern numerous pathophysiological pathways that converge on dysglycaemia. Over the previous decade, polygenic risk scores (PRS) derived from large genome-wide association studies have become broadly recognized for their potential in precision medicine. PRS, and now partitioned polygenic scores generated by clustering of risk variants, can quantify individual genetic predisposition to diabetes mellitus and reveal molecular heterogeneity responsible for variation in clinical presentation and prognoses. In this Review, we examine and contrast progress in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus PRS and type 2 diabetes mellitus PRS, and discuss paths to further methodological advances. We examine how studies in the past 10years have harnessed PRS and novel partitioned polygenic scores to reveal insights into diabetes mellitus aetiology and characterize changes in cellular and tissue-specific disease-modifying molecular pathways. Additionally, we discuss advances and opportunities in areas of clinical translation, including improved classification of diabetes mellitus type, screening of those at risk and personalized interventions informed by PRS. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need to overcome ancestry-related challenges and highlight current progress and gaps in ensuring the equitable translation of PRS for diabetes mellitus precision medicine.

### The discovery of type 1 diabetes [^85191eb3]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

The etiological heterogeneity of idiopathic diabetes has been recognized for 25 years, and subdivision into type 1 and type 2 diabetes is fundamental to the way we think about the disease. Review of the literature suggests that the concept of type 1 diabetes as an immunemediated disease emerged rapidly over the period from 1974 to 1976 and showed many of the features of a classic paradigm shift. A few key observations triggered recognition and acceptance of the new paradigm, but the necessary context was provided by scientific developments in areas mainly unrelated to diabetes. The disease paradigm established by 1976 is still widely accepted, and its essential features have been modified only in detail by the revolution in molecular biology that has occurred over the intervening period. Notwithstanding, some of the underlying assumptions remain imprecise, unchallenged, or unconfirmed. Appreciation of the historical origin and subsequent evolution of these fundamental concepts could stimulate critical analysis and help prepare the way for a new paradigm.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus as a disease of the β-cell (do not blame the immune system?) [^e99fd93d]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is believed to result from destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in pancreatic islets that is mediated by autoimmune mechanisms. The classic view is that autoreactive T cells mistakenly destroy healthy ('innocent') β-cells. We propose an alternative view in which the β-cell is the key contributor to the disease. By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity. Finally, we synthesize a model ('connecting the dots') in which both β-cell stress and islet autoimmunity can be harnessed as targets for intervention strategies.

### Update in type 1 diabetes [^7e51e65b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by severe beta-cell loss. The great majority of patients have type 1A or immune-mediated diabetes.

Synthesis

There has been recent progress in defining the genetics, pathogenesis, and natural history of the disease. In addition, there is a major effort to develop immunotherapies to prevent the disorder and to cure the disease with islet transplantation, and there is potential for dramatic improvement in care with introduction of continuous glucose monitoring devices. The discovery of "metabolic memory" underscores the importance of excellent metabolic control. With comprehensive care, major microvascular complications (e.g. blindness and renal failure) are preventable for most patients.

Conclusion

The existence of multiple "competing" technologies to deal with this devastating disorder holds promise of improved outcomes.

### The β-cell in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis: a victim of circumstances or an instigator of tragic events? [^95dab7a7]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent reports have revived interest in the active role that β-cells may play in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis at different stages of disease. In some studies, investigators suggested an initiating role and proposed that type 1 diabetes may be primarily a disease of β-cells and only secondarily a disease of autoimmunity. This scenario is possible and invites the search for environmental triggers damaging β-cells. Another major contribution of β-cells may be to amplify autoimmune vulnerability and to eventually drive it into an intrinsic, self-detrimental state that turns the T cell-mediated homicide into a β-cell suicide. On the other hand, protective mechanisms are also mounted by β-cells and may provide novel therapeutic targets to combine immunomodulatory and β-cell protective agents. This integrated view of autoimmunity as a disease of T-cell/β-cell cross talk will ultimately advance our understanding of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and improve our chances of preventing or reversing disease progression.

2.1 Genetic susceptibility

A clear role for genetic risk has been established in type 1 diabetes, with a high concordance rate in identical twins (60%–70%) and increased lifetime risk of developing type 1 diabetes in first‐degree relatives. However, most individuals with type 1 diabetes have no family history of type 1 diabetes. While genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is polygenic, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II‐associated polymorphisms define approximately 50% of the inherited risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The most important of these type 1 diabetes‐associated loci are HLA‐DR and HLA‐DQ, and genotypes with specific haplotypes and combinations of haplotypes each convey unique degrees of risk for type 1 diabetes, ranging from highly susceptible to highly protective. Insulin gene (INS) variants have also been associated with an increased risk of type 1 diabetes, with several polymorphisms at additional loci implicated in various immune cell functions and, in some cases, the β‐cell response to inflammation. The polygenic nature of genetic susceptibility in type 1 diabetes has been employed to calculate polygenic risk scores by integrating multiple single‐nucleotide variants to quantify genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. These genetic risk scores (GRS) have been used to identify high‐risk individuals and aid in the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and have the potential to be more widely used clinically, particularly in identifying high‐risk populations for autoantibody screening. Moving forward, these polygenic scores, which are still evolving, may also provide mechanistic insight into how different individual combinations of genetic polymorphisms lead to β‐cell vulnerability and islet autoimmunity, which drive the development and progression of type 1 diabetes.

FIGURE 2
Pancreas and islet changes during stages of type 1 diabetes disease progression. The progressive reduction in pancreas volume is illustrated at the top of the figure and occurs throughout the disease course, with changes noted even before the development of multiple autoantibodies (Stage 1) and continuing after diagnosis (Stage 3). Below the pancreas are schematics of pancreatic islets at each stage. Circulating islet autoantibodies that are markers of autoimmunity, but not cytotoxic, are present starting at Stage 1. However, negative seroconversions can occur, leading to decreased or undetectable antibodies by Stage 3 or in long‐standing type 1 diabetes. Cytotoxic immune cells can be present with scattered insulitis in Stages 1 and 2, leading to progressive loss of β‐cells. This insulitis is most prominent at Stage 3, but is not observed in long‐standing diabetes, despite some individuals retaining residual β‐cell function. C‐peptide levels also decrease throughout the stages, coinciding with the loss of β‐cells, and this leads to the development of dysglycaemia (Stage 2), which progresses to hyperglycaemia (Stage 3). Refer to the text for additional details.

Although insulitis is patchy, with not all islets affected equally, in one study, there was a trend of insulitis being associated with normal β‐cell‐containing islets rather than pseudoatrophic islets. The extent of insulitis is associated with disease stage, with one study identifying insulitis in 11% of autoantibody‐positive donors without clinical diabetes, 100% of donors examined within a year of diagnosis, and only in 19% of donors with disease duration longer than a year. The infiltrating pancreatic CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells have been shown to react to a wide range of islet autoantigens, including proinsulin, GAD and IA‐2, among others. Interestingly, one study showed that CD8+ T‐cells with different autoantigen species can even be found within the same islet, especially in individuals with long‐standing type 1 diabetes. And while the signalling cascades and effector functions in these activated cells are currently poorly understood, the CD4+ T‐cells are thought to orchestrate the immune attack while the more abundant CD8+ T‐cells mediate direct β‐cell destruction. Despite these increased insights into T‐cell‐mediated β‐cell destruction, it remains unclear what mediates the heterogeneity of insulitis in the pancreas, and whether the autoimmunity is the same at all stages or whether it waxes and wanes.

### Type 1 diabetes, hyperglycaemia, and the heart [^d3780ec8]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease that might not always be appreciated in view of the fairly young age of patients with this condition. In fact, in type 1 diabetes, the heart is subject to a variety of pathological insults, including accelerated atherosclerosis, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and possibly intrinsic cardiomyopathy. Although the relation between hyperglycaemia and microvascular complications has been well established, a direct effect of hyperglycaemia on cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes has long been debated. More recently, several studies, most notably the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications, have clarified this issue and provided conclusive evidence that hyperglycaemia is indeed a mediator of cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes and that intensive diabetes therapy can reduce cardiovascular disease outcomes. We review current concepts in type 1 diabetes and the heart, focusing on recent insights into the central role of hyperglycaemia.

### Prevalence of hyperandrogenism in type 1 diabetes… [^a86f78fa]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite hyperandrogenism is the cornerstone in the pathophysiology of PCOS, this derangement is closely related to insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and abdominal adiposity. Hyperinsulinemia increases androgen secretion by co-stimulating besides gonadotropins both ovary and adrenal steroidogenesis, which leads to predominant visceral/abdominal fat deposition, and further contributes to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. In addition, PCOS has been classically associated with metabolic alterations such as for overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, type 1 diabetes mellitus results from autoimmune-mediated destruction of the pancreas, causing a complete insulin lack in most patients.

Intensive insulin therapy
- a mandatory iatrogenic hyperinsulinism -, while improving chronic glycemic control and prognosis, has led in recent years to the appearance of "new" reproductive consequences in these patients, such as functional hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity. In 2016, a systematic review assessing the prevalence of PCOS in T1D was published, including 475 women with T1D from 9 studies. The results showed an overall prevalence of PCOS about 24% in T1D, higher than reported in the general population. Other hyperandrogenic traits such as hirsutism, hyperandrogenaemia, or ovulatory dysfunction were also common. The investigators hypothesize that the prevalence of functional hyperandrogenism including PCOS in Spanish women with T1D is higher than in women from the general population.

Furthermore, signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, and hyperandrogenemia may be milder in patients with T1D compared to hyperandrogenic women from the general population. Moreover, the occurrence of PCOS in these women may be influenced by insulin dose, duration of diabetes, and chronic metabolic control. The main objective of this study is to determine the actual prevalence of PCOS in premenopausal women with T1DM, according to different diagnostic criteria/PCOS phenotypes. As secondary goals, the investigators also aim to describe: i) the hyperandrogenic traits associated with PCOS in women with T1DM; and ii) the metabolic-T1D related parameters in women with or without hyperandrogenism.

### Incident dysglycemia and progression to type 1 diabetes among participants in the diabetes prevention trial-type 1 [^5fc437be]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The pathogenetic development of type 1 diabetes appears to be an ongoing process with an initial immunologic insult to β-cells followed by progressive metabolic deterioration before and after diagnosis. Therefore, from both clinical and research perspectives, it may be advantageous to identify individuals as early as possible in this process. The very high likelihood that autoantibody-positive children will develop type 1 diabetes within 5 years after the occurrence of dysglycemia suggests that the earlier identification of the disease is a distinct possibility.

### Double diabetes-when type 1 diabetes meets type 2 diabetes: definition, pathogenesis and recognition [^c5075baa]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the differentiation between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is not straightforward, and the features of both types of diabetes coexist in one subject. This situation triggered the need to discriminate so-called double diabetes (DD), hybrid diabetes or type 1.5 diabetes, which is generally described as the presence of the insulin resistance characteristic of metabolic syndrome in individuals diagnosed with T1D. DD not only raises the question of proper classification of diabetes but is also associated with a significantly greater risk of developing micro- and macroangiopathic complications, which was independent of glycaemic control. When considering the global obesity pandemic and increasing incidence of T1D, the prevalence of DD may also presumably increase. Therefore, it is of the highest priority to discover the mechanisms underlying the development of DD and to identify appropriate methods to prevent or treat DD. In this article, we describe how the definition of double diabetes has changed over the years and how it is currently defined. We discuss the accuracy of including metabolic syndrome in the DD definition. We also present possible hypotheses connecting insulin resistance with T1D and propose possible methods to identify individuals with double diabetes based on indirect insulin resistance markers, which are easily assessed in everyday clinical practice. Moreover, we discuss adjuvant therapy which may be considered in double diabetic patients.

### Perioperative management of type 1 diabetes mellitus [^e3f8e5c8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Clearly, perioperative management of diabetic patients requires thorough preoperative evaluation and planning whenever possible. A firm understanding of the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic stress response, and the interactions between various forms of insulin and other variables such as supplemental nutrition and glucocorticoids can greatly assist in achieving a positive outcome. Consultation with an endocrinologist, internist, or other primary care provider comfortable with managing type 1 diabetes patients is strongly recommended to assist in the details of in-patient care and overseeing of proper ancillary support. It may also be helpful to allow the patient to function as an active decision-maker in the coordination of care, especially because a large percentage of type 1 diabetes patients (particularly those who are on insulin pumps) are well-educated about their disease process and their own physiologic idiosyncrasies. This knowledge can save valuable time and effort toward achieving the ultimate united goal of avoiding perioperative morbidity and mortality by maximizing glycemic control.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus [^b070044d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an endocrine disorder in which pancreatic β cells stop producing insulin, typically due to autoimmune destruction. This results in hyperglycemia and ketosis; thus, insulin replacement is vital to management. Incidence peaks in puberty and early adulthood, but onset can occur at any age. However, prevalence is highest among adults because persons with T1DM live for many years. Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. Acute complications include diabetic ketoacidosis, which requires urgent management. Long-term complications include microvascular and macrovascular disease. Patients with T1DM are at higher risk for other autoimmune diseases and psychosocial issues. Management should focus on optimizing glucose control to reduce acute and long-term complications.

### Genetics of type 1 diabetes: what's next? [^597efcc9]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Disease pathogenesis.

Contemporary models of pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes support the involvement of two primary dramatis personae: the immune system and the β-cell. The known and newly identified genetic risk factors for type 1 diabetes present exciting opportunities to build on to the current cast of disease mechanisms and networks. Most of the listed genes of interest (Table 2) and those in extended regions are assumed to regulate immune function. Some of these genes, however, may also have roles in the β-cell (insulin being the most obvious example). Another gene, PTPN2, encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase, was identified as affecting the risk for type 1 diabetes as well as for Crohn disease. PTPN2 is expressed in immune cells, and its expression is highly regulated by cytokines. However, PTPN2 is expressed also in β-cells, where it modulates interferon (IFN)-γ signal transduction and has been shown to regulate cytokine-induced apoptosis. Other candidate genes, such as NOS2A, IL1B, reactive oxygen species scavengers, and candidate genes, identified in large GWA studies of type 2 diabetes, have not been found to be significant contributors to the susceptibility of type 1 diabetes.

Recently, new relationships between type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have been uncovered (Table 3). Certain HLA haplotypes have long been known to strongly influence genetic predisposition to autoimmunity. The contribution of the specific HLA component differs considerably among different autoimmune diseases, but most relate to the function of the adaptive immune response and the binding and presentation of specific peptides. The results of GWA studies have reinforced the belief that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease and that HLA is the major genetic determinant of risk for type 1 diabetes. Importantly, there is a substantial overlap in non-HLA susceptibility loci between type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. This overlap in genetic susceptibility locus (although not necessarily the same causal variant) supports the concept that genetic risk in autoimmunity is determined in part by variation in genes that act on control mechanisms of the immune system. It will be important to identify loci that are distinct to type 1 diabetes (such as the INS locus), since these loci may illuminate type 1 diabetes–specific pathways.

### Diagnosis, classification, and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus [^111c6e46]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by inappropriate hyperglycemia and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Currently, diabetes mellitus is diagnosed by blood or plasma glucose levels. A random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in an individual with classic symptoms is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Otherwise, a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL or a 2-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL after an oral glucose challenge of 75 g on 2 occasions is sufficient evidence upon which to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The major types of diabetes mellitus are type 1 diabetes (insulin deficient) and type 2 diabetes (combination of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency). In both types, there is a genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors that contribute to the expression of the genetic predisposition. In type 1 diabetes, the primary abnormality is extensive deficiency of beta cell function. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance occurs, and the marked compensatory increases in insulin secretion necessary to maintain normal glucose tolerance cannot be achieved or maintained. As beta cell function continues to decrease, the individual progresses from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes with primarily postprandial hyperglycemia to diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia. Drugs can cause diabetes by interfering with beta cell insulin secretion, by increasing insulin resistance, or by a combination of both. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to cause diabetic ketoacidosis, obesity and insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. A monitoring system should be in place in patients started on treatment with these agents to detect metabolic abnormalities as they are evolving so that adequate and timely treatment can be initiated.

Following almost 30 years of intensive research, initiated by the observation that Type 1 diabetes development is associated with a characteristic pancreatic immune cell infiltrate, a picture is emerging of which of the diverse effector arms of the immune system are involved in β-cell destruction. Like any chronic pathology, there is considerable complexity, and our ability to model the disease is hampered by a lack of ready access to the target organ and limited longitudinal analyses. However, it seems that putative pathways can start to be ruled in and out, in part as a result of focused mechanistic studies that make use of new technologies, and in part through analysis of the outcomes of clinical trials of new agents aimed at halting the disease process. The picture that emerges suggests a pathway to prevention that may require combinations of therapeutic agents that target different aspects of the immune system and will need to be used with due attention to their risk-benefit profiles.

### Stopping type 1 diabetes: attempts to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes in man [^64dd8c7c]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — or, more accurately, type 1A diabetes — is thought to arise from selective immunologically mediated destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans with consequent insulin deficiency. This occurs in individuals in whom genetic susceptibility outweighs genetic protection and is probably initiated by environmental factors not yet clearly defined. The disease arises via a cellular-mediated immune process, presumably a specific reaction to one or more β-cell proteins (autoantigens). There is consequent progressive impairment of β-cell function and apparent decline in β-cell mass. A secondary humoral immune response is characterized by the appearance of autoantibodies that serve as markers of the immune damage to β-cells. This insidious type 1 diabetes disease process generally evolves over a variable period of years (Fig. 1). The decline in β-cell function — and presumably in mass — is evidenced metabolically by loss of first-phase insulin response to an intravenous glucose challenge and later by the appearance of impairment in glycemic regulation, which is manifested as dysglycemia either as impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or "indeterminate" glucose levels (values > 200 mg/dl [11.1 mmol/l] at 30, 60, or 90 min during an oral glucose tolerance test). Ultimately, the clinical syndrome of type 1 diabetes becomes evident when the majority of β-cell function has been lost and presumably most β-cells have been destroyed; at this juncture, frank hyperglycemia supervenes. Although that broad sequence can be articulated, there are still gaps in many of the details. Further understanding of the nature of the disease process will facilitate the design of intervention strategies aimed at abrogating β-cell destruction and ultimately at prophylaxis of type 1 diabetes.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^8b0fc931]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of obesity and the degree of insulin resistance in these individuals remains unclear, and particularly with rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the paediatric population, the need for recognising and studying this population is increasingly appreciated. Given that insulin resistance and obesity can overlay any classification of diabetes, causing dysglycaemia and hyperglycaemia to occur sooner in the autoimmune process, it is unclear whether all or some of this population represent a distinct endotype or if insulin resistance is causing individuals who otherwise may present with classic symptoms to develop dysglycaemia and hyperglycaemia earlier in the autoimmune process (see Figure 1). Obesity does seem to be having an impact on the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes, and high‐risk children less than 12 years old who are overweight or obese have a higher rate of progression to type 1 diabetes. Whether obesity‐induced inflammatory factors play a role in accelerating the β‐cell‐directed autoimmunity is unknown.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^43060cf9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

While loss of β‐cell mass represents less than 2% of pancreas size, recent studies have shown that overall pancreas size by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also smaller in pre‐symptomatic Stages 1 and 2 and at the onset of diabetes (Stage 3), suggesting loss of exocrine pancreas tissue in these individuals. This loss in size is not associated with the duration of diabetes; rather, it occurs primarily within 5 years of diagnosis. The mechanism and temporal relationship of these changes in the exocrine pancreas with loss of β‐cells are unclear, but there is a reduction in acinar cells and evidence of fibrosis. Although not seen in all cases, some individuals with type 1 diabetes appear to have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Interestingly, changes in exocrine pancreas size and decreased pancreatic enzymes have also been noted in relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that these changes occur early in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, prior to the development of multiple autoantibody positivity (Stage 0).

### Type 1 diabetes-early life origins and changing epidemiology [^71658e39]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, immune-mediated disease characterised by the destruction of insulin-producing cells. Standardised registry data show that type 1 diabetes incidence has increased 3–4% over the past three decades, supporting the role of environmental factors. Although several factors have been associated with type 1 diabetes, none of the associations are of a magnitude that could explain the rapid increase in incidence alone. Moreover, evidence of changing prevalence of these exposures over time is insufficient. Multiple factors could simultaneously explain the changing type 1 diabetes incidence, or the magnitude of observed associations could have been underestimated because of exposure measurement error, or the mismodelling of complex exposure-time-response relationships. The identification of environmental factors influencing the risk of type 1 diabetes and increased understanding of the cause at the individual level, regardless of the ability to explain the changing incidence at the population level, is important because of the implications for prevention.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus… [^45694fe5]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a disorder of glucose homeostasis characterized by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cell that progressively leads to insulin deficiency and resultant hyperglycemia. If left untreated, insulin deficiency leads to progressive metabolic derangement, with worsening hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, starvation, and death. In an effort to restore and maintain euglycemia, treatment attempts to mimic the action of the native β-cell by exogenously replacing insulin and includes frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. As the visionary pioneer Dr. Elliott P. Joslin believed, the best possible outcomes of T1DM treatment are realized when a sense of empowerment, rather than victimization, is imparted to both patient and family.

Achieving this empowerment through diligence and education enables an individual living with T1DM to attain optimal health and well-being and constitutes the ultimate goal — and challenge — of the medical team. The epidemiology and pathophysiology. Comments.

### Environmental triggers and determinants of type 1 diabetes [^a2245e15]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is perceived as a chronic immune-mediated disease with a subclinical prodromal period characterized by selective loss of insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreatic islets in genetically susceptible subjects. A series of evidence supports a critical role of exogenous factors in the development of type 1 diabetes, such as 1) the fact that < 10% of individuals with HLA-conferred diabetes susceptibility do progress to clinical disease, 2) a pairwise concordance of type 1 diabetes of < 40% among monozygotic twins, 3) a more than 10-fold difference in the disease incidence among Caucasians living in Europe, 4) a several-fold increase in the incidence over the last 50 years, and 5) migration studies indicating that the disease incidence has increased in population groups who have moved from a low-incidence to a high-incidence region. This article discusses the trigger-booster hypothesis claiming that the diabetic disease process is triggered by an exogenous factor with definite seasonal variation and driven by one or several other environmental determinants. In addition, there are a series of modifying factors affecting the fate and pace of the process. Accordingly, progression to clinical type 1 diabetes typically requires the unfortunate combination of genetic disease susceptibility, a diabetogenic trigger, and a high exposure to a driving antigen.

### The viral paradigm in type 1 diabetes: who are the main suspects? [^def64667]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Although genetic predisposition plays an important role in T1D development, studies of identical twins suggest that environmental factors such as viruses and other pathogens may be critical triggers either through direct cytolytic effect and gradual beta cell destruction, or by bystander activation of the immune system. In addition, viruses may circumvent the host immune response and have the capacity to establish chronic lifelong infections. The association of various viral infections with the induction of T1D has been extensively studied at the serological and epidemiological level. However, there is still little evidence from studies of human pancreas to confirm their presence or a causal role in disease pathogenesis. In this review, we identify possible suspects for viral triggers of disease and explain their potential roles in the "viral paradigm" of T1D.

### Environmental risk factors for type 1 diabetes [^cce4cab7]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The incidence of type 1 diabetes has risen considerably in the past 30 years due to changes in the environment that have been only partially identified.

We revisit previously proposed hypotheses to explain the growth in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in light of current data. Finally, we suggest a unified model in which immune tolerance to β cells can be broken by several environmental exposures that induce generation of hybrid peptides acting as neoautoantigens.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated loss of pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin deficiency. It is the most common form of diabetes in children, and its incidence is on the rise. This article reviews the current knowledge on the genetics of T1D. In particular, we discuss the influence of HLA and non-HLA genes on T1D risk and disease progression through the preclinical stages of the disease, and the development of genetic scores that can be applied to disease prediction. Racial/ethnic differences, challenges and future directions in the genetics of T1D are also discussed.

### Islet regeneration needed for overcoming autoimmune destruction-considerations on the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes [^55f28dd0]. Pediatric Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

How many new beta-cells need to be generated in order to withstand the attack of an 'average-strength' destructive autoimmune response? An answer to this question is central for the design of intervention approaches aimed at dampening or redirecting parts of the autoimmune response and allowing for the generation of new beta-cells. In this article, we consider quantitative and spatial restrictions of destructive T-cell activity, in balance with the regenerative capacity and neogenesis of beta-cells. We assume that the initial interaction between specific autoaggressive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and beta-cells is a terminal event leading to the elimination of the beta-cell and removal from the pool of potential sources for beta-cell replenishment. Furthermore, we propose that there may be no way to save an individual islet from complete destruction, once a few activated CTL effectors have gained entry, based on the fact that activated CTL are 'committed killers' and hard to turn off. Thus, mechanisms that restrict CTL access to islets or provide 'immune privilege' to defined locations within islets and/or ductal tissue are critical to allow beta-cell regeneration in the face of ongoing autoimmune destruction. The key to halting progression of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis should build on the observation that islets die in a highly non-synchronized fashion, at least during the more chronic disease course. These considerations suggest a compartmentalized view of the diseased pancreas so that substantial histopathological differences among individual islets may be exploited to facilitate preservation and/or regeneration of selected islets. The recent development of novel technologies will allow more precise quantification of in vivo destruction and regeneration in order to test these hypotheses.

### Diabetogenic T lymphocytes in human type 1 diabetes [^5a1b5289]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The field of Type 1 diabetes research has been quick to embrace the era of translational medicine in the recent epoch. Building upon some 30 years of intense immunological research, the past decade has been marked by a series of clinical trials designed to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of a range of immune intervention and prevention strategies [1(••),2–5]. At the heart of Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune process, the consequence of which is immune-mediated destruction of islet β-cells. Although understanding the pathogenesis of islet autoimmunity is critical, there are also good reasons to focus research onto the β-cell destructive process itself. Measuring preservation of function of insulin-producing cells is currently the best means available to evaluate potential beneficial effects of immunotherapy, but there is an urgent need to discover and monitor immunological correlates of this β-cell destructive process. Whilst the best approach to intervention and prevention has yet to emerge, it is logical that future attempts to intelligently design therapeutics for Type 1 diabetes will need to be predicated on a clear understanding of the process of β-cell destruction and the immune components involved. For these reasons, this review will focus on the role of diabetogenic T lymphocytes in this disease-defining event.

### Respiratory infections and type 1 diabetes: potential roles in pathogenesis [^118bf125]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune condition affecting over nine million worldwide, characterised by the loss of functional pancreatic islet β ‐cells. This ultimately results in the lifelong dependency on exogenous insulin. Although the pathophysiology of T1D is well characterised and understood, its aetiology remains unclear. However, it is well established that the mechanisms underlying the development of T1D is multifaceted and likely involves the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Among the environmental factors associated with T1D, infections with viruses are identified as prime candidate triggers of islet autoimmunity (IA) which precedes most clinical onset of T1D.

### Non-invasive imaging of functional pancreatic islet β-cell mass in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^03daf0bd]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterised by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta‐cells resulting in insulin deficiency. The destruction of beta‐cells precedes the clinical manifestation of the disease and impaired insulin secretion can be detected several years prior to the onset of hyperglycaemia. Beta‐cell mass is reduced by 80%–90% at the time of diagnosis, and the degree of beta‐cell dysfunction often exceeds beta‐cell loss, indicating additional functional impairment in insulin secretion. Both beta‐cell mass and function further decline over time, but are not always reflected in plasma C‐peptide concentrations. It is now recognised that there are micro‐secretors of insulin and that preservation of insulin secretion in these cases is associated with several physiological advantages, such as reduction in hypoglycaemic episodes, improved quality of life and reduced hospitalisations. This provides a rationale for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring or at least preventing further loss of beta‐cell mass in type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Evaluation of novel immunomodulatory therapies to prevent beta‐cell destruction requires reliable methods to measure beta‐cell function. Although plasma C‐peptide concentrations can be measured with high sensitivity assays, it does not reflect the functional numbers of beta cells present. Therefore, novel methods to evaluate functional beta cell mass would be invaluable for understanding the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus, tracking disease progression, and assessing treatment response. For effective in vivo beta‐cell imaging, contrast media need to be sufficiently selective for beta‐cells, to provide a stable high‐intensity signal, and to reflect the functional state of beta‐cells. An example includes the use of gadolinium‐based zinc‐sensitive agents which exploit the fact that zinc ions are secreted along with insulin from the pancreatic beta cells. Translation of this approach into human subjects has yet to be established. An alternative new and readily translatable approach is manganese‐enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

### Immunomodulatory therapy to preserve pancreatic β-cell function in type 1 diabetes [^b858d880]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2011). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a common, severe chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the progressive and insidious loss of self-tolerance to the insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells. This loss of self-tolerance leads to the destruction of β-cells and the development of overt hyperglycaemia at diagnosis. The incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes is rapidly increasing worldwide, and this has led to intensive efforts to develop immunotherapies to induce remission of the disease and improve clinical outcomes. Immunotherapy aims to restore self-tolerance, resulting in the downregulation of autoimmune responses to pancreatic self-antigens and arrested ongoing β-cell destruction. When combined with replacement of the lost insulin-producing cells, this may lead to the restoration of euglycaemia. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and how this information has been translated into clinical trials. We also discuss next-generation combination immunotherapies that may be administered as adjuvant therapy at time of diagnosis.

### Type 1 diabetes risk factors, risk prediction and presymptomatic detection: evidence and guidance for screening [^d77c5c46]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

A critical point is that early‐stage type 1 diabetes, particularly Stage 1, is diagnosed entirely based on laboratory tests. This makes the establishment of clear diagnostic criteria essential. Accurate criteria are vital to avoid overdiagnosis (false positives: individuals who do not develop clinical type 1 diabetes) and underdiagnosis (false negatives: individuals who develop clinical type 1 diabetes without an early‐stage diagnosis). In the strictest sense, true early‐stage type 1 diabetes should reliably progress to clinical type 1 diabetes, with diagnostic tests minimizing both false positives and false negatives.

### The environment and the origins of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes [^21cd1c7a]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes involves the specific destruction of the pancreatic islet β-cells, eventually resulting in a complete dependency of exogenous insulin. The clinical onset of diabetes is preceded by the appearance of autoantibodies against β-cell antigens. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region is the single most important genetic determinant of Type 1 diabetes susceptibility, yet variability in the HLA region has been estimated to explain only approximately 60% of the genetic influence of the disease. Over 50 identified non-HLA genetic polymorphisms support the notion that genetics alone cannot explain Type 1 diabetes. Several lines of evidence indicate that environmental triggers may be integral in inducing the onset of islet autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals. The association between environmental factors and the clinical onset is complicated by observation that the rate of progression to clinical onset may be affected by environmental determinants. Hence, the environment may be aetiological as well as pathogenic. Putative inductive mechanisms include viral, microbial, diet-related, anthropometric and psychosocial factors. Ongoing observational cohort studies such as The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study aim to ascertain environmental determinants that may trigger islet autoimmunity and either speed up or slow down the progression to clinical onset in subjects with persistent islet autoimmunity.

T2DM has simply been thought to be a result of insulin deficiency and/or peripheral insulin resistance. However, the phenotype of T2DM is heterogeneous, as is the pathophysiology. 2,3.

### Recent advancement of understanding pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and potential relevance to diabetic nephropathy [^ce9c8d5d]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive destruction of pancreatic beta cells by genetic and environmental factors which leads to an absolute dependence of insulin for survival and maintenance of health. Although the majority of mechanisms of beta cell destruction remain unclear, many molecules, including proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, are implicated in the development of beta cell damage. Furthermore, beta cell destruction is enhanced by the Th1 and Th17 subsets of CD4+ T cells. In contrast, there are mechanisms involved in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by regulatory T cells, the function of which depends on the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor beta. Development and progression of renal injuries in patients with diabetic nephropathy are also associated with several growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, insulin-like growth factor-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta. Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy are principally different, i.e., autoimmunity and inflammation, some common factors, including susceptibility genes and proinflammatory cytokines, are involved in both mechanisms, including infiltrating cell recruitment, upregulation of other cytokines and chemokines, or apoptosis.

### Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus [^b52c8589]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is a widespread, emerging, heterogeneous syndrome characterized by patients who present with diabetic ketoacidosis or unprovoked ketosis but do not necessarily have the typical phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Multiple, severe forms of beta-cell dysfunction appear to underlie the pathophysiology of KPD. Until recently, the syndrome has lacked an accurate, clinically relevant and etiologically useful classification scheme. We have utilized a large, longitudinally followed, heterogeneous, multiethnic cohort of KPD patients to identify four clinically and pathophysiologically distinct subgroups that are separable by the presence or absence of beta-cell autoimmunity and the presence or absence of beta-cell functional reserve. The resulting "Abeta" classification system of KPD has proven to be highly accurate and predictive of such clinically important outcomes as glycemic control and insulin dependence, as well as an aid to biochemical and molecular investigations into novel causes of beta-cell dysfunction. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge in regard to the natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of the subgroups of KPD, with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding their immunological and genetic bases.

### Beta-cell mass and type 1 diabetes: going, going, gone? [^131a3ac5]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Studies largely done in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice have described a linear loss of β-cell mass from the time of initiation of insulitis through presentation with hyperglycemia and afterward until there is complete loss of β-cells. Results from the Diabetes Prevention Trial-1 (DPT-1) have described changes in insulin secretion from pre-diabetes to presentation with hyperglycemia, and other studies have depicted the progressive loss of insulin secretion after diagnosis. Whereas the data from animal studies and clinical investigations are largely consistent, other studies indicate that a simple linear loss of β-cell function may be an oversimplification of a process that involves an undulating downhill course. Variation in the rate of progression of β-cell loss may be due to waxing and waning of the inflammatory response because of exposure of new antigens; intercurrent insults to β-cells involving infectious agents, metabolic demands, or other factors; and a continuous attempt at β-cell regeneration that tides the progression. Inflammation itself appears to stimulate β-cell regeneration, but at the same time may expose new antigenic epitopes that become the drivers of a broadening autoimmune response. Ultimately, the failure to contain and counter this enlarging process results in presentation with clinical disease. Understanding the way in which the process develops and progresses has implications for treatment and reversal of the disease.

### The role of inflammation in insulitis and β-cell loss in type 1 diabetes [^053ca991]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a strong inflammatory component. The latest studies indicate that innate immunity and inflammatory mediators have a much broader role in T1DM than initially assumed. Inflammation might contribute to early induction and amplification of the immune assault against pancreatic beta cells and, at later stages, to the stabilization and maintenance of insulitis. Inflammatory mediators probably contribute to the suppression of beta-cell function and subsequent apoptosis; they may also inhibit or stimulate beta-cell regeneration and might cause peripheral insulin resistance. The different effects of inflammation take place in different phases of the course of T1DM, and should be considered in the context of a 'dialog' between invading immune cells and the target beta cells. This dialog is mediated both by cytokines and chemokines that are released by beta cells and immune cells, and by putative, immunogenic signals that are delivered by dying beta cells. In this Review, we divided the role of inflammation in T1DM into three arbitrary stages: induction, amplification and maintenance or resolution of insulitis. These stages, and their progression or resolution, might depend on a patient's genetic background, which contributes to disease heterogeneity.

### Diabetes mellitus induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors [^09b7f39b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used in oncology for their favourable antitumor efficacy. ICI therapy is associated with a unique toxicity profile known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). One such irAE is ICI-related diabetes mellitus (DM), which is relatively uncommon but can become extremely severe, leading to irreversible impairment of β-cells, and even lead to death if not promptly recognised and properly managed. The precise mechanisms of ICI-related DM are not well understood. In this review, we summarise the clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management of this adverse effect caused by ICI therapy. Deeper investigation of ICI-related DM may contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of classical type 1 DM.

### C-peptide utilization in clinical practice: effect on treatment and outcome of diabetes in a series of cases [^45c020af]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To emphasize that measurement of a C-peptide level can be critical in the diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We present a series of clinical cases in which glycemic control proved challenging, and we discuss the underlying pathophysiologic features of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes.

Results

In a series of 12 illustrative cases, suboptimal control of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes prompted further investigation. Assessment of C-peptide levels helped determine a precise diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, information that was pivotal in choosing treatment options and improving the outcome. These examples show that the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis of diabetes does not necessarily indicate the type of diabetes that is present.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware of the importance of establishing whether patients have type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and the implications of that distinction on the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies.

### Cohort profile: the German diabetes study (GDS) [^a7c662ee]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Why was the cohort set up?

Diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly type 2 DM, is a global health issue affecting about 387 million people. Also type 1 DM, characterized by insulin deficiency due to autoimmune-mediated beta-cell destruction, is rising. All DM types tightly associate with microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease) and several malignancies. The resulting organ dysfunctions affect at least one-third of individuals with DM accounting for approximately 8% of global all-cause mortality in humans aged between 20 and 79 years.

Subphenotypes of DM

Type 2 DM is characterized by a long "prediabetic" state with impaired insulin sensitivity, which promotes hyperinsulinemia. With failing insulin secretion, glycemia increases until diagnostic thresholds for overt diabetes are exceeded. There is evidence for the existence of subphenotypes even in the prediabetic state, possibly resulting from differences in the pathogenesis, and also with regard to the course of disease and related complications. In most forms of DM, beta cell dysfunction is a major driving force for disease development and progression. Despite extensive research on potential underlying mechanisms, such as glucose- or lipid-mediated toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction or inflammation the processes involved in beta cell failure are not fully understood. Defects in pancreatic beta-cell function are often preceded by insulin resistance which is not only a feature of type 2 DM, but is also found in patients with type 1 DM. Moreover, obesity associates with increased incidence of type 1 DM, which has led to the term 'double diabetes'. The mechanisms linking type 1 DM and insulin resistance, and thereby type 2 DM, are yet unknown.

Gene variants identified by genome-wide association studies seem to affect DM susceptibility predominantly through beta-cell dysfunction but also with insulin resistance. The risk alleles are common in the population, but their effect size is small and not suitable for general genetic screening. Identification of genetic determinants for insulin resistance relied on its surrogate markers such as fasting insulin. If such genetic variants are studied in comprehensively phenotyped cohorts, novel therapy targets might be identified. The distribution of subphenotypes, the predictive value for the development of comorbidities and the effectiveness of stratified or personalized treatment strategies are yet unclear.

### Proinsulin-a pathogenic autoantigen in type 1 diabetes [^0d25da5d]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterised by immunity to pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens, associated with beta-cell destruction leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia. The rigorous definition of an autoimmune disease requires evidence that an autoantigen elicits pathological immune responses. Using criteria for the pathogenicity of an autoantigen, we examine the evidence for proinsulin as an autoantigen in T1D. We conclude that proinsulin satisfies these criteria. As a corollary, proinsulin is a potential immunotherapeutic tool for the prevention of T1D.

### Immunoregulatory dendritic cells to prevent and reverse new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus [^11b76d9b]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Herein, the authors provide an overview of where dendritic cells lie in the immunopathology of autoimmune Type 1 diabetes mellitus and how dendritic cell-based therapy may be usefully translated to treat and reverse the disease. The immunopathology of Type 1 diabetes mellitus offers a number of windows at which immunotherapy can be applied to delay, stop and even reverse the autoimmune processes, especially in light of the recent antibody-based accomplishment of improvement in residual beta-cell mass function. As in almost all cell-specific inflammatory processes, dendritic cells are central regulators of diabetes onset and progression. This realisation, along with accumulating data confirming a role for dendritic cells in maintaining and inducing tolerance in multiple therapeutic settings, has prompted a line of investigation to identify the most effective embodiments of dendritic cells for diabetes immunotherapy.

Type 1 A diabetes

Type 1 A diabetes is a chronic inflammatory disease which leads to selective destruction of beta cells in pancreatic islets. Such cells are affected by a process involving specific cellular and humoral autoimmunity mechanisms against their antigens. A failure of regulatory T cells (T- regs) on this process is involved. However, even though type 1 A diabetes is one of the most widely studied autoimmune diseases over the last decades, its complete natural history has not been fully clarified yet.

One of the subtypes of type 1A diabetes is the "monogenic" diabetes, associated with the Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1. Such syndrome, also as APECED (Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy- Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy) is more frequent in children and pre-puberal individuals and is associated with the mutation of the autoimmune regulatory gene (AIRE), located in chromosome 21, that it is important to the regulation of autoimmune mechanisms. A change in this gen results in autoimmune reactions to different antigens expressed in peripheral tissues due to a failure in regulating the presentation of such antigens in the thymus for its recognition as "self-antigens". As it is already known, a large part of autoimmune regulation occurs at the thymus level, so that when peripheral lymphocytes go through the thymus, they receive information about antigens to which they must react or not. When the individual suffers change in the AIRE gene, the selection criteria fail and these patients start to react against antigens to which they should not react. Type 1 diabetes is observed in 13–20% of these patients. They are generally referred by other specialists, because the first clinical manifestation, most of the times, is not hyperglycemia. The most frequent manifestations of this syndrome are mucocutaneous candidiasis, Addison's Disease and hypoparathyroidism. It is interesting that in such patients, the glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA), that in classical type 1A diabetes indicate pancreatic β cell lesion, are more related to the presence of enteropathy.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f2f336e8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^254c4d6d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes risk — presentation, autoantibody progression, and confirmation are described as follows: People with type 1 diabetes often present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and 25–50% are diagnosed with life-threatening DKA; the majority, ~90%, of individuals who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a known relative with the disease. Of the 585 children who developed more than two autoantibodies, nearly 70% developed type 1 diabetes within 10 years and 84% within 15 years. Such screening, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent DKA. In several cohort studies, up to 50% of children with only a single autoantibody revert to being islet autoantibody negative during follow-up; therefore, it is recommended that the first autoantibody-positive test be confirmed with a second test within 3 months, preferably in a laboratory that meets the performance standards set by the Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program (IASP). In a simulation using one such genetic risk score, the majority of those who would go on to develop type 1 diabetes, > 77%, could be identified within just 10% of the general population.

2.2 Environmental factors

The increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes in genetically stable populations has been used to support a growing role of environmental factors in triggering the development of β‐cell‐directed autoimmunity or accelerating the progression of type 1 diabetes. Though many environmental agents have been extensively investigated, with a number of studies suggesting potential roles for various viral infections, intestinal microbiota, and nutritional factors, the triggering agent and/or events remain unknown. However, the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study cohort of individuals at high genetic risk of developing type 1 diabetes continues to prospectively and systematically investigate potential environmental triggers in its large cohort.

Viral infections have been intensively studied as potential triggers for type 1 diabetes. Associations have been made between type 1 diabetes diagnoses during seasonal peaks of viral outbreaks, including mumps, rubella, and human enterovirus B. However, given that β‐cell‐directed autoimmunity develops in earlier stages of type 1 diabetes, it is more likely that these associations are due to infections accelerating the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes due to increased insulin requirements during illness. Several studies have investigated the relationship between enteroviral infections and type 1 diabetes. Serologic studies have variably associated enteroviral infections with type 1 diabetes diagnosis versus seroconversion. Autopsy studies of pancreatic islets demonstrated increased enteroviral genomic or RNA material in samples from type 1 diabetes donors, but no causation has been demonstrated. Furthermore, a recent study using RNA‐sequencing demonstrated no evidence of persistent enteroviral B infection in pancreas samples from donors with type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, the incidence of type 1 diabetes in children did not decrease during the COVID‐19 pandemic despite the concomitant decrease in paediatric viral infections.

### Autoimmune gestational diabetes mellitus: a distinct clinical entity? [^3e286364]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

This review gives an update of the present knowledge on what is defined here as autoimmune gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Autoimmune phenomena associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) can be detected in a subgroup of women with GDM. Islet autoantibodies are present in sera from women with GDM with variable frequency. Distinct phenotypic and genotypic features may be recognised in this subset of women with GDM, which are representative of a distinct clinical entity. Furthermore, these women are at increased risk of developing type 1 DM after pregnancy. However, the eventual progression of the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells in these subjects may follow different time-course patterns thus leading to variable forms of presentation of autoimmune DM. As a high-risk group for type 1 diabetes, women with previous autoimmune GDM may be candidates for potential immune intervention strategies.

### COVID-19 as a trigger for type 1 diabetes [^5991c31e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is usually caused by immune-mediated destruction of islet β cells, and genetic and environmental factors are thought to trigger autoimmunity. Convincing evidence indicates that viruses are associated with T1D development and progression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases of hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and new diabetes increased, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be a trigger for or unmask T1D. Possible mechanisms of β-cell damage include virus-triggered cell death, immune-mediated loss of pancreatic β cells, and damage to β cells because of infection of surrounding cells. This article examines the potential pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 affects islet β cells in these 3 aspects. Specifically, we emphasize that T1D can be triggered by SARS-CoV-2 through several autoimmune mechanisms, including epitope spread, molecular mimicry, and bystander activation. Given that the development of T1D is often a chronic, long-term process, it is difficult to currently draw firm conclusions as to whether SARS-CoV-2 causes T1D. This area needs to be focused on in terms of the long-term outcomes. More in-depth and comprehensive studies with larger cohorts of patients and long-term clinical follow-ups are required.

Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diabetes Management — background on diabetes mellitus outlines disease mechanisms, prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and treatment distinctions with implications for activity in wilderness settings. Diabetes mellitus is described as a metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose from a lack of insulin secretion, reduced insulin sensitivity, or both, with type 2 diabetes the most common form (90% of individuals with diabetes have type 2 diabetes). Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in children or young adults and results from autoimmune destruction of islet cells causing insulin deficiency; people with type 1 diabetes require treatment with subcutaneous insulin, whereas those with type 2 diabetes may or may not require insulin treatment. The text notes that strenuous exercise and wilderness environments can complicate glycemic control, and that exercise and environmental stressors may interact with commonly used medications, glucose monitoring, and medication delivery.

### Fulminant type 1 diabetes: a comprehensive review of an autoimmune condition [^ad3696d7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D) is a subset of type 1 diabetes characterized by extremely rapid pancreatic β-cell destruction with aggressive progression of hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis. It was initially classified as idiopathic type 1 diabetes due to the absence of autoimmune markers. However, subsequent studies provide evidences supporting the involvement of autoimmunity in rapid β-cell loss in FT1D pathogenesis, which are crucial for FT1D being an autoimmune disease. This article highlights the role of immunological aspects in FT1D according to the autoimmune-associated genetic background, viral infection, innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and pancreas histology.

### Understanding type 1 diabetes through genetics: advances and prospects [^563bc58b]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Starting with early crucial discoveries of the role of the major histocompatibility complex, genetic studies have long had a role in understanding the biology of type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is one of the most heritable common diseases. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have given us a clearer picture of the allelic architecture of genetic susceptibility to T1D. Fine mapping and functional studies are gradually revealing the complex mechanisms whereby immune self-tolerance is lost, involving multiple aspects of adaptive immunity. The triggering of these events by dysregulation of the innate immune system has also been implicated by genetic evidence. Finally, genetic prediction of T1D risk is showing promise of use for preventive strategies.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^805a3c31]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — presymptomatic screening and classification recommendations indicate that screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by the detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8); autoantibody-based screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes should be considered in relatives of people with a family history of type 1 diabetes or otherwise known elevated genetic risk; having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes and, when multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered; and standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment).

### New potential treatments for protection of pancreatic B-cell function in type 1 diabetes [^dcdd2729]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from the progressive and specific autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic B-cells, which develops over a period of years and continues after the initial clinical presentation. The ultimate goal of therapeutic intervention is prevention or reversal of the disease by the arrest of autoimmunity and by preservation/restoration of B-cell mass and function. Recent clinical trials of antigen-specific or non-specific immune therapies have proved that modulation of islet specific autoimmunity in humans and prevention of insulin secretion loss in the short term after the onset of disease is achievable. The identification of suitable candidates for therapy, appropriate dosage and timing, specificity of intervention and the side-effect profile are crucial for the success of any approach. Considering the complexity of the disease, it is likely that a rationally designed approach of combined immune-based therapies that target suppression of B-cell specific autoreactivity and maintenance of immune tolerance, coupled with islet regeneration or replacement of the destroyed B-cell mass, will prove to be most effective in causing remission/reversal of disease in a durable fashion.

### Autoimmune type 1 diabetes in the era of disease-modifying immune therapy [^e26c21e4]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Over the past 60 years, autoimmune disorders and those of immune dysregulation have moved away from just the treatment of symptoms to the use of disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) to alter the course of disease. For most of that period, the field of type 1 diabetes (T1D) had not entered this era of immune therapies or biological agents to treat the underlying autoimmune pathology. However, clinical approval of the first DMT and multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of immune therapies for T1D. This has shifted how treatment of this disease can be approached and led to a delay in the need for insulin treatment. This review will provide a brief overview of the stages of T1D development and a description of teplizumab now approved for clinical use to delay the onset of clinical diabetes and those therapies under investigation to treat various stages of T1D. Important considerations for the implementation of these novel therapeutics in clinical practice, and the implications of treating the underlying immunology of T1D for the field, will be discussed as the focus of this review.

### Type 1 diabetes and viral infections: what is the relationship? [^42a1a27c]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common chronic metabolic disorder in children. Epigenetic and environmental factors capable of altering the penetrance of major susceptibility genes or capable of increasing the penetrance of low-risk genes are currently thought to play a role in triggering autoimmunity and T1D development. This paper discusses the current knowledge of the role of viruses in T1D. Most studies that have evaluated the potential association between viral infections and T1D have indicated that it is highly likely that some of these infectious agents play a role in T1D development. However, most T1D cases are immune-mediated, and it is supposed that the initial viral infection is capable of creating, in genetically predisposed subjects, a particular condition in which chronic local inflammation occurs through the persistence of the infecting virus in pancreatic tissue and the activation of autoimmunity by means of molecular mimicry, bystander activation, or both. Theoretically, this knowledge could lead to possible prophylaxis and therapy for T1D. Further studies devoted to evaluating which infectious agents are linked to T1D and which immune mechanisms induce or protect against the disease are needed before adequate prophylactic and therapeutic measures can be developed.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated ketoacidosis vs type 1 diabetes-associated ketoacidosis [^5b5cf107]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The pathophysiology of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)–associated ketoacidosis (DKA) differs from type 1 diabetes (T1D) DKA. T1D DKA is driven by absolute insulin deficiency, leading to ketosis and hyperglycemia. In contrast, SGLT2i DKA occurs due to reduction in plasma glucose (PG) from urinary glucose losses, which reduces insulin secretion and stimulates glucagon secretion, leading to ketosis. Accordingly, PG levels in SGLT2i DKA are often normal or mildly elevated. The implication is that glycemia and ketosis are less closely linked than in T1D DKA. Despite these differences, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology recommends treatment with the same protocols as T1D. This may result in hypoglycemia when patients receive fixed-dose insulin infusion or inadequate insulin dosing and reduced ketone clearance when patients receive dynamic insulin infusions.

### Immune modulation in humans: implications for type 1 diabetes mellitus [^56bd34f3]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is the result of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in genetically predisposed individuals with impaired immune regulation. The insufficiency in the modulation of immune attacks on the β cells might be partly due to genetic causes; indeed, several of the genetic variants that predispose individuals to T1DM have functional features of impaired immune regulation. Whilst defects in immune regulation in patients with T1DM have been identified, many patients seem to have immune regulatory capacities that are indistinguishable from those of healthy individuals. Insight into the regulation of islet autoimmunity might enable us to restore immune imbalances with therapeutic interventions. In this Review, we discuss the current knowledge on immune regulation and dysfunction in humans that is the basis of tissue-specific immune regulation as an alternative to generalized immune suppression.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^e6065b16]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus — the rate of beta-cell destruction varies, and presentations include individuals who develop ketoacidosis as the first manifestation or others with modest fasting hyperglycemia that can change rapidly to severe hyperglycemia and/or ketoacidosis because of infection or other stress. Some people retain sufficient residual beta-cell function to prevent ketoacidosis for many years but eventually become dependent on insulin for survival; in the later stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, and persons tend to be acutely symptomatic at onset, often complaining of polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, unexplained weight loss, dry mouth, or blurred vision.

### Viral infections in type 1 diabetes mellitus – why the β cells? [^3e36a77c]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by progressive autoimmune-mediated loss of pancreatic β-cell mass via apoptosis. The onset of T1DM depends on environmental factors that interact with predisposing genes to induce an autoimmune assault against β cells. Epidemiological, clinical and pathology studies in humans support viral infection — particularly by enteroviruses (for example, coxsackievirus) — as an environmental trigger for the development of T1DM. Many candidate genes for T1DM, such as MDA5, PTPN2 and TYK2, regulate antiviral responses in both β cells and the immune system. Cellular permissiveness to viral infection is modulated by innate antiviral responses that vary among different tissues or cell types. Some data indicate that pancreatic islet α cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response to infection with diabetogenic viruses than do β cells, and so are able to eradicate viral infections without undergoing apoptosis. This difference could account for the varying ability of islet-cell subtypes to clear viral infections and explain why chronically infected pancreatic β cells, but not α cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response and killed during the development of T1DM. These issues and attempts to target viral infection as a preventive therapy for T1DM are discussed in the present Review.

### HLA class I and genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes: results from the type 1 diabetes genetics consortium [^7b7cccb3]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

In summary, the extreme polymorphism of the HLA class I alleles and the strong LD in the HLA region make association analysis difficult for individual alleles. The large size of the T1DGC dataset and the consistent genotyping resolution of the samples from the collection allow meaningful analyses to assess the contribution of classical HLA alleles to type 1 diabetes susceptibility. The data presented here argue that HLA class I alleles (minimally B✱3906 and B✱5701) should be considered for inclusion in type 1 diabetes genetic screening panels. Thorough understanding of the risk of individual HLA alleles will provide clues to biological mechanism of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and, eventually, could lead to intervention or prevention targets. The results presented here represent a step toward this goal.
