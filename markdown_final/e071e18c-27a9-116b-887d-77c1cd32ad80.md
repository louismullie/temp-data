## Question

how quickly can ferritin rise in response to oral iron supplementation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how quickly ferritin can rise in response to oral iron supplementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of oral iron absorption and the hepcidin-mediated feedback that modulates fractional absorption. Then, I should verify the earliest time points when ferritin changes are detectable in clinical studies. Next, I will distinguish the initial ferritin rise from true iron store repletion and define what constitutes an adequate response. After that, I should consider modifiers such as baseline iron status, inflammation, and dosing strategy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable timeline with caveats and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic framework. Oral iron is absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum, with fractional absorption typically 10–20% in iron-deficient states and lower with replete stores or inflammation, and each dose acutely increases serum hepcidin, which inhibits further absorption for roughly 24–48 hours, supporting once-daily or alternate-day strategies to maximize net absorption [^7e0a572d] [^95bc0308] [^200a2d5d].

> Wait, let me verify the earliest detectable ferritin signal. In a randomized trial of iron-depleted women, serum ferritin rose within 1–2 weeks of starting oral iron, indicating that a measurable increase in stores can precede full repletion, and this aligns with clinical guidance that ferritin should begin to increase within about a month in responders [^fe5b35ec] [^c2e4afd0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what that early rise means. I need to distinguish the initial ferritin bump from true iron store normalization. The initial increase often reflects redistribution and acute-phase effects rather than full marrow repletion, and complete restoration of iron stores typically requires 3–6 months of therapy after hemoglobin normalization, which is why guidelines advise continuing iron for about 3 months after Hb normalizes to ensure adequate stores [^0e1b5789] [^586f90e2].

> I should double-check the magnitude and time course in real-world populations. In blood donors with low ferritin, low-dose oral iron restored ferritin to baseline in a median of 21 days, whereas those not receiving iron had not recovered by 168 days, illustrating that the early trajectory depends heavily on baseline deficiency and whether iron is provided, even though full repletion still takes months in many adults [^cc0c6f5a].

> Next, I should review modifiers that speed or slow ferritin recovery. Baseline iron status is key: patients with ferritin below about 30 ng/mL absorb iron more efficiently and show faster ferritin rises, whereas inflammation elevates hepcidin and blunts absorption, and alternate-day dosing can increase fractional absorption by 30–40% compared with daily dosing, though total weekly absorption may be similar if total dose is equated over time [^4902ea82] [^7327d54f] [^69a69515].

> Let me consider special populations briefly. In chronic kidney disease, oral iron is often less effective due to elevated hepcidin and functional iron deficiency; ferritin rises are modest and slow, so guidelines favor intravenous iron when a prompt hematologic response is needed or oral therapy fails, reinforcing that the ferritin kinetics are context dependent [^e2a94f54] [^c2e4afd0].

> I will now examine dosing strategy nuances. Although alternate-day regimens improve fractional absorption, some observational data in older veterans suggest that multi-dose daily regimens may yield faster hemoglobin recovery without clear differences in ferritin at 90–180 days, so if rapid hematologic correction is prioritized and tolerated, divided daily dosing may be reasonable, whereas if tolerance is limiting, alternate-day dosing can maintain progress with fewer side effects [^ec923810] [^b4ce2d91].

> But wait, what if the patient has ongoing blood loss or malabsorption? I need to ensure we account for continued etiologies that can outpace oral repletion, in which case ferritin may lag or fail to rise despite adherence, prompting evaluation for sources of bleeding, celiac disease, Helicobacter pylori, bariatric anatomy, or escalation to intravenous iron if there is inadequate response by 2–4 weeks [^d926af9f] [^c2e4afd0].

> Let me synthesize a clinically actionable timeline. In iron-deficient adults starting oral iron, a small but detectable ferritin rise can occur within 1–2 weeks, a clinically meaningful increase is expected within about 4 weeks if adherent, and full repletion of iron stores generally requires 3–6 months after hemoglobin normalization, with earlier reassessment at 2–4 weeks to confirm response and adjust therapy if ferritin and hemoglobin are not improving as expected [^fe5b35ec] [^c2e4afd0] [^586f90e2].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and thresholds. Guidelines advise checking hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks and continuing iron for roughly 3 months after Hb normalizes, and if ferritin fails to rise meaningfully by about 4 weeks despite confirmed adherence, consider switching to intravenous iron or reassessing the diagnosis and ongoing losses, recognizing that inflammation can confound ferritin interpretation and that transferrin saturation and clinical context should guide decisions [^c2e4afd0] [^586f90e2] [^d926af9f].

Ferritin begins to rise within **1–2 weeks** of starting oral iron, with a clinically meaningful increase expected by **2–4 weeks** in most patients [^fe5b35ec] [^c2e4afd0]. The early rise is often modest (about 10–20 ng/mL) and reflects increased iron stores before full repletion. Complete ferritin normalization typically takes **3–6 months**, depending on baseline deficiency, dose, adherence, and inflammation [^0e1b5789] [^d926af9f]. If ferritin does not rise by 4 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss and consider IV iron [^c2e4afd0].

## Time course of ferritin rise with oral iron

- **Early rise (1–2 weeks)**: Ferritin begins to increase within 1–2 weeks, reflecting early iron incorporation into stores [^fe5b35ec].
- **Clinically meaningful rise (2–4 weeks)**: A noticeable ferritin increase is expected by 2–4 weeks in most patients [^c2e4afd0].
- **Full repletion (3–6 months)**: Complete ferritin normalization typically takes 3–6 months, depending on baseline deficiency and adherence [^0e1b5789].

## Factors influencing the rate of ferritin rise

Several factors influence **how quickly ferritin rises** with oral iron:

| **Factor** | **Effect on ferritin rise** |
|-|-|
| Baseline ferritin level | Lower baseline ferritin accelerates rise; higher baseline slows it [^4902ea82] |
| Iron dose and formulation | Higher elemental iron doses (e.g. 65 mg) increase absorption and ferritin rise; ferrous sulfate is standard [^7e0a572d] [^7327d54f] |
| Adherence and administration | Poor adherence or taking iron with food slows absorption; alternate-day dosing may improve fractional absorption [^7327d54f] [^03465fff] |
| Inflammation | Elevated CRP/hepcidin blunts absorption and delays ferritin rise [^4902ea82] [^d7745f41] |
| Ongoing blood loss | Continued bleeding delays repletion and ferritin rise [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence on ferritin rise

- **Blood donors**: Low-dose iron (37.5 mg/day) restored ferritin to baseline in a median of 21 days in iron-depleted donors, vs > 168 days without iron [^cc0c6f5a].
- **General population**: Ferritin typically rises within 1–2 weeks, with a clinically meaningful increase by 2–4 weeks [^fe5b35ec] [^c2e4afd0].
- **Full repletion**: Normalization usually takes 3–6 months, depending on baseline deficiency and adherence [^0e1b5789].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring

- **Early monitoring**: Check ferritin at 2–4 weeks to assess early response and adherence [^c2e4afd0].
- **Lack of rise**: If ferritin does not rise by 4 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss and consider IV iron [^c2e4afd0].
- **Complete repletion**: Continue oral iron for 3–6 months after Hb normalization to fully replete stores [^0e1b5789].

---

Ferritin begins to rise within **1–2 weeks** of oral iron, with a clinically meaningful increase by **2–4 weeks** and full repletion in **3–6 months**. The rate depends on baseline ferritin, dose, adherence, and inflammation; if ferritin fails to rise by 4 weeks, reassess and consider IV iron [^c2e4afd0].

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients, and non-anemic blood donorssuggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin > 100 μg/L often requires longer treatment.

Ferrous salts

Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered as the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate or gluconate is recommended as a first line treatment for IDA in adults by the current British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Slow-release ferrous salt supplements have performed poorly in several studies, possibly due to delayed liberation of encapsulated Fe 2+ past the duodenum and upper jejunum, where iron absorption is optimal. Hence, serious concerns have been raised on their efficacy, and their use is not recommended.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^3337928e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Studies of longer duration were more likely to have a lower prevalence of baseline anaemia (online supplemental appendix 5). As a result, the apparently diminishing impacts of iron with increased duration were entirely explained on control for baseline anaemia (online supplemental appendix 6). Some prior studies have shown that impacts of iron on haemoglobin persist for several months after the cessation of supplementation, though the period of durability likely depends on the availability of dietary iron, burden of infection and degree of blood loss experienced by the population. The findings of this study support the current WHO recommendation of a 3-month course of iron supplementation, though a longer duration may be considered in order to maintain haemoglobin levels.

For all ages, the lowest dose tertile of iron received less than the WHO recommended daily supplement (10–12.5 mg/day for ages 6–23 months, 30 mg/day for ages 24–59 months, 30–60 mg/day for ages 5–12 years). Moderate age-adjusted doses appeared to be more effective than lower doses at increasing haemoglobin, but all doses effectively improved outcomes, even doses below current WHO recommendations. Interestingly, more frequent supplementation, longer durations of supplementation and higher doses each were associated with greater increases in serum ferritin. These novel findings can inform the design of future supplementation programmes, suggesting that flexibility is possible depending on specific aims.

### Oral iron supplements increase hepcidin and decrease iron absorption from daily or twice-daily doses in iron-depleted young women [^200a2d5d]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Iron supplements acutely increase hepcidin, but the duration and magnitude of the increase, its dose dependence, and its effects on subsequent iron absorption have not been characterized in humans. Better understanding of these phenomena might improve oral iron dosing schedules. We investigated whether the acute iron-induced increase in hepcidin influences iron absorption of successive daily iron doses and twice-daily iron doses. We recruited 54 nonanemic young women with plasma ferritin ≤ 20 µg/L and conducted: (1) a dose-finding investigation with 40-, 60-, 80-, 160-, and 240-mg labeled Fe as [(57)Fe]-, [(58)Fe]-, or [(54)Fe]-FeSO4 given at 8:00 am fasting on 1 or on 2 consecutive days (study 1, n = 25; study 2, n = 16); and (2) a study giving three 60-mg Fe doses (twice-daily dosing) within 24 hours (study 3, n = 13). In studies 1 and 2, 24 hours after doses ≥ 60 mg, serum hepcidin was increased (P < .01) and fractional iron absorption was decreased by 35% to 45% (P < .01). With increasing dose, fractional absorption decreased (P < .001), whereas absolute absorption increased (P < .001). A sixfold increase in iron dose (40–240 mg) resulted in only a threefold increase in iron absorbed (6.7–18.1 mg). In study 3, total iron absorbed from 3 doses (2 mornings and an afternoon) was not significantly greater than that from 2 morning doses. Providing lower dosages (40–80 mg Fe) and avoiding twice-daily dosing maximize fractional absorption. The duration of the hepcidin response supports alternate day supplementation, but longer-term effects of these schedules require further investigation. These clinical trials were registered at www. ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT01785407 and #NCT02050932.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^ada4f3af]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Thus, a large proportion of pregnant women is susceptible to diagnostic misclassification and decision-making mistakes when the indication of iron-therapy is based on the erythrogram or even ferritin results. Studies which validate those tests against therapeutic outcomes of iron supplementation at a real clinical setting might support this assertion. Therefore, our study assessed the diagnostic performance of erythrocyte indices and serum ferritin to predict and discriminate the increase of Hb in response to a therapeutic test with oral iron, which was applied as the reference standard of iron-deficiency in anaemic pregnant women at a prenatal care center. The response to iron-therapy may be a suitable diagnostic alternative, as is being recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) and British Committee for Standards in Haematology. To normalize the effect of haemodilution phenomenon on Hb changes, we adjusted the Hb values for the gestational age at start and end of iron-therapy, and we are introducing a Nomogram of Hb Z-scores as an easy-to-use graphic to follow the Hb values during pre-natal care.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bde6cc85]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal dosage and frequency of oral iron supplementation

The elemental iron content (actual amount of iron available for absorption) differs between commercial iron formulations (Table 1). Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing ~60–70 mg elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach, to reach a daily dose of ~200 mg elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to reach the target of increasing hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple dosing per day. The studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aiming to prevent iron overload. These are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption(Figure 2).

Thus, the effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study with non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate in different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, so that each participant served as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher triggered induction of hepcidin for up to 24 h, which decreased fractional iron absorption from a subsequent dose the following day. Hepcidin levels returned to baseline after 48 h, restoring efficient iron absorption. These early data seem to disqualify the split dosing of ferrous sulfate two or three times per day, and even favor intermittent intake every second day versus daily dosing, to bypass the hepcidin blockade and increase fractional iron absorption.

### Efficacy of daily versus intermittent oral iron supplementation for prevention of anaemia among pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fd79affc]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of iron supplementation on the prevention of anaemia among pregnant women. Currently WHO recommends daily iron supplementation for pregnant women. We found that there was no significant difference in the endpoint haemoglobin levels between daily versus any intermittent oral iron supplementation with a low level of certainty. On sub group analysis by baseline anaemic status of pregnant women, frequency of intermittent supplementation did not have a significant effect on the endpoint haemoglobin status. The studies included to support this evidence had a high risk of bias.

The endpoint serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in pregnant women who were provided with daily oral iron supplementation compared to intermittent oral iron supplementation. Based on baseline anaemia status, endpoint ferritin pooled estimate in the non-anaemic group remained significant, while the same was not significant among anaemic women. In a study conducted by Milman et al. women with baseline serum ferritin concentrations below 70 ng/mL had a risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy or post-partum, thus suggesting the need for iron supplementation in these women. In our meta-analysis we found that for daily or intermittent supplementation of oral iron, the rise in ferritin was not beyond 70 ng/mL, suggesting that the pregnant women supplemented with either regimen might be at risk of developing anaemia.

### Redefining iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure [^06fffe68]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

With respect to the effect on circulating levels of iron, the most important site of action of hepcidin appears to be the macrophage and hepatocyte, rather than the enterocyte, because selective hepcidin suppression in nonduodenal cells releases iron and is sufficient to alleviate anemia. Macrophage trapping is particularly meaningful, because recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes is the primary mechanism by which serum iron levels are maintained to sustain red blood cell production. A diminished role for duodenal iron uptake in states of heightened hepcidin synthesis may explain why no study has shown a relationship between serum hepcidin and iron malabsorption in HF. In fact, in patients with HF without evidence of systemic inflammation, the absorption of iron has been reported to be enhanced — not impaired.

Despite the lack of evidence for iron malabsorption, oral iron supplementation in patients with HF produces only modest changes in iron biomarkers, with no little rise in the serum ferritin level. The lack of a reactive increase in serum ferritin indicates that oral iron administration produces minimal changes in the intracellular labile pool of reactive iron. In fact, only 20% to 25% of patients with HF experience a substantial improvement in iron status after 16 weeks of oral iron therapy. These results are similar to the disappointing findings with oral iron supplementation in CKD. Therefore, it seems likely that, in patients with functional iron deficiency, oral iron is absorbed, but so slowly that it is readily sequestered in hepatocytes or macrophages by the heightened action of hepcidin before it can be delivered to target sites. In contrast, IV iron rapidly achieves high serum iron concentrations, thus bypassing the usual transferrin-based transport mechanisms in the bloodstream and allowing direct delivery to depleted cytosolic pools within target organs.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^0947c5bf]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic implications

Notwithstanding spectacular advances in our understanding of iron metabolism and homeostasis our diagnostic approach to iron disorders still relies mainly on three historical tests: serum iron, transferrin (or total iron binding capacity) and ferritin. Transferrin saturation (Tsat), i.e. the ratio of serum iron/total iron binding capacity and serum ferritin coupled with genetic testing and non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging measurements of liver iron content, define the nature and severity of iron loading in both hemochromatosisand thalassemia. Other useful markers are the level of serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTFRC), related to the expansion of erythropoiesis or iron deficiency, the sTFRC/log ferritin ratio for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in inflammationand the Tsat/log hepcidin ratio to suspect IRIDA.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits can measure serum hepcidin levels. However, this does not provide any information additional to serum ferritin, since the two variables are tightly related. Some researchers propose determining hepcidin levels in order to choose the better therapeutic route of administration of iron supplementation (oral vs. intravenous), as well as its correct timingand schedule. However, besides being subject to circadian oscillations, hepcidin levels change rapidly in response to activating and inhibitory signals, making their measurement useful in only a limited number of conditions. A kit to measure human serum ERFE concentration is available for research purposes. Whether the elongated ERFE identified in individuals with SF3B1 mutations will become a biomarker of ringed sideroblast myelodysplastic syndromeremains to be tested.

### Oral iron for patients receiving dialysis: what is the evidence? [^81dbd452]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

This review aims to summarize the available evidence of the effectiveness of oral iron in patients receiving dialysis. Four small randomized controlled trials (105 evaluated patients) compared oral iron supplements with placebo or no treatment; hemoglobin and ferritin levels did not differ significantly between groups at the end of the studies, while transferrin saturation levels fell in the placebo group in two studies. One trial (46 evaluated patients), comparing different ferrous iron preparations, found that hemoglobin levels and iron indices were maintained, but not increased. Another trial (54 evaluated patients) compared heme iron polypeptide with ferrous sulfate; hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels remained stable with both agents, but ferritin levels fell with heme iron polypeptide, but not ferrous sulfate. Two observational studies found that iron supplements can maintain hemoglobin and iron indices. Oral iron supplements were poorly tolerated. These sparse data suggest that oral iron is of little or no benefit in raising hemoglobin and iron indices in patients receiving dialysis. Further data are required to determine if oral iron can maintain adequate iron indices following iron replenishment using intravenous iron supplements.

### Alternate day versus consecutive day oral iron supplementation in iron-depleted women: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^6ff7aa88]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent randomized trials from India and Turkey reported greater or similar efficacy of alternate day versus consecutive day iron dosing in women with iron deficiency anemia. But small numbers, short treatment periods (3–6 weeks) and nonblinded study designs make these trials difficult to interpret. In a recent randomized controlled double-blinded trial, anemic Indian men and women (n = 200) received either one tablet of iron as FeSO 4 (60 mg) daily or two tablets of FeSO 4 (120 mg) on alternate days as a single morning dose for 8 weeks. There was no group difference in mean change of Hb at 8 weeks (P = 0.47). In a parallel group study, male and female endurance-trained runners (serum ferritin < 50 μg/L) received 105 mg iron as FeSO 4 either on consecutive or on alternate days for 8 weeks; although the alternate-day group received half the iron dose, there were no group differences in serum ferritin throughout the study.

We previously showed that after the intake of oral iron doses ≥ 60 mg, serum hepcidin peaks at 8 h and remains elevated at 24 h, but not at 48 h. Also, serum hepcidin was increased during dosing of 60 mg given on consecutive days for 14 days versus on alternate days for 28 days. In this study, we show that this effect is present over 3 months of consecutive day iron doses: serum hepcidin was higher in the consecutive-day compared to the alternate-day group at 46 and 90 days (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). However, because serum hepcidin is upregulated by acute iron doses and increased circulating iron concentrations as well as increased liver iron stores, the higher serum hepcidin in the consecutive-day group may have been due to both the acute effect of consecutive day dosing and a greater increase in body iron stores in this group during the first 3 months.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^7447acce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic test with oral iron

There was a mean increase of 0.008 Hb Z-score for each iron pill (p = 0.013), independently of sociodemographic and clinical-obstetric characteristics, and pre-treatment values of serum ferritin and leucocytes, and adjusted for Hb pre-treatment and duration of treatment. This dose-response effect was not coincident with case criterion as we predefined, hence 30 pills of oral iron would result in an increase of 0.24 Hb Z-score rather than 0.55. For this reason, we estimated Se, Sp, PPV, NPV, LR and diagnostic OR also using cutoff points of 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40 Hb Z-scores, but results were not sensitive to this criterion changes (see the multiple linear regression and accuracy reanalysis in supplementary material of this article - Additional files 4 and 5).

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^03d50a9e]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO iron status evaluation during ESA therapy — recommendations and rationale: Evaluate iron status (TSAT and ferritin) at least every 3 months during ESA therapy, including the decision to start or continue iron therapy (Not Graded), and test more frequently when initiating or increasing ESA dose, when there is blood loss, when monitoring response after a course of IV iron, and when iron stores may become depleted (Not Graded). The rationale states that in patients on ESA therapy, ferritin and TSAT should be measured at least every 3 months; falling TSAT and/or ferritin likely reflect ongoing blood loss or consumption of iron stores and can be used to anticipate the need for future or additional iron supplementation; and in patients on oral iron, testing can assess adherence. Increasing TSAT and/or ferritin may indicate excessive treatment that can be stopped or reduced, whereas increasing ferritin with stable or declining TSAT may indicate inflammation, infection, or other clinical situations requiring reassessment of continued iron administration; more frequent testing may be appropriate following initiation of ESA or iron therapy or when ESA dose or dose frequency is increased, and iron status testing is important in assessing patients who become less responsive to ESA treatment.

Introduction

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide and is associated with adverse outcomes in a broad range of settings. Thus, tackling ID efficiently and safely holds the potential to deliver cross-cutting benefits to a large number of patients. ID has been traditionally treated with oral iron supplements, which replenish iron incrementally over weeks by delivering ∼100 mg doses into the gut lumen, of which typically 10%–22% is absorbed into the circulation. Oral iron's gastrointestinal side effects, poor compliance, and limited absorption in inflammatory settings have fuelled a gradual shift towards intravenous (IV) iron therapies. These can deliver up to 2000 mg of iron into the circulation at once. To minimize the otherwise toxic effects of free iron reactivity, the iron in IV iron therapies is contained within carbohydrate complexes. These are designed for targeted uptake by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the spleen and to a lesser extent in the liver. According to the consensus canonical pathway of IV iron metabolism, the iron–carbohydrate complex is degraded within the lysosome of macrophages, iron is freed, exported into the circulation, and loaded onto the plasma iron chaperone transferrin. The iron made bioavailable through this pathway is considered safe because transferrin-bound iron is non-reactive and is only taken up by tissues according to their needs. Indeed, surface expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) is coupled to cellular iron need, because its levels are controlled by the iron homeostatic proteins [iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)]. Inside cells, labile iron is quickly made non-reactive through storage into ferritin, the translation of which is also controlled by IRPs. Because plasma ferritin derives primarily from macrophages, uptake of iron–carbohydrate complexes by reticuloendothelial macrophages is closely followed by a rise in plasma ferritin.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^e0a21b05]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Between August 2011 and October 2012, 187 women were consecutively enrolled and evaluated monthly for a period of 23 to 125 days, hence until December 2012, 139 women completed the trial. Sociodemographic information (age, self-assigned ethnicity, county of residence, educational level, family income per capita) and clinical-obstetric data (body mass index-BMI, numbers of pregnancies and births, time since the last delivery, weeks of current pregnancy and recent use of oral iron) were obtained at the time of the enrollment, and after the women were forwarded to blood collection to measure erythrocyte indices and serum ferritin pre-treatment (index-tests).

Every month, in addition to the routine of prenatal care, the participants responded a questionnaire about adverse effects (anorexia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, colic or abdominal pain) and adherence to therapy, while the iron pills not taken were counted; and after they were forwarded to a new blood collection to measure the Hb post-treatment (follow-up of responsiveness to iron-therapy). The withdrawal occurred in case of high-risk pregnancy, genital bleeding, drop out of treatment or intolerance, and use of other iron supplements. The follow-up was stopped in case of childbirth, and cure (Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL) or worsening of anaemia (Hb < 7.0 g/dL or drop in Hb > 1.0 g/dL). For more details, the protocol was previously published under the acronym AMA (it can be seen in supplementary material of this article - Additional file 1).

### Optimal oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia among US veterans [^ec923810]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study signifies the importance of following the standard clinical practice (2–3 times a day oral iron supplementation) in IDA when a rapid rise of hemoglobin is desired. There was no evidence of a difference in improvement of hemoglobin and other iron indices between the daily and ADD oral iron strategy, and improvement happened at a slower pace than the MDD oral iron strategy. Patients with CKD showed similar responses with different oral iron dosing strategies; however, the magnitude of the changes was smaller compared with those with NKF. The choice of oral iron therapy should depend on the rapidity of response desired and patient preference due to adverse effects.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^b39cea74]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Is Oral Iron Effective in HF?

The only study to date to compare IV iron versus oral iron in HF was terminated prematurely because of competing trials and insufficient funding. In this study (IRON-HF), 23 anemic HF patients with LVEF < 40%, TSAT < 20%, and ferritin < 500 ng/ml were randomized into 3 groups to receive IV iron (iron sucrose), oral iron (ferrous sulphate), or placebo. Over a 3-month follow-up period, the primary endpoint of change in peak VO 2 numerically increased by 3.5 ml/kg/min in the IV group without a detectable increase with the use of oral iron. However, there was a significant increase in the serum ferritin and TSAT levels observed in both the IV and oral iron groups. The use of oral iron in another retrospective study was also associated with a significant increase in the values of serum iron, ferritin, TSAT, and Hb level (all p < 0.001). These 2 studies collectively suggest that the use of oral iron can improve iron indexes. The question remains whether the improvement of iron indexes with oral iron would translate into better clinical status.

### Alternate day versus consecutive day oral iron supplementation in iron-depleted women: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^69a69515]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings for our two co-primary outcomes are that, at equal total iron doses, comparing consecutive-day and alternate-day iron dosing in iron-depleted young women: 1) median serum ferritin was 43.8 μg/L (31.7–58.2) versus 44.8 μg/L (33.8–53.6) (P = 0.98); and 2) the LPR for GI side effects on days of iron intake was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.38, 1.77; P < 0.0001). For our secondary outcomes, at equal total iron doses, comparing consecutive-day and alternate-day groups: 1) median serum hepcidin was 3.0 nM (IQR 2.0–5.0) versus 1.9 nM (1.4–2.9) (P < 0.0001) and 2) iron deficiency prevalence after 3 months was 5.5% versus 4.3% (P = 0.74) and after 6 months was 11.4% and 3.0% (P = 0.049).

### Deferasirox oral [^8263efa2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

During Therapy:

Monitor serum ferritin monthly and adjust the dose of deferasirox, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin trends.
Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin
Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals.
In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 mcg/L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered. Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Adjust dose based on serum ferritin levels
If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction, especially if the deferasirox dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox therapy to minimize the risk of overchelation and continue monthly monitoring.
Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation therapy for patients whose conditions no longer require regular blood transfusions.
Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
Interrupt deferasirox for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Fig. 1
Schematic representation of the study design. Enrolled women were randomly assigned to either the consecutive- or alternate-day study group. Participants in the consecutive-day group received daily 100 mg iron as FeSO 4 for 90 days, followed by daily placebo for another 90 days. Participants in the alternate-day group received 100 mg iron as FeSO 4 and placebo on alternate days for 180 days. Participants came fasting to the ETH for a morning study visit every ∼6 weeks for 6 months (days 0, 46, 90, 139, and 183), and for two additional visits 3 days following the midpoint and endpoint study visits (days 93 and 186). Participants from the alternate day group also came for a follow-up visit ∼4 months after the study endpoint visit.

Participants came fasting to the ETH for a morning study visit every ∼6 weeks for 6 months (days 0, 46, 90, 139, and 183), and for two additional visits 3 days following the midpoint and endpoint study visits (days 93 and 186) (Fig. 1). Participants from the alternate day group also came for a follow-up visit ∼4 months after the study endpoint visit. At baseline, height and weight were measured. We collected venipuncture blood samples (∼8 mL) at all study visits for assessment of Hb, iron, and inflammation status. On days 0, 90 and 183, participants brought in a stool sample, which they had collected at home within 48 h of the visit. On days 90 and 183, participants returned the capsule containers for capsule counts as a measure of compliance and a blood sample was collected. From days 90–93 to 183–186, participants did not consume any capsules, and venipuncture was then done on days 93 and 186. This delay allowed us to use serum ferritin as an unbiased measure of body iron stores, as serum ferritin is acutely elevated, independent of body iron stores, for 2 days after a high dose of supplemental iron. Along with serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), CRP, serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were measured on days 93 and 186. Hecidin, Hb, MCV (mean corpuscular volume), hematocrit and I-FABP were measured in the blood samples collected on days 90 and 183.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^d0139ecf]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How should patients be treated postoperatively?

Pharmacological optimisation of postoperative haemoglobin and erythropoiesis should allow correction of iron deficiency and rapid recovery from postoperative anaemia, which may lead to improved postoperative outcomes and improved quality of life. It may also result in a reduction of patient exposure to red cell transfusion and its related risk and complications, thus contributing further to improving surgical outcome and patient safety.

Iron therapy: oral vs. i.v. iron?

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK (NICE) recommends offering oral iron after surgery to patients with iron deficiency anaemia 12. However, in the postoperative period, oral iron is often not tolerated or absorbed and has several limitations including frequent gastro‐intestinal side‐effects and, as a consequence, poor treatment adherence. Additionally, the inflammatory response induced by surgery stimulates hepcidin synthesis and release, which in turn inhibits intestinal iron absorption, making oral iron therapy largely ineffective 10, 13, 50. Various randomised placebo‐controlled trials (RCT) in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated that oral iron therapy was not better than placebo in correcting postoperative anaemia and reducing transfusion requirements 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

On the other hand, NICE recommends considering i.v. iron after surgery for patients who have iron deficiency anaemia and cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron, or are unable to adhere to oral iron treatment, as well as for those who are diagnosed with functional iron deficiency 12. Thus, patients presenting with postoperative iron deficiency and/or moderate‐to‐severe postoperative anaemia (haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1) may benefit from i.v. iron supplementation, which has proven to be more effective than oral iron in a number of surgical settings (Supporting Information online, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Most recent RCTs have shown improved outcomes following high‐dose postoperative i.v. iron (e.g. 1000 mg) as demonstrated by increased haemoglobin and/or reduction in transfusion requirements, and no i.v. iron‐related serious adverse events were reported (Supporting Information, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 44, 45. Importantly, in orthopaedic surgical patients with postoperative haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1 and/or uncorrected pre‐operative iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 μg.l −1), a greater rise in haemoglobin and better scores for 'usual activities' were observed with high‐dose i.v. iron compared with oral iron 42.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^c2e4afd0]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Intravenous iron supplementation — indications, expected oral response thresholds, and infusion reaction management: Intravenous (IV) iron is indicated if a patient cannot tolerate oral iron or if blood counts or iron stores do not improve with oral iron supplementation. In anemic patients, hemoglobin levels should increase by 1 g/dL within 2 weeks in adherent patients on oral iron; a reasonable expectation is ferritin should increase in a month, and if these parameters are not met then IV iron should be used. IV iron should also be used when oral iron is unlikely to be effective due to impaired absorption (after bariatric surgery or with active inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]) or when iron loss exceeds oral absorption, although IV iron is substantially more expensive than oral formulations. Among available IV formulations, those that can replace iron deficits with 1 to 2 infusions are preferred. True allergy to IV iron is very rare, with most reactions being complement activation–related pseudo‑allergy; for mild reactions, stopping and restarting 15 minutes later at a slower rate will suffice, corticosteroids may help in more severe reactions, and diphenhydramine should be avoided because its side effects can mimic worsening reactions. Reported reaction rates are approximately 1:200 for mild reactions and 1:20,000 for major reactions.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^2bcd92de]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^01f545a7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations for treatment

The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend intravenous iron in adult patients with TSAT < 30% and serum ferritin < 500 mg/L if an increase in hemoglobin without starting ESA treatment is preferred or if a decrease in the current ESA dose is wanted. In patients with nondialysis dependent CKD, a 1–3 month trial of oral administration is suggested. In patients with end‐stage CKD on regular dialysis, the oral route is not recommended.

The 2013 European recommendations are similar but with a different threshold for iron supplementation, that is, TSAT < 20% and serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml (absolute ID) or — if an increase in Hb concentration without starting ESA treatment is desired — TSAT < 25% and serum ferritin < 200 ng/ml in nondialysis CKD patients and TSAT < 25% and serum ferritin < 300 ng/ml in dialysis patients. The limit of TSAT of 30% and serum ferritin of 500 ng/ml should not be exceeded in both nondialysis and dialysis CKD patients.

Knowledge gaps

ID in CKD patients is most often, if not exclusively, considered in the setting of anemia. Future studies should evaluate the efficacy of iron therapy in nondialysis CKD patients with ID but without anemia. Long‐term studies with mortality are also needed. There is a relationship between fatigue in CKD patients and the role of iron in ATP production in muscle cells. However, the impact of ID, independent of anemia, on neurological and cognitive disorders in CKD patients is also an insufficiently explored field.

### Circulating non-transferrin-bound iron after oral administration of supplemental and fortification doses of iron to healthy women: a randomized study [^0ccbad11]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

After the oral administration of iron, the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron may contribute to an increased risk of illness in malaria-endemic areas that lack effective medical services.

Objective

In healthy women with a range of body iron stores, we aimed to determine effects on the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron resulting from the oral administration of 1) a supplemental dose of iron (60 mg) with water, 2) a supplemental dose of iron (60 mg) with a standard test meal, and 3) a fortification dose of iron (6 mg) with a standard test meal.

Design

With the use of serum ferritin as the indicator, healthy women with replete iron stores (ferritin concentration > 25 μg/L; n = 16) and reduced iron stores (ferritin concentration ≤ 25 μg/L; n = 16) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, crossover study. After the oral administration of aqueous solutions of ferrous sulfate isotopically labeled with ⁵⁴Fe, ⁵⁷Fe, or ⁵⁸Fe, blood samples were collected for 8 h, and iron absorption was estimated by erythrocyte incorporation at 14 d.

Results

At 4 h, serum non-transferrin-bound iron reached peaks with geometric mean (95% CI) concentrations of 0.81 μmol/L (0.56, 1.1 μmol/L) for 60 mg Fe with water and 0.26 μmol/L (0.15, 0.38 μmol/L) for 60 mg Fe with food but was at assay limits of detection (0.1 μmol Fe/L) for 6 mg Fe with food. For the 60 mg Fe without food, the area under the curve over 8 h for serum non-transferrin-bound iron was positively correlated with the amount of iron absorbed (R = 0.49, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with serum ferritin (R = -0.39, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

In healthy women, the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron is determined by the rate and amount of iron absorbed. The highest concentrations of non-transferrin-bound iron resulted from the administration of supplemental doses of iron without food. Little or no circulating non-transferrin-bound iron resulted from the consumption of a meal with a fortification dose of iron.

### Iron deficiency in young basketball players: is a 100 μ g / L ferritin cut-off appropriate for iron supplementation? results of a randomized placebo-controlled study [^31e90a1f]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, after the 3‐month supplementation the ferritin level was significantly higher in the iron group than in the placebo group, but only a small portion of the athletes (15%) reached our expected ferritin level. Several studies assessed the effect of oral iron supplementation on iron status laboratory parameters in athletes with IDNA. A meta‐analysis by DellaValle et al. has concluded that 6−8 weeks of at least 100 mg of iron‐sulfate supplementation improves the level of ferritin or prevents the further decline of ferritin level in female athletes. In a study, Villanueva et al. assessed the effect of oral iron supplementation on laboratory parameters in elite soccer players, where they also found a significant increase in ferritin levels after 3 weeks of supplementation. Parallel to our results, Kang et al. did not find a blood count increase in IDNA athletes after iron supplementation. According to these results iron supplementation in IDNA athletes only refills the iron storages without any change in blood count parameters. This may have an indirect impact on the oxygen transport with modifying the iron‐dependent oxidative enzymes and respiratory proteins. We found statistically significant increase in blood iron concentration in the placebo group. However, we did not consider that clinically relevant, since blood iron levels can be influenced by a number of other factors: diurnal variation, fasting status, inflammatory status. A study examined the role of the serum iron level in the diagnosis of children (< 18 years) with ID. They concluded that the serum iron level is no longer recommended by guidelines and that it should not be used to establish the iron status.

### Iron supplementation, response in iron-deficiency anemia: analysis of five trials [^c51b3a08]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral iron-replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia, but it is often poorly tolerated or ineffective. Hemoglobin response at day 14 of oral iron may be useful in assessing whether and when to transition patients from oral to intravenous (IV) iron.

Methods

Pooled data from 5 randomized trials were analyzed to compare oral and IV iron-replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment criteria and assignment to oral versus IV iron were defined per protocol; this analysis included only subjects receiving oral iron. Responders were subjects with ≥ 1.0-g/dL increases in hemoglobin at day 14, and nonresponders were those with smaller increases. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated for association with hemoglobin response at multiple timepoints.

Results

Most subjects (72.8%) were classified as responders. The proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases ≥ 1.0, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 3.0 g/dL was greatest among those with postpartum anemia, intermediate among those with heavy uterine bleeding or gastrointestinal-related causes of anemia, and lowest among those with other causes; this proportion was also significantly greater among responders than nonresponders. A ≥ 1.0-g/dL increase in hemoglobin on day 14 most accurately predicted satisfactory overall hemoglobin response to oral iron on day 42/56 (sensitivity 90.1%; specificity 79.3%; positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 72.7%, respectively). Iron-replacement therapy improved quality of life and reduced fatigue.

Conclusion

Hemoglobin responses < 1.0 g/dL at day 14 of oral iron identify subjects with iron-deficiency anemia who should be transitioned to IV iron supplementation.

### Blunted increase in serum hepcidin as response to oral iron in HFE-hemochromatosis [^dec7601a]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

HFE hemochromatosis (HFE-H) is the most common and well-defined inherited cause for iron-related morbidity and mortality. Majority of patients with HFE-H are homozygote for C282Y mutation. Recent studies suggest that iron accumulation in most types of hemochromatosis is due to deficiency of hepcidin, a central iron regulator. However, the precise link between hepcidin levels and iron absorption in HFE-H patients has been poorly understood.

Aim

To measure hepcidin response to oral iron challenge (200 mg ferrous sulphate), in HFE-H (C282Y/C282Y) patients and compare with healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

Nine patients with C282Y/C282Y HFE-H along with 15 HC were recruited for the study. All HFE-H were iron depleted and studied at a time distant to phlebotomy. Hepcidin was measured using a published immunoassay method after ingestion of 65 mg oral iron challenge. Serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured using standard methods. The area under the curve was calculated and compared between the two groups.

Results

The basal serum hepcidin levels in patients with HFE-H were significantly low as compared with HC (P = 0.0002). Incremental serum hepcidin response seen in HC reached significance at 4 h post iron challenge (P = 0.0085) returning to baseline only at 24 h. There was no significant hepcidin response in HFE-H at 4 h (P = 0.294). The overall hepcidin response was significantly lower in HFE-H compared with HC (area under the curve: P = 0.0127).

Conclusion

Failure to mount a rapid hepcidin response to an oral iron challenge is the key mechanisms of iron accumulation despite prevailing excess body iron in patients with HFE-H with C282Y/C282Y mutation.

### Oral iron supplementation after blood donation: a randomized clinical trial [^cc0c6f5a]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Although blood donation is allowed every 8 weeks in the United States, recovery of hemoglobin to the currently accepted standard (12.5 g/dL) is frequently delayed, and some donors become anemic.

Objective

To determine the effect of oral iron supplementation on hemoglobin recovery time (days to recovery of 80% of hemoglobin removed) and recovery of iron stores in iron-depleted ("low ferritin", ≤ 26 ng/mL) and iron-replete ("higher ferritin", > 26 ng/mL) blood donors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, nonblinded clinical trial of blood donors stratified by ferritin level, sex, and age conducted in 4 regional blood centers in the United States in 2012. Included were 215 eligible participants aged 18 to 79 years who had not donated whole blood or red blood cells within 4 months.

Interventions

One tablet of ferrous gluconate (37.5 mg of elemental iron) daily or no iron for 24 weeks (168 days) after donating a unit of whole blood (500 mL).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time to recovery of 80% of the postdonation decrease in hemoglobin and recovery of ferritin level to baseline as a measure of iron stores.

Results

The mean baseline hemoglobin levels were comparable in the iron and no-iron groups and declined from a mean (SD) of 13.4 (1.1) g/dL to 12.0 (1.2) g/dL after donation in the low-ferritin group and from 14.2 (1.1) g/dL to 12.9 (1.2) g/dL in the higher-ferritin group. Compared with participants who did not receive iron supplementation, those who received iron supplementation had shortened time to 80% hemoglobin recovery in both the low-ferritin (mean, 32 days, interquartile range [IQR], 30–34, vs 158 days, IQR, 126- > 168) and higher-ferritin groups (31 days, IQR, 29–33, vs 78 days, IQR, 66–95). Median time to recovery to baseline ferritin levels in the low-ferritin group taking iron was 21 days (IQR, 12–84). For participants not taking iron, recovery to baseline was longer than 168 days (IQR, 128- > 168). Median time to recovery to baseline in the higher-ferritin group taking iron was 107 days (IQR, 75–141), and for participants not taking iron, recovery to baseline was longer than 168 days (IQR, > 168- > 168). Recovery of iron stores in all participants who received supplements took a median of 76 days (IQR, 20–126); for participants not taking iron, median recovery time was longer than 168 days (IQR, 147- > 168 days; P < .001). Without iron supplements, 67% of participants did not recover iron stores by 168 days.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among blood donors with normal hemoglobin levels, low-dose iron supplementation, compared with no supplementation, reduced time to 80% recovery of the postdonation decrease in hemoglobin concentration in donors with low ferritin (≤ 26 ng/mL) or higher ferritin (> 26 ng/mL).

### Optimal oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia among US veterans [^b17eeaa0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral iron supplementation is a preferred approach to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA). However, iron absorption from supplements in iron-depleted patients is low (2%-13% with food and 5%-28% without food). To compensate for this low absorption and to increase bioavailability, large iron doses are often administered in divided doses, typically 2 to 3 times per day.

Hepcidin is the central regulatory molecule in iron metabolism. Oral iron supplements acutely increase serum hepcidin level, and a higher level of hepcidin inhibits further absorption of iron from the gut. Hence, acute hepcidin rise triggered by a morning iron dose might lead to poor absorption of an afternoon or evening dose of oral iron. Furthermore, hepcidin levels are elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may impair the absorption of oral iron and reduce the efficacy of oral iron supplementation in patients with IDA and CKD. However, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline recommends trials of oral iron 2 to 3 times per day in patients with IDA.

A recent studyshowed no difference in fractional oral iron absorption between single daily doses vs divided daily doses in iron deficient patients without anemia. Furthermore, compared with daily iron dosing, alternate-day iron dosing showed 34% higher rate of iron absorption. However, the association of this less frequent iron supplementation with hemoglobin and iron indices has not been properly investigated among patients with IDA who have either normal kidney function (NKF) or CKD. We investigated the association of 2 to 3 times a day oral iron administration (typical clinical practice) vs once daily oral iron administration vs alternate day oral iron administration with the change of hemoglobin and iron indices in patients with NKF and CKD.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^a00ffb6f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to iron supplementation, choice of formulation, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer oral iron once a day at most. Consider using every-other-day iron dosing for better tolerance in some patients, with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing.

### Alternate day versus consecutive day oral iron supplementation in iron-depleted women: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^b4ce2d91]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparative studies which attempt to retrospectively ascertain side effects through interview are subject to both recall bias and inaccurate recall. Recall accuracy is higher with shorter time intervals since occurrence and high subject motivation. Our specifically-designed mobile application enabled daily contact with our subjects to assess compliance and side effects via simple forced-choice questions. Reception of the application was overwhelmingly positive. A recent review reported multiple benefits of mobile apps for side effect reportingand the use of the mobile app likely improved adherence and reporting accuracy in our study.

This study has several strengths. The study was rigorously double blind and capsule adherence was very high. Our design allowed us to assess the intervention effect in two ways: comparing the same treatment length with different total iron doses, and the same total iron dose with different treatment lengths. However, it did not allow us to compare the same total iron dose given over the same treatment length. Future studies could be done to compare equal total doses given over the same treatment length by doubling the dose given on the alternate day. This study also has limitations. Because the subjects were prompted by the mobile app to take their supplements, adherence was high in both groups; without these daily reminders, adherence may have varied. Only a small number of our participants were mildly anemic; we did not study women with moderate-to-severe anemia, who might respond differently to those with no anemia or mild anemia.

Our findings show that, compared to consecutive day dosing of iron, alternate day dosing did not result in higher serum ferritin but led to a reduction in iron deficiency at 6 months and triggered fewer GI side effects. It appears the increase in FIA with alternate day dosing does not fully offset the halving of the iron dose per unit time, so alternate day dosing reduces total iron absorption per unit time compared to consecutive day dosing. This may not be optimal in women with symptomatic iron deficiency anemia, in whom rapid repletion of body iron is needed. Nevertheless, in most women with iron deficiency, speed of response is not critical, but maintaining good compliance with oral iron is difficult. Alternate day iron dosing will likely be better tolerated by many women, and this may increase compliance and efficacy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^85945b17]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in CKD — iron status tests and responsiveness: The TSAT and serum ferritin level have only limited sensitivity and specificity in patients with CKD for prediction of bone marrow iron stores and erythropoietic response to iron supplementation, and their utility is further compromised by substantial inter-patient variability unrelated to changes in iron store status. A very low serum ferritin (< 30 ng/ml [< 30 µg/l]) is indicative of iron deficiency, yet a substantial fraction of CKD patients with anemia and TSAT ≥ 20% respond to iron supplementation.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^1bcc9073]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations for treatment

Recommendations for iron supplementation vary according to the guidelines. The NCCN guidelines are mainly for anemic patients receiving ESA, not with ID alone. Intravenous or oral iron is recommended for absolute ID (serum ferritin < 30 ng/ml and TSAT < 20%); failure to correct anemia within 4 weeks should lead to consideration of functional ID. Intravenous iron is recommended in functional ID (serum ferritin 30–500 µg/L and TSAT < 20%) in patients on ESA therapy.

According to ESMO guidelines, ID should be corrected as soon as serum ferritin levels are < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 20% regardless of anemia. Oral iron treatment can only be considered in patients with absolute ID with ferritin < 30 µg/L and in the absence of an inflammatory state (C‐reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L).

Knowledge gaps

ID remains insufficiently diagnosed in cancer patients and guidelines recommendations are insufficiently applied. Iron therapy is generally considered only a supportive care treatment, combined with ESA in advanced cancer disease. There is a lack of data on ID with or without anemia in the early phases of cancer in patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. The insufficient use of iron therapy by oncologists may be related to previous concerns and uncertainties regarding iron administration in this setting. Although iron therapy is recommended in patients controlled with antitumor treatment, iron is also considered as a promising target in cancer progression because it facilitates cell proliferation and growth. In addition, blood transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of cancer development. Long‐term studies on the efficacy and safety of iron therapy could help convince oncologists to systematically diagnose and treat ID, especially during the early phase of the cancer disease, thus avoiding the need for ESA or transfusions when anemia is established and more problematic to treat.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Rapid growth is a dominant predictor of hepcidin suppression and declining ferritin in Gambian infants [^3072d66b]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are highly prevalent in low-income countries, especially among young children. Hepcidin is the major regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. It controls dietary iron absorption, dictates whether absorbed iron is made available in circulation for erythropoiesis and other iron-demanding processes, and predicts response to oral iron supplementation. Understanding how hepcidin is itself regulated is therefore important, especially in young children. We investigated how changes in iron-related parameters, inflammation and infection status, seasonality, and growth influenced plasma hepcidin and ferritin concentrations during infancy using longitudinal data from two birth cohorts of infants in rural Gambia (n = 114 and n = 193). This setting is characterized by extreme seasonality, prevalent childhood anemia, undernutrition, and frequent infection. Plasma was collected from infants at birth and at regular intervals, up to 12 months of age. Hepcidin, ferritin and plasma iron concentrations declined markedly during infancy, with reciprocal increases in soluble transferrin receptor and transferrin concentrations, indicating declining iron stores and increasing tissue iron demand. In cross-sectional analyses at 5 and 12 months of age, we identified expected relationships of hepcidin with iron and inflammatory markers, but also observed significant negative associations between hepcidin and antecedent weight gain. Correspondingly, longitudinal fixed effects modeling demonstrated weight gain to be the most notable dynamic predictor of decreasing hepcidin and ferritin through infancy across both cohorts. Infants who grow rapidly in this setting are at particular risk of depletion of iron stores, but since hepcidin concentrations decrease with weight gain, they may also be the most responsive to oral iron interventions.

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^f6924aee]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

These findings demonstrate that oral iron supplements alone provide hemoglobin level and iron storage recovery efficacy equivalent to that of oral iron supplemented with vitamin C in patients with IDA. To our knowledge, this RCT is the first to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin C supplements combined with oral iron in patients with IDA.

Oral iron provides an inexpensive and effective means of restoring iron balance in patients with IDA. Vitamin C is the only dietary constituent other than animal tissue that has been shown to promote the absorption of nonheme iron in humans. Thus, some clinicians, who believe that vitamin C can improve the efficacy of oral iron and speed up the treatment of anemia, recommend taking vitamin C supplements combined with oral iron tablets. However, the absolute dose of vitamin C did not appear to be associated with iron absorption with a complete diet, and the improvement in iron status was not noticeable, which was consistent with our findings that oral iron alone provides efficacy equivalent to that of oral iron with vitamin C. The changes in hemoglobin level were similar between the 2 groups at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. The mean difference in hemoglobin level change was within the equivalence margin of ± 1 g/dL, which is the threshold for clinically significant change recommended by hematologists. Notably, the changes in MCV from baseline to all time points were slightly greater in the vitamin C plus iron group. MCV is a measure of the mean size of RBCs, and patients with IDA typically have lower than normal values. The RBC parameters MCH, MCV, and MCHC are more sensitive and helpful to monitor the response to a treatment. However, the aim of treatment was restoring hemoglobin levels and replenishing iron stores, neither of which was sensitive to the treatment. Iron metabolism parameters such as serum ferritin, serum iron, iron saturation, and TIBC at week 8 were comparable between the 2 groups. Adverse events were also equivalent between the 2 groups.

These results challenge the recommendation to take vitamin C supplements with oral iron to improve the efficacy and speed up the recovery from anemia. Iron is absorbed as the ferrous salt (Fe ++) in a mildly acidic medium. In theory, vitamin C is helpful in its absorption. However, in light of the results of this RCT, vitamin C may be less beneficial than reported and expected.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

### How can sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors stimulate erythrocytosis in patients who are iron-deficient? Implications for understanding iron homeostasis in heart failure [^2a968f8f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In light of the influence of inflammation on circulating levels of conventionally‐measured iron homeostatic proteins in heart failure, the available evidence suggests that the iron deficiency state in most patients with heart failure is functional, rather than absolute; a similar judgment has been reached by other investigators. This conclusion is supported by observations that (i) hepcidin and ferritin are increased in patients with heart failure until the disease becomes advanced;, and (ii) iron‐deficient patients with heart failure show clinical benefits in response to intravenously (but not orally) administered iron supplements, presumably related to hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of duodenal iron absorption. A similar discordance in the responsiveness to intravenous vs oral iron therapy has been observed when patients with chronic kidney disease and functional iron deficiency are treated with erythropoietin‐stimulating agents.

### Efficacy of daily versus intermittent oral iron supplementation for prevention of anaemia among pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b696ea9f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To enhance the effectiveness of iron supplementation programs, intermittent iron supplementation has emerged as a promising alternative. The mucosal block theory suggests that loading the mucosa with iron during the first dose may inhibit the absorption of subsequent doses. By reducing the frequency of dosing to once or twice a week to match mucosal turnover, each iron tablet may be better absorbed, necessitating a lower overall iron dose. While animal studies support this hypothesis, human studies utilizing radiolabelled iron have shown only minimal reductions in absorption following previous iron administration. Recently it has been observed that iron supplementation induces an increase in serum hepcidin that persists for 24 h, decreasing iron absorption from supplements given later on the same or the next day. Hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis is primarily synthesized in the liver and released into the bloodstream. Its production increases in response to high iron levels and inflammation, while decreasing when erythropoiesis occurs. This hormone regulates systemic iron levels by interacting with ferroportin, a protein responsible for exporting iron from cells. The rise in serum hepcidin level was significantly linked to reduced absorption from the second iron dose administered 24 h after the initial dose. It was noted that oral iron at doses of 60 mg or higher, when given at least 48 h apart, demonstrated a higher fractional absorption. A study by Stoffel et al. found that taking 60 mg iron supplements every other day led to 34% higher iron absorption compared to taking them daily. In another study, a decline in iron absorption 48 h after the last administered dose was not observed, contrary to the postulation of a mucosal block lasting up to five or six days. The evidence suggests that, oral iron supplementation on alternate days leads to increased absorption of iron. Reducing the frequency of supplementation has been proposed as a means to mitigate transient iron overload and could potentially alleviate adverse effects like nausea and epigastric pain by diminishing the daily iron content in the gastrointestinal tract.

Results

Study population characteristics

613 pregnant women with anaemia were identified at the IMIP laboratory web system and 487 were contacted by the research team and sought us at the time of their routine prenatal consultation. Among them, 246 met the inclusion criteria, but 24 did not accept to participate in the study and 35 were excluded, totaling a sample of 187 pregnant women, who were included and followed between August 2011 and December 2012 (a flow diagram showing inclusions, losses and failures to undergo index-testes and reference-standard test can be seen in the supplementary material of this article - Additional file 3). There were 25.7% of losses: 43 follow-up losses and five exclusions for not taking the minimum effective iron doses (indeterminate results of the reference standard - Table 2), totaling 37 iron-responsive plus 102 not iron-responsive women. Women had ingested 31 to 180 iron pills during 23 to 125 days. This period differed of study protocol due to delays between monthly evaluations as they happened at the routine prenatal care.

The characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1, according to the presence or not of responsiveness to the therapeutic test with oral iron (reference standard). Almost all of the pregnant women lived in the urban area. The sociodemographic and clinical-obstetric characteristics did not differ and the women using daily iron supplements for more than 1 month before the study (n 23) were homogeneously distributed between the groups.

The laboratory pre-treatment characteristics showed some differences between the two groups. The means of Hb and Hb Z-scores were significantly lower in the group with iron-responsive anaemia; and the median of serum ferritin levels tended to be lower in this group, without statistical significance. Regarding to the therapeutic characteristics, more than 90% of the pregnant women in both groups ingested at least 1,800 mg of elemental iron until the follow-up end; the gastrointestinal complains were less frequent, while the duration and the number of iron pills ingested were higher among not iron-responsive women.

### Intravenous iron replacement for iron deficiency anemia… [^0e1b5789]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: The FPIN by Dr. Mounsey and colleagues emphasizes the lack of mortality benefit for intravenous iron over oral iron. 1 However, there are clinical situations in which intravenous iron is preferred. The first category is when stress or inflammatory conditions have produced increased hepcidin levels which decrease iron absorption in the gut and lack of response to oral iron. The 2022 American College of Cardiology guidelines indicate, "In patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency with or without anemia, intravenous iron replacement is reasonable to improve functional status and QOL". 2 The second category is when morbidity is associated with the slow correction of iron stores via the oral route.

With oral iron, "3 to 6 months of treatment are required for the repletion of iron stores and the normalization of serum ferritin levels. " 3 Intravenous iron is indicated in cases of intolerance or poor effectiveness of the oral route, in active disease, or in patients with more severe anemia.
4. Although intravenous iron administration has risks, these can be minimized using newer iron compounds such as ferric carboxymaltose, in which adjusted incidence rates for anaphylaxis per 10, 000 first administrations were
0. 8 cases. 5 Although there may be lack of mortality benefit, better clinical outcomes would seem to justify the inconvenience and cost of intravenous iron in appropriate situations.

Data extraction

The titles and abstracts of the articles obtained using the search strategy were uploaded to the online Rayyan software for screening. Two reviewers (AB & SA) independently screened for eligibility by initial evaluation of abstracts. The full texts of all the eligible articles were downloaded and further screened for final inclusion in the meta-analysis. Any kind of conflicts for study inclusion were resolved by discussion and consensus was reached with the help of a third reviewer (NK). For multiple articles citing the same patient data, only one of the key papers was chosen and other articles were used for any supplementary data extraction if required. In the case of studies where more than two arms were present, each arm of intermittent dose was noted separately in comparison to the daily supplementation. Also, one study had separate data for anaemic and non-anaemic pregnant women and hence the data was considered twice with data recorded for each population separately.

SA performed data extraction from the final selection of articles using a standardized data format. Information related to the title of the paper, first author, year of publication, study design, country of the study population, type of publication, sample size, week of gestation, type of population (anaemic or non-anaemic), study duration, dose of iron supplement, frequency of dose, any other supplements, mean and standard deviation (SD) of baseline and post-treatment levels of haemoglobin and ferritin are recorded wherever available. Additionally, the frequency of side effects, if available, was also included in the data extraction sheet. All data extraction was checked by a second reviewer (NK or AB). The primary outcome measure of the study was a rise in haemoglobin levels. The secondary outcomes included the change in ferritin levels and side effects due to iron supplementation.

Outcomes

The following outcome measures were evaluated in the studies.
a) Baseline and endpoint haemoglobin levels in pregnant women on oral iron supplementation.
b) Serum ferritin levels in pregnant women on oral iron supplementation.
c) Adverse events of oral iron supplementation.

### The benefits of iron supplementation following blood donation vary with baseline iron status [^333efd89]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Whole blood donation rapidly removes approximately 10% of a donor's blood volume and stimulates substantial changes in iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. We sought to identify donors who benefit from iron supplementation, describe the nature of the benefit, and define the time course for recovery from donation. Blood samples were collected over 24weeks following whole blood donation from 193 participants, with 96 participants randomized to 37.5 mg daily oral iron. Changes in total body, red blood cell (RBC), and storage iron, hepcidin, erythropoietin, and reticulocyte count were modeled using semiparametric curves in a mixed model. and the changes were compared among six groups defined by baseline ferritin (< 12; 12–50; ≥ 50ng/mL) and iron supplementation. The effect of oral iron on storage and RBC iron recovery was minimal in donors with baseline ferritin ≥ 50ng/mL, but sizeable when ferritin was < 50ng/mL. Iron initially absorbed went to RBC and storage iron pools when ferritin was < 12ng/mL but went mostly to RBCs when ferritin was ≥ 12ng/mL. Donors with ferritin ≥ 12ng/mL had a "ripple" increase in reticulocytes ~100days after donation indicating physiological responses occur months following donation. Thus, iron supplements markedly enhance recovery from whole blood donation in donors with ferritin < 50ng/mL. However, full recovery from donation requires over 100days when taking iron. The findings also highlight the value of the study of blood donors for understanding human hemoglobin and iron metabolism and their usefulness for future studies as additional biomarkers are discovered.

### Oral iron for prevention and treatment of rickets and osteomalacia in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemia [^66fdb7ff]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Oral Iron Therapy Reverses the ADH Phenotype

In 2015, Kapelari and colleagues 12 were the first to report an iron‐deficient girl with ADH and active rickets whose phosphate metabolism normalized and rickets fully healed on oral iron treatment alongside normalization in ferritin levels, allowing for rickets medication to be discontinued. In 2019, the Chinese group 11 also reported improvement and normalization in phosphate metabolism in several symptomatic, iron‐deficient ADH patients using oral iron therapy but did not provide comprehensive treatment data.

In this issue of the Journal of Bone Mineral Research (JBMR), Imel and colleagues 13 corroborate the role of oral iron in ADH reversal in a well‐conducted prospective study in five adults. Oral iron doses were titrated to serum iron concentrations and reached 130 to 260 mg/day at the end of the study. The study is remarkable because, despite its small sample size (n = 5), it depicts two distinctly different groups of patients. At baseline, the three hypophosphatemic subjects with the highest FGF23 concentrations were iron deficient and had a striking increase in serum phosphorus concentrations in response to oral iron therapy and only a mild increase in ferritin. This remarkable response was much in contrast to the two subjects who at baseline had normal FGF23, phosphorus, and ferritin levels and showed no clinically meaningful response in phosphate or FGF23 to iron therapy. These two subjects had been iron sufficient at baseline and demonstrated, in fact, a sharp and continuous increase in serum ferritin during the study to levels over 200 μg/L, which raises concerns about iron overload if iron therapy was to be continued. The WHO defines the criteria for iron overload as serum ferritin concentrations over 150 and 200 μg/L in females and males, respectively. 14

### Iron dextran [^5bc98c29]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

### Iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing in iron-depleted women: two open-label, randomised controlled trials [^7327d54f]. The Lancet: Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines to treat iron deficiency recommend daily provision of ferrous iron divided through the day to increase absorption. However, daily dosing and split dosing might increase serum hepcidin and decrease iron absorption from subsequent doses. Our study aim was to compare iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and given as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing.

Methods

We did two prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trials assessing iron absorption using (54 Fe)-labelled, (57 Fe)-labelled, or (58 Fe)-labelled ferrous sulfate in iron-depleted (serum ferritin ≤ 25 μg/L) women aged 18–40 years recruited from ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, Switzerland. In study 1, women were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups. One group was given 60 mg iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) on consecutive days for 14 days, and the other group was given the same doses on alternate days for 28 days. In study 2, women were assigned to two groups, stratified by serum ferritin so that two groups with similar iron statuses could be formed. One group was given 120 mg iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) and the other was given the dose split into two divided doses of 60 mg at 0800 h (± 1 h) and 1700 h (± 1 h) for three consecutive days. 14 days after the final dose, the groups were each crossed over to the other regimen. Within-individual comparisons were done. The co-primary outcomes in both studies were iron bioavailability (total and fractional iron absorption), assessed by measuring the isotopic label abundance in erythrocytes 14 days after administration, and serum hepcidin. Group allocations in both studies were not masked and primary and safety analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02175888 (study 1) and NCT02177851 (study 2) and are complete.

Findings

For study 1, 40 women were enrolled on Oct 15–29, 2015. 21 women were assigned to the consecutive-day group and 19 to the alternate-day group. At the end of treatment (14 days for the consecutive-day group and 28 days for the alternate-day group), geometric mean (-SD, +SD) cumulative fractional iron absorptions were 16.3% (9.3, 28.8) in the consecutive-day group versus 21.8% (13.7, 34.6) in the alternate-day group (p = 0.0013), and cumulative total iron absorption was 131.0 mg (71.4, 240.5) versus 175.3 mg (110.3, 278.5; p = 0.0010). During the first 14 days of supplementation in both groups, serum hepcidin was higher in the consecutive-day group than the alternate-day group (p = 0.0031). In study 2, 20 women were enrolled between Aug 13 and 18, 2015. Ten women were assigned to receive once-daily dosing and ten were assigned to receive twice-daily divided dosing. No significant differences were seen in fractional (day 1–3 geometric mean: 11.8% [7.1, 19.4] once daily vs 13.1% [8.2, 20.7] twice daily; p = 0.33) or total iron absorption (day 1–3: 44.3 mg [29.4, 66.7] once daily vs 49.4 [35.2, 69.4] twice daily; p = 0.33) between the two dosing regimens. Twice-daily divided doses resulted in a higher serum hepcidin concentration than once-daily dosing (p = 0.013). No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in either study.

Interpretation

In iron-depleted women, providing iron supplements daily as divided doses increases serum hepcidin and reduces iron absorption. Providing iron supplements on alternate days and in single doses optimises iron absorption and might be a preferable dosing regimen. These findings should be confirmed in iron-deficient anaemic patients.

### Clinical experience with ferric carboxymaltose in the treatment of cancer-and chemotherapy-associated anaemia [^011760c6]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Since patients with baseline serum ferritin levels < 100 ng/ml achieved a more rapid Hb increase, low baseline ferritin is a good indicator of depleted iron stores and predicts rapid treatment response. These patients can benefit most from i.v. iron therapy. Furthermore, the observed Hb improvement in patients with low mean baseline TSAT (14.2%) and ferritin baseline levels up to 500 ng/ml confirms that cancer patients can experience a shortage in available iron despite elevated ferritin levels (FID). Accordingly, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the concomitant use of i.v. iron and ESAs in patients with ferritin up to 800 ng/ml, if TSAT is < 20%. Patients with FID can particularly benefit from i.v. iron treatment. Currently, only a small proportion of patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia are treated with iron, and the majority of these receive oral iron, although this is less effective in patients with FID and associated with gastrointestinal intolerance and poor compliance.

Higher baseline TSAT levels (28.8%) and more advanced disease in patients with serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml might be the reason why this subgroup of patients showed a slower response to iron treatment, although they received a higher total dose per patient. Notably, Hb responders in this population had a lower mean baseline TSAT than non-responders. However, the number of patients in this subpopulation is too low to draw conclusions on the predictive role of TSAT in patients with ongoing acute-phase reactions. Observed fluctuations in Hb levels may be a consequence of the small patient numbers in this group.

In general, FCM at total iron doses of 600–1500 mg was well tolerated. ADRs were recorded for only 14 (2.3%) patients, and the mortality and completion rate are in line with a population of cancer patients in which 27.9% were receiving second-line or higher anti-tumour therapy, and 64.2% had metastatic disease. Serum ferritin values increased markedly from baseline to termination visit across all groups without any indications of iron overload or increased adverse reactions.

### Deferasirox (deferasorox) [^62d4d5f5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

 During Therapy:

Monitor serum ferritin monthly and adjust the dose of deferasirox oral granules, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin trends.
Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin
Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals.
In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 mcg/L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered. Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Adjust dose based on serum ferritin levels
If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction especially if the deferasirox oral granules dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox oral granules therapy to minimize the risk of overchelation, and continue monthly monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation therapy for patients whose conditions no longer require regular blood transfusions.
Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
Interrupt deferasirox oral granules for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### The FIND-CKD study – a randomized controlled trial of intravenous iron versus oral iron in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients: background and rationale [^9e716602]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rigorous data are sparse concerning the optimal route of administration and dosing strategy for iron therapy with or without concomitant erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD).

Methods

FIND-CKD was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective, randomized three-arm study (NCT00994318) of 626 patients with ND-CKD and iron deficiency anaemia randomized to (i) intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) at an initial dose of 1000 mg iron with subsequent dosing as necessary to target a serum ferritin level of 400–600 µg/L (ii) IV FCM at an initial dose of 200 mg with subsequent dosing as necessary to target serum ferritin 100–200 µg/L or (iii) oral ferrous sulphate 200 mg iron/day. The primary end point was time to initiation of other anaemia management (ESA therapy, iron therapy other than study drug or blood transfusion) or a haemoglobin (Hb) trigger (two consecutive Hb values < 10 g/dL without an increase of ≥ 0.5 g/dL).

Results

The background, rationale and study design of the trial are presented here. The study has been completed and results are expected in late 2013.

Discussion

FIND-CKD was the longest randomized trial of IV iron therapy to date. Its findings will address several unanswered questions regarding iron therapy to treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients with ND-CKD. It was also the first randomized trial to utilize both a high and low serum ferritin target range to adjust IV iron dosing, and the first not to employ Hb response as its primary end point.

### Oral versus high dose parenteral iron supplementation in pregnancy [^e53c9f1b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect of daily oral iron supplementation with two injections of high dose parenteral iron.

Method

A total of 220 pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy and hemoglobin between 8 to 11 g% at 16–24 weeks gestation were identified and randomly divided into two groups. Group A was started on daily oral iron therapy of 100 mg of elemental iron. Group B was given 250 mg of iron sorbitol intramuscularly and repeated at an interval of 4–6 weeks. Blood indices were evaluated at the beginning of study and at 36 weeks to see the effect after iron supplementation in the two groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 10.1.

Results

Definitive and comparable improvement in hemoglobin and all the blood indices (hematocrit, MCH, MCHC, MCV, Serum iron and TIBC) was observed. The absolute change in hemoglobin and hematocrit was 1.18 ± 0.68 g% and 4.02 ± 2.59% in oral group, 1.34 ± 0.77 g% and 4.93 ± 3.65% in parenteral group, respectively. Serum ferritin showed statistically significant absolute rise (10.43 ± 7.92 microg/dl) after parenteral iron supplementation as compared to oral iron supplementation (9.76 ± 4.78 microg/dl). Obstetric outcome was comparable in two groups.

Conclusion

Two treatment regimens are biologically equivalent in terms of hematological response. Two high doses of intramuscular iron can be a good substitute to meet iron requirement in pregnancy.

### FIND-CKD: a randomized trial of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anaemia [^8bc3d2fd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency may benefit from IV iron treatment targeting a higher ferritin level. Both IV and oral iron therapy were effective in increasing Hb, ferritin and TSAT levels in this setting; however, FCM therapy with a higher ferritin target was shown to be superior to oral iron in delaying and/or reducing the requirement for other anaemia management or occurrence of an Hb trigger during the 12-month study, as well as producing a faster haematological response with a greater proportion of patients achieving an Hb increase of ≥ 1 g/dL. These results were achieved with relatively few FCM injections and despite selecting patients for inclusion in the study who might be expected to do well on oral iron therapy. High-ferritin FCM was well tolerated, with fewer treatment-related adverse events and study discontinuations versus oral iron and within the limitations of this trial, no renal toxicity and no increases in cardiovascular or infectious events were observed. These findings support current guidelines, which recommend a trial of iron therapy if an increase in Hb without ESA therapy is desired in patients with CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency. Furthermore, based on the findings in this study, targeting a higher ferritin level with IV FCM may contribute to improved anaemia management.

Follow up

The goal of iron supplementation should always be complete normalization of Hb and iron storage. It should be kept in mind that even after normalization of Hb levels, iron storages are still not filled up because anemia is only the end point of iron deficiency. Iron treatments should be followed up clinically and using laboratory tests at least within 4 weeks in asymptomatic patients and more frequently in symptomatic patients. An important surveillance factor is the wellbeing of the patient. Clinically, QoL can improve within a few days after initiation of iron therapy and previous symptoms of anemia decrease.

An adequate erythropoietic response has been defined as an increase of Hb of at least 2 g/dl or normalization within 4 weeks. As described above, reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index are faster parameters of successful treatment and will be increased within 1–2 weeks following oral or intravenous iron with or without EPO.

As described above, iron storage can be assessed using ferritin and transferrin saturation. During oral or intravenous iron supplementation, transferrin saturation can be falsely elevated. Ferritin levels also overestimate the iron available for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow during intravenous iron treatment. Therefore, assessment of iron storage should only be performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the last intravenous iron application. After termination of iron therapy, the parameters of iron storage should be above the lower limits of normal. A recent study has pointed out that the time until reoccurrence of iron deficiency in patients with IBD can be delayed with higher post-treatment ferritin values above 100 μg and even more so above 400 μg/liter. However, it was suggested that a ferritin level of 800 μg/liter and a transferrin saturation of 50% should be used as upper limits for intravenous iron to prevent iron overload.

Patients on oral iron should be monitored clinically about tolerability and side effects. In oral iron therapy, ferritin can be used for monitoring during treatment and is expected to increase within 1–2 weeks and Hb levels should also be monitored.

If a patient is on oral iron and the erythropoetic response is not adequate, or if oral iron is not tolerated, the patient should be switched to intravenous iron. If treatment with intravenous iron is not successful, other causes of anemia should be reevaluated. If (concomitant) ACD is possible, additional use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors should be considered. Optimal treatment of the underlying IBD is also an important factor in the treatment of anemia at all levels.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^95bc0308]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron replacement therapy

The goal of iron replacement therapy is to correct IDA or non-anemic ID and replete iron stores. Iron can be administered in oral or intravenous formulations. Oral iron is usually the first line of therapy due to its convenience to use, availability over the counter and low cost of its mainstream formulations (Table 1). Effective iron repletion with oral supplements requires relatively high doses of 50–200 mg/day of elemental iron for 3–12 weeks. Only ~10–20% of it gets absorbed, resulting in accumulation of excess iron in the digestive tract, which causes gastrointestinal side effects. Excess iron may also alter the microbiota diversity and composition, shifting the balance towards pathogenic bacteria. These responses are tightly linked to increased susceptibility to infections, intestinal inflammationand metabolic syndrome pathologies.

Intravenous iron therapy is of paramount importance for the treatment of severe IDA when fast repletion of iron stores is desired (e.g. in patients awaiting surgery), or when intestinal iron absorption is impaired and oral iron is ineffective (e.g. in many patients with IBD or CKD). Candidates for intravenous iron are also iron-deficient patients with poor tolerance to oral iron, and women with heavy menstrual bleeding or in late pregnancy. Compared to oral iron, intravenous iron increases hemoglobin levels and iron stores faster. Potential side effects are the risk of infections, hypophosphatemia, and acute hypersensitivity reactions, which can vary from mild itching and flushing to severe anaphylaxis. The extent of side effects depends on the type and dose of intravenous iron formulation, and the infusion time. Anaphylactic reactions are very rare but can be life-threatening. Therefore, administration of intravenous iron should always be performed in an adequately equipped medical facility with the assistance of trained health care providers. The cost of an intravenous iron infusion varies between $400–4,000, depending on the product and the facility providing the treatment.

### Optimal oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia among US veterans [^3e8531f4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study results differ substantially from what was published by others. We had a large sample size and studied changes in hemoglobin up to 6 months. Although we do not have a clear explanation for our findings, hepcidin dynamics with oral iron have previously been studied mainly with healthy young females. Our patients, on the other hand, were older males with IDA and multiple comorbidities. It is possible that our patients might have had slightly higher baseline serum hepcidin levels and may not have experienced similar hepcidin dynamics with additional oral iron dosing as others have shown, and therefore responded better to frequent dosing.

Our study results are in line with other small studies. A randomized clinical trialof 62 young patients with IDA showed that more patients achieved 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin in a twice a day, 60 mg, elemental oral iron regimen compared with an ADD, 120 mg, elemental oral iron regimen at 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Similarly, in another small study of 200 patients, equivalent dose of oral iron supplementation (120 mg alternate day vs 60 mg daily) did not show any difference in mean change in hemoglobin or serum ferritin at 8 weeks between ADD vs daily regimen. In our study, there was no evidence of a difference in improvement of hemoglobin between daily vs ADD oral iron strategy at 90 and 180 days.

Our study has several strengths. We have a large sample size, a longer duration of follow-up, and have included patients with IDA who were prescribed commonly used oral iron prescription for 90 days with confirmed refill between 90 and120 days, suggesting ongoing compliance with oral iron tablets. We have studied clinically meaningful outcomes like change in hemoglobin with different dosing strategies. We have done sensitivity analysis to show that baseline hemoglobin level does not affect the result. Although, iron absorption from the different ferrous formulation was about the same and mainly affected by dietary habits, to account for any variation in absorption, we have adjusted our model with different iron formulations and PPI. Because decreased kidney function is known to affect oral iron absorption, we have studied patients with CKD as a separate subcohort.

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^f4d9f034]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### FIND-CKD: a randomized trial of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anaemia [^6291795e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal iron therapy regimen in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown.

Methods

Ferinject® assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anaemia and Non-Dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective and randomized study of 626 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients were randomized (1:1:2) to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting a higher (400–600 µg/L) or lower (100–200 µg/L) ferritin or oral iron therapy. The primary end point was time to initiation of other anaemia management (ESA, other iron therapy or blood transfusion) or haemoglobin (Hb) trigger of two consecutive values < 10 g/dL during Weeks 8–52.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 36 patients (23.5%), 49 patients (32.2%) and 98 patients (31.8%) in the high-ferritin FCM, low-ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44–0.95; P = 0.026 for high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron]. The increase in Hb was greater with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (P = 0.014) and a greater proportion of patients achieved an Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dL with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (HR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.52–2.72; P < 0.001). Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in all groups.

Conclusions

Compared with oral iron, IV FCM targeting a ferritin of 400–600 µg/L quickly reached and maintained Hb level, and delayed and/or reduced the need for other anaemia management including ESAs. Within the limitations of this trial, no renal toxicity was observed, with no difference in cardiovascular or infectious events.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^e2a94f54]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO Chapter 2 — use of iron to treat anemia in CKD — provides the following guidance: When prescribing iron therapy, balance the potential benefits of avoiding or minimizing blood transfusions, ESA therapy, and anemia-related symptoms against the risks of harm in individual patients (Not Graded). For adult CKD patients with anemia not on iron or ESA therapy we suggest a trial of IV iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (2C): an increase in Hb concentration without starting ESA treatment is desired and TSAT is ≤ 30% and ferritin is ≤ 500 ng/ml (≤ 500 μg/l). For adult CKD patients with anemia not receiving iron supplementation, we suggest a trial of IV iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (2C): an increase in Hb concentration or a decrease in ESA dose is desired and TSAT is ≤ 30% and ferritin is ≤ 500 ng/ml (≤ 500 μg/l). For CKD ND patients who require iron supplementation, select the route of iron administration based on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior oral or IV iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost (Not Graded). Guide subsequent iron administration in CKD patients based on Hb responses to recent iron therapy, ongoing blood losses, iron status tests (TSAT and ferritin), Hb concentration, ESA responsiveness and ESA dose in ESA treated patients, trends in each parameter, and the patient's clinical status (Not Graded).

### Hepcidin is the major predictor of erythrocyte iron incorporation in anemic African children [^601cf60e]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Changes in iron status after 14 days of iron supplementation in postmalarial anemic children.

Despite the relative suppression of erythrocyte iron (57 Fe) incorporation in postmalarial anemic children, after the first 14 days of iron supplementation Hb levels had risen notably (Table 1). Inflammation (CRP) in most postmalarial children had resolved and other hematologic indices were normalizing by this time (Table 1). Similarly, hepcidin levels had also fallen and EPO levels had dropped markedly, indicating a correction of hypoxia probably consequent on antimalarial treatment. Correspondingly, erythrocyte incorporation of 58 Fe (administered on day 15) was higher than 57 Fe incorporation (Table 1), suggesting the relative block to oral iron use was being relieved.

Changes in iron status after 14 days of iron supplementation in nonmalarial anemic children.

In contrast to the postmalarial anemia cases, there was no significant increase in Hb levels after the first 14 days of iron supplementation, and CRP levels remained low. However, serum iron and ferritin levels had risen by day 15, and hepcidin had risen in concert with reduced sTfR-F index (both nonsignificantly), indicative of a response to the course of iron supplementation (Table 1). The efficiency of 58 Fe erythrocyte incorporation administered on day 15 was similar in these children to that of 57 Fe incorporation administered on day 1, suggesting continued efficacy of oral iron supplementation throughout the course.

In summary, these data suggest that many of the conflicting signals that affect iron handling and use are represented in these groups: inflammation and recent infection, iron deficiency, anemia and erythropoietic drive. There were differences in the changes over time of iron status and inflammation in children with postmalarial anemia compared with children with nonmalarial anemia. In addition, over the course of the study, oral iron availability was maintained at a high level, so that the temporal balance of the above factors was not constant. Against this background, we wished to test how hepcidin compared with other serum indices as a predictor of iron use as measured by erythrocyte iron incorporation.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for 500 mg Deferiprone Tablets (three times a day) for Adult Patients with Transfusional Iron Overload due to Thalassemia Syndromes

Starting Dosage for Three Times a Day Tablets

The recommended starting oral dosage of deferiprone tablets (three times a day) is 75 mg/kg/day (actual body weight), in three divided doses per day. Table 5 describes the number of deferiprone tablets (three times a day) needed to achieve the 75 mg/kg/day total starting dosage. Round dose to the nearest 250 mg (half-tablet).

To minimize gastrointestinal upset when first starting therapy, dosing can start at 45 mg/kg/day and increase weekly by 15 mg/kg/day increments until the full prescribed dose is achieved.

Dosage Adjustments

Tailor dosage adjustments for deferiprone tablets (three times a day) to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body iron burden). The maximum oral dosage is 99 mg/kg/day (actual body weight), in three divided doses per day. Table 6 describes the number of deferiprone tablets (three times a day) needed to achieve the 99 mg/day total maximum daily dosage.

Pediatric use information is approved for Chiesi USA, Inc.'s FERRIPROX® (deferiprone) tablets. However, due to Chiesi USA, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

2.5 Monitoring Ferritin Levels to Assess Efficacy

Monitor serum ferritin concentration every two to three months to assess the effect of deferiprone on body iron stores. If the serum ferritin is consistently below 500 mcg/L, consider temporarily interrupting deferiprone therapy until serum ferritin rises above 500 mcg/L.

2.6 Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions

Allow at least a 4-hour interval between administration of deferiprone and other drugs or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, aluminum, or zinc [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Impact of inflammatory status on intestinal iron absorption in older hospitalized patients [^4902ea82]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Even with adequate iron levels after supplementation, the recovery from iron-deficiency anemia is influenced by several factors, including bone marrow reserve, concurrent myelosuppressive medications, and the severity of any acute illness, particularly in older patients. Consequently, our study concentrated solely on the dynamics of iron absorption and omitting further analysis of hemoglobin increments in patients with clinically evident anemia. Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with CRP levels above 0.4 mg/dl experience delayed increases in hemoglobin compared to those with lower CRP. Although this threshold significantly deviates from ours, it emphasizes the influence of elevated CRP on impaired iron absorption. Interestingly, iron absorption efficiency is also dependent on iron storage levels, improving with ferritin levels below 30 ng/ml and worsening above 100 ng/ml. In the context of our findings, both CRP and serum ferritin emerged as significant determinants of iron absorption efficiency. While CRP is a well-known acute-phase reactant indicating inflammation, ferritin serves as an indicator of iron stores and is influenced by both iron status and inflammatory conditions. Our analysis further highlights the complex interplay between inflammation (as indicated by CRP) and iron stores (as reflected by ferritin levels) in regulating iron absorption. Notably, the regression results demonstrate that the association of CRP with impaired iron absorption remains robust and independent of iron status (severity of depletion). This independence underscores the critical role of acute inflammatory responses in influencing iron absorption.

Despite certain limitations as discussed above, a key strength of our investigation lies in its specific focus on direct measures of intestinal iron absorption without resorting to surrogate markers like haemoglobin increments, thus minimizing potential confounding factors. Consequently, we recommend caution in using oral iron supplements for patients with a CRP level above 5 mg/dl, particularly in older patients with multiple comorbidities. Maintaining adequate iron stores is crucial in such populations, e.g. for its role in myoglobin and therefore its association with muscle strength and function in older hospitalized individuals. Furthermore, subclinical iron deficiency may contribute to conditions like restless-legs syndrome, which could be erroneously diagnosed as delirium in critically ill older adults patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that intravenous iron supplementation can significantly improve common symptoms such as fatigue in older patients. Collectively, these findings underscore the vital roles of iron in the human body and highlight the need for careful management of iron supplementation in older hospitalized patients.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^03465fff]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The absorption of oral iron salts is significantly impaired if taken with food. Taking iron with meals can reduce bioavailability by up to 75%. This necessitates iron being taken either in the fasting state first thing in the morning or in periods between meals during the day. It is not clear how soon after oral iron food can be taken, but the inhibitory effect of tea on iron absorption dissipates within 60 min. Despite previous suggestions of benefit, coadministration of vitamin C with oral IRT is not recommended — a recent large randomised controlled trial has confirmed that it neither enhances the haematological response or rate of iron loading, nor diminishes side effects.

Iron absorption from oral preparations is determined by a complex interplay involving total body iron stores, erythropoietic activity of the bone marrow, recent exposure of the small intestine to iron and systemic inflammation. Hepcidin is the most important inhibitor of iron absorption. Hepcidin levels follow a diurnal pattern and increase after oral iron intake, impairing fractional absorption of subsequent doses.

Short-term studies of iron-depleted but otherwise healthy women have shown that oral doses of 60 mg elemental iron stimulate increased hepcidin levels for the next 24 hours, thus reducing subsequent iron absorption by 35%–45%. As a consequence, the overall absorption of iron from 60 mg of elemental iron taken once a day was similar to that from 60 mg two times a day. Therapy with low dose oral iron has been reported to be successful and safe in elderly patients with IDA — a daily dose of 15 mg of elemental iron was as effective as 50 mg or 150 mg in terms of the Hb response, with a lower incidence of adverse effects.

There are limited data on outcomes at lower dosage frequencies. Alternate day dosing leads to a significantly increased fractional iron and total iron absorption in iron-depleted healthy women. Fractional iron absorption was significantly higher with alternate day administration of 100 mg or 200 mg elemental iron compared with daily dosing. Importantly, the overall iron absorption from 200 mg on alternate days was almost twice that from the equivalent dosage of 100 mg on consecutive days. In a randomised trial comparing treatment regimes in subjects with IDA, 60 mg elemental iron two times a day produced a faster rate of Hb rise than 120 mg on alternate days (ie, half the equivalent daily dose), though similar Hb increments were seen with alternate day dosing after the same total dose had been given, with a significantly lower prevalence of nausea.

### Iron supplementation for chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [^55e4d563]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of iron supplementation alone and as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) compared with ESA alone in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia?

Bottom Line

Addition of iron to ESAs improves hematopoietic response, reduces the need for red blood cell transfusions, increases hemoglobin levels, and seems to be well tolerated. The subgroup analyses suggest the superiority of parenteral iron over oral iron supplementation in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia.

### Rapid growth is a dominant predictor of hepcidin suppression and declining ferritin in Gambian infants [^3ccbfc86]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Other limitations should also be considered. Self-reporting of infectious episodes may have poor sensitivity and specificity for actual infection. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation may only capture current or recent inflammatory insults; since previous inflammation may contribute to reduced iron status through chronically raised hepcidin, higher resolution tracking of inflammatory events between key time points would be desirable. Finally, whether the effects we describe are maintained in distinct LMIC infant populations, most notably regions with a high malarial burden, should be further investigated.

Universal iron interventions for LMIC infants have proven to be relatively ineffective in reducing the burden of anemia, partly because only a proportion of anemia is thought to be iron responsive. Iron absorption is facilitated in the presence of low hepcidin concentrations, but inhibited when hepcidin is raised (such as during infection/inflammation), potentially explaining why many infants respond poorly to iron interventions. Growth rate has previously been linked to reduced ferritin and iron deficiency, – and has been shown to be predictive of hemoglobin response to iron supplementation; hepcidin suppression during rapid growth likely explains the latter effect. Since rapid growth predicts greater hepcidin suppression, our data suggest that simple weight monitoring could enable identification of rapidly growing infants to whom oral iron might be advantageously targeted.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^c6570075]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a prospective validation study on phase III, whose index-tests were the pre-treatment values of serum ferritin, red blood cell count, Hb, HTC, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW and reticulocyte count, and reference standard was the responsiveness to a therapeutic test with oral iron. This report was made according to the requirements of the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Initiative. The validation studies on phase III are conducted with a population in whom it is clinically sensible to suspect the target disease in a pragmatic real-world setting of routine clinical practice. Thereby, this study was conducted at a single pre-natal care center and compared the diagnostic tests in pregnant women previously classified as anemic, as they are under higher risk of iron-deficiency.

This study followed the ethics principles in research with human beings of the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of IMIP (registration number 2050/10). Each participant was oriented, read and signed the consent form prior to their inclusion in the study. As we applied a before-after intervention with medicinal iron, our protocol was inscribed in International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (U1111-1123-2605) of WHO, and in Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-237 registered 28 July 2011, available at:).

Participants and follow-up

Pregnant women attended at the prenatal care center of Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof Fernando Figueira (IMIP) were consecutively recruited based on a Hb value < 11 g/dL (WHO criteria for anaemia) in the routinely prenatal exams plus the following inclusion criteria: 18 to 35 years old, 12 th to 32 nd weeks of low-risk singleton pregnancy. Our prenatal service composes of the reference network assistance for pregnant women in the public health system in the state of Pernambuco, in the Northeast of Brazil, and performs an average of 17,000 outpatient consultations and 6,000 deliveries per year. The exclusion criteria were Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dL, history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to ferrous sulfate, disorders or mental deficits; use of tobacco, alcohol or other drugs; previous diagnosis of another cause of anaemia; or infection at the time of the enrollment (positive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus or syphilis, leukocytosis or leukocyturia with positive urine culture, clinical signs and symptoms of airway infection).

### Plasma hepcidin is a modest predictor of dietary iron bioavailability in humans, whereas oral iron loading, measured by stable-isotope appearance curves, increases plasma hepcidin [^b830924f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Plasma hepcidin appears to be a major regulator of iron absorption and homeostasis, but there are few data in humans.

Objectives

With the use of iron stable isotopes, we aimed to determine whether circulating hepcidin predicts dietary iron bioavailability, to quantify the amount of absorbed iron after oral iron loading, and to measure the plasma hepcidin response.

Design

In the first study, young women (n = 98) with an iron status varying from iron deficiency anemia to iron sufficiency (women with serum ferritin concentrations 25–40 microg/L were not included) were given stable isotope-labeled test meals (n = 196) containing ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferric pyrophosphate, after which plasma hepcidin and iron bioavailability were measured. In the second study, iron-sufficient men (n = 4) were given 3.8- and 60-mg oral doses of labeled ferrous sulfate. The stable isotope appearance curve was determined, and the plasma hepcidin response was measured over 6 h.

Results

In study 1, plasma hepcidin and plasma ferritin were strongly correlated (r = 0.79, P < 0.001). Plasma hepcidin significantly, but modestly, predicted iron bioavailability from ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate (r = -0.51 and -0.46, respectively; P < 0.0001) but not from ferric pyrophosphate (r = -0.30, P = 0.056, respectively). In study 2, the 3.8-mg dose increased mean circulating absorbed iron to a peak of 0.42 micromol/L at 60 min but did not increase plasma hepcidin, The 60-mg dose increased mean circulating absorbed iron to a peak of 5.9 micromol/L at 120 min and produced an approximately 30% increase in mean plasma hepcidin at 6 h (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Plasma hepcidin is only a modest predictor of dietary iron bioavailability in humans. Oral iron loading, measured by stable-isotope appearance curves, increases circulating hepcidin.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^8271d660]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^73dba1e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^81ec5ba8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — IV iron at high ferritin. KDIGO notes that IV iron "should not routinely be administered" when ferritin is consistently > 500 ng/ml, yet cites allowance in selected patients for "a single course of up to 1,000 mg" even with ferritin ≥ 500 ng/ml after considering risks. The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) "should be considered when TSAT is low (≤ 30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL". It also states "there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes", and that "Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly".

Serum ferritin and serum hepcidin concentrations during the study in the consecutive - day and alternate - day oral iron supplementation groups. Serum ferritin (A) and serum hepcidin (B). The dots represent the medians, the error bars represent 95% confidence intervals, the horizontal line represents the comparison of the consecutive day group, day 90 versus alternate day group, day 183. Analysed by linear mixed models, with independent samples t-test and non-parametric tests for variables with significant group-time effects. Post-hoc tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni step-down (Holm) correction. Serum ferritin adjusted for inflammation.

Inflammation markers at baseline and during the study are shown in Table 3. There were no group-time effects on CRP, AGP, I-FABP or fecal calprotectin. The prevalence of systemic inflammation was < 8% in both groups throughout the study and did not differ between groups. Median (IQR) I-FABP was 24% higher in the consecutive-day group at 3 months compared to alternate-day group at 6 months; 712.8 (459.5–921.3) versus 573.3 (444.5–786.4) pg/mL (P = 0.22). There was a significant time effect on fecal calprotectin, which increased from baseline to 6 months in both groups (P = 0.011) (Table 3).

### Hemoglobin response to ferric citrate in patients with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anemia [^44913622]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Similarly, the treatment effect of ferric citrate versus placebo was greater among patients with lower baseline ferritin (estimated LSM difference at ferritin 35 ng/mL, 1.12 g/dL; 95% CI, 0.78‐1.45; P < .0001) than patients with higher baseline ferritin (estimated LSM difference at ferritin 126 ng/mL, 0.79 g/dL; 95% CI, 0.46‐1.12; P < .0001; treatment × baseline ferritin × week 16 interaction, P = 0.0974). Ferric citrate‐treated patients with lower versus higher baseline ferritin showed a greater rate of hemoglobin rise (Figure 1 B).

These post hoc results indicate the association of baseline iron store markers, namely TSAT and ferritin, with hemoglobin response to ferric citrate treatment. While patients with lower baseline TSAT/ferritin experienced a greater 16‐week hemoglobin increase than those with higher baseline TSAT/ferritin, hemoglobin increases versus placebo were also significant among those with higher baseline TSAT/ferritin values, indicating that ferric citrate treatment is efficacious over a wide range of patients with NDD‐CKD. These data support current guidelines recommending a trial of oral iron in patients with iron deficiency anemia and CKD and suggest the need to identify more reliable clinical markers of bone marrow iron availability. 1

An important novel finding is the significant association of lower baseline intact FGF23 and higher baseline serum albumin with greater hemoglobin increase. No association was observed with c‐terminal FGF23, presumably because cleavage of active/intact FGF23 is not impaired in the setting of iron deficiency. 5 In the setting of inflammation, serum ferritin and intact FGF23 are increased, while serum albumin is decreased. 5, 6 However, serum ferritin also decreases with iron deficiency. Thus, in patients with CKD, the hemoglobin response to iron is probably dependent on various degrees of inflammation and iron deficiency anemia. This impedes the predictive utility of ferritin and even TSAT.

This study is limited by the post hoc and exploratory nature of these analyses. Results should be verified by randomized, prospective trials that focus on optimizing anemia management while achieving a steady state for iron parameters.

In summary, while hemoglobin increased in nearly all patients with iron deficiency anemia and NDD‐CKD over 16 weeks of ferric citrate treatment, patients with biochemical markers of more severe iron deficiency experienced more pronounced increases in hemoglobin concentration.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Iron supplementation for unexplained fatigue in non-anaemic women: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^6cc23e1a]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the subjective response to iron therapy in non-anaemic women with unexplained fatigue.

Design

Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial.

Setting

Academic primary care centre and eight general practices in western Switzerland.

Participants

144 women aged 18 to 55, assigned to either oral ferrous sulphate (80 mg/day of elemental iron daily; n = 75) or placebo (n = 69) for four weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Level of fatigue, measured by a 10 point visual analogue scale.

Results

136 (94%) women completed the study. Most had a low serum ferritin concentration; ≤ 20 microg/l in 69 (51%) women. Mean age, haemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin concentration, level of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were similar in both groups at baseline. Both groups were also similar for compliance and dropout rates. The level of fatigue after one month decreased by -1.82/6.37 points (29%) in the iron group compared with -0.85/6.46 points (13%) in the placebo group (difference 0.95 points, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.62; P = 0.004). Subgroups analysis showed that only women with ferritin concentrations ≤ 50 microg/l improved with oral supplementation.

Conclusion

Non-anaemic women with unexplained fatigue may benefit from iron supplementation. The effect may be restricted to women with low or borderline serum ferritin concentrations.

### Intravenous iron for heart failure, iron deficiency definitions, and clinical response: the IRONMAN trial [^82b5525c]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, the HEART-FID trial found little evidence that i.v. FCM improved either hospitalization for heart failure or mortality. However, at baseline, 60% of patients had a TSAT of 20% or more and the mean haemoglobin was 12.6 g/dL, suggesting that many had neither iron deficiency nor anaemia. A meta-analysis of individual-patient data (IPD) from trials of FCM and aggregate data from IRONMAN did not provide conclusive evidence that i.v. iron substantially reduced the composite outcomes of cardiovascular hospitalizations or death (rate ratio 0.86 [95% CI 0.75 to 0.98]) or heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death (rate ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.75 to 1.01]). However, the IPD meta-analysis found a strong interaction between TSAT and the reduction in these outcomes and in cardiovascular death. Benefits were substantial benefit when TSAT was < 15% but there were trends to harm when TSAT was ≥ 24%. A reasonable interpretation of the totality of evidence is that many patients enrolled in randomized trials could not benefit from i.v. or oral iron supplements because they did not have iron deficiency but that patients who do have iron deficiency, as evidenced by a low TSAT, might benefit substantially.

Although highly correlated with TSAT, serum iron might be the better marker of prognosis for patients with cardiovascular disease. TSAT depends not only on serum concentrations of iron but also of transferrin, which is inversely related to serum ferritin. As serum ferritin rises, transferrin falls, leading to a higher TSAT for a given serum iron concentration. Conversely, when serum ferritin is low, transferrin will be higher, leading to lower TSAT for a given serum iron concentration. If serum iron is a better marker of iron deficiency than TSAT, this might explain the lack of a clear relationship between decrements in TSAT below 20% and the magnitude of response to FDI. Patients with a serum ferritin > 400 µg/L were excluded from IRONMAN. In retrospect, measurements of TSAT or serum iron may be better ways of excluding iron overload, again making measurement of serum ferritin clinically redundant. Other markers of iron deficiency might also be considered for the identification of patients with iron deficiency more likely to benefit from iron supplements, but they have not been studied in randomized trials.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^1d3c4cfb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

It remains uncertain whether vitamin C routinely used with oral iron supplements is essential for patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA).

Objective

To compare the equivalence and assess the safety of oral iron supplements plus vitamin C or oral iron supplements alone in patients with IDA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-center, open-label, equivalence randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017, in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. Adult patients with newly diagnosed IDA were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the oral iron supplements plus vitamin C group or the oral iron supplements-only group. Data analysis was performed from March to December 2018.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive a 100-mg oral iron tablet plus 200 mg of vitamin C or a 100-mg iron tablet alone every 8 hours daily for 3 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin level from baseline to 2 weeks of treatment, and an equivalence margin of 1 g/dL in hemoglobin was chosen for the demonstration of comparable efficacy. Secondary outcomes included the change in the reticulocyte percentage after 2 weeks of treatment, the increase in hemoglobin level after 4 weeks of treatment, the increase in serum ferritin level after 8 weeks of treatment, and adverse events.

Results

Among the 440 randomized patients (220 each in the oral iron supplements plus vitamin C group and iron-only group; 426 women [96.8%]; mean [SD] age, 38.3 [11.7] years), all were assessed for the primary outcome, and 432 (98.2%) completed the trial. From baseline to the 2-week follow-up, the mean (SD) change in hemoglobin level was 2.00 (1.08) g/dL in the oral iron supplements plus vitamin C group and 1.84 (0.97) g/dL in the oral iron supplements-only group (between-group difference, 0.16 g/dL; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.35 g/dL), thus meeting the criteria for equivalence. The mean (SD) change in serum ferritin level from baseline to 8-week follow-up was 35.75 (11.52) ng/mL in the vitamin C plus iron group and 34.48 (9.50) ng/mL in the iron-only group (between-group difference, 1.27 ng/mL; 95% CI, -0.70 to 3.24 ng/mL; P = 0.21). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding the rates of adverse events (46 [20.9%] vs 45 [20.5%]; difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -6.7% to 8.5%; P = 0.82). No patient withdrew because of adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with IDA, oral iron supplements alone were equivalent to oral iron supplements plus vitamin C in improving hemoglobin recovery and iron absorption. These findings suggest that on-demand vitamin C supplements are not essential to take along with oral iron supplements for patients with IDA.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^82b26923]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

As an iron distribution disorder, IRIDA is marked by relatively high iron levels in reticuloendothelial macrophages compared to the circulation and parenchymal cells, like hepatocytes. Importantly, elevated hepcidin alone does not confirm the diagnosis; it must be interpreted alongside the body's iron levels and inflammation status. In IRIDA, iron maldistribution is best reflected by a low TSAT/hepcidin ratio (< 2.5th percentile for age and gender) (Table 1). Another diagnostic hallmark is minimal or absent response to oral iron supplementation and incomplete response to intravenous (IV) iron therapy, with persistently low TSAT (Figure 1).

TABLE 1
Characteristics of IRIDA.

FIGURE 1
Schematic overview of effects of oral and IV iron therapy in IRIDA. (A) Macrophages release 20–25 mg of iron daily, mainly from the recycling of senescent erythrocytes. Enterocytes absorb 1–2 mg of dietary iron. Iron enters the circulation via the membrane‐bound exporter ferroportin, binds to transferrin and is delivered to iron‐requiring cells, including erythroid precursor cells. Each transferrin molecule can carry up two iron ions; for example, at a TSAT of 50%, each transferrin molecule typically carries one iron ion. (B) In IRIDA, inappropriately elevated hepcidin levels inhibit dietary iron uptake and iron release from macrophages by interacting with ferroportin, reducing circulating iron levels. (C) Oral iron supplements (containing usually 30 mg elemental iron per 100 mg of the compound) are generally ineffective in IRIDA. Hepcidin‐mediated inhibition traps iron in duodenal enterocytes, preventing its release into circulation and macrophages, and thus not significantly improving circulating iron levels. However, positive outcomes have been observed in younger children, although the studies are heterogeneous in terms of treatment regimens. (D) IV iron bypasses this barrier by delivering a significantly higher amount of elemental iron directly to macrophages, where it is unpacked from its carbohydrate shell. Ferroportin mRNA expression in macrophages is upregulated via the IRP/IRE system, overcoming hepcidin inhibition and enabling iron release into circulation while releasing macrophage iron loading. The extent of this release depends on the ferritin set point of a specific patient — the ferritin level at which iron is mobilized from reticuloendothelial stores — which tends to decrease with age and increase with the severity of TMPRSS6 defects.

### Hepcidin levels predict nonresponsiveness to oral iron therapy in patients with iron deficiency anemia [^d7745f41]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Levels of hepcidin, a major regulator of iron homeostasis, may identify patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) who will not respond to oral iron therapy. In this study, IDA patients underwent a 14-day trial (run-in) course of ferrous sulfate therapy. Nonresponders (Hgb increase < 1 g/dL with 67% compliance rate) were randomized to IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM; two injections of 750 mg) or further oral iron for 14 days. Screening hepcidin levels were 38.4 versus 11.3 ng/mL, P = 0.0002 in nonresponders versus responders to a trial of oral iron. Hepcidin of > 20 ng/mL, showed sensitivity of 41.3%, specificity of 84.4%, and positive predictive value of 81.6% for predicting nonresponsiveness to oral iron. PPVs for ferritin > 30 ng/mL or transferrin saturation (TSAT) > 15% were 59.2 and 55%, respectively. Negative predictive values for hepcidin, ferritin, and TSAT were 46.3, 22.7, and 19.7, respectively. FCM versus oral iron showed Hgb increases of ≥ 1 gm/dL in 65.3% versus 20.8% (P < 0.0001) and Hgb increases of 1.7 ± 1.3 versus 0.6 ± 0.9 g/dL (P = 0.0025), respectively. We conclude that hepcidin predicts nonresponsiveness to oral iron in patients with IDA and is superior to TSAT or ferritin for this purpose. Nonresponse to oral iron therapy does not rule out IDA, since two-thirds of patients subsequently responded to intravenous iron.

### Iron deficiency: a concise review [^95c40166]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. There is recent evidence that the anemia is only the last manifestation of the syndrome and that symptoms occur before the anemia is manifest. Advances in outlining the physiology of iron deficiency have been made, gaps remain in the current understanding. While oral iron supplement remains the mainstay, some indications for the intravenous administration have developed. This review will highlight the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^98073fd8]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — upper thresholds and routine iron use: In most patients with TSAT > 30% or serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml (> 500 μg/l), any erythropoietic response to iron supplementation alone will be small, and we do not recommend routine use of iron supplementation in patients with TSAT > 30% or serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml (> 500 μg/l). Previous guidelines usually cited ferritin limits of 500–800 ng/ml (500–800 μg/l) above which additional IV iron was generally not recommended, but no randomized controlled trials and few other studies have examined providing IV iron to maintain ferritin levels > 500–800 ng/ml (> 500–800 μg/l).

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information

Monitoring for Safety

Due to the risk of agranulocytosis, monitor ANC before and during FERRIPROX therapy.

Test ANC prior to start of FERRIPROX therapy and monitor on the following schedule during treatment:

First six months of therapy: Monitor ANC weekly;
Next six months of therapy: Monitor ANC once every two weeks;
After one year of therapy: Monitor ANC every two to four weeks (or at the patient's blood transfusion interval in patients that have not experienced an interruption due to any decrease in ANC [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Due to the risk of hepatic transaminase elevations, monitor ALT before and monthly during FERRIPROX therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Due to the risk of zinc deficiency, monitor zinc levels before and regularly during FERRIPROX therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for FERRIPROX Oral Solution for Adult and Pediatric Patients with Transfusional Iron Overload due to Thalassemia Syndromes, Sickle Cell Disease or Other Anemias

Starting Dosage

The recommended starting oral dosage of FERRIPROX Oral Solution is 25 mg/kg (actual body weight), three times per day for a total of 75 mg/kg/day. Round dose to the nearest 2.5 mL.

To minimize gastrointestinal upset when first starting therapy, dosing can start at 45 mg/kg/day and increase weekly by 15 mg/kg/day increments until the full prescribed dose is achieved.

Dosage Adjustments

Tailor dosage adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body iron burden). The maximum oral dosage is 33 mg/kg (actual body weight), three times per day for a total of 99 mg/kg/day.

2.3 Monitoring Ferritin Levels to Assess Efficacy

Monitor serum ferritin concentration every two to three months to assess the effect of FERRIPROX on body iron stores. If the serum ferritin is consistently below 500 mcg/L, consider temporarily interrupting FERRIPROX therapy until serum ferritin rises above 500 mcg/L.

2.4 Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions

Allow at least a 4-hour interval between administration of FERRIPROX and other drugs or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, aluminum, or zinc [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Comparison of ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose complex for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy-randomised controlled trial [^3e253008]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study compared two intravenous iron preparations for the correction of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. FCM was found non-inferior to ISC in correction of anemia and it led to significantly higher and rapid Hb rise as compared to ISC group and with significantly less number of visits.

Iron sucrose has been the standard of care for parenteral iron therapy for treatment of anemia in pregnancy. However, the main disadvantage with iron sucrose is limited maximum permissible dose per week thus need of multiple visits to deliver the required iron dose, while FCM can be administered in a larger amount at a time.

The first study on the use of FCM for treatment of IDA in pregnancy was published by Christoph P et al. The study concluded comparable safety and tolerability of FCM to ISC and that FCM offers the advantage of a much higher iron dosage at a time reducing the need for repeated applications and increasing patients' comfort. The authors documented a comparable rise in Hb levels at the end of the study. The current study, in contrast, showed significantly higher Hb levels in FCM group as compared to ISC group after 12 weeks.

Breymann C et al. compared FCM with oral iron therapy for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. Hb levels improved at comparable rates in both groups. Patients in FCM group had significantly more women who achieved Hb > 110 g/L and within a shorter time frame. The authors concluded to consider FCM to be first-line treatment option for correction of IDA especially in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Body iron stores are largely determined by serum ferritin levels. Froessler et al. have documented significantly increased ferritin levels after FCM infusion in patients with anemia and in women with iron deficiency and no anemia. In the present study, serum ferritin levels were comparable in two groups at baseline and at the end of study after 12 weeks. It can be inferred that though FCM causes a rapid rise in iron stores, over a long term ISC is equally able to give comparable supplementation for replenishment of iron stores.

### Iron metabolism, iron deficiency, thrombocytosis, and the cardiorenal anemia syndrome [^8733836a]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

In treating moderate to severe anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), oral iron is effective only in a minority of nondialysis patients. Intravenous iron is more effective and can raise levels of hemoglobin even without the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Unfortunately, the current assays of iron status that are presently widely available are not especially helpful in predicting response. In patients on dialysis, i.v. iron is effective over a wide range of serum ferritin from < 100 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml. None of the three available randomized controlled trials comparing oral with i.v. iron showed evidence of nephrotoxicity caused by i.v. iron. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for thrombocytosis and should, wherever possible, be avoided. Optimal coadministration of iron may reduce the risk for ESA-driven cardiovascular events. Increased total body iron stores (imperfectly reflected by serum ferritin levels in CKD) do not appear to be related to such events or hospitalization in CKD; it is unclear what other risk factors and mechanisms need to be considered. In the appreciable proportion of patients with both renal and cardiac dysfunction, management is further complicated by a vicious circle (which can be characterized as cardiorenal anemia syndrome) in which CKD, heart failure, and anemia exacerbate each other. In such patients, correction of anemia appears to improve cardiac function and quality of life without a greater risk for adverse events.

### Iron replacement in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7f8775ee]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A number of controlled trials and prospective studies have compared intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) iron for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with mixed results.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of trials published on 2014 that compared IV with PO iron to treat in patients with IBD. Meta-analysis was performed to generate effect estimates. Quality assessment was also performed according to GRADE criteria.

Results

Five studies met our inclusion criteria, enrolling 694 patients. For the primary outcome of "response" (hemoglobin rise > 2 g/dL), there was no significant difference between IV or PO iron; risk ratio for response with IV was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.9–1.2; P = 0.2). For the secondary outcome of mean change in hemoglobin (g/dL), the mean difference between PO and IV iron was not statistically significant (mean difference, 0.6 g/dL, 96% CI, -0.1 to 1.3; P = 0.08). IV iron was associated with a significantly greater initial rise in serum ferritin compared with PO iron (mean difference 89 ng/mL; 95% CI, 29–148, P = 0.003). There was a lower risk of withdrawal due to adverse events in these trials in the IV iron cohorts when compared with PO iron (risk ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–1.0; P = 0.05).

Conclusions

We found no significant difference between IV and PO iron in correcting iron-deficiency anemia in patients with IBD in this meta-analysis. Patients who received IV iron had a greater rise in serum ferritin and were less likely to stop treatment due to adverse events, when compared with those who received PO iron.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised controlled trials, including 201 trial arms of oral iron supplementation in children, demonstrates significant benefits on haematologic outcomes including haemoglobin (+6.3 g/L; 95% CI 5.5, 7.1), ferritin (+18.5 ng/mL; 16.1, 20.9) and prevalence of anaemia (39% reduction; 33%, 45%), ID (70% reduction; 63%, 76%) and IDA (80% reduction; 69%, 87%). Children under age 5 years were most frequently studied (63% of trial arms), including trials throughout this age range, but with meaningful numbers of trials among children aged 5–11 years (25%) and adolescents aged 12–19 years (12%). In sum, these findings provide strong evidence for the benefits of iron supplementation among children.

Importantly, the number and diversity of identified trials allowed us to assess factors that might modify these benefits. Our results suggest that frequent (3–7 times/week) and intermittent (1–2 times/week) iron supplementation may be equally effective at increasing haemoglobin and decreasing anaemia, ID and IDA. While WHO recommends daily oral iron supplementation for all children in regions with an anaemia prevalence of 40% or more, the success of such programmes may be threatened by low adherence from adverse gastrointestinal reactions or high caregiver burden to provide daily supplements. Weekly iron supplementation has been promoted as an alternative to reduce these barriers. Furthermore, since mammalian gastrointestinal epithelial cells turn over every 2–6 days, weekly supplementation may not be at a great disadvantage relative to daily supplementation with respect to the total amount of absorbed iron. Some evidence points to changes in gastrointestinal epithelial cells following a large bolus of iron that results in reduced transport of iron into portal blood. A prior meta-analysis of 21 trials concluded that, compared with daily iron supplements, intermittent supplementation had similar effects on haemoglobin levels but was less effective in reducing anaemia. Our findings, based on a much larger number of trials, suggest that frequent and intermittent supplementation are similarly effective in reducing anaemia.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^e0c50165]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 2.2 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - initiation of ESA and iron status

We suggest that ESA therapy should not be initiated in the presence of absolute iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 microgram/L) until this is corrected and anaemia persists. In patients with functional iron deficiency iron supplements should be given prior to or when initiating ESA therapy. (2B)

Low serum ferritin is a useful marker to diagnose absolute iron deficiency. Normal or high serum ferritin values (≥ 100 microgram/L) do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes as infection or inflammation.

Guideline 2.3 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - route of administration

We suggest that oral iron will, in general, be sufficient to maintain and may be sufficient to attain the Hb within targets in ESA treated CKD patients not yet requiring dialysis and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD). (2B)

For CKD patients not requiring haemodialysis, the choice between oral vs. parenteral iron depends on the severity of iron deficiency, the previous response and side effects, the availability of venous access and the need to initiate ESA therapy (2A).

In contrast most haemodialysis patients will require intravenous iron. (2A).

When offering intravenous iron therapy to people not receiving in-centre haemodialysis, consider high dose, low frequency (HD/LF) IV iron as the treatment of choice for adults and young people when trying to achieve iron repletion, taking into account all of the following:
the availability of venous access
preferences of the person with anaemia of CKD or, where appropriate, their family or carers
nursing and administration costs
cost of local drug supply
provision of resuscitation facilities

Guideline 2.4 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - upper limit for iron therapy

We recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 800 microgram/L in patients treated with iron, and to achieve this iron management should be reviewed when the ferritin is > 500 microgram/L. (1B)

Treatment with Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (guidelines 3.1–3.11)

Guideline 3.1 - treatment of Anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents

We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to patients with anaemia of CKD who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion; especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation. (1B)

Guideline 3.2 - treatment of Anaemia - choice of ESA

We recommend that the decision on the choice of ESA is based on local availability of ESAs. (1B)

KDIGO anemia in CKD — route selection and ongoing iron administration: for CKD ND patients who require iron supplementation, select the route of iron administration based on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior oral or IV iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost (Not Graded). Guide subsequent iron administration in CKD patients based on Hb responses to recent iron therapy, ongoing blood losses, iron status tests (TSAT and ferritin), Hb concentration, ESA responsiveness and ESA dose in ESA treated patients, parameter trends, and the patient's clinical status (Not Graded).
