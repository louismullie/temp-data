## Question

How is lichen sclerosos treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how lichen sclerosus is treated, with a treatment plan and algorithm across populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first-line therapy and whether there is consensus on an ultra-potent corticosteroid. Then, I should verify the exact induction regimen and formulation choices. Next, I will consider nonpharmacologic adjuncts, followed by maintenance strategies and duration. After that, I need to review second-line options and their evidence base, then surgical indications by sex and severity. I will also examine pediatric and extragenital variations, and finally I must ensure safety, monitoring, biopsy indications, and patient education are addressed comprehensively with guideline support.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are the first-line for anogenital lichen sclerosus, with clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1% most endorsed by major guidelines, which aligns with the autoimmune-inflammatory pathophysiology that responds to potent anti-inflammatory suppression [^113SxtqC] [^116UREav] [^116ZawHT] [^115kpLbT] [^113DdK1Y].

> I need to verify the exact induction regimen and avoid assumptions about duration or frequency that are not guideline-backed; the standard is a three-month taper: apply clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment once daily for one month, then on alternate days for the second month, then twice weekly for the third month, with a 3‑month review to individualize thereafter, and ointment is preferred to minimize preservatives and irritation [^112Za6QS] [^114bny4A] [^114sJGMt].

> Wait, let me verify whether extending beyond 12 weeks improves clearance; at first glance longer courses might seem better, but comparative data suggest that extending to 24 weeks does not provide meaningful added benefit in complete clearance over conventional 12-week courses, so I should not overextend induction unless clinically justified and instead pivot to maintenance or alternative strategies [^116AyTAc] [^1176NjrT].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic adjuncts because barrier repair and irritant avoidance materially impact symptoms and tolerance; emollient ointments should be used as soap substitutes and barrier preparations, and patients should avoid mechanical trauma, excessive water and routine cleansing products, synthetic or tight clothing, and wet wipes, with attention to precise application techniques such as cotton bud placement for meatal involvement if present before specialty referral [^114LhfJa] [^111S1KWK] [^114Zu6n9] [^113SxtqC] [^114sJGMt].

> Hold on, I should verify the maintenance strategy because LS is chronic and relapse-prone; proactive maintenance with twice-weekly ultra-potent or potent corticosteroid such as clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1% is recommended to maintain remission and reduce scarring and malignant risk, with practical guidance that 30 g of ultra-potent steroid should last at least three months and an individualized titration to the lowest effective regimen is prudent, noting high relapse rates over years without sustained control [^113jEYrM] [^114Xgb69] [^113Ht9jT] [^113aSpky] [^117PyZzR] [^113YD3Ss].

> I will now examine second-line and alternative therapies for inadequate responders or those with contraindications to steroids; topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus can be considered when steroids fail or are unsuitable, although I should double-check safety messaging because while older literature raised theoretical concerns about malignancy in a precancerous setting, guideline use is acceptable with caution and shared decision-making, and for focal hyperkeratotic plaques resistant to topical therapy intralesional triamcinolone is reasonable once neoplasia is excluded, with retinoids as a dermatologist-led option in refractory cases and limited or insufficient evidence for systemic immunosuppressants such as hydroxychloroquine or systemic steroids in routine care, reserving photodynamic therapy as a third-line option when standard measures fail [^112vfzCm] [^116EtEeW] [^116cGNvp] [^111eibX4] [^115kBu1z] [^117GhLs5] [^117XifKD] [^115BPaiU] [^116tr6H6] [^113D3myU].

> But wait, what if scarring or stenosis is functionally limiting; I need to ensure I do not overuse surgery upfront, as it is not first-line and targets anatomic complications rather than inflammation, so in males circumcision is appropriate when guideline-recommended medical therapy fails or for persistent phimosis with complete foreskin removal and histopathology of specimen, with attention to meatal and urethral disease including mucosal grafting or urethroplasty when indicated, whereas in females carefully selected de-adhesion or perineoplasty can address introital stenosis or dyspareunia, always combined with perioperative anti-inflammatory therapy and dilator protocols to prevent restenosis, and perioperative topical steroids are advised pre- and post-procedurally [^117Tuj1A] [^1144BgGe] [^114U2Ehc] [^114dwWoE] [^117WHVHB] [^116aEvkQ] [^112m46ZB] [^117JQCEb].

> I should confirm population-specific nuances; in pediatric females, clobetasol 0.05% ointment with a three-month taper combined with emollients is recommended, and tacrolimus 0.03% can be considered as a safe twice-weekly maintenance to reduce recurrences, while in pediatric males, potent or ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are first-line with circumcision considered for phimosis refractory to medical therapy, and in adults I need to remember issues like buried penis in obesity where weight loss and appropriate referrals are part of care, and for extragenital LS potent topical corticosteroids or acitretin are options with calcipotriol as a consideration, sometimes under occlusion [^115GxUZm] [^113KWdTB] [^113PLgby] [^11335euE] [^116BWfQe] [^114i2Rbv] [^116UsU2i].

> Next, I should review safety, surveillance, and follow-up because malignant transformation risk and scarring mandate structured monitoring; once stable and patients are confident in self-management, annual primary care review is reasonable, but initially reviews every one to six months until disease control is achieved are advised, and long-term suppressive therapy is recommended to mitigate squamous cell carcinoma risk, with biopsies indicated for persistent hyperkeratosis, non-healing erosions or erythema, new papules or warty lesions, treatment-resistant areas, atypical pigmentation, or when morphology is atypical, to confirm diagnosis and exclude neoplasia [^113n6M1c] [^116SL6W9] [^113jEYrM] [^112dUbXq] [^111zKMoH] [^113MdKLw].

> Hold on, I should verify that patient education is emphasized because adherence and technique often determine outcomes; I need to counsel on correct steroid amounts, safe use of ultra-potent agents, application sites, expectations that pallor may persist despite quiescence, recognition of progression or cancer-warning signs such as ulceration or new papules, and strict irritant avoidance with ointment-based emollients preferred over creams to minimize preservatives and contact allergy [^116S1PA8] [^113Wr7M8] [^112NCFo6] [^114LhfJa] [^114sJGMt].

> Let me now synthesize the practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines: initiate clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment with a three-month taper and concurrent emollient and irritant avoidance, review at three months to document response and biopsy any suspicious areas, then continue individualized proactive maintenance typically twice weekly with clobetasol or mometasone and titrate to disease activity, consider topical calcineurin inhibitors if steroid failure or intolerance and intralesional triamcinolone or retinoids for refractory plaques under specialist care, reserve surgery for functional scarring or stenosis with perioperative topical steroid support, and structure follow-up initially every one to six months until stable then annually thereafter with ongoing education and vigilance for malignant change [^114bny4A] [^112Za6QS] [^113jEYrM] [^114Xgb69] [^112vfzCm] [^117GhLs5] [^117WHVHB] [^116SL6W9].

---

First-line treatment for lichen sclerosus is **ultra-potent topical corticosteroids** [^1147Z9TH] (clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1%) [^116UREav] applied once daily for 4 weeks, then every other day for 4 weeks, and twice weekly for 4 weeks [^114bny4A], with review at 3 months and individualized maintenance thereafter [^113jEYrM] [^112Za6QS]. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus 1%) [^112oH3hQ] are reserved for **steroid-intolerant or refractory cases** [^116EtEeW] [^112vfzCm]. Emollients and avoidance of irritants are **recommended adjuncts** [^114LhfJa] [^111S1KWK] [^114Zu6n9]. Circumcision is indicated for male phimosis unresponsive to medical therapy [^117Tuj1A] [^114U2Ehc], and minor vulvar procedures are used for persistent introital stenosis [^117WHVHB] [^116aEvkQ]. Regular follow-up is **essential** [^116SL6W9] to monitor response, adherence, and malignancy risk [^112NCFo6] [^113n6M1c].

## Topical corticosteroids (first-line therapy)

- **First-line therapy**: Ultra-potent topical corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate 0.05% or mometasone furoate 0.1%) [^114boKtE] [^114bny4A].

- **Induction regimen**: Apply once daily for 4 weeks, then alternate days for 4 weeks, then twice weekly for 4 weeks [^114bny4A]; review at 3 months and individualize thereafter [^113Ht9jT].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Proactive maintenance (e.g. twice weekly) [^117PyZzR] to maintain remission and prevent malignant change [^113jEYrM] [^115YoK7V].

- **Safety**: Long-term use is generally safe [^113YD3Ss] with minimal risk of atrophy or systemic effects.

---

## Topical calcineurin inhibitors (second-line therapy)

- **Indication**: Use when corticosteroids are unsuitable or ineffective [^112vfzCm] [^116EtEeW].

- **Agents**: Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment [^112oH3hQ] or pimecrolimus 1% cream [^116EtEeW].

- **Efficacy**: Effective for symptom control [^116cGNvp] and maintenance, but less effective than corticosteroids for appearance.

- **Safety**: Generally safe [^112vfzCm]; transient burning/itching may occur.

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Emollients**: Use during standard therapy to reduce irritation [^114sJGMt] and restore barrier function [^114LhfJa].

- **Avoidance of irritants**: Avoid soaps, detergents, fragrances [^114Zu6n9], and tight clothing [^111S1KWK].

- **Patient education**: Provide information [^113Wr7M8] on adherence, self-examination, and recognizing progression or malignancy [^112NCFo6].

---

## Surgical interventions

Male **circumcision** [^114U2Ehc] is indicated for phimosis unresponsive to medical therapy; the complete foreskin should be removed and submitted for histopathology [^117Tuj1A]. Female procedures, such as **de-adhesion, synechiolysis, or perineoplasty** [^116aEvkQ], are considered when introital stenosis persists despite medical therapy [^117WHVHB].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should occur **every 1–6 months until stable, then annually** [^112dUbXq] [^116SL6W9] [^113n6M1c]. Monitoring should assess response, adherence, and malignancy risk [^115YoK7V]; patients should be encouraged to self-examine [^113Wr7M8] and promptly report changes [^112NCFo6].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients should receive **ultra-potent or potent topical corticosteroids** [^115GxUZm] [^113PLgby]; circumcision is recommended for refractory male phimosis [^11335euE]. For **extragenital LS**, use potent topical corticosteroids [^114i2Rbv]; consider calcipotriol or acitretin for refractory disease [^116UsU2i].

---

Ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are **the cornerstone of LS management** [^116UREav], with calcineurin inhibitors as second-line options [^116EtEeW]. Emollients, avoidance of irritants, and patient education support management [^114LhfJa] [^111S1KWK] [^113Wr7M8]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^117WHVHB]; regular follow-up is essential to monitor response and malignancy risk [^116SL6W9] [^112NCFo6].

The objective of this work was to survey physician members and fellows of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease to determine expert opinions regarding the management of adult vulvar lichen sclerosus.

A cross-sectional design was used. An electronic survey was emailed to all members and fellows of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease. Responses were analyzed using univariate methods. Subgroup analyses were performed to report treatment differences between gynecologists and dermatologists and between physicians in the United States and Europe.

In total, 128 (42%) of 305 providers responded to the survey. Analysis was confined to the 114 physician respondents who treat patients with lichen sclerosus. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% is the most common first-line agent used in lichen sclerosus (85%). The most common second-line agents used are tacrolimus (39%), other topical steroids (28%), and intralesional steroids (13%). Most physicians (59%) start all patients with lichen sclerosus on drug therapy at an initial visit, regardless of symptoms. Dermatologists are more likely to treat all patients (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) than gynecologists (p < .01). Most physicians (64%) continue maintenance therapy in all patients. Gynecologists are more likely than dermatologists to treat only when patients are symptomatic versus using maintenance therapy (p = .03). Physicians practicing in the United States are more likely than those practicing in Europe to treat all patients with…

### Diagnosis and treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus: An update for dermatologists [^113MdKLw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus is an important skin disease that is common in women in their 50s and beyond; however, it can also affect females of any age, including children. If not treated, it has the potential to cause significant and permanent scarring and deformity of the vulvar structure. In addition, if untreated, it is associated with a 2–6% lifetime risk of malignant squamous neoplasia of the vulva. Lichen sclerosus has been considered a difficult-to-manage condition; however, both serious complications can potentially be prevented with early intervention with topical corticosteroid, suggesting that the course of the disease can be treatment modified.

### Conservative management of penile and urethral lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^1161Sexa]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of currently available conservative management options for penile and urethral lichen sclerosus.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive review of existing literature on lichen sclerosus was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. References were assessed for relevance to nonsurgical management of male genital lichen sclerosus by title and abstract by three independent reviewers. These were then reviewed in full and in duplicate by five independent reviewers.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies describing conservative management of histologically confirmed penile and urethral lichen sclerosus in male patients were included in the final review. The evidence supports the use of four major treatment modalities: topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, platelet-rich plasma, and CO2 laser. Limited studies also discuss the use of oral acitretin and polydeoxyribonucleotide injections. Outcomes assessed include symptoms, clinical appearance, quality of life, sexual satisfaction, adverse effects, and long-term efficacy of treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Topical corticosteroids remain the mainstay of conservative management for penile and urethral lichen sclerosus. The literature supports the use of other therapies such as tacrolimus and platelet-rich plasma as alternatives or adjuvant treatments when escalation of treatment is necessary. Future research should further explore the efficacy and safety of newer therapies through additional controlled clinical trials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^111zKMoH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of lichen sclerosus (LS) is usually clinical. When the clinical features are typical, histologic examination is not always essential. However, in the early stages of the disease, the diagnosis can be difficult. The main differential diagnoses include lichen planus (LP), lichen simplex chronicus, vitiligo, immunobullous disorders such as mucous membrane pemphigoid, and vulvar or penile intraepithelial neoplasia. In clinically inconclusive cases, a histologic examination is advisable; it may close the diagnostic gap but should never be interpreted in isolation.

One-third of men with sufficient symptoms and signs to be clinically diagnosed with LS showed only nonspecific histology on biopsy or in the circumcised prepuce. A nonspecific biopsy does not rule out LS, but classic histologic findings confirm the diagnosis. Patients under routine follow-up will need a biopsy if:

- **Suspicion of neoplastic change**: A persistent area of hyperkeratosis, persistent erosion, or erythema, or new warty or papular lesions.
- **Resistance to treatment**: An area resistant to adequate treatment.
- **Extragenital LS**: Features suggesting an overlap with morphea.
- **Pigmented areas**: To exclude an abnormal melanocytic proliferation.
- **Second-line therapy considerations**.

There are instances when it can be impossible to differentiate between LS and LP based on either clinical or histologic features. These cases are described as overlap syndrome and often show poor response to treatment.

### Lichen sclerosus: Review of the literature and current recommendations for management [^115igr6h]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

We reviewed the literature regarding the clinical presentation, etiology, natural history, and medical and surgical management of lichen sclerosus in men.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of the literature in PubMed, MEDLINE, and other electronic databases between 1950 and 2006 using the keywords lichen sclerosis, balanitis xerotica obliterans, and urethral stricture. Our search resulted in 1,268 sources containing the words lichen sclerosus or balanitis xerotica obliterans. We reviewed 68 articles in peer-reviewed journals and 2 chapters on this subject.

- **Results**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, lymphocyte-mediated skin disease that was first described in 1887. It shows a predilection for the anogenital area in men and women. Much has been discovered regarding the epidemiology, natural history, and histological features of this disease process during the last century, including the discovery of a strong association between lichen sclerosus and squamous cell carcinoma. The techniques of medical and surgical management of this disorder are still being elucidated. Biopsy of the initial lesion for definitive diagnosis and long-term follow-up of affected patients are well-established, critical elements in the management of lichen sclerosus.

- **Conclusions**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, debilitating condition that may progress to cause significant voiding complications. Biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of having lichen sclerosus to rule out squamous cell carcinoma. Further research is needed to improve the prevention and understanding of this condition.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113DdK1Y]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder affecting both genital and extragenital skin. It is a debilitating disease causing itch, pain, dysuria, restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest that LS is an autoimmune-induced disease in genetically predisposed patients, rather than being significantly influenced by hormonal factors. Preceding infections may play a provocative role, though the involvement of Borrelia remains controversial. Trauma and an occlusive moist environment might act as precipitating factors.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids are the primary therapeutic agents used. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered for patients who do not respond to ultrapotent corticosteroids or for whom corticosteroids are contraindicated. Topical and systemic retinoids might be beneficial in select cases. For extragenital LS, phototherapy, and for genital LS, photodynamic therapy may be considered for rare, refractory cases. Surgical intervention is limited to scarring processes causing functional impairment. In men, circumcision proves effective in most cases, but recurrences are well documented.

Anogenital LS is associated with an elevated risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS in both female and male genitals and extragenital regions.

### Does longer duration of corticosteroid treatment improve clearance in vulvar lichen sclerosus? Results from a single centre, comparative, open label study [^116AyTAc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). High credibility.

The ideal treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) should aim at inducing relief of symptoms, reversing signs, and preventing further anatomical changes. Adherence to long-term treatment was also shown to prevent progression towards cancer. Based on the immunological pathophysiology of VLS, high potency topical corticosteroids represent the first-line treatment in the active phase of the disease. Consistent with this, there is strong evidence that potent and ultra-potent corticosteroids have an excellent effect on both symptom control and, although to a lesser extent, on the reversal of clinical signs. This evidence is largely based on trials of 12-week duration, which is the conventional duration of trials assessing the effectiveness of topical treatments in the active phase of the disease.

Despite significant improvement in symptoms and signs, a recent retrospective study highlighted the fact that complete cure of VLS occurs in a minority of patients treated with 12-week therapies. This means that, at treatment completion, most patients may still have substantial residual disease, with possible negative effects on their well-being and quality of life. In this regard, one might wonder if treatment courses that are longer than the conventional duration may provide therapeutic advantages and increase the chance of complete clearance.

The present study purposely assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of a 24-week treatment with a potent corticosteroid. A comparison was also made with the treatment outcomes achieved with a standard 12-week duration.

### The role of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lichen sclerosus [^115kBu1z]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a propensity to affect the mucocutaneous anogenital area. Topical corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for this condition and constitute an effective therapeutic modality. However, in patients with corticosteroid-resistant disease, when long-term remission is not sustainable, or in those intolerant to these agents, topical calcineurin inhibitors may be considered. Studies have demonstrated their efficacy and tolerability; however, concerns remain regarding their malignant potential with long-term use. As lichen sclerosus is a potentially precancerous dermatosis, topical calcineurin inhibitors should be used with caution in this disorder.

### Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^1121oBLP]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review is to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of genital lichen sclerosus (LS), its urologic manifestations, and treatment options.

- **Materials and methods**: The Medline/PubMed and Embase databases were systematically reviewed for publications related to LS. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, references were assessed for relevance to the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of LS by title and abstract review by two independent reviewers, yielding 186 articles for assessment.

- **Results**: The contemporary understanding of the epidemiology and histology of LS is reviewed herein. Additionally, we explore in detail the three hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanism contributing to disease presentation: infectious etiology, primary immune dysregulation, and the isotraumatopic response. We summarize the available biological evidence supporting each hypothesis. This discussion provides context for understanding LS morbidity and may spur new avenues of research. For the clinician, we review the clinical presentation of the disease, including the risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma. The medical and surgical treatment options are also detailed.

In conclusion, LS remains a potentially insidious disease that may lead to debilitating urinary and sexual dysfunction. Cross-disciplinary research should aim for earlier detection, as well as more effective and durable treatment. The exact cause of LS remains unknown.

### Systemic therapy for lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^115cW3CK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory process predominantly affecting anogenital skin, with extragenital involvement in up to 20% of cases. The mainstay of therapy for anogenital LS is topical immunosuppression. However, in treatment-refractory cases, severe or hypertrophic disease, systemic modalities may be used. Currently, there are no guidelines for systemic therapy in LS.

The study aimed to provide a review of the literature on the use of systemic therapies for LS, including demographic and clinical features of LS, as well as reported outcomes. A primary literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science, from the journal's publication year until June 2022.

Ultimately, 71 studies consisting of 392 patients were included. Of these, 65% (n = 254) had anogenital disease, 9% (n = 36) had extragenital disease, 19% (n = 73) had both anogenital and extragenital disease, and in 7% (n = 29) of cases, the location was not specified.

- **Frequent therapies and outcomes**: The most frequent therapies, stratified by total cases, included oral retinoids (n = 227), methotrexate (n = 59), hydroxychloroquine (n = 36), and systemic steroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, oral triamcinolone, and other systemic steroids) (n = 60). Overall, 76% (n = 194) of anogenital, 94% (n = 34) of extragenital, and 81% (n = 59) of patients with both anogenital and extragenital involvement were reported to have clinical or symptomatic improvement.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115njFh1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Studies concerning pediatric lichen sclerosus are limited, and, at the time of writing, there have been no studies comparing the course of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls. We sought to examine all publications on boys and girls with lichen sclerosus and assess and compare epidemiology, symptoms and signs, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in the Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were information on children ages 0–18 years and a clinical or histologic diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. Literature from 1985 to 2021 was reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 1780 articles were retrieved from the search, of which 90 articles were eligible for inclusion. Boys and girls present similarly on many aspects; nonetheless, treatment and follow-up are approached differently.

- **Conclusions**: Though the clinical approach is often different, lichen sclerosus in boys and girls demonstrates many similarities. More research is needed, especially on follow-up, to gain a better understanding of the course of lichen sclerosus and establish an advanced management plan for children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113YD3Ss]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term follow-up in 83 women, with a median follow-up time of 4.7 years, confirmed a high rate of relapses of 84% at 4 years. Even with long-term, ultrapotent, topical corticosteroid maintenance treatment, tolerance in this cohort was excellent. Surprisingly, no atrophic effects were observed.

Several studies showed that less potent topical corticosteroids, such as mometasone furoate or triamcinolone, are also effective in treating vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS). Cattaneo et al. treated 31 women with biopsy-proven vulvar LS with a regimen of 0.1% mometasone furoate cream applied once daily for 4 weeks and then twice weekly for 8 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, all women showed significant improvement in the gross aspects of the disease and a dramatic decrease in symptoms, with nearly all subjects experiencing complete symptomatic remission. No adverse effects were observed. The use of a less potent topical corticosteroid could be safer, particularly for long-term maintenance treatment of LS. To minimize corticosteroid exposure, many clinics successfully practice lowering the potency and frequency of applied corticosteroids once remission has occurred and maintenance therapy is required.

In the treatment of childhood vulvar LS, an excellent response to a potent topical corticosteroid (betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%) without serious adverse events was first described in a small case series in 1997. Other authors have confirmed these results in prepubertal girls treated with ultrapotent topical corticosteroids, also without significant adverse effects.

### Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Pathophysiology and treatment [^116ZTUXo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic disorder of the skin and mucosal surfaces, most commonly seen on the female genital skin, although it can occur on other areas of the body. While any age group may be affected, it is more frequently observed in elderly women. The exact cause of lichen sclerosus remains unknown. However, reports of family members with the condition suggest a possible genetic link, and there is also a potential autoimmune component.

Currently, ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are the medical treatment of choice. Other treatments utilized for this condition include testosterone, progesterone, tacrolimus, surgery, and phototherapy. Surgery should be reserved for symptomatic patients who do not respond to multiple medical treatments, as there is a high recurrence rate following surgical intervention. The risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is approximately 5% in women with vulvar lichen sclerosus. Therefore, close surveillance by both healthcare providers and patients is necessary.

This review discusses the history, clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of lichen sclerosus of the vulva, as well as issues related to pregnancy and sexual function in patients with this condition. Additionally, it reviews problems specific to children with lichen sclerosus.

### Fractional CO laser treatment as adjunctive therapy to topical steroids for managing vulvar lichen sclerosus [^1156Fg76]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The need for second-line or adjunctive therapies to augment topical corticosteroid standard-of-care is well recognized. Medical providers have explored various therapies to address symptoms and active disease. Published accounts reflect variable success in treating recalcitrant vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) with medical therapies, such as intralesional corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, oral or topical retinoids, and immunosuppressors. Surgical modalities are currently the main treatment for architectural changes arising from chronic VLS.

An ideal adjunctive therapy for VLS would augment topical corticosteroid therapy to achieve and maintain remission in recalcitrant cases and address architectural change as a means to improve sexual dysfunction. Studies on fractional carbon dioxide (CO₂) laser as a treatment modality for other vulvovaginal conditions suggest its potential efficacy in treating recalcitrant VLS. In these studies, vaginal treatment with fractional CO₂ laser has been shown to reconstitute normal vaginal flora, drive collagenogenesis and tissue remodeling, and alleviate symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Fractional CO₂ resurfacing has also been successful in achieving remission in patients with severe hyperkeratotic VLS that is unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. Following CO₂ laser treatment, these patients' VLS became manageable with topical corticosteroid treatment. Significantly, CO₂ laser has also been successful in treating clitoral phimosis caused by VLS.

This study assesses the long-term outcome and safety profile of fractional CO₂ laser therapy as an adjunctive treatment for VLS.

### An arm-based network meta-analysis on treatments for vulvar lichen sclerosus and a call for development of core outcome sets [^113PsD7T]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present systematic review is to evaluate the available medical treatments for vulvar lichen sclerosus, using an arm-based network meta-analysis protocol.

- **Data sources**: We searched Medline (1966–2019), Scopus (2004–2019), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL (1999–2019), Clinicaltrials.gov (2008–2019) databases, and Google Scholar (2004–2019) database along with the reference list of all included studies.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: All observational, randomized, and single-arm studies that evaluated medical treatments for vulvar lichen sclerosus were considered eligible for inclusion in the present systematic review.

- **Study appraisal**: A network meta-analysis was carried out in R 3.4.3 using the pcnetmeta package, which uses a Bayesian hierarchical model based on Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence simulation.

Sixteen studies were included in this present meta-analysis, which recruited 954 women with vulvar lichen sclerosus. Their quality was evaluated with the JADAD, Cochrane risk of bias, and risk of bias in nonrandomised studies of interventions-I tools. Clobetasol treatment ranked as the best treatment for disease remission after evaluating rank probabilities (40% chance of ranking first compared with tacrolimus [38%]); however, the density plot revealed partial overlapping with tacrolimus. The lowest probability of experiencing a relapse was observed with pimecrolimus (15% [2–48%]); however, the density plot revealed significant overlapping with mometasone furoate, testosterone, and clobetasol.

### Does longer duration of corticosteroid treatment improve clearance in vulvar lichen sclerosus? Results from a single centre, comparative, open label study [^1176NjrT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

A complete clearance of vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is achieved in a minority of patients treated with a standard 12-week duration corticosteroid treatment. The aim of this pragmatic, retrospective, open label, comparative trial was to assess the effectiveness, in terms of complete clearance, of a 24-week treatment with mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment (MMF) and to compare it with a 12-week therapy.

We included VLS patients treated with MMF administered for five consecutive days/week for 24 weeks (group A). The following were assessed:

- **Clearance in Global Subjective Score (GSS), Global Objective Score (GOS) or both**: Changes of these parameters and dyspareunia at treatment completion compared to baseline.
- **Safety profile**: All these assessments were compared with the same outcomes recorded among VLS patients who had previously undergone a 12-week MMF treatment (group B).

Twenty-nine patients were included in group A and 32 in group B. The rates of patients who achieved the clearance of GSS, GOS, or both parameters did not significantly differ between groups A and B. The groups did not differ in any of the effectiveness outcomes assessed. A 24-week duration corticosteroid treatment does not seem to provide significant therapeutic benefits in comparison with standard 12-week courses, especially considering the occurrence of complete clearance.

### Topical interventions for genital lichen sclerosus [^112hSDzd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that most commonly occurs in adult women, although it may also be seen in men and children. It primarily affects the genital area and around the anus, causing persistent itching and soreness. Scarring after inflammation may lead to severe damage by fusion of the vulval lips (labia), narrowing of the vaginal opening, and burying of the clitoris in women and girls, as well as tightening of the foreskin in men and boys if treatments are not started early. Affected individuals have an increased risk of genital cancers.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical interventions for genital lichen sclerosus and adverse effects reported in included trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 16 September 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), LILACS (from 1982), CINAHL (from 1981), British Nursing Index and Archive (from 1985), Science Citation Index Expanded (from 1945), BIOSIS Previews (from 1926), Conference Papers Index (from 1982), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 1990). We also searched ongoing trial registries and scanned the bibliographies of included studies, published reviews, and papers that had cited the included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical interventions in genital lichen sclerosus.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115QKoGj]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

- **Treatment**: In both girls and boys, moisturizing practices with emollients are crucial to reduce irritation and restore the skin barrier.

In girls, a systematic review of pediatric lichen sclerosus (LS) concluded that ultrapotent topical corticosteroid ointment, generally clobetasol propionate 0.05% (CP 0.05%), is the most effective treatment to induce remission, with improvement of symptoms and signs in 99% of patients within 4–12 weeks. In most cases, treatment is applied for up to 3 months, after which intermittent maintenance therapy is often required or advised. Despite the initial therapy with CP 0.05%, overall recurrences in girls were reported in 67% within 1 year, and additional treatment was required in 37% after 3 months of therapy. Tacrolimus 0.03%–0.1% ointment is reported to produce improvement in signs and symptoms but may be less effective than CP 0.05%. Tacrolimus is often used along with CP 0.05% or bridged during remission. Anderson found that tacrolimus 0.1% showed promise as an option for maintenance therapy. Initially, tacrolimus can sometimes briefly cause a burning sensation upon application. After treatment with potent topical corticosteroids (TCS), Ellis and Fischer prescribed individualized maintenance regimes with moderate- or mild-potency TCS. Scarring and progression was prevented in subjects adherent to maintenance. Surgery is not advised for girls with LS. In adolescence, there might rarely be an indication for introitus-plasty in non-active LS.

A follow-up should be obtained at 6 months post-circumcision, with careful investigation of the meatus and glans. Urethral surgery is reserved for special cases, such as hypospadias.

Systemic retinoids have been used in the past with considerable success in severe vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS), but in women of childbearing age, the teratogenic risk limits their use.

Surgery should be limited to patients with associated malignancy or to patients who need correction of functionally restricting, scarring processes. Phototherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are possible third-line therapies in cases resistant to the aforementioned treatments.

Genital lichen sclerosus is associated with scarring and an increased risk for vulvar and penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Long-term follow-up and ongoing suppressive treatment are mandatory.

### Lichen sclerosus: A review and practical approach [^111jUSjt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic dermatitis predominantly found in the anogenital area. It can affect individuals of any age group, sex, or race, but is most commonly present in Caucasian peri- or postmenopausal women. Although the etiology of LS remains uncertain, an autoimmune process is believed to underlie this condition. With many cases going unreported, its incidence is still unknown.

There is no cure for LS; however, treatment offers control of the condition for three primary reasons: relief of symptoms and discomfort, prevention of any or further anatomical changes, and a theoretical prevention of malignant transformation. Although many treatments have been suggested over the years, only potent or ultra-potent corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice. After initial therapy, some patients might only use corticosteroids as needed, while others may require twice-weekly maintenance therapy.

There is no place for surgery in uncomplicated LS. Surgery should be limited exclusively to patients with malignancy and to correct scarring secondary to the disease. Lichen sclerosus is associated with a 4–6% risk of squamous cell carcinoma, making long-term follow-up essential in these patients.

Regarding surgical interventions for lichen sclerosus, specifically concerning indications for surgery in females, the EADV 2015 guidelines recommend considering minor surgical procedures, such as perineotomy, de-adhesiolysis, or Z-plasty, for symptomatic relief (dyspareunia) in highly selected patients with vulvar LS. It is advised to combine surgery with perioperative anti-inflammatory treatment and the use of dilators and/or early resumption of intercourse after surgery to prevent restenosis.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for lichen sclerosus, specifically in relation to topical emollients, the BASHH 2025 guidelines recommend using ointment bases instead of cream-based treatments for anogenital skin. This preference is due to the reduced need for preservatives in ointment bases, thereby minimizing the risk of irritation and secondary contact allergy.

Regarding specific circumstances for lichen sclerosus, particularly in pediatric patients, the EDF 2024 guidelines recommend considering circumcision, preferably removing the complete foreskin, if the guideline-recommended treatment fails in pediatric male patients with phimosis caused by LS. It is important to evaluate the removed foreskin through a histopathological examination to confirm LS and exclude precancerous lesions, such as severe dysplasia, which necessitates a close follow-up after surgery. Pre- and postoperative treatment with topical corticosteroid ointments should be administered for 4 weeks before and 4–12 weeks after the procedure, starting 1 week postoperatively.
