## Question

What is the diagnostic approach to Morton neuroma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step diagnostic approach to Morton neuroma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and history features that anchor the diagnosis. Then, I should review the targeted physical examination and the evidence behind specific provocative maneuvers. Next, I will examine when and how to use imaging, clarifying ultrasound versus MRI and addressing any conflicting data. After that, I will consider the role of diagnostic injections as a therapeutic-diagnostic tool. I should confirm the limited utility of electrodiagnostics. I will then outline key differential diagnoses that can mimic or coexist. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged diagnostic algorithm and verify that each step aligns with the available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the characteristic history that supports Morton neuroma as a largely clinical diagnosis. Patients classically present with burning forefoot pain at the metatarsal heads, often radiating to the adjacent toes in the third web space, accompanied by paresthesias and the sensation of "walking on a stone", with worsening in tight or high-heeled shoes and relief with shoe removal or offloading, which is highly suggestive and typically sufficient to ground initial clinical suspicion [^116sXxzw] [^114rZgcV]. Hold on, I should verify that these features truly form the foundation of first-line decision making; contemporary reviews emphasize that history and exam guide initial diagnosis and nonoperative care, including activity modification and orthoses, before imaging is considered in atypical cases or prior to intervention [^116sXxzw].

> Next, I should review the physical examination and confirm which maneuvers carry the best evidence. The thumb–index finger squeeze test has the highest reported sensitivity and accuracy for Morton neuroma among bedside tests, and reproducing the patient's focal pain and paresthesias in the involved interspace meaningfully raises post-test probability, whereas Mulder's click is less sensitive and tends to be positive with larger lesions, and the foot squeeze is less reliable overall [^115qeLDu]. Wait, I should double-check the overall diagnostic performance of clinical evaluation; retrospective surgical series suggest clinical assessment can achieve very high sensitivity for both diagnosis and correct interspace localization, sometimes outperforming imaging for localization, which supports using exam findings to guide early management and targeted imaging only when needed [^117LYwmi] [^115qeLDu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; I need to check when it adds value. Imaging is not mandatory for straightforward cases but is helpful for atypical symptoms, exclusion of alternative pathology, mapping multiplicity, and pre-intervention planning, with ultrasound typically preferred first because it is accessible, cost-effective, dynamic, and facilitates guided procedures, including real-time assessment of Mulder's sonographic sign during compression [^111kAAQd] [^116W14LZ] [^114rZgcV]. Let me verify accuracy comparisons: one meta-analysis found ultrasound and MRI had similar high sensitivity, while another reported comparable sensitivity but higher specificity for ultrasound, highlighting that operator expertise and study selection drive variability; in practice, I still favor ultrasound first for problem-solving and guidance, while acknowledging interoperator variability as a limitation [^111kAAQd] [^111VLHG8] [^115H7Srv].

> I will now examine the role of MRI to clarify its niche. MRI provides characteristic appearances of a low T1, variable T2 ovoid or dumbbell-shaped lesion within the neurovascular bundle with homogeneous post-contrast enhancement, and is well-suited as a second-line modality when ultrasound is inconclusive, when concurrent pathology is suspected, or when precise soft-tissue mapping is required before surgery or ablation [^116W14LZ] [^114rZgcV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MRI would consistently be more specific than ultrasound, but one systematic review actually shows lower specificity for MRI versus ultrasound, even though another pooled analysis found MRI specificity to be very high; given these discrepancies, modality choice should be tailored to question and local expertise, with MRI reserved for complex or equivocal cases rather than as a default first test [^111VLHG8] [^111kAAQd].

> Let me consider the diagnostic-therapeutic value of injection, and I should confirm the advantage of image guidance. Interdigital anesthetic injection that relieves pain confirms the neuroma as the pain generator, and adding corticosteroid provides clinically meaningful short-term improvement in foot health in randomized trials, with ultrasound guidance improving accuracy and patient-reported outcomes versus landmark-based injections both in the short term and sustained over years, which strengthens the case for guided injections before proceeding to invasive treatments [^115WMMBz] [^112P72gc] [^1146sJWU]. But wait, what if the injection is non-guided and still helps? Even then, the evidence trends favor ultrasound guidance for both technical success and durability of symptom improvement, so I should recommend guidance when feasible, especially in recurrent or equivocal cases [^112P72gc] [^1146sJWU].

> Next, I should review the limited role of electrodiagnostics and make sure I'm not overusing them. Nerve conduction approaches detect abnormalities in only a subset of patients, with abnormality rates around 57–71 percent, so routine electrodiagnostics are not recommended for typical Morton neuroma; they are best reserved for atypical neuropathic presentations or when broader neuromuscular differentials are being entertained, in line with the literature's acknowledgment that there are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria and that clinical response to diagnostic block remains central [^115mwPvL] [^111R2jhk]. Hold on, I should verify that the clinical–imaging pathway remains the most effective overall; multiple series affirm the primacy of history and exam, with imaging as an adjunct or for interventional planning, which aligns with this conservative use of electrodiagnostics [^117LYwmi] [^115qeLDu].

> I will now examine important differential diagnoses and comorbidities that should be considered, especially when imaging is atypical or symptoms persist. Synovial sarcoma in the web space is rare but can mimic a neuroma clinically and radiographically, and tendon-sheath fibroma in the web can present with neuroma-like symptoms and be cured by nerve-sparing excision, so red flags and atypical imaging should prompt reconsideration and, at times, biopsy or alternative management pathways [^113np6Ka] [^116vy69Z]. Let me reconsider mechanical contributors; mechanical metatarsalgia may coexist and is associated with symptom relapse after alcohol sclerosing therapy, and proximal compressive neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome can coexist in a meaningful fraction of cases, both of which may influence outcomes and require parallel management strategies to optimize response [^113syb6H] [^1115qACo].

> Now, I should synthesize this into a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm while preserving the evidence cadence. Level 1 is clinical: a detailed history with the classic burning forefoot pain and radiation pattern plus a targeted exam favoring the thumb–index finger squeeze test can justify a clinical diagnosis and initiation of conservative measures including footwear modification and orthoses, with the understanding that I initially thought the overall sensitivity was 96 percent, but wait, I should correct that to approximately 96.5 percent for accurate diagnosis and localization in surgical series [^116sXxzw] [^117LYwmi]. Level 2 is confirmation and mapping: if the picture is atypical, before invasive procedures, or if multiplicity is suspected, obtain ultrasound as the first-line imaging, reserving MRI for inconclusive ultrasound or complex differential considerations, acknowledging operator dependence and the mixed specificity data across meta-analyses [^111kAAQd] [^111VLHG8] [^115H7Srv]. Level 3 is diagnostic–therapeutic: use ultrasound-guided anesthetic with or without corticosteroid injection to confirm the pain generator and provide symptom relief, stepping toward intervention only if reasonable nonoperative care fails [^115WMMBz] [^112P72gc] [^1146sJWU].

> Finally, I need to ensure conservative management context is aligned with evidence because diagnostic steps often segue directly into care. First-line nonoperative strategies include activity and footwear modification and metatarsal offloading, with randomized data supporting customized insoles for functional gains and pain-on-walking reduction, and injection options such as corticosteroid or capsaicin providing short-term benefit in selected patients, which can also reinforce diagnosis when response is robust [^116sXxzw] [^1151YHR6] [^1115EvhU]. Hold on, let me verify that the diagnostic pathway remains predominantly clinical while leveraging imaging and injections judiciously; the convergence of contemporary reviews, surgical series, and modality comparisons supports this staged, verification-oriented approach that emphasizes history and exam first, ultrasound for problem-solving and guidance, MRI for complex cases, and targeted injection as a diagnostic–therapeutic bridge [^117LYwmi] [^111kAAQd] [^115WMMBz].

Diagnosis of Morton's neuroma relies on clinical assessment [^116sXxzw] supported by imaging [^111VLHG8], with **clinical tests first** and **ultrasound preferred** for confirmation [^111kAAQd].

- **Clinical assessment**: Look for burning or shooting forefoot pain, numbness, or a "pebble" sensation [^116sXxzw], often worsened by tight shoes or activity. The thumb-index squeeze test is the most sensitive clinical test (96% sensitivity), while Mulder's click is less sensitive but more specific [^115qeLDu].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is the first-line imaging due to high sensitivity (90–91%) [^111kAAQd] and specificity (88–100%) [^112vJXe9], and it allows dynamic assessment [^114rZgcV]. MRI is reserved for inconclusive cases or when malignancy is suspected [^113np6Ka], with similar sensitivity but lower specificity than ultrasound [^111VLHG8].

- **Diagnostic injections**: Ultrasound-guided [^112P72gc] corticosteroid [^115WMMBz] or local anesthetic injections can confirm diagnosis [^111R2jhk] if they relieve symptoms.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude metatarsalgia, stress fractures, tarsal tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis, and peripheral neuropathy through clinical evaluation and imaging [^1179bwVV].

- **Histopathology**: Not routinely required; shows perineural fibrosis and nerve enlargement if performed [^115H7Srv].

In summary, diagnosis relies on **clinical features** confirmed by **ultrasound**, with selective use of **MRI** or diagnostic injections [^116sXxzw].

### Common painful foot and ankle conditions: A review [^116sXxzw]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are foot and ankle conditions associated with pain and disability, but they can respond to nonoperative treatment.

- **Observations**: Morton neuroma, consisting of interdigital neuronal thickening and fibrosis, is characterized by burning pain in the ball of the foot and numbness or burning pain that may radiate to the affected toes (commonly the third and fourth toes). First-line nonoperative therapy consists of reducing activities that cause pain, orthotics, and interdigital corticosteroid injection; however, approximately 30% of patients may not respond to conservative treatment.

Plantar fasciitis accounts for more than 1 million patient visits per year in the US and typically presents with plantar heel pain. Fifteen years after diagnosis, approximately 44% of patients continue to have pain. First-line nonoperative therapy includes stretching of the plantar fascia and foot orthotics, followed by extracorporeal shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy presents with pain approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion on the heel. The primary nonoperative treatment involves eccentric strengthening exercises, but extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be used.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are painful foot and ankle conditions. First-line therapies include activity restriction, orthotics, and corticosteroid injection for Morton neuroma; and stretching and foot orthotics for plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinopathy.

### The operational characteristics of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of plantar intermetatarsal neuroma [^112vJXe9]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was carried out on 48 patients to correlate preoperative ultrasound findings with postoperative histopathology findings and to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of ultrasound in the diagnosis of Morton's interdigital neuroma. All case sheets of the 48 patients operated on between 1997 and 2005 were reviewed in the medical record section of Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland, so that preoperative ultrasound reports were compared with the postoperative histopathological reports. A statistical analysis of the results was performed.

Ultrasonography showed 43 true-positive cases, 1 true-negative case, and 4 false-negative cases out of 48 cases. Histopathology showed 47 true-positive cases and 1 true-negative case. Statistical analysis performed on the results showed a sensitivity of 91.48%, a specificity of 100%, and 100% positive and 20% negative predictive values, respectively. In our analysis, the probability that ultrasound will confirm the presence of plantar intermetatarsal neuroma is 91.67%.

### Ultrasound-guided diagnosis and treatment of Morton's neuroma [^114rZgcV]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Morton's neuroma is the fibrous enlargement of the interdigital nerve branches, usually found in the second and third interspace between the metatarsal heads where the lateral and medial plantar nerves often join. Specific symptoms include dull or sharp pain, numbness and/or tingling in the third and fourth digits, a burning sensation, cramping, and a feeling of "walking on a stone" around the metatarsal heads.

Numerous clinical tests for Morton's neuroma have been described, such as the thumb-index finger squeeze, Mulder's click, and foot squeeze tests. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can be used for confirmation, especially for differential diagnosis, exact localization, and identifying the number of neuromas. Performing dynamic imaging during these tests is crucial and can readily be carried out with ultrasound.

Treatment mainly comprises footwear modifications, radiofrequency ablation, physical therapy, and local (corticosteroid and anesthetic) injections into the affected webspace. Surgery is another option. The use of real-time ultrasound guidance during such interventions is noteworthy.

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for Morton's neuroma compared with ultrasonography [^115qeLDu]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of seven clinical tests for Morton's neuroma (MN) compared with ultrasonography (US). Forty patients (54 feet) were diagnosed with MN using predetermined clinical criteria. These patients were subsequently referred for US, which was performed by a single, experienced musculoskeletal radiologist. The clinical test results were compared against the US findings. MN was confirmed on US at the site of clinical diagnosis in 53 feet (98%).

- **Operational characteristics of the clinical tests performed were as follows**:
	- Thumb index finger squeeze: 96% sensitivity, 96% accuracy
	- Mulder's click: 61% sensitivity, 62% accuracy
	- Foot squeeze: 41% sensitivity, 41% accuracy
	- Plantar percussion: 37% sensitivity, 36% accuracy
	- Dorsal percussion: 33% sensitivity, 26% accuracy
	- Light touch and pin prick: 26% sensitivity, 25% accuracy

No correlation was found between the size of MN on US and the positive clinical tests, except for Mulder's click. The size of MN was significantly larger in patients with a positive Mulder's click (10.9 versus 8.5 mm, p = .016). Overall, the clinical assessment was comparable to US in diagnosing MN. The thumb index finger squeeze test was identified as the most sensitive screening test for the clinical diagnosis of MN.

### Morton's neuroma: Review of anatomy, pathomechanism, and imaging [^115H7Srv]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Morton's neuroma is a commonly encountered cause of forefoot pain, which may limit weight-bearing activities and footwear choices. Although the etiology and pathomechanism of this condition are controversial, the histological endpoint is well established as benign perineural fibrosis of a common plantar digital nerve, typically within the third intermetatarsal space. The diagnosis of Morton's neuroma is mainly based on characteristic symptoms and clinical findings but may be confirmed by ultrasonography. Although ultrasound is a highly accurate diagnostic tool for Morton's neuroma, it is subject to interoperator variability due to differences in technique and level of experience.

In this paper, the authors review the anatomy of the common plantar digital nerves and surrounding structures in the forefoot, which are deemed relevant to understanding Morton's neuroma, especially from a sonographic point of view. Several theories of the pathomechanism of Morton's neuroma are briefly discussed. The main purpose of this article is to illustrate the ultrasound techniques for evaluating Morton's neuroma and performing ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections.

### The accuracy of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma: a systematic review [^111VLHG8]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the accuracy of MRI versus ultrasound for Morton's neuroma, a search was undertaken for clinical studies published in any language in PubMed up to December 2013. Studies assessing the accuracy of the ultrasound or MRI for the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Study selection, data collection, and extraction were performed independently by two authors. Meta-disc 1.4 and Revman 5.2 software were applied for statistical analysis.

The study included 12 studies; 217 patients underwent MRI and 241 underwent ultrasound examinations. There appeared greater diagnostic accuracy for ultrasound than MRI for the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma. Ultrasound sensitivity was 90%, specificity 88%, positive likelihood ratio 2.77, negative likelihood ratio 0.16, versus MRI sensitivity 93%, specificity 68%, positive likelihood ratio 1.89, negative likelihood ratio 0.19.

The available evidence suggests that ultrasound can provide better accuracy for the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma than MRI.

### The local molecular signature of human peripheral neuropathic pain [^1147NECd]. Pain (2025). High credibility.

Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and duration of Morton's neuroma symptoms (if applicable) were recorded for each participant. The severity of patients' symptoms was evaluated presurgery using a range of clinical questionnaires. The average severity of pain and numbness over the past 24 hours was recorded on separate visual analogue scales (VAS), where 0 indicated no symptoms and 10 indicated the worst symptoms imaginable. The severity and profile of neuropathic pain were evaluated with the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), which consists of 10 numerical rating scales from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). These scales are used to rate pain subtypes, including burning, deep pressure pain, paraesthesia, paroxysmal symptoms, and evoked pain, as well as a composite score.

To determine the characteristics of the neuropathic pain profile of Morton's neuroma compared with other neuropathies, we compared NPSI data among people with Morton's neuroma (n = 56, of which n = 22 were included in the tissue analysis), spine-related leg pain ("sciatica", n = 134), carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 113), and diabetic neuropathy (n = 628). The data for the latter three cohorts were available from our previously published studies (REC Ref 18/SC/0263 and 10/H0706/35).

We report the case of a 75-year-old male who underwent a lung lobectomy for presumed lung cancer. Thereafter, he presented with a painful mass between the third and fourth metatarsal heads in the foot, which was assumed to be Morton's neuroma. After extensive oncologic evaluation, the foot mass was diagnosed as a synovial sarcoma. In retrospect, his lung lesion was understood to be metastatic disease.

### Comparing clinical examination and radiological evaluation in the preoperative diagnosis and location of symptomatic interdigital (Morton's) neuroma [^117LYwmi]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

This study investigates whether clinical examination is as sensitive as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and localization of symptomatic interdigital neuroma. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two tertiary centers on all consecutive patients who underwent excision by a single foot and ankle specialist surgeon for a presumed interdigital neuroma between January 2008 and December 2020.

Investigators collected preoperative clinical findings, radiological investigations, and postoperative outcomes. Sensitivity and positive predictive values were calculated, and a Z-score for two populations' proportions was performed. Among 114 consecutive patients operated on for 131 suspected interdigital neuromas, 13 were excluded due to inadequate clinical documentation. Of the remaining 101 patients with 118 suspected interdigital neuromas, 115 were confirmed histologically (97.5%).

The sensitivity of clinical assessment to accurately diagnose and place an interdigital neuroma in the correct space was calculated as 96.5%. The most common preoperative clinical feature was pain (99.2%).

- **Ultrasound**: The calculated sensitivity for ultrasound to accurately diagnose an interdigital neuroma was 83.6%, and to correctly locate the neuroma was 79.5%, both statistically different compared to clinical assessment (p-value: < 0.001).

- **MRI**: The calculated sensitivity for MRI to accurately diagnose an interdigital neuroma was 93.6%, which was statistically different from clinical assessment (p-value: .005).

### Surgical interventions for the treatment of painful neuroma: a comparative meta-analysis [^111pKR2F]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

A consensus on the optimal treatment of painful neuromas does not exist. Our objective was to identify available data and to examine the role of surgical technique on outcomes following surgical management of painful neuromas. In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a comprehensive literature search to identify studies measuring the efficacy of the surgical treatment of painful neuromas in the extremities (excluding Morton's neuroma and compression neuropathies).

- **Surgical treatments**: Surgical treatments were categorized as excision-only, excision and transposition, excision and cap, excision and repair, or neurolysis and coverage. Data on the proportion of patients with a meaningful reduction in pain were pooled, and a random-effects meta-analysis was performed. The effects of confounding, study quality, and publication bias were examined with stratified, meta-regression, and bias analysis.

Fifty-four articles met the inclusion criteria, many with multiple treatment groups. Outcomes reporting varied significantly, and few studies controlled for confounding. Overall, surgical treatment of neuroma pain was effective in 77% of patients [95% confidence interval: 73–81]. No significant differences were seen between surgical techniques. Among studies with a mean pain duration greater than 24 months, or a median number of operations greater than 2 prior to definitive neuroma pain surgery, excision and transposition or neurolysis and coverage were significantly more likely than other operative techniques to result in a meaningful reduction in pain (P < 0.05).

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^116rDPfD]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic pain due to nerve injury-induced painful neuroma

The term "chronic pain" can be misleading, and the need for timely surgical intervention is often mistakenly dismissed in these cases. Such delays and assumptions can lead to significant impairment and/or inability to return to work and may have even more devastating outcomes, especially if suicidal ideation is present. Although a variety of treatment options are currently used for pain secondary to neuroma formation, most are focused on treatment of symptoms. Nonsurgical or symptomatic treatments are often unsuccessful, as they fail to address the root cause of pain. When pain persists despite reasonable treatment via supportive symptomatic modalities, surgical intervention targeting the source of the pain is indicated.

- **Take-home messages**: If chronic pain persists 3 to 6 months after nerve injury, it is recommended that surgical exploration/treatment be electively scheduled, with patient goals and rate of symptom progression taken into consideration. Although the literature is unclear regarding the exact timing, increased duration of symptoms has been associated with unfavorable outcomes.

If a patient presents with uncontrolled pain that is severe, progressing, or incapacitating despite nonoperative management, acute exploration/intervention should be considered. Ultimately, intervention must be determined using clinical judgment for each patient regardless of whether pain has persisted for 3 months.

### Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors: An interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^1159yyh1]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Tumors of peripheral nerves are commonly benign and can be removed without functional deficits in most cases. However, there is a high risk of initial misdiagnosis due to their rarity, leading to consecutive mistreatment with potential severe consequences. Therefore, treating disciplines must keep these rare differential diagnoses in mind. Treatment should be performed only at specialized centers.

### Can imaging be the new yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathy?-a comparison between high resolution ultrasound and MR neurography with an approach to diagnosis [^1155vsLd]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

In our study, six out of 37 cases of post-traumatic neuropathy exhibited nerve discontinuity, which was diagnosed by both ultrasound and MRI. Notably, among the non-traumatic neuropathies (infective, inflammatory, mass lesion, unclassified), nerve continuity was preserved in all instances. In comparing MRI and high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) for assessing nerve continuity, both modalities demonstrated equal sensitivity (100%) when compared to surgical findings, which were available for 28 out of 37 patients.

Neuroma formation was identified in 25 cases using MRI, while HRUS failed to correctly identify three of these cases. HRUS successfully detected neuromas in 88% of instances, compared to 100% detection with MRI. Surgical exploration confirmed neuroma presence in 18 out of the 25 cases identified by imaging; the remaining patients declined surgical intervention.

In terms of muscle changes, 15 affected nerves showed altered muscle intensities on MRI, while HRUS detected increased muscle echogenicity in only four cases.

Regarding the time taken for HRUS and MRI, a complete MRI study took, on average, five times longer than HRUS. The mean duration for a comprehensive MRI study was 37.32 minutes, with a standard deviation of 5.36 minutes. In contrast, HRUS required significantly less time, with a mean of 7.91 minutes and a standard deviation of 2.05 minutes.

Idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was the most common etiology diagnosed in our study, traditionally identified through nerve conduction velocity (NCV) testing. The findings in CTS, including reference cut-off values, are summarized in Table 5.

### Excision with interpositional nerve grafting: An alternative technique for the treatment of Morton neuroma [^115PXHQS]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

"Morton neuroma" is a common cause of forefoot pain, with numbness frequently occurring in the distribution of the third common digital nerve. After the failure of nonoperative measures, decompression with excision of the neuroma is common practice. Residual numbness and pain have been reported as consequences of this treatment option. This study describes excision of the neuroma with interpositional nerve grafting as a treatment option for Morton neuroma. This proposed technique has the benefit of reducing pain, decreasing the incidence of secondary neuromas, and restoring post-excision sensory deficits.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent elective primary excision of a Morton neuroma with interpositional nerve grafting was undertaken. Patient demographics, surgical technique, and clinical outcomes, such as pain, neuroma recurrence, 2-point discrimination, numbness, and weight-bearing status, at a minimum of 1 year post-operation are reported.

- **Results**: Eight patients (9 neuromas) underwent excision of the Morton neuroma with interpositional nerve grafting after failing nonoperative measures. At final follow-up, all patients had improvement of pain, and there were no neuroma recurrences. Sensation to the grafted hemi-toe returned in all but 1 case. All patients returned to full weight-bearing status. Although no major complications were reported, wound dehiscence secondary to a hematoma occurred in 1 case.

- **Conclusions**: Excision and interpositional nerve grafting is an effective treatment for Morton neuroma, as it alleviates pain and numbness.

### Heel neuroma: A case study [^112NEmkN]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of plantar heel neuroma, an entity that has previously been described and recognized. We believe it warrants further review due to the prevalence of plantar heel pain that does not respond to the usual array of treatments. It is our assertion that a neuroma of the medial calcaneal nerve often goes undiagnosed and may progress to a severely painful condition requiring surgical intervention. In this article, we describe another case of heel neuroma in an otherwise healthy patient with a history of chronic plantar heel pain that was unresponsive to a wide array of nonsurgical treatments.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for chronic foot pain induced by Morton neuroma: A novel, personalized approach in one patient [^1126bCEq]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old male patient presented with bilateral Morton Neuroma (MN) and over 15 years of persistent bilateral forefoot pain. The pain was described as sharp, burning pain involving the third web space bilaterally. Criteria for diagnosis of MN included a positive +3 Mulder click test and exquisite pain on bilateral compression of the third metatarsal base.

Over the course of 15 years, the patient had attempted conservative management with NSAIDs, antidepressants, oral anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesic medication. He then underwent six rounds of chemical neurolysis injections, a peripheral nerve block, and surgical intervention with bilateral synovectomies of the transverse ligaments. All these resulted in moderate, temporary relief with an eventual return of symptoms.

Given that conventional management strategies had failed and local treatments had transiently modulated the patient's pain, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) leads targeting the affected nerves were proposed as a treatment option, to which the patient consented.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for chronic foot pain induced by Morton neuroma: A novel, personalized approach in one patient [^115VakzV]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Morton neuroma (MN) is characterized by pain in the intermetatarsal spaces of the forefoot. Pain induced by MN can occur unilaterally or bilaterally and is characterized by burning, stinging, or painful numbness. Chronic or persistent cases represent 10% to 19% of the population with MN and can be physically and emotionally debilitating.

Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) has not, at the time of writing, been used to treat MN. Here, we describe the operative technique of a 78-year-old man with treatment-resistant chronic pain induced by bilateral MN that was treated with PNS.

### Methylprednisolone injections for the treatment of Morton neuroma: A patient-blinded randomized trial [^115WMMBz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2013). High credibility.

Morton neuroma is a common cause of neuralgia affecting the web spaces of the toes. Corticosteroid injections are commonly administered as a first-line therapy, but the evidence for their effectiveness is weak. Our primary research aim was to determine whether corticosteroid injection is an effective treatment for Morton neuroma compared with an anesthetic injection as a placebo control.

- **Methods**: We performed a pragmatic, patient-blinded randomized trial set within hospital orthopedic outpatient clinics in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. One hundred and thirty-one participants with Morton neuroma (mean age, fifty-three years; 111 [85%] female) were randomized to receive either corticosteroid and anesthetic (1 mL methylprednisolone [40 mg] and 1 mL 2% lignocaine) or anesthetic alone (2 mL 1% lignocaine). An ultrasonographic image was obtained before treatment, and injections were performed with the needle placed under ultrasonographic guidance. The primary outcome was the difference in patient global assessment of foot health between the two groups at three months after injection. This was measured with use of a 100-unit visual analog scale (VAS) anchored by "best imaginable health state" and "worst imaginable health state".

- **Results**: Compared with the control group, global assessment of foot health in the corticosteroid group was significantly better at three months (mean difference, 14.1 scale points [95% confidence interval, 5.5 to 22.8 points]; p = 0.002). The difference between the groups was also significant at one month.

Significant and nonsignificant improvements were observed, indicating the potential benefit of corticosteroid injections in treating Morton neuroma.

### Surgical management of neuromas of the hand and wrist [^114CRtnr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Low credibility.

Neuromas of the hand and wrist are common causes of peripheral nerve pain. These neuromas form following nerve injury and can be both debilitating and painful. Diagnosis is achieved through a thorough history and physical examination. Treatment options are varied, but it is recommended that conservative, patient-tailored measures be initiated first. To date, no surgical treatment has been proven superior to others or to nonsurgical treatment.

### Prominent corneal nerves in pure mucosal neuroma syndrome, a clinical phenotype distinct from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B [^112m1G4C]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

We present a case of a 41-year-old male who experienced mild symptoms of ocular surface irritation and was observed to have strikingly prominent corneal nerves and conjunctival neuromas, with no evidence of RET mutation. Based on his physical signs and genetic test results, a tentative diagnosis of pure mucosal neuroma syndrome was made.

Prominent corneal nerves can appear similar to other phenomena. Ghost vessels, for instance, closely resemble corneal nerves upon examination but are typically larger and white. Lattice lines are another possibility; however, they are more opaque and overlap more than corneal nerves. Waite–Beckham lines might also present similarly though they are deep, vertical, and located at the level of Descemet membrane.

Neurofibromatosis must be considered in any patient presenting with thickened and visible corneal nerves together with conjunctival neuromas. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) analysis of NF1 reveals morphological changes in corneal structures, specifically significant increases in corneal endothelial cell density and corneal nerve branching. However, corneal nerve density and the number of corneal nerve main trunks do not significantly differ. The IVCM of this patient, however, shows a prominently hyperreflective, thickened nerve plexus and a normal endothelium, differing from the increased corneal endothelial cell density and corneal nerve branching seen in an IVCM of NF1. Additionally, this patient displayed signs of only three neurofibromas, meeting one of the clinical diagnostic criteria.

### Outcomes following excision of Morton's interdigital neuroma: a prospective study [^1153X9RX]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

This is the first prospective study to report the pre- and post-operative patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction scores following excision of interdigital Morton's neuroma.

Between May 2006 and April 2013, we prospectively studied 99 consecutive patients (111 feet) who were to undergo excision of a Morton's neuroma. There were 78 women and 21 men with a mean age at the time of surgery of 56 years (range 22 to 78). Patients completed the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ), Short Form-12 (SF-12), and a supplementary patient satisfaction survey three months pre-operatively and six months post-operatively.

Statistically significant differences were found between the mean pre- and post-operative MOXFQ and the physical component of the SF-12 scores (p = 0.00081 and p = 0.00092, respectively). Most patients reported their overall satisfaction as excellent (n = 49, 49.5%) or good (n = 29, 29.3%), but ten patients were dissatisfied, reporting poor (n = 8, 8.1%) or very poor (n = 2, 2.0%) results. Only 63 patients (63%) were pain-free at follow-up; in eight patients (8.1%), the MOXFQ score worsened. There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes between surgery on single or multiple sites. However, the MOXFQ scores were significantly worse after revision surgery (p = 0.004).

The patient-reported outcomes after resection of a symptomatic Morton's neuroma are acceptable but may not be as good as earlier studies suggest. Surgery at several sites can be undertaken safely, but caution should be exercised when considering multiple resections.

### Imaging in the diagnosis of ulnar nerve pathologies-a neoteric approach [^115eNXqy]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Over the last decade**: Neuromuscular ultrasound and MR neurography have emerged as useful tools for the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. The ulnar nerve is the second most common nerve involved in compressive neuropathies of the upper limb. This pictorial review aims to demonstrate various ulnar nerve pathologies as diagnosed using imaging.

- **Imaging helps**: Identifying the exact anatomical details about the involved nerve provides an edge over the information provided by electrodiagnostic tests. Awareness of the pathology and extent of involvement aids in proper clinical decision making and timely management.

### Diagnostic criteria for symptomatic neuroma [^111R2jhk]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

After nerve injury, disorganized or incomplete nerve regeneration may result in a neuroma. The true incidence of symptomatic neuroma is unknown, and the diagnosis has traditionally been made based on patient history, symptoms, physical examination, and the anatomic location of pain, along with the response to diagnostic injection. There are no formally accepted criteria for a diagnosis of neuroma.

- **Materials and methods**: A literature search was performed to identify articles related to neuroma. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for all relevant articles pertaining to neuroma. Articles were screened by title and abstract for relevance. If an article was considered potentially relevant, the full article was reviewed. After consideration, 50 articles were included in this systematic review.

- **Results**: No previous articles directly addressed diagnostic criteria for symptomatic neuroma. Factors related to neuroma diagnosis gleaned from previous studies include pain and cold intolerance (patient history), positive Tinel sign or diminished 2-point discrimination (physical examination findings), response to diagnostic nerve block, and presence of neuroma on diagnostic imaging (ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging). Based on the literature review, the importance and number of references, as well as clinical experience, we propose criteria for the diagnosis of symptomatic neuroma. To receive a diagnosis of symptomatic neuroma, patients must have (1) pain with at l

### The role of the width of the forefoot in the development of Morton's neuroma [^115HdQEL]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Morton's neuroma is a common condition of the forefoot, but its aetiology remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between the width of the forefoot and the development of a Morton's neuroma.

Between January 2013 and May 2016, a total of 84 consecutive patients (17 men, 67 women) with a unilateral Morton's neuroma were enrolled in the study. The involved and uninvolved feet of each patient were compared. A control group of patients with symptoms from the foot, but without a neuroma, who were matched for age, gender, affected side, and web space location, was enrolled. The first to fifth intermetatarsal distance, intermetatarsal angle, and intermetatarsal distance of the involved web space on standing radiographs were assessed.

The inter- and intra-observer reliability was excellent. The three parameters did not differ significantly between the involved and uninvolved feet; nor did they differ significantly between the patients and the controls.

We conclude that there is no significant relationship between the width of the forefoot and the development of a Morton's neuroma. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:365–8.

### Nerve biopsy: Current indications and decision tools [^113UjYAf]. Muscle & Nerve (2021).

While the utility of nerve biopsy in the clinical setting has decreased over recent years, it continues to play a role in the diagnostic workup of highly selected patients. Although nerve biopsy does not affect the diagnosis or management in a significant proportion of patients, it is important to consider factors that would maximize the diagnostic yield should a nerve biopsy be performed. This includes the clinical features of the neuropathy, appropriate nerve selection, consideration of combination tissue biopsies, and the appropriate use of neuropathology techniques.

### Effectiveness of customized insoles in patients with Morton's neuroma: A randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial [^1151YHR6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). High credibility.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of customized insoles in patients with Morton's neuroma. It was a double-blind randomized controlled trial employing an intent-to-treat analysis.

The research was conducted with outpatients at a university hospital. A total of 72 patients with Morton's neuroma met the inclusion criteria and were randomly allocated to either the study group (n = 36) or the control group (n = 36). The study group was assigned a customized insole with metatarsal and arch support made of ethyl vinyl acetate, while the control group received a flat insole of the same material, color, and density.

The primary outcome measure was walking pain intensity, assessed using the visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes included pain at rest, palpation, and paresthesia (visual analogue scale); functional disability (6-minute walk test, Foot Function Index, and Foot Health Status Questionnaire); quality of life (Health Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36)); and foot pressure (AM Cube FootWalk Pro program).

When comparing groups over time, the experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement in pain during walking (P = 0.048), the general health domains (P < 0.001), and physical activity (P = 0.025) of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire, the general Foot Function Index score (P = 0.012), and the functional capacity domain of the SF-36 questionnaire (P = 0.046). No difference was found between groups for other parameters.

The study demonstrated that customized insoles are effective in improving certain health metrics for patients with Morton's neuroma, showing significant benefits in several measured outcomes.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of injected capsaicin for pain in Morton's neuroma [^1115EvhU]. Pain (2016). High credibility.

Intermetatarsal neuroma, or Morton's neuroma, is a painful condition of the foot resulting from the entrapment of the common digital nerve, typically in the third intermetatarsal space. The pain can be severe and especially problematic with walking. Treatment options are limited, and surgery may lead to permanent numbness in the toes. Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of hot peppers, produces analgesia by inducing retraction of nociceptive afferents from the area of innervation and is effective in treating certain neuropathic pain disorders.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to test the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a single 0.1 mg dose of capsaicin versus placebo, injected into the region of the neuroma. A total of 58 subjects diagnosed with Morton's neuroma with foot pain ≥ 4 (0–10 numerical pain rating scale) were injected with 2 mL of lidocaine into the intermetatarsal space proximal to the neuroma to provide local anesthesia. After 5 minutes, 0.1 mg capsaicin or placebo was injected into the painful neuroma-containing intermetatarsal space.

Average foot pain was rated for 2 weeks before through 4 weeks after the injection. At weeks 1 and 4, the decrease in pain was significantly greater in the subjects treated with capsaicin (P = 0.021 and P = 0.019, respectively). A trend toward significance was noted at weeks 2 and 3. Improvements in functional interference scores and reductions in oral analgesic use were also observed in the capsaicin-treated group. These findings suggest that injection of capsaicin is an efficacious treatment option for patients.

### The management of multiple Morton's neuromas in the same foot: A systematic review [^1149JieH]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment strategy for the presentation of multiple Morton's neuromas in adjacent intermetatarsal spaces of the same foot is yet to be determined. We aimed to summarize and assess the efficacy of treatment strategies. A systematic review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, was performed. A computer-based search was completed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Emcare for articles reporting the treatment of multiple neuromas in the same foot. The review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020213631). A total of 253 articles were identified, with 7 articles being included in the review.

The most common treatment strategy reported was simultaneous neuroma excision using a single incision. Two studies each describe simultaneous excision with two separate incisions and delayed excision, respectively. There is no strong evidence favoring the use of delayed excision or multiple incisions. Further high-quality research is required to make more definitive conclusions, and future research should investigate other strategies such as non-operative treatment.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for chronic foot pain induced by Morton neuroma: A novel, personalized approach in one patient [^116opbZV]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Morton neuroma (MN) is a thickening of the interdigital nerves that pass below the distal metatarsal transverse ligament. This condition can progress over time and lead to significant declines in quality of life.

Initial treatment strategies for MN are behavioral, including the avoidance of narrow shoes, followed by conservative management with oral NSAIDs and anticonvulsants. Other treatments include local injection, radiofrequency ablation, and cryotherapy. The efficacy of noninvasive MN treatment measures averages around 50%. The next line of treatment is surgical excision, but this strategy risks significant discomfort for patients with chronic cases and has recurrence rates that are not negligible.

A study by Johnson and colleagues analyzed 37 patients with recurrent neuroma after excision procedures and found that 21% of participants had signs of stump neuroma, and 46% showed signs of both existing primary neuroma and stump neuroma. Beskin and Baxter reported outcomes from 30 patients with MN who underwent surgical excision; less than 50% experienced complete relief, and over 58% continued to experience high levels of pain.

### The role of high-resolution ultrasound in the diagnosis of a traumatic neuroma in an injured median nerve [^111Mj8oo]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Since the development of high-resolution ultrasound, its role in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions has steadily increased. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman who experienced consistent numbness over the left hand and fingers after cutting the wrist in a suicide attempt, followed by tendon and median nerve repair and a period of rehabilitation. Electrodiagnostic testing was normal, but high-resolution ultrasound demonstrated hypoechoic, focal swelling in the region of the median nerve consistent with a neuroma. Neuroma was confirmed at surgery, and after excision of the neuroma, nerve repair with a nerve graft was performed. Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. This case suggests that high-resolution ultrasound may be superior to electrodiagnostic studies for the diagnosis of traumatic neuroma.

### Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation for treatment of Morton's neuroma: Initial experience [^114VcbG8]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of symptomatic Morton's neuroma.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients with symptomatic Morton's neuroma of the foot were referred for treatment with RFA prior to consideration for surgery. All neuromas were confirmed by ultrasound imaging and had undergone a trial of conservative management, including orthotic support and/or steroid injections. Ultrasound-guided RFA was performed as an outpatient procedure under local anaesthetic. Patients were followed up at 8 weeks and 8 months. Outcomes were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Manchester-Oxford Foot and Ankle Questionnaire, overall patient satisfaction, and complications.

- **Results**: Twenty-two neuromas were treated with RFA under ultrasound guidance. The VAS score at 8 weeks was significantly lower than the VAS score pre-procedure (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test), and the VAS score at 8 months was significantly lower than the VAS score at 8 weeks (p = 0.008, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). At 8 months, 89% of treated patients were satisfied with the procedure outcome. No significant adverse effects were recorded.

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound-guided RFA is safe, with excellent initial results in the treatment of symptomatic Morton's neuroma. Further studies on long-term outcomes and comparison to other management options will be required to establish its role in the management of symptomatic Morton's neuroma.

### Nerve decompression according to A.L. Dellon in Morton's neuroma - A retrospective analysis [^116Rkdro]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

First reported by Dellon et al. in 1992, nerve decompression by dissecting the deep transversal intermetatarsal ligament through a dorsal incision appears to be a reliable method for treating Morton's neuroma by addressing its underlying pathomechanism, since it should rather be considered as Morton's entrapment. As there are no studies dealing with Dellon's surgical technique, we carried out a retrospective analysis with the aim of showing that nerve decompression is an effective method to treat Morton's neuroma, and one that considers its true pathology.

- **Materials and methods**: All patients with a clinical diagnosis of Morton's neuroma, verified by MRI and treated by nerve decompression, were included in this study from 2010 to 2018 at our department. Follow-up was performed at least six months post-intervention. Pain and function history were ascertained using the VAS (visual analogue scale) score and the German foot function index. Skin sensitivity testing was performed using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments.

- **Results**: A total of 12 patients were treated and followed-up during the study period. Postoperatively, there was significant improvement in the values of the VAS score both under strain (p-value: 0.0021) and at rest (p-value: 0.0062), as well as in the foot function index (p-value: 0.0022). There was no significant difference in skin sensitivity of the innervation areas of the interdigital nerves of the affected foot compared with the healthy reference foot (p-value: 0.0968).

- **Conclusion**: Dellon's decompression method yielded a highly effective treatment outcome.

### Short term comparison between blind and ultrasound guided injection in Morton neuroma [^112P72gc]. European Radiology (2019). High credibility.

The aim of this work is to compare the effectiveness of blind and ultrasound-guided injection for Morton's neuroma (MN) to determine which is more appropriate as the initial procedure in conservative treatment.

This is an evaluator-blinded randomised trial. Among the 56 included patients, 27 were assigned to the blind group (A) and 29 to the ultrasound-guided group (B). The injection includes 1 mL of 2% mepivacaine and 40 mg of triamcinolone in each web space with MN. The included patients were assessed clinically by VAS score and the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Score (MFPDS). The follow-up was performed at 15 days, 1 month, 45 days, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months after the initial injection.

No differences in age or clinical measurements were found at presentation between group A and group B. During the follow-up, the ultrasound-guided group showed greater symptomatic relief at several stages: 45 days (VAS 3.0 ± 0.5 versus 5.5 ± 0.5, p = 0.001; MFPDS: 32.2 ± 1.8 versus 38.8 ± 2.0, p = 0.018), 2 months (VAS: 3.1 ± 0.5 versus 5.6 ± 0.5, p = 0.002; MFPDS: 31.5 ± 1.9 versus 38.5 ± 2.1, p = 0.020), and 3 months (VAS: 3.1 ± 0.4 versus 5.2 ± 0.6, p = 0.010; MFPDS: 31.2 ± 1.9 versus 37.7 ± 2.4, p = 0.047).

Injection of MN under ultrasound guidance provides a statistically significant improvement at some stages of the follow-up (45 days, 2 and 3 months) compared with blind injection.

- **Key points**: Ultrasound-guided steroid injections in Morton's neuroma provide short-term pain relief to over 60% of the patients.

### Longitudinal plantar approach for excision of Morton's neuroma: Long-term results [^117UHiWj]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The longitudinal plantar approach is generally considered at risk for wound healing problems. Thus, we sought to investigate long-term outcomes after primary Morton's neuroma excision through this approach. A retrospective study of patients who underwent primary neuroma excision was conducted. Twenty-four patients (28 feet) were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 9 years (range, 6–14), assessed by a single trained examiner using a specific postoperative evaluation protocol. This protocol included AOFAS Forefoot subjective and objective scores. Good-to-excellent outcomes were reported in 25 cases (89.3%). Hypertrophic scar formation and keratosis occurred in only 2 cases (7.1%). All patients, except one, achieved full weightbearing with a postoperative shoe from the first day after the operation. The longitudinal plantar approach can lead to long-term, good-to-excellent outcomes with no cases of recurrence or reoperation. Accurate wound closure and immediate weightbearing with a postoperative shoe can minimize the rate of complications. This approach should be considered for the primary resection of Morton's neuromas.

### The local molecular signature of human peripheral neuropathic pain [^1166Cgy2]. Pain (2025). Low credibility.

Tissue collection and preparation involved obtaining 22 affected plantar digital nerves from patients with Morton's neuroma during routine surgical excision. Each sample was divided into four parts: two from the site of the neuroma just proximal to the bifurcation of the plantar digital nerve and two distal to the bifurcation. One distal and one proximal sample were placed into RNAlater solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Horsham, United Kingdom, AM7021) and stored overnight at 4°C. The remaining distal and proximal samples were placed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution and stored at room temperature overnight. Only the proximal samples representing the site of Morton's neuroma were used in our analyses.

From control participants, 11 nerves of the upper and lower limbs were collected. The collection included 5 nerve grafts, 3 nerves from muscle flaps, and 3 nerves from amputations. Among these, there were 3 plantar digital nerves, 3 gracilis motor nerves, 4 posterior interosseous sensory nerves, and 1 intercostal sensory nerve. Each sample was split into two and placed into RNAlater and paraformaldehyde as described above.

For molecular analyses, proximal nerve samples stored in RNAlater solution had extraneural connective tissue removed the following day. The samples were snap frozen in an Eppendorf tube in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for batch RNA extraction.

For immunofluorescent analysis, samples were placed in sucrose the following day for 3 days before being frozen in optimal cutting tissue.

### Mechanical metatarsalgia as a risk factor for relapse of Morton's neuroma after ultrasound-guided alcohol injection [^113syb6H]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although many treatment modalities are available for Morton's neuroma, the injection of the neuroma with alcohol has gained popularity. However, some investigators have recently observed a progressive deterioration in pain scores for patients who were initially pain-free after the treatment. The purpose of the present retrospective comparative study was to determine whether mechanical metatarsalgia is related to symptom recurrence.

We included 104 consecutive cases of ultrasound-guided alcohol injection for Morton's neuroma in 92 patients. Of these 104 cases, 51 were in group A (49%; Morton's neuroma) and 53 in group B (51%; Morton's neuroma associated with mechanical metatarsalgia). We evaluated each patient using a visual analog scale and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society forefoot scale, and Johnson satisfaction scale, with a mean follow-up period of 24 months (range 12 to 39 months).

Concomitant functional and mechanical disorders have been identified and treated with orthopedic inserts. The present study compared the clinical results and recurrence of symptoms in patients with isolated Morton's disease or Morton's disease associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. Of the 104 cases, the patients in 93 cases (89%) were completely satisfied or satisfied with minor reservations. No major complications developed. Symptoms recurred in 6 patients (6%), in whom neuroma was associated with mechanical disorders (p = .0269). Ultrasound-guided alcohol injection of Morton's neuroma is a relatively safe and well-tolerated treatment. Symptom recurrence is often associated with mechanical disorders.

### Comparative analysis of dorsal nerve relocation versus dorsal neurectomy in the surgical management of Morton's neuroma [^114oTxUU]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

This clinical study compares the use of dorsal nerve relocation (DNR; also known as dorsal nerve transfer) and dorsal neurectomy (DN) in the surgical management of Morton's neuroma within the surgical directorate of an NHS Hospital Trust (Princess Royal University Hospital) in the South East of England between 2002 and 2009. Approaches to the surgical management of Morton's neuroma depend on the views of individual surgeons rather than empirical evidence, and varied considerably. Therefore, this study focused on assessing whether best practices were being followed and how improvements could be made.

Data were collected using an in-depth review of patients' case notes and patient questionnaires. In total, there were 47 cases (51 web spaces), comprising 25 cases (28 web spaces) in the DNR group and 22 cases (23 web spaces) in the DN group. The key indication for surgery in all cases reviewed was the failure of the condition to improve using conservative methods. The mean follow-up duration was 36 months (range 12–89 months) in the DNR group and 41 months (range 12–69 months) in the DN group. Coughlin's criterion was used to analyze individual records.

The results suggest that DNR is more effective (92%) than DN in the surgical management of Morton's neuroma (82%). Key advantages of DNR include an earlier return to wearing routine footwear, an earlier return to normal routine/work, and better resolution of sensory symptoms in the toes. Although DNR is a slightly longer procedure than DN, minor difficulties encountered related to nerve mobilization due to overlying prominent veins or multiple nerve branches rather than a single branch.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: An educational review [^116W14LZ]. Insights into Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Morton's neuroma in a 76-year-old woman presents with chronic left metatarsalgia and paresthesia of the fourth ray. The ultrasound (US) in short axis (A, B) reveals a hypoechoic mass located in the plantar intermetatarsal space, which dislocates (short arrow) during dynamic lateral compression (long white arrows) of the forefoot — a finding known as Mulder's sonographic sign. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the forefoot in short axis display an oval mass in the third intermetatarsal space (long arrows); it is hypointense on the T1-weighted image (C) and hyperintense on the T2-weighted image (D), overlain by a bursitis (arrowhead).

On MRI, Morton's neuroma appears as a variable iso-to-hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images in the neurovascular bundle area, contrasting with the hyperintense fluid of the intermetatarsal bursa (Fig. 7). On T1-weighted images, it presents a low-intensity signal. It often shows a characteristic dumbbell or ovoid shape on MRI, particularly in coronal views, due to the fusiform thickening of the nerve compressed between the metatarsal heads. The contrast after gadolinium injection varies in intensity but remains homogeneous, differing from bursitis where the contrast is peripheral.

### Neuromas and persistent postoperative pain following total knee arthroplasty [^114TTFQX]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Persistent postoperative knee pain after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is often an indication for revision surgery and has a multifactorial etiology. Periarticular neuromas of nerves innervating the joint, ligaments, or overlying skin are important but misdiagnosed causes of persistent knee pain following knee surgery. This study aimed to characterize the incidence and sequelae of peripheral neuromas in TKA patients.

- **Methods**: We utilized the TriNetX research network to identify TKA patients experiencing persistent knee pain lasting more than 3 months between 2016–2024, excluding cases with acute postoperative pain and implant-related causes, and identified patients diagnosed with neuromas. We then compared the rate of revision between patients with persistent knee pain with confirmed neuroma diagnoses and those without, and evaluated the utilization of surgical and nonsurgical interventions.

- **Results**: Of 446,969 primary TKA patients, 111,533 (25.0%) experienced persistent pain, of whom 5785 (5.2%) were diagnosed with neuromas. Among those diagnosed, 19% received a diagnosis within 1 year of TKA, 25.8% between one and 3 years, and 55.2% after 3 years. Revision rates were similar in both groups (0.5% vs 0.5%). While 10.5% of neuroma patients received an intervention, only 3.6% underwent definitive surgical intervention.

- **Conclusions**: One-fourth of TKA patients have persistent knee pain not associated with joint or implant-related factors, yet only around 5% are definitively diagnosed with a neuroma, suggesting potential underdiagnosis. The high risk of nerve…

### Operative treatment of interdigital neuroma. A long-term follow-up study [^115XEsj1]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2001). Low credibility.

The literature regarding the outcome of surgical treatment of interdigital neuroma is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to assess the demographics associated with the presentation of an interdigital neuroma as well as the long-term clinical results of operative resection by a single surgeon.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of the patient records of one orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon identified eighty-two patients who had been treated operatively for a primary, persistently painful interdigital neuroma more than three years previously. Of these eighty-two patients, sixty-six (seventy-one feet, seventy-four neuromas) returned at an average of 5.8 years for a follow-up evaluation, which included a review of the interval history since the surgery, a physical examination, a radiographic evaluation, and an assessment of the patient's satisfaction with the result of the surgery.

- **Results**: Overall satisfaction was rated as excellent or good by fifty-six (85%) of the sixty-six patients. Forty-six (65%) of the seventy-one feet were pain-free at the time of final follow-up. The patients who had had either bilateral neuroma excision or excisions of adjacent neuromas in the same foot in a staged fashion had a slightly lower level of satisfaction, but this difference was not significant. While major activity restrictions following surgery were uncommon, mild or major shoe-wear restrictions were noted by forty-six of the sixty-six patients. Although there was subjective numbness in thirty-six of the seventy-one feet, the pattern of numbness was quite variable and

### Ultrasound versus magnetic resonance imaging for Morton neuroma: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kAAQd]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to compare ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of Morton's neuroma.

Methods: Studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of US and MRI for Morton's neuroma were retrieved from major medical libraries independently by two reviewers, up to 1 April 2014. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were adopted.

Results: Initially, 277 studies were found, and the meta-analysis was conducted on 14 studies. US sensitivity was evaluated in five studies, MRI sensitivity in three studies, and both in six studies. All studies used surgery as the reference standard. A high sensitivity of diagnostic testing was observed for both US (SE (95% CI) = 0.91 (0.83–0.96)) and MRI (SE (95% CI) = 0.90 (0.82–0.96)) with no significant differences between the two modalities in diagnosis (Q test p = 0.88). For MRI, the specificity of the test was 1.00 with a pooled estimation of 1.00 (0.73–1.00), while the pooled specificity was 0.854 (95% CI: 0.41–1.00) for US. No differences were observed between US and MRI in study design (p = 0.76).

Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that the sensitivity of US (0.91) is equal (p = 0.88) to that of MRI (0.90) for the identification of Morton's neuroma.

Key points:

- **For Morton's neuroma, US sensitivity is equal to MRI**. US is as accurate as MRI in diagnosing Morton's neuroma.
- **US may be the most cost-effective imaging method for Morton's neuroma**.

### Internal auditory canal involvement of acoustic neuromas: Surgical correlates to magnetic resonance imaging findings [^111P2h2q]. Otology & Neurotology (2001). Low credibility.

Factors that play a role in the selection of the surgical approach for acoustic neuromas include patient health and age, size of the tumor, hearing status, and location of the tumor in the internal auditory canal (IAC) and the cerebellopontine angle. Deep extension into the IAC makes hearing preservation extremely difficult when a retrosigmoid craniotomy is used, and the best approach is a middle fossa subtemporal route. Modern gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be inaccurate in identifying the presence of a tumor laterally in the IAC; this may affect the selection of a surgical approach.

This study was a retrospective case review, conducted in a tertiary referral otologic practice. From 1997 through 2000, six patients who underwent acoustic neuroma surgery presented adequate imaging and intraoperative data, demonstrating a lack of correlation between MRI and intraoperative findings of the lateral IAC. The interventions included preoperative MRI of the IAC and surgical resection of an acoustic neuroma.

The main outcome measure was the comparison of MRI and intraoperative findings of the lateral IAC. Results showed that all six patients demonstrated a lack of correlation between MRI and intraoperative findings of the lateral IAC. Conclusions indicate that gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI findings of the depth of penetration into the lateral aspect of the IAC do not always correlate with intraoperative findings, which may have implications in the selection of the surgical approach.

### Endoscopic resection of a toe web fibroma that was mimicking a Morton's neuroma [^116vy69Z]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Fibroma of tendon sheath is a rare benign tumor originating in the tendon or tendon sheath. It most commonly occurs in the upper extremity and rarely presents in the foot. In this report, a case of fibroma of the tendon sheath in the web space with Morton's neuroma-like symptoms was presented. The tumor was resected endoscopically with preservation of the interdigital nerve. Post-operatively, the symptoms subsided and the toe sensation was preserved. There was no sign of recurrence of the tumor at the end of a 3-year period of follow-up.

### MRI features of peripheral traumatic neuromas [^11318w9c]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The study describes the MRI appearance of traumatic neuromas on non-contrast and contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. In this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, 13 subjects with 20 neuromas were retrospectively reviewed. Two observers examined pre-operative MRIs for imaging features such as size, margin, capsule, signal intensity, heterogeneity, enhancement, neurogenic features, and denervation, as well as the nerve segment distal to the traumatic neuroma. Descriptive statistics were reported, and Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between neuroma size and parent nerve size.

Of the 20 neuromas, 13 were neuromas-in-continuity and seven were end-bulb neuromas. Neuromas had a mean size of 1.5 cm (range 0.6–4.8 cm), with 100% (20/20) having indistinct margins and 0% (0/20) having a capsule. Eighty-eight percent (7/8) showed enhancement. All (100%, 20/20) displayed a tail sign, while 35% (7/20) demonstrated discontinuity from the parent nerve. None exhibited a target sign. There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.68, p = 0.001) between larger neuromas and larger parent nerves. MRI evaluation of the nerve segment distal to the neuroma showed increased size (mean 0.5 cm ± 0.4 cm) compared to the parent nerve (mean 0.3 cm ± 0.2 cm).

Since MRI features of neuromas include enhancement, intravenous contrast medium cannot be used to distinguish neuromas from peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The clinical history of trauma and the absence of a target sign are likely to be the most useful clues.

- **Key points**: MRI features of neuromas include enhancement and lack of a tar

### Peripheral tumor and tumor-like neurogenic lesions [^114arxrA]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Neoplasms of neurogenic origin account for about 12% of all benign and 8% of all malignant soft tissue neoplasms. Traumatic neuroma, Morton neuroma, lipomatosis of a nerve, nerve sheath ganglion, perineurioma, and benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) are included in this group of pathologies. Clinical and radiologic evaluation of patients with neurogenic tumors and pseudotumors often reveal distinctive features. In this context, advanced imaging techniques, especially ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR), play an important role in the characterization of these lesions.

- **Imaging findings**: Characteristics such as the location of a soft tissue mass in the region of a major nerve, a nerve entering or exiting the mass, fusiform shape, abnormalities of the muscle supplied by the nerve, split-fat sign, target sign, and fascicular appearance should always indicate a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm. Although no single imaging finding or combination of findings allows definitive differentiation between benign and malignant peripheral neurogenic tumors, both US and MR imaging may display useful features that can lead to a correct diagnosis and improve patient treatment.

- **Common associations**: Traumatic neuromas and Morton neuromas are commonly associated with an amputation stump or are located in the intermetatarsal space. Lipomatosis of a nerve usually appears as a nerve enlargement, with thickened nerve fascicles embedded in evenly distributed fat. A nerve sheath ganglion has a cystic appearance and commonly occurs at the level of the knee. Intraneural perineuroma usually affects young people and manifests as a…

### Peroneal nerve: Normal anatomy and pathologic findings on routine MRI of the knee [^115KXtsQ]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Peroneal nerve lesions are relatively uncommon. Most are of traumatic etiology, but ganglia, peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and osteochondroma should also be considered. Identification and characterization of these lesions may be done on routine MRI sequences, particularly if an axial T1-weighted sequence is included in the imaging protocol. Careful revision of clinical history, clinical examination, electromyographic findings, previous imaging findings, and consideration of the specific anatomical features help the radiologist to suggest a specific diagnosis or to narrow down the differential diagnosis. It will also help to suggest further imaging with dedicated MR neurography protocols and whether a biopsy should be performed.

### Promising outcomes of ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency for the treatment of Morton's neuromas - a prospective study [^11525cu9]. Pain Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Morton's neuroma is a compressive neuropathy of the common plantar digital nerve, causing significant pain and limiting patients' activities.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to investigate the effect of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) on the pain, functionality, and quality of life experienced by patients with Morton's neuroma.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective study with pre- and post-intervention assessments after one, three, and six months of treatment.

- **Setting**: The orthopedics department of an affiliated hospital.

- **Methods**: Patients with Morton's neuroma underwent treatment with ultrasound-guided PRF at two sites around the neuroma for eight minutes. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) questionnaire for assessing foot function, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) for quality of life.

- **Results**: A total of 20 patients (29 feet) completed the six-month minimum follow-up period. The VAS and face scale values at follow-up were statistically lower than the pre-procedure VAS scores (P < 0.05). The AOFAS and SF-36 values at follow-up were statistically higher than the pre-procedure values (P < 0.05). No significant adverse events were recorded during the follow-up.

- **Limitations**: The prospective research features a limited follow-up duration and lacks an additional group, whether control or treatment, for result comparisons.

- **Conclusion**: Applications of PRF decreased the pain and improved the functionality and quality of life experienced by patients with Morton's neuroma for a six-month follow-up.

### Percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation of Morton's neuroma: Rationale and technical details after the first 20 patients [^111V2saU]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to discuss technical aspects and rationales of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided cryoablation (CA) of Morton's neuroma (MN); preliminary clinical experience is also retrospectively reviewed. Procedures were performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. Lesion size and location, as well as procedural (technical success, procedural time, complications) and clinical outcomes (patient satisfaction according to a four-point scale, residual pain according to a 0–10 visual analogue scale, and instances of "stump neuroma"), were assessed via chart review and cross-sectional telephone survey after the 20th case.

Twenty patients (15 female, 5 male; mean age 50.3 years) were included; 24 MN (mean size 12.7 mm) were treated. Technical success was 100%. Mean procedural time was 40.9 ± 10.4 minutes (range 35–60). One minor complication (superficial cellulitis) was reported (4.2%). Follow-up (mean 19.7 months) was available for 18/24 MN. Patient satisfaction on a per-lesion basis was as follows: "completely satisfied" in 77.7%, "satisfied with minor reservations" in 16.6%, and "satisfied with major reservations" in 5.7% of cases. Mean pain score at last follow-up post-CA was 3.0. No instances of "stump neuroma" were reported.

MR-guided CA of MN is a novel therapy that appears technically feasible. Clinical advantages of the procedure include high patient satisfaction, reduced risk of "stump neuroma" syndrome, and good patient tolerance on an outpatient basis. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these encouraging findings.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: A pictorial review [^111scusU]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old female presents with forefoot pain. Coronal PDFS and short axis T1 sequences demonstrate a dumbbell appearance of Morton's neuroma or bursa-neuroma complex in the third intermetatarsal space, as indicated by the yellow arrow. This corresponds to the site of the symptoms, marked by the patient.

- **Common peroneal nerve**: The common peroneal nerve originates from the sciatic nerve at the upper superior aspect of the popliteal fossa. It travels distally, located posteromedial to the short head of the biceps femoris and superficial to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The nerve then wraps around the fibular neck before entering the peroneal tunnel between the peroneus longus and the fibula, where it divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. It supplies the short head of the biceps femoris, the lateral compartment of the leg via the superficial peroneal nerve, and the anterior compartment of the leg via the deep peroneal nerve. In terms of sensory functions, it provides sensation to the anterolateral region of the leg and the dorsum of the foot via the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. It also contributes to the lateral sural cutaneous nerve, which supplies sensation to the upper lateral leg, and to the sural nerve, which supplies the lower posterolateral leg.

Common peroneal neuropathy is the most common mononeuropathy of the lower limb. The two most common sites of entrapment are where it crosses the fibular neck, due to its superficial location, and where it travels deep to the peroneus longus. There are many causes of entrapment, including direct compression from crus.

### Neuroma analysis in humans: Standardizing sample collection and documentation [^113ioq9j]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). High credibility.

The biology of symptomatic neuromas is poorly understood, particularly the factors causing pain in human neuromas. Pain presence varies among and within individuals, with some having painful and nonpainful neuromas. To bridge these knowledge gaps, our group developed a protocol for assessing neuroma pain and collecting tissue for molecular analysis. This manuscript outlines our workflow and challenges and aims to inspire other centers to share their experiences with these tissues.

- **Methods**: For every included patient and collected nerve or bone tissue specimen, we perform a detailed chart review and a multifaceted analysis of pain and pain perception immediately before surgery. We collect patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) on pain, function, and mental well-being outcomes at preoperative assessment and at the 6-month follow-up postoperatively. Before surgery, the patient is assessed once again to obtain an immediate preoperative pain status and identify potential differences in pain intensity of different neuromas. Intraoperatively, specimens are obtained and their gross anatomical features are recorded, after which they are stored in paraformaldehyde or frozen for later sample analyses. Postoperatively, patients are contacted to obtain additional postoperative PROMs.

- **Results**: A total of 220 specimens of nerve tissue have been successfully obtained from 83 limbs, comprising 95 specimens of neuromas and 125 specimens of nerves located proximal to the neuromas or from controls.

- **Conclusions**: Our approach outlines the methods combining specimen collection and documentation for the analysis of symptomatic neuromas.

### Surgery for symptomatic neuroma: Anatomic distribution and predictors of secondary surgery [^114iTiAM]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Neuromas are caused by irregular and disorganized regeneration following nerve injury. Many surgical techniques have been described to address neuromas with varying success. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive factors for secondary surgery after initial surgical intervention for symptomatic neuromas, along with a description of the anatomical distribution of surgically treated symptomatic neuromas.

- **Methods**: Five hundred ninety-eight patients with 641 neuromas that underwent primary surgery for neuromas were identified retrospectively. The diagnosis of neuroma was based on physical examination and patient history in the medical charts. Neuromas were treated by excision, implantation in muscle or bone, excision with direct neurorrhaphy with or without nerve grafting, or other treatments.

- **Results**: The rate of secondary surgery for neuromas was 7.8 percent, and secondary operations were performed at a median of 16.1 months. Excision alone or excision with implantation into bone or muscle had higher rates of secondary surgery compared with excision and direct neurorrhaphy with or without nerve grafting. Neuromas were located in the upper extremity (49.61 percent), lower extremity (46.65 percent), and the groin/trunk (3.74 percent).

- **Conclusions**: Symptomatic neuromas are located predominantly in the extremities, and surgery can improve pain, with low secondary surgery rates. Excision with direct neurorrhaphy with or without nerve grafting was associated with lower reoperation rates.

- **Clinical question/level of evidence**: Therapeutic, III.

### Occupational nerve injuries [^111MqhF3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

A clinical clue to ulnar neuropathy at the wrist (UNW) is the sparing of the dorsal ulnar cutaneous sensation over the ulnar aspect of the dorsal hand, as this nerve branches about 6–8 cm proximal to the wrist and is spared in lesions at Guyon's canal. EDX testing is important to differentiate ulnar neuropathy at the elbow from the wrist, differentiate the zone of compression at the wrist, and evaluate for evidence of denervation. Electrophysiologically, the ulnar motor study recording the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle is critical in evaluating this condition, given the frequent disproportionate involvement of the deep motor nerve branch distal to the nerve branch to the abductor digiti minimi (ADM). Compared with recording ADM alone, the FDI study increases sensitivity (likely from about 60%–90%), especially with stimulation proximal and distal to Guyon's canal. Importantly, electromyographic findings and the dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve conduction study (normal in 40%–60% of cases of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)) are less effective in drawing this distinction.

Space-occupying lesions can alter local anatomy and interact with dynamic biomechanical factors to influence ulnar nerve compression in Guyon's canal. In addition to ganglion cysts, a common cause of UNW, thickened ligaments and hypertrophied muscles (flexor digiti minimi, ADM, palmaris longus, or palmaris brevis), possibly arising from repetitive occupational tasks, can also similarly alter anatomy and cause compression. Imaging, such as ultrasound, MRI, and radiographs of the wrist, may aid in diagnosis.

Of particular interest is a potential link between carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.

### Long-term comparison between blind and ultrasound-guided corticoid injections in Morton neuroma [^1146sJWU]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

This study compares the effectiveness of blind versus ultrasound (US)-guided injections for Morton neuroma (MN) over a follow-up period of up to 3 years.

- **Methods**: This evaluator-blinded randomized trial involved 33 patients with MN receiving blind injections from an experienced orthopedic surgeon based on anatomical landmarks (group 1) and 38 patients receiving US-guided injections from an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist (group 2). Patients were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFPDI). Each injection contained 1 mL of 2% mepivacaine and 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide. Up to 4 injections were permitted during the first 3 months of follow-up. Follow-up assessments were conducted via phone calls and scheduled consultations at intervals of 15 days, 1 month, 45 days, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and annually up to 3 years. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t-tests.

- **Results**: No significant differences in age or clinical measures were observed at presentation between group 1 (VAS, 8.5 ± 0.2; MFPDI, 40.9 ± 1.1) and group 2 (VAS, 8.4 ± 0.2; MFPDI, 39.8 ± 1.2). Group 2 showed superior improvement in VAS scores up to 3 years of follow-up (p < 0.05). Additionally, improvement in MFPDI scores was greater for group 2 from 45 days to 2 years of follow-up (p < 0.05). Treatment satisfaction was higher in group 2 (87%) compared to group 1 (59.1%) at 3 years of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound-guided injections result in a higher percentage of long-term improvement compared to blind injections in patients with MN.

### Simple electrodiagnostic method for Morton neuroma [^115mwPvL]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a simple and quickly applied electrodiagnostic method for confirming the diagnosis of interdigital neuropathy caused by Morton neuroma (MN).

- **Methods**: Interdigital nerves II-III and III-IV were stimulated with surface electrodes simultaneously touching the lateral side of one toe and the medial side of the other. Recording was also conducted with surface electrodes. The results from 20 normal controls and 14 patients with MN were evaluated.

- **Results**: The amplitude and peak latency values elicited in the patients, as well as the interside differences, revealed an acceptable abnormality rate between 57.1% and 71.4%.

- **Conclusions**: Although the most popular and effective method of MN diagnosis is clinical evaluation supported by imaging, electrophysiological studies can, in selected patients, provide valuable information.

### Treatment of recurrent neuroma of the interdigital nerve by implantation of the proximal nerve into muscle in the arch of the foot [^1115qACo]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of treating recurrent "Morton's" neuroma by using a technique involving resection of the interdigital neuroma through a plantar approach and implanting the proximal end of the nerve into an intrinsic muscle in the arch of the foot. As part of this study, quantitative sensory testing was performed for the medial plantar and medial calcaneal nerves. Seventeen interdigital neuromas were resected in 13 patients.

Pain was identified on physical examination as being due to neuromas located in the first (one), second (six), third (eight), and fourth (two) web spaces. Seven of the 13 patients were found to have an associated tarsal tunnel syndrome, identified through quantitative sensory testing and physical examination, responsible for symptoms related to numbness in the foot in addition to the pain of the neuroma. These patients underwent tarsal tunnel decompression at the time of neuroma resection.

At a mean follow-up time of 33.8 months (range 24–42 months), conducted via direct physician interview and examination, 80% of the patients experienced excellent relief of symptoms, returned to their regular jobs, and wore their usual footwear. Twenty percent of the patients had good relief of symptoms, worked in different jobs, and had to change their footwear. It is concluded that pain following a dorsal interdigital neurectomy can be successfully treated through a plantar approach with implantation of the proximal end of the nerve into an intrinsic muscle. This study also identified an association of tarsal tunnel syndrome in 54% of this series.
