## Question

Are Melatonin supplements effective in treating insomnia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether melatonin supplements are effective in treating insomnia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context and definitions of insomnia. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and high-quality meta-analyses say about melatonin in adults with chronic insomnia. Next, I will examine whether any subgroups or formulations show benefit, including older adults, children/adolescents, and circadian-related insomnia. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and product quality issues. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note exceptions where melatonin may be reasonable despite limited general efficacy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, with adequate opportunity and significant next-day impairment, persisting for at least 3 months; circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, such as delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, are related but mechanistically distinct, and that distinction matters for melatonin's expected effects.

> Next, I should review the highest-quality adult evidence. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2017 guideline, informed by systematic review and meta-analysis, recommends against using melatonin for adult chronic insomnia because benefits are small and not clinically meaningful. For example, sleep quality improved by only about 0.21 standard deviations, and sleep latency reductions were inconsistent and modest, with very low certainty of evidence overall [^114bcEeT] [^116tDofe] [^111qwC6G] [^114RtwdR].

> Wait, let me verify whether newer adult syntheses change this conclusion. The 2022 Lancet network meta-analysis of 154 RCTs found no material benefit for melatonin on global insomnia outcomes in adults, placing melatonin among agents with insufficient or low-strength evidence for clinically important effects, which aligns with the AASM stance [^113KrC6K]. The 2025 VA/DoD guideline similarly concludes that melatonin should be avoided for chronic insomnia disorder in adults, citing low-quality evidence and lack of meaningful benefit [^113KrC6K] [^113CXS4c].

> Hold on, I should double-check whether any adult subgroup shows benefit. Some trials of prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg in adults older than about 55 years suggest modest improvements in sleep latency and quality, and European guidance allows consideration of prolonged-release melatonin up to 3 months in selected adults over 55; however, even these effects are small, not consistently replicated, and should be interpreted cautiously given risk of bias and heterogeneity [^116UfSZv] [^1178NcfC] [^1169bQH9]. But wait, what if the insomnia is circadian rather than primary? In circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, melatonin can advance sleep timing and reduce sleep-onset latency, which is a different therapeutic target than primary insomnia and explains why some studies appear "positive" in that narrower context [^116kBchP] [^111pjToH].

> I need to check pediatric data separately because age modifies response. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses in children and adolescents show moderate reductions in sleep latency (about 15–18 minutes) and modest increases in total sleep time (about 19–30 minutes), but with very low to low certainty and no consistent improvement in sleep quality or daytime functioning; multiple pediatric guidelines therefore advise that melatonin should not be first-line and, if used, should follow optimization of sleep hygiene and behavioral interventions and be time-limited and monitored [^116Ypnw4] [^113LRHxX] [^115vQAE4] [^114Q2Ue1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought melatonin might improve sleep quality in youth, but I should correct that: the best available evidence shows benefits are limited to sleep continuity parameters without clear gains in perceived sleep quality or daytime function, reinforcing a conservative approach [^116Ypnw4] [^113LRHxX].

> Let me consider special populations where melatonin might be reasonable despite limited general efficacy. In traumatic brain injury, small RCTs and a scoping review suggest improvements in subjective sleep quality and sleep efficiency with melatonin, likely reflecting disrupted endogenous melatonin rhythms post-injury; however, evidence quality is low and heterogeneous, so shared decision-making and monitoring are prudent [^113aJhHC] [^113uvqpX]. For neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, professional society guidance supports melatonin as an option when behavioral strategies fail, with careful dosing and safety counseling, acknowledging off-label status in many regions [^116o6SY5].

> I should confirm safety, tolerability, and product quality before making any recommendation. Melatonin is generally well tolerated in short-term use, with common adverse effects including dizziness, headache, nausea, and somnolence; serious adverse events are uncommon in trials, though long-term pediatric safety remains uncertain and some guidelines flag theoretical concerns about endocrine effects with prolonged use in youth [^114vmY1K] [^115u48C3]. Critically, over-the-counter melatonin products show marked variability in melatonin content and frequent contamination with serotonin, so if melatonin is used, pharmaceutical-grade products and, when possible, prescriptions are preferred to mitigate quality concerns [^112XMXAB] [^116o6SY5].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating anything. For adults with chronic insomnia disorder, melatonin has not demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit and is not recommended by major guidelines; any observed effects are small, inconsistent, and often not better than placebo on patient-important outcomes, so first-line management should prioritize cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and sleep hygiene, with pharmacotherapy reserved for selected cases and melatonin generally not a preferred option [^114bcEeT] [^114XvfUB] [^113KrC6K]. For children and adolescents, melatonin may modestly improve sleep latency and total sleep time but does not reliably improve sleep quality or daytime functioning; therefore, it should be considered only after behavioral interventions have failed, with explicit counseling about limited benefits, potential non-serious adverse effects, and the need for monitoring and time-limited use [^116Ypnw4] [^113LRHxX] [^115vQAE4]. Exceptions include older adults with insomnia where prolonged-release melatonin may be considered for up to 3 months in selected cases, and circadian rhythm disorders where melatonin's phase-shifting properties can be leveraged, but expectations should remain modest and individualized [^116UfSZv] [^116kBchP].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical guidance. If a patient asks about melatonin for insomnia, I would explain that for most adults with chronic insomnia it is unlikely to help in a meaningful way and that CBT-I remains first-line. If we proceed with melatonin, I would use a pharmaceutical-grade product, start low (for example, 1–3 mg about 30–60 minutes before bedtime), reassess within 2–4 weeks, and discontinue if there is no clear benefit, while screening for drug interactions and counseling on side effects and product variability [^114bcEeT] [^112XMXAB] [^114vmY1K]. For youth, I would ensure behavioral sleep interventions are optimized first, then consider a short, closely monitored trial with explicit stop criteria and follow-up, given the limited and low-certainty benefits and the uncertain long-term safety profile [^116Ypnw4] [^113LRHxX] [^115u48C3].

---

Melatonin is **not effective for most adults with chronic insomnia** [^114bcEeT] [^114XvfUB]. It offers only small, clinically insignificant improvements in sleep onset, total sleep time, and efficiency [^113CXS4c], and guidelines recommend against its routine use for primary insomnia [^113KrC6K]. Melatonin may help older adults (> 55 years) with prolonged-release formulations [^116UfSZv], but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^114bcEeT]. It is **not first-line therapy**; CBT-I remains the preferred treatment, and melatonin should be considered only when other options fail or are unsuitable [^114XvfUB].

## Clinical evidence for melatonin in insomnia

### Adults with chronic insomnia

- **Effectiveness**: Meta-analyses show small, clinically insignificant improvements in sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency [^113CXS4c] [^1153EQtr].
- **Guidelines**: AASM recommends against melatonin for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy [^114bcEeT].
- **VA/DoD 2025**: Recommends avoiding melatonin for chronic insomnia; evidence shows no significant benefit [^113KrC6K] [^113CXS4c].

---

### Older adults (> 55 years)

In older adults (> 55 years), **prolonged-release melatonin** may improve sleep onset and quality [^1178NcfC], but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^114bcEeT]. The **EIN/ESRS 2023** guideline suggests considering prolonged-release melatonin up to 3 months in selected patients > 55 years [^116UfSZv], though benefits remain modest [^114bcEeT].

---

### Children and adolescents

In children and adolescents, **pediatric insomnia** meta-analyses show moderate reductions in sleep latency and increased total sleep time, but evidence quality is low and long-term safety is uncertain [^116Ypnw4] [^113LRHxX]. The **recommendation** is that melatonin may be considered short-term only after nonpharmacologic measures fail, with close monitoring [^116Ypnw4] [^113LRHxX].

## Comparison with other insomnia treatments

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Melatonin | - Limited <br/> - Small effects | - Generally safe <br/> - Non-serious adverse effects | Not recommended for chronic insomnia [^114bcEeT] [^113KrC6K] |
| CBT-I | - Highly effective <br/> - Large effect sizes | - No significant adverse effects | First-line therapy [^notfound] |
| Benzodiazepines | - Effective <br/> - Significant adverse effects | - Dependence <br/> - Cognitive impairment | Short-term use only [^notfound] |
| Z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone) | - Effective <br/> - Significant adverse effects | - Dependence <br/> - Cognitive impairment | Short-term use only [^notfound] |

---

CBT-I is **first-line** because of its large, durable benefits and favorable safety profile [^notfound]. Melatonin is **less effective** than CBT-I and many pharmacologic options, with smaller effect sizes and inconsistent results [^114XvfUB].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Adverse effects**: Generally mild (headache, dizziness, nausea, somnolence) [^114vmY1K].
- **Long-term safety**: Uncertain, especially in children and adolescents; potential hormonal effects warrant caution [^115u48C3].
- **Product quality**: OTC melatonin shows significant variability and contamination, raising safety concerns [^112XMXAB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **AASM 2017**: Recommends against melatonin for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy [^114bcEeT].
- **VA/DoD 2025**: Recommends avoiding melatonin for chronic insomnia [^113KrC6K].
- **EIN/ESRS 2023**: Consider prolonged-release melatonin up to 3 months in selected > 55-year-olds [^116UfSZv].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing efficacy

- **Age**: Older adults may benefit more, likely due to declining endogenous melatonin [^1178NcfC].
- **Circadian factors**: Melatonin may help when circadian misalignment contributes to insomnia [^112uT4QN].
- **Comorbidities**: Limited evidence in psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions; use with caution [^112TjkPw].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **First-line**: Use CBT-I and sleep hygiene [^112G1Vif].
- **Second-line**: Consider melatonin only if CBT-I is unavailable or declined, with close monitoring [^114Q2Ue1].
- **Dosing**: Start 1–3 mg 30–60 minutes before bedtime; titrate to effect, not exceeding 10 mg [^116o6SY5].
- **Duration**: Limit to short-term use (< 3 months) with regular reassessment [^116UfSZv].

---

Melatonin is **not effective for most adults with chronic insomnia**; benefits are small and inconsistent [^114XvfUB]. It may help some older adults, but evidence is limited. CBT-I remains first-line, and melatonin should be reserved for select cases with close monitoring.

Statistical issues

The predefined primary efficacy variable was the comparison of sleep latency as measured by the sleep diary at 3 weeks treatment weeks with PRM (2 mg) or placebo in the pre-defined subgroups of patients who were low excretors of melatonin regardless of age (primary endpoint) and the patients aged 65–80 years, regardless of melatonin levels. The comparison was done using a linear regression model with terms for treatment (PRM versus placebo), baseline sleep latency and age group (≥ 65 or < 65 - only for the primary endpoint). In compliance with US Food Drug Administration regulatory procedures, no correction for multiple comparisons were performed for the primary outcome measure.

All other efficacy endpoints were pre-defined as exploratory and aimed at confirming the results of the primary analysis using additional instruments (for example, PSQI) or adding information on other aspects of the sleep and daytime consequences of the treatment including: (1) time going to bed and sleep offset times, sleep maintenance, total sleep time, sleep quality and morning alertness from the sleep diaries; (2) the PSQI global score; (3) PSQI questions 2 (sleep latency in minutes) and 4 (total sleep time in minutes) and the individual PSQI components; (4) the CGI-I score assessed by the clinician at three to 29 treatment weeks) quality of life derived from the WHO-5 Well-being index covering positive mood, vitality and general interests.

Our main conclusion was based on sleep latency, the predefined primary variable. No correction was made for multiple statistical testing for the exploratory variables. Accordingly, the overall conclusions from the results are based on the accumulation of evidence for between-treatment differences which were, in many cases, correlated or complementary, rather than on isolated P -values.

### The efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin for primary sleep disorders. A meta-analysis [^116kBchP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Exogenous melatonin has been increasingly used in the management of sleep disorders.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in the management of primary sleep disorders.

Data Sources

A number of electronic databases were searched. We reviewed the bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews and conducted hand-searching.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for the efficacy review, and controlled trials were eligible for the safety review.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data, while the other verified data extracted. The Random Effects Model was used to analyze data.

Data Synthesis

Melatonin decreased sleep onset latency (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -11.7 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -18.2, -5.2)); it was decreased to a greater extent in people with delayed sleep phase syndrome (WMD: -38.8 minutes; 95% CI: -50.3, -27.3; n = 2) compared with people with insomnia (WMD: -7.2 minutes; 95% CI: -12.0, -2.4; n = 12). The former result appears to be clinically important. There was no evidence of adverse effects of melatonin.

Conclusions

There is evidence to suggest that melatonin is not effective in treating most primary sleep disorders with short-term use (4 weeks or less); however, additional large-scale RCTs are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. There is some evidence to suggest that melatonin is effective in treating delayed sleep phase syndrome with short-term use. There is evidence to suggest that melatonin is safe with short-term use (3 months or less).

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^112AiBos]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

Study Selection

35 randomized, controlled trials of at least 4 weeks' duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and that reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies that reported harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists; and product labels for all agents.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia, fractures, and major injury. The FDA documents reported that most pharmacotherapies had risks for cognitive and behavioral changes, including driving impairment, and other adverse effects, and they advised dose reduction in women and in older adults.

Limitations

Most trials were small and short term and enrolled individuals meeting stringent criteria. Minimum important differences in outcomes were often not established or reported. Data were scant for many treatments.

Conclusion

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term global and sleep outcomes for adults with insomnia disorder, but the comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapies for insomnia are not known. Pharmacotherapies for insomnia may cause cognitive and behavioral changes and may be associated with infrequent but serious harms.

### The effect of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc on primary insomnia in long-term care facility residents in Italy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^111QVW6K]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether nightly administration of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc improves primary insomnia in long-term care facility residents.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

One long-term care facility in Pavia, Italy.

Participants

Forty-three participants with primary insomnia (22 in the supplemented group, 21 in the placebo group) aged 78.3 ± 3.9.

Intervention

Participants took a food supplement (5 mg melatonin, 225 mg magnesium, and 11.25 mg zinc, mixed with 100 g of pear pulp) or placebo (100 g pear pulp) every day for 8 weeks, 1 hour before bedtime.

Measurements

The primary goal was to evaluate sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), the Short Insomnia Questionnaire (SDQ), and a validated quality-of-life instrument (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36)) were administered as secondary end points. Total sleep time was evaluated using a wearable armband-shaped sensor. All measures were performed at baseline and after 60 days.

Results

The food supplement resulted in considerably better overall PSQI scores than placebo (difference between groups in change from baseline PSQI score = 6.8; 95% confidence interval = 5.4–8.3, P < .001). Moreover, the significant improvements in all four domains of the LSEQ (ease of getting to sleep, P < .001; quality of sleep, P < .001; hangover on awakening from sleep, P = 0.005; alertness and behavioral integrity the following morning, P = 0.001), in SDQ score (P < .001), in total sleep time (P < .001), and in SF-36 physical score (P = 0.006) suggest that treatment had a beneficial effect on the restorative value of sleep.

Conclusion

The administration of nightly melatonin, magnesium, and zinc appears to improve the quality of sleep and the quality of life in long-term care facility residents with primary insomnia.

### The short-term and long-term adverse effects of melatonin treatment in children and adolescents: a systematic review and GRADE assessment [^115u48C3]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In children, sleep is vital for healthy development, optimal growth, emotional regulation, and mental health. Moreover, sleep influences the reconstruction, restoration and functioning of the brain and other tissues, including strengthening the immune system, improving cardiovascular functioning, and managing energy regulation. The consequences of chronic insomnia are serious and far-reaching, and among children the negative social, psychological, and physiological outcomes of sleep deficiency may persist into adulthood. Therefore, focus on promoting quality sleep remains an important public health issue already early in life, especially considering the worldwide high prevalence of insomnia among children.

Non-pharmacological interventions are first-line treatment of insomnia in children. Several non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed, with the overarching aim of introducing low-risk, non-invasive strategies with few side effects to promote healthy sleep. When non-pharmacological strategies have been tested, potential pharmacological therapies, such as melatonin may be considered. Registry and survey data from Scandinavia and Northern America show that melatonin supplementation is widely used among children with a substantial and a noteworthy increase in paediatric users over the last two decades, making melatonin a commonly used treatment in children. The increased use of melatonin in children and adolescents, involving both off-label use and self-prescriptions, underlines the need for safety data, however systematic reviews on safety in children and adolescents are scarce and with current reviews largely focusing on narrative summaries. This hinders a general overview of the extent of adverse events in the young population. In the European Union (EU), melatonin has had a marketing for use in the adult population since 2007 and for children with specific psychiatric disorders since 2018. Thus, the potential long-term consequences are largely unknown. According to the European assessment report, a potential long-term adverse event of melatonin treatment is the risk of delayed puberty, mainly due to concerns that melatonin treatment may disturb the gradual hormonal decline in melatonin plasma concentrations detected before the onset of puberty in normal development. Numerous systematic and narrative reviews have discussed the evidence, with some advocating for and others against such an association. Another element of pubertal physiology is growth spurts, which may be considered a particular vulnerable period regarding bone health, the achieved final height and fracture risk. Disturbances in melatonin regulation during pubertal development may adversely influence bone mineralisation, e.g. via the effects on pituitary and gonadal function, but beneficial effects of melatonin on bone metabolism, including both antiresorptive and anabolic effects, have also been suggested from in vitro studies and studies conducted in the elderly. In a cross-sectional study among 100 healthy girls aged 9–15 years, night urine melatonin excretion was positively correlated with osteocalcin levels, a biochemical marker for bone formation (osteoblast activity), but circulating concentrations of melatonin was not correlated with bone mineral content or bone mineral density. Whether long-term melatonin treatment among children and adolescents with chronic insomnia influences bone health is at this point uncertain.

### Efficacy of melatonin for sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: a randomised controlled trial [^116o9TEC]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of melatonin in alleviating sleep dysfunction in patients with TBI and insomnia. Although melatonin was well tolerated and provides a safe alternative to traditional hypnotic medications in patients with TBI and insomnia, treatment efficacy is unknown over longer durations. Future research should investigate the role of combining melatonin supplementation with other treatments, such as CBT-I and light therapy, to determine improvements in sleep outcomes in TBI beyond that of melatonin alone.

### Sleep, circadian rhythms, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease [^116ynTF8]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part III: therapeutic implications

Therapies aimed at improving sleep quality and normalizing rhythms in sleep and behavior would address both the sleep and circadian systems and are thus particularly attractive. Considering the profound protective effect of almorexant on Aβ plaque burden in mice, the orexin system is a high-priority target. The recent approval of Suvorexant, the first Food and Drug Administration approved orexin receptor antagonist, provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate orexin-targeted therapeutics on Aβ dynamics and cognitive endpoints in early-stage or presymptomatic AD.

Melatonin and light therapy are two methods of synchronizing the circadian clock and enforcing a consistent diurnal rhythm of sleep and activity, and they have been studied extensively in aging and AD with mixed results. In addition to helping regulate circadian rhythms, melatonin is a versatile endogenous antioxidant, and its levels decrease both with ageand preclinical AD. Regular melatonin supplementation may be slightly beneficial in improving cognitive performance of patients with mild cognitive impairment. In mice, however, there seems to be mixed data on the efficacy of melatonin supplementation on the reduction of amyloid plaques and other correlates of AD.,

Studies have suggested that melatonin has mixed effects in restoring diurnal rhythm in AD patients. Administration of melatonin at bedtime simulates the body's natural signal that it is night and exerts direct effects on clock gene expression in the SCN and other tissues. While studies in normal aged individuals suggest improvements in sleep quality with melatonin supplementation, studies have shown little, if any, effect on sleep in AD patients, suggesting additional factors other than endogenous melatonin levels may be affected by AD pathology.

Similarly, ensuring darkness at night and then applying high-intensity white or blue light in the morning has similar effects on the circadian system. Studies have shown that bright-light therapy is effective in improving the stability of diurnal rhythms in dementia patients, although this therapy alone may not improve rhythms in AD patients. However, bright-light therapy in conjunction with melatonin appears more effective than either therapy alone. A specific melatonin M1/M2 receptor agonist (ramelteon) has been approved for insomnia, whereas a second M1/M2 selective receptor agonist (tasimelteon) has been approved for the treatment of circadian disturbance (termed non-24 h sleep–wake disorder) in the blind. Although neither of these agents has been tested in an AD setting, they may achieve higher potency than melatonin itself.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^11384RGW]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of synthetic melatonin prescribed as a sleep aid for children and adolescents has increased substantially within the last decade. In Denmark, the use of melatonin is approved as a sleep aid for a narrow set of paediatric patients including autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). For all other conditions, the use of melatonin is considered off-label, meaning that the decision to initiate treatment and the consequences this may have, is the responsibility of the prescribing clinician. Registry data from the Danish Health Data Authority from 2011 to 2021 show that the number of individuals using prescribed melatonin more than tripled for those aged 0–17 years, whereas a sevenfold increase was seen for those between 18 and 24 years of age. The increase in users of prescribed melatonin was seen in individuals presenting both with and without a diagnosis that based on indication could justify its use. In Denmark, there are currently no evidence-based recommendations that may guide clinical decision-making on the use of melatonin to treat insomnia attributed to underlying disorders beyond autism spectrum disorders and ADHD.

Due to the substantial increase in users of prescribed melatonin, the Danish Health Authority initiated the work with constructing a recommendation, which based on a critical assessment of the current evidence evaluated the use of melatonin for patient groups, who are currently not included in existing guidelines. Here, we report these findings, including the certainty of evidence, pooled estimates of effects and the final clinical recommendation constructed following the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Melatonin for chronic insomnia in adults — The overall quality of evidence was downgraded to very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and industry sponsorship, and meta-analysis for adverse events was not possible with no clinically significant differences versus placebo reported. Rebound or withdrawal effects were generally not seen, with one possible exception in which Haimov found a marginally significant difference in sleep efficiency between an active phase of two month, 1 mg sustained-release melatonin and a withdrawal period. The task force concluded there was weak evidence against clinically significant efficacy for sleep onset insomnia, judged benefits to moderately exceed potential harms, and determined that a majority of patients would likely use melatonin compared to no treatment based on its availability and perceived benign profile.

### Treatments for sleep disturbances in individuals with acquired brain injury: a systematic review [^113qBo27]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatment

Two studies examined pharmacological treatment to improve sleep quality in patients with acquired brain injury. Pharmacological treatment included melatonin and amitriptyline. Melatonin intake (2 mg daily), which could be also considered as supplement, approximately two hours prior to bedtime, had a positive effect on sleep quality, but not on sleep onset latency in patients with traumatic brain injury. No follow-up assessment was conducted. This study obtained a low risk of bias with the use of a randomized controlled crossover design as a major strength. Kemp et al.compared the effect of melatonin (5 mg) with amitriptyline (25 mg) on sleep disturbances in individuals with mild to severe traumatic brain injury. Either melatonin or amitriptyline intake did not show improvements on sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep latency, or daytime alertness compared to baseline. No follow-up measurement was conducted. This study was rated with "some concerns". There was a risk of bias in selection of the reported result as there was no information on a statistical analysis protocol or trial register.

### Melatonin treatment has consistent but transient beneficial effects on sleep measures and pain in patients with severe chronic pain: the DREAM-CP randomised controlled trial [^115PqLEn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We report here a single-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of melatonin as Circadin™ in patients with severe chronic non-malignant pain. We found that melatonin treatment did not improve sleep disturbance at 6 weeks but was associated with improved sleep parameters captured with all three sleep assessment tools at 3 weeks. Adverse events were similar during both melatonin and placebo treatment periods.

Administration of melatonin reduces sleep latency and other sleep measures in older adults with primary insomnia, but not everyone responds to melatonin, with absolute responder rates of between 27% and 42%. Circadin™ is given for up to 12 months to treat primary insomnia, with no rebound or withdrawal effects and no apparent loss of efficacy over time. Melatonin has been proposed to not only help sleep in patients with chronic pain but also improve pain.

### Melatonin in medically ill patients with insomnia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115x9mu4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that melatonin improves sleep functioning, but this possibility has not been studied in medical populations.

Method

33 medically ill persons with initial insomnia were randomly assigned to receive either melatonin (N = 18) or placebo (N = 15) in a flexible-dose regimen. Double-blind assessments of aspects of sleep functioning were obtained daily across the next 8 to 16 days.

Results

The mean stable dose of melatonin was found to be 5.4 mg. Relative to placebo, melatonin significantly hastened sleep onset, improved quality and depth of sleep, and increased sleep duration without producing drowsiness, early-morning "hangover" symptoms, or daytime adverse effects (p < .05). Melatonin also contributed to freshness in the morning and during the day and improved overall daytime functioning. Benefits were most apparent during the first week of treatment.

Conclusion

Melatonin may be a useful hypnotic for medically ill patients with initial insomnia, particularly those for whom conventional hypnotic drug therapy may be problematic.

### Melatonin in schizophrenic outpatients with insomnia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113YPNVQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Low nighttime levels of melatonin have been demonstrated in patients with insomnia, and melatonin has been shown to have hypnotic properties in some groups of such subjects. Low melatonin levels have also been observed in patients with schizophrenia; however, there is little literature on the efficacy of exogenous melatonin in treating insomnia associated with schizophrenia.

Method

Stable DSM-IV schizophrenic outpatients (N = 40) with initial insomnia of at least 2 weeks' duration were randomly assigned to augment their current medications with either flexibly dosed melatonin (3–12 mg/night; N = 20) or placebo (N = 20). By use of a questionnaire, double-blind assessments of aspects of sleep functioning were obtained daily across the next 15 days. The study was conducted between March and December 2002.

Results

The modal stable dose of melatonin was 3 mg. Relative to placebo, melatonin significantly improved the quality and depth of nighttime sleep, reduced the number of nighttime awakenings, and increased the duration of sleep without producing a morning hangover (p < .05). Subjectively, melatonin also significantly reduced sleep-onset latency, heightened freshness on awakening, improved mood, and improved daytime functioning (p < .05).

Conclusion

Melatonin may be a useful short-term hypnotic for schizophrenic patients with insomnia. Melatonin could be considered for patients in whom conventional hypnotic drug therapy or higher sedative antipsychotic drug doses may be problematic.

Complementary Use of Melatonin and Other Indications for Use of Melatonin

Melatonin can be used because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well. With antioxidant properties on nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, melatonin supplementation was aimed to reduce tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia being treated with antipsychotics. A meta-analysis suggested a potential efficacy for improving tardive dyskinesia, although no significant effect was demonstrated. Antioxidant properties of melatonin might be utilized, e.g. to modulate mitochondrial dysfunction in aging, cognition, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, melatonin might be a useful alternative as an anti-inflammatory agent. Dysfunction of immune system might be related to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and mood disorders. Furthermore, melatonin may be beneficial for metabolic syndrome in patients treated with antipsychotics. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated the effects of melatonin on attenuating metabolic parameters such as fasting glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. These effects might be direct or due to correcting sleep or circadian rhythms. Also, melatonin has been tried to treat insomnia caused due to benzodiazepine withdrawal. Currently, there are conflicting results. One RCT did not find significant effects of melatonin on the average benzodiazepine dosage, benzodiazepine cessation proportion, or withdrawal symptoms at 24 weeks. However, melatonin supplementation in another RCT significantly improved the self-reported sleep quality. Further studies are warranted to clarify the facilitating efficacy of melatonin on benzodiazepine withdrawal.

### Practice guideline: treatment for insomnia and disrupted sleep behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1129g7AR]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) — sleep disturbances in children and adolescents are common, including difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, frequent and prolonged night awakenings, irregular sleep–wake patterns, short sleep duration, and early-morning waking, and between 44% and 83% of children and adolescents with ASD report coexisting sleep abnormalities; although up to 40% of typically developing children and adolescents have sleep problems, these often resolve with age, whereas in ASD sleep problems often persist. Children and adolescents with ASD and sleep disturbances often receive combined medication, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, and exogenous melatonin is a synthetic form of endogenous melatonin with chronobiologic (circadian) functions and hypnotic effects; over-the-counter (OTC) preparations are considered supplements and not subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) purity regulations.

### The use and misuse of exogenous melatonin in the treatment of sleep disorders [^117BWxrv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To explore the evidence for using exogenous melatonin in the treatment of sleep disorders, both primary and secondary, in children and adults.

Recent Findings

A number of recently published meta-analyses have shown that there is evidence for the efficacy of exogenously administered melatonin in a number of sleep disorders. However, melatonin is likely to be prescribed largely for reasons of perceived minimal side-effect profile and very low cost in situations in which high-quality evidence for its usefulness is not forthcoming.

Summary

There is evidence for the efficacy of melatonin in the management of insomnia and some intrinsic disorders of circadian rhythm in adults and children as well as in reducing sleep onset latency in jet-lag and shift work disorder in adults. Melatonin is used routinely in the treatment of rapid-eye movement sleep-behaviour disorder despite limited trial evidence. Increasingly, dual melatonin receptor agonists are being trialled in a variety of sleep disorders. Long-term adverse effects are currently not fully identified.

### Novel perspective of' poor sleep' in public health: a narrative review [^1129gFhg]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

A number of other popular non-prescription treatments have demonstrated safety and varying levels of effectiveness. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, plays a fundamental role in regulating sleep–wake cycle and circadian rhythm, and melatonin-based supplements are available to manage sleep disturbances. Melatonin helps to reduce the time to fall asleep; however, there is no recommended dosage regimen for melatonin supplementation. Common side effects, such as somnolence and headaches, have been associated with the use of melatonin.

Plants or plant-derived materials have long been used to treat a range of sleep disturbances; these include chamomile (Matricaria recutita), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and passionflower (Passiflora incarnata). Recent meta-analyses found conflicting results on the actual efficacy of these substances, but have emphasised the lack of efficacy of most herbal components for insomnia. Some dietary supplements, for example, iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium, nicotinamide, B vitamins and polyphenols, have shown some positive effect on sleep. There are still a few studies examining the relationship between micronutrient status and sleep; however, emerging evidence suggests a link between dietary micronutrient intake and sleep.

Finally, other sleep aids can improve sleep by modifying environmental factors. Body temperature is a critical determinant of both falling asleep (core body temperature drops) and staying asleep (core body temperature increases). Different devices have been investigated (mattress, bedsheet and warming eye mask) and results were consistent in reporting objective and subjective sleep quality in adults with mild difficulty in falling asleep. Light plays a central role in regulating the circadian rhythm. In response to darkness, the pineal gland initiates production of melatonin, but light exposure slows or halts that production. Short wavelength light, emitted by smartphone screens, highly influences the biological clock and therefore can affect sleep quality through suppression of melatonin production. A study investigated the effect of an amber filter for screens on sleep quality and found that blocking the short-wavelength light component may improve sleep length.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^114CobEC]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Melatonin has become a widely used sleeping aid for young individuals currently not included in existing guidelines. The aim was to develop a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 2–20 years, with chronic insomnia due to disorders beyond indication.

Methods

We performed a systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomised trials (RCTs) in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A separate search for adverse events was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 17, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (2–20 years of age) with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. Studies exclusively on autism spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactive disorder were excluded. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events, assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, non-serious adverse events, and all-cause dropouts (assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment), plus quality of sleep and daytime functioning (assessed at 3–6 months post-treatment). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse variance random effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using I² statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. A multidisciplinary guideline panel constructed the recommendation using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation and its impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

Findings

We identified 13 RCTs, including 403 patients with a wide range of conditions. Melatonin reduced sleep latency by 14.88 min (95% CI 23.42–6.34, 9 studies, I² = 60%) and increased total sleep time by 18.97 min (95% CI 0.37–37.57, 10 studies, I² = 57%). The funnel plot for total sleep time showed no apparent indication of publication bias. No other clinical benefits were found. The number of patients experiencing adverse events was not statistically increased however, safety data was scarce. Certainty of evidence was low.

Interpretation

Low certainty evidence supports a moderate effect of melatonin in treating sleep continuity parameters in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia due to primarily medical disorders beyond indication. The off-label use of melatonin for these patients should never be the first choice of treatment, but may be considered by medical specialists with knowledge of the underlying disorder and if non-pharmacological interventions are inadequate. If treatment with melatonin is initiated, adequate follow-up to evaluate treatment effect and adverse events is essential.

### Efficacy of melatonin for chronic insomnia: systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^1153EQtr]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin versus placebo or other hypnotic agents in improving sleep quality and quantity in patients with chronic insomnia. A literature search on Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to November 2020. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep quality and quality of life were examined as outcomes. We identified 24 randomized controlled trials of chronic insomnia including four studies of patients with comorbid insomnia. All studies were compared with placebo. Due to heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses by age group. In non-comorbid insomnia, melatonin was only significantly effective in sleep onset latency and total sleep time in children and adolescents. In adults group, melatonin was not significantly effective in improving sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency. In comorbid insomnia, melatonin significantly improved sleep onset latency in all age groups, but there was only one study in adults group. In conclusion, melatonin did not appear to be effective in adults but might be effective in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia for both comorbid insomnia and non-comorbid insomnia. Further studies are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of melatonin by age groups.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^115gtQ2S]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia — herbal supplements (chamomile, melatonin, passionflower, saffron, valerian): The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence and reported that these supplements did not show improvement in insomnia outcomes, are associated with side effects, and can delay appropriate insomnia treatment; the harms slightly outweighed the benefits and the Work Group decided on a Weak against recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the recommendation was categorized as Reviewed, Amended with no new evidence regarding chamomile, with limitations including small sample size, risk of bias, imprecision of data, and indirectness of data. Additional considerations noted that herbal supplements are not FDA regulated, there are concerns about purity and composition, costs can vary from cheap to expensive which can place an additional financial burden, melatonin has been associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, vivid dreams, and nightmares, and valerian has also been associated with liver toxicity; given these supplements were not shown to improve insomnia, choosing them over proven treatments could be detrimental to the patient.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^113LRHxX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Melatonin prescriptions for children and adolescents have increased substantially during the last decade. Existing clinical recommendations focus on melatonin as a treatment for insomnia related to neurodevelopmental disorders. To help guide clinical decision-making, we aimed to construct a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 5–20 years with idiopathic chronic insomnia.

Methods

A systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCT) were performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A search for adverse events in otherwise healthy children and adolescents was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 18, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (5–20 years of age) with idiopathic chronic insomnia, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption, or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, all-cause dropouts, and non-serious adverse events. Outcomes were assessed at different time points to assess short-term and long-term effects. Meta-analysis was performed using inverse variance random-effects model and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. If possible, funnel plots would be constructed to investigate publication bias. Heterogeneity was calculated via I² statistics. A multidisciplinary guideline panel formulated the recommendation according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was subsequently used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation alongside the impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

Findings

We included eight RCTs with 419 children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia. Melatonin led to a moderate increase in total sleep time by 30.33 min (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.96–41.70, 4 studies, I² = 0%) and a moderate reduction in sleep latency by 18.03 min (95% CI −26.61 to −9.44, 3 studies, I² = 0%), both as assessed by sleep diary. No other beneficial effects were found. None of the studies provided information on serious adverse events, yet the number of participants experiencing non-serious adverse events was increased (Relative risk 3.44, 95% CI 1.25–9.42, 4 studies, I² = 0%). Funnel plots were not constructed due to the low number of studies. The certainty of evidence was very low on the quality of sleep and low for daytime functioning.

Interpretation

Evidence of very low certainty shows that benefits are limited and unwanted events are likely when melatonin is used to treat otherwise healthy children and adolescents with chronic insomnia. Melatonin should never be the first choice of treatment for this particular population, yet carefully monitored short-term use may be considered if sleep hygiene practices and non-pharmacological interventions have proven inadequate, and only if daytime function is compromised.

### Role of melatonin in the management of sleep and circadian disorders in the context of psychiatric illness [^111pjToH]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Role of Melatonin in Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders

The effects of melatonin in cohorts with distinct sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are well established. In patients with primary insomnia, exogenous melatonin demonstrates significant effects on several sleep parameters such as sleep onset latency, total sleep time, morning alertness, and sleep quality, as reviewed in several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A meta-analysis in primary insomnia with 5 original studies showed that exogenous melatonin significantly shortens sleep onset latency. Most of the studies included in the Auld et al. meta-analysis administered melatonin 2 mg at 2 h before bedtime. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the effects of a higher dosage, 3 mg melatonin for 4 weeks, on sleep disturbance in 97 middle-aged patients with primary insomnia. While this study showed a positive impact on sleep parameters, such as decreases in early wake time and percentage of N2 sleep, there was no effect of melatonin on a circadian marker, sleep onset latency.

Until now, only one, older RCT compared the efficacy on sleep onset latency according to melatonin dosage. This study reported differential effects of melatonin as 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, and 3 mg on several sleep parameters in 30 insomniac subjects who were over 50 years of age. Although each melatonin administration did not show a difference in sleep onset latency compared to placebo, melatonin 0.3 mg showed the largest impact on sleep efficiency.

Further evidence for the potential of melatonin in correcting circadian rhythms is provided in some other target groups, including both disorders and external causes for a phase shift. A meta-analysis with a focus on patients with delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) concluded that exogenous melatonin advanced endogenous melatonin onset and shortened sleep onset latency. Later, one RCT using 0.5 mg melatonin at 1 h before a desired bedtime significantly shortened sleep onset latency. These studies propose usefulness of low-dosage melatonin administration in advancing sleep phase or shortening sleep latency. The improving effects of melatonin on sleep parameters have also been observed in subjects with jet lag symptoms, in shift workers, and in non-24-h sleep–wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD). However, some older studies provide conflicting findings.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^112ZcW42]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, melatonin has a moderate effect on sleep continuity parameters, without having an impact on more personal-perceived outcomes. The use of melatonin should never be first choice of treatment for otherwise healthy children and adolescents with chronic insomnia. However, given the potential negative impact of continuous sleep problems, melatonin may be administered in special cases and only for a short period of time. The limited benefits of melatonin, the likelihood of non-serious adverse events and what may constitute realistic magnitudes of effect has to be discussed prior to initiating treatment.

The strengths of the current review include transparent methods adhering to PRISMA guidelines, Cochrane collaboration and the GRADE approach. The work is based on a pre-specified protocol, formulated by a multidisciplinary guideline panel and pre-registered at the Danish Health Authority. The search is based on a systematic and comprehensive search strategy. Selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment have been done independently by duplicate reviewers. Limitations include restriction to English and Scandinavian languages. This was done to avoid any misinterpretation of results published in another foreign language. It is not known whether there may be additional relevant studies published in other languages. Reviewers were not being blinded during selection of studies, as this was not possible with the current software and since evaluation of the full text was mandated to assess the eligibility of the study for inclusion. Authors of the included studies were not contacted for further information and grey literature was not considered for inclusion. Assessment of title and abstract was only done by one reviewer. Amendments to the pre-registered protocol were inclusion of studies in which sleep hygiene had not been tested prior to initiation of the trial. We were not able to evaluate the frequency of adverse events as initially planned, due to limitations in the reporting of data. Due to lack of data, we were not able to evaluate the pre-specified outcomes following 3–6 months of treatment. Daytime functioning was only assessed using parent-rated questionnaires and not by a clinician as initially pre-specified. The age range in our pre-specified protocol was 5–20 years, whereas the included studies assessed children and adolescents aged 6–19 years. We do however believe that the current evidence is still representative of our pre-specified age range, and thus no amendments in regards to this were made. Our cut-off values used in the subgroup analysis investigating dosage effects (below/above 5 mg) were chosen post-hoc. As such, these cut-off values are based on what data was available in the identified literature, and thus do not per se reflect any clinical, scientific or theoretical reason of choice.

### Efficacy of melatonin for sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: a randomised controlled trial [^116mZiwq]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances are commonly reported following traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring across the spectrum of severity and persisting years following injury. Insomnia and hypersomnia are among the most prevalent sleep disorders in TBI patients. Despite a high prevalence, sleep disturbances are often overlooked in the TBI population and evidence-based treatments are lacking. Consequently, untreated sleep disturbances following TBI contribute to ongoing cognitive dysfunction, poorer rehabilitation outcomes, lower productivity and poorer functional status.

Although numerous mechanisms may contribute to sleep disturbance in TBI, our research demonstrates that TBI is associated with attenuated and delayed melatonin profiles. Specifically, we observed reduced evening and overnight melatonin production in TBI patients compared to age and sex matched controls, with evening melatonin production positively correlated with REM sleep. As endogenous melatonin has sleep-promoting effects and is involved in the circadian control of the sleep–wake cycle, attenuated melatonin profiles may contribute to sleep-related disturbances following TBI. Thus, restoring melatonin with supplementation may help to alleviate sleep disturbances in individuals with TBI. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin supplementation (2 mg/d) on sleep quality in patients with TBI reporting sleep disturbances.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^111EFPje]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Search for literature and study selection

A systematic search was performed in four individual steps for 1) guidelines and health technology assessments, published within the last 12 years 2) systematic reviews and metanalysis, published within the last 7 years 3) randomised controlled trials (RCT), with no date restriction and 4) a restricted search for adverse events, with no date restriction. Search for guidelines, systematic reviews and the restricted search for adverse events was performed up to March 2023 (last search date March 18). The search for RCTs was performed up to February 2023 (last search date February 6). The restricted time frame for guidelines and systematic reviews was chosen to ensure that any identified evidence synthesis would include the latest primary studies and thus would still be considered relevant. No restriction was put on the search for randomised studies to ensure that all relevant primary studies were identified. Searches were performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and the Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. Search words included medical subject headings and free-text search words. Language was restricted to English and Scandinavian languages. There were no restrictions on publication status. The reference lists of included studies were searched for additional relevant studies. The guideline panel was consulted to ensure that no known literature was missing. The search strategies are found in the Supplementary.

Identified studies were imported to RefWorks and duplicates were removed. Remaining studies were imported to Covidence, and final selection was based on the described PICO criteria. One reviewer (HEC) assessed title and abstracts. Full text assessment was done by two independent reviewers (HEC and HKA). Reviewers were not blinded during study selection. Any disagreements were solved through discussion.

Results

Literature search and study selection

No relevant guidelines or health technology assessments were identified (Fig. 1 a). The search for systematic reviews resulted in 28 reviews that underwent full-text evaluation. Of these 28 reviews, 14 reviews came close to our research question, yet these were excluded following a thorough read-through (Fig. 1 b). A search for primary studies resulted in 1109 studies, leading to the final inclusion of eight RCTs; (Fig. 1 c). The reference lists of the identified systematic reviews and the separate search for RCTs investigating adverse events did not contribute with any further studies. PRISMA flowcharts for all searches performed and an overview of excluded primary studies are included in the Supplementary.

### Practice guideline: treatment for insomnia and disrupted sleep behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116o6SY5]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Melatonin use in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — clinician guidance states that clinicians should offer melatonin to children and adolescents with ASD if behavioral strategies have not been helpful and contributing coexisting conditions and use of concomitant medications have been addressed (Level B). For product quality, clinicians offering melatonin for sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with ASD should write a prescription for melatonin or recommend using a high-purity pharmaceutical grade of melatonin when available (Level B). For dosing, clinicians offering melatonin for sleep dysregulation in children and adolescents with ASD should start by initiating a low dose (1–3 mg/d), 30–60 minutes before bedtime, and titrate to effect, not exceeding 10 mg/d (Level B). Safety counseling is also specified: clinicians offering melatonin for sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with ASD should counsel children and adolescents with ASD and sleep disturbance (as appropriate) and their parents regarding potential adverse events of melatonin use and the lack of long-term safety data (Level B).

### Insomnia: the sleeping giant of pediatric public health [^112G1Vif]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Insomnia among children and adolescents is ubiquitous and takes a great toll on youth and their families, impacting academic achievement, mood, social functioning, and a variety of developmental outcomes. Unfortunately, however, pediatric insomnia most often remains unidentified and untreated. When treatment is provided, it is most often in the form of medications, which are not FDA approved for that indication in children and adolescents. A comprehensive literature review was employed to establish the recommendations in this report. This article provides a review of sleep physiology and both current and recommended approaches to assessing and treating pediatric insomnia. Comprehensive assessment, accurate diagnosis, and evidence-based treatment of insomnia is imperative to the healthy development of children and adolescents. While clinicians often prescribe a variety of medications to treat pediatric insomnia, there is insufficient data to demonstrate efficacy and endorse their routine use. At this time, behavioral techniques, such as cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and sleep hygiene education, should remain the first line of treatment. As a second-line consideration, melatonin, a dietary supplement, may be effective. Pediatric insomnia has an enormous impact on children, adolescents, and their families that requires adequate attention from clinicians and parents alike.

### Melatonin: translation of ongoing studies into possible therapeutic applications outside sleep disorders [^113jGFWj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Melatonin, a natural hormone mainly synthesized by the pineal gland, is regulated by circadian rhythm. Synthetic melatonin is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any indication. However, melatonin receptor agonists such as ramelteon and tasimelteon are US Food and Drug Administration approved and are considered by the American Academy of Family Physicians for the treatment of insomnia. Due to the availability of over-the-counter products in some countries and the increasing use of melatonin, it is interesting to highlight knowledge regarding the potential benefits of melatonin outside sleep disorders.

Methods

This narrative review included published reports in EMBASE and MEDLINE databases between 1975 and 2021 relating to the therapeutic applications of melatonin.

Findings

Based on the quality of the evidence published to date, the most promising non-insomnia indications are for treating ischemia/reperfusion injury, primary headache disorders, fibromyalgia, glucose control, and blood pressure control.

Implications

Most of the studies were preclinical and in in vivo and in vitro phases. More clinical trials are needed before recommending melatonin as a treatment in clinical practice.

PSQI global scores were lower (improved) in the PRM group across study visits with significant global treatment effects [-0.70 (-1.17, -0.23) P = 0.003; Table 7].

Consistent with the improvements in quality of sleep (PSQI global score) and sleep latency (diary), components 1 (sleep quality) and 2 (sleep latency) of the PSQI were significantly lower (improved) in the PRM group across study visits in patients aged 65–80 years [-0.15 (-0.25, -0.04), P = 0.006, -0.24 (-0.38, -0.10), P = 0.001]. PSQI question 2 (sleep latency) was significantly lower across study visits in the PRM group in the age 65–80 population [-12.1 min (-19.1, -5.1), P = 0.001].

PRM patients aged 65–80 years were significantly more alert in the morning than placebo patients [-0.10 (-0.19, -0.01), P = 0.032; Table 6]. The effects of treatment on morning alertness were enhanced during the long term period as evidenced by a linear trend in treatment by visit effects (P = 0.012), with greater benefits for PRM patients at later visits. CGI-I scores were significantly lower (improved) across study visits in the PRM group compared with placebo for these patients [-0.20 (-0.38, -0.02), P = 0.027; Table 7].

### Effect of melatonin supplementation on sleep quality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1126jk77]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Present study was conducted to systematically review the effect of the melatonin on sleep quality. We summarized evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of melatonin on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in adults with various diseases.

Methods

The literature searches of English publications in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were performed up June 2020. Results were summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random effects model (DerSimonian-Laird method). Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test and I-squared (I2). To determine the predefined sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was performed.

Results

Of 2642 papers, 23 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Our results indicated that melatonin had significant effect on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (WMD: -1.24; 95% CI -1.77, -0.71, p = 0.000). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I² = 80.7%, p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis based on health status and kind of intervention were potential between-study heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on health status revealed melatonin intervention in subjects with Respiratory diseases (WMD: -2.20; 95% CI -2.97, -1.44, p = 0.000), Metabolic disorders (WMD: -2.74; 95% CI -3.48, -2.00, p = 0.000) and sleep disorders (WMD: -0.67; 95% CI -0.98, -0.37, p = 0.000) has significant effect on sleep quality.

Conclusion

We found that the treatment with exogenous melatonin has positive effects on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in adult. In adults with respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, primary sleep disorders, not with mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and other diseases.

### The utility of melatonin for the treatment of sleep disturbance after traumatic brain injury: a scoping review [^113uvqpX]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the utility of melatonin supplementation as a treatment option for individuals with sleep disturbance after traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Data Sources

A systematic search was conducted in 6 electronic databases (Medline, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus) from earliest records to April 2022.

Study Selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: a) human participants with sleep disturbance after TBI, b) melatonin or melatonergic agent used as an intervention to treat sleep disturbance, and c) outcomes of melatonin administration reported. All TBI severity types (mild, moderate, and severe) were eligible. The initial search retrieved a total of 595 articles, with 9 studies meeting the eligibility criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed methodological quality. Extracted data consisted of participant and injury characteristics, melatonin interventional properties, and sleep outcome. Methodological quality was assessed via the Downs and Black checklist.

Data Synthesis

A total of 251 participants with TBI-induced sleep disturbance (mean age range: 14.0–42.5 years) were included. Melatonin, Circadin (prolonged-release melatonin), or Ramelteon (melatonin receptor agonist) were administered. Dosages and intervention duration ranged from 2 to 10 mg and 3 to 12 weeks, respectively. Eight out of 9 studies reported positive outcomes after melatonin treatment. Significant improvements in subjective sleep quality, objective sleep efficiency, and total sleep time were found with melatonin. Reductions in self-reported fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were also observed with melatonin treatment. No serious adverse events were reported after melatonin administration.

Conclusion

Melatonin has good tolerability after short-term use and the potential to be a therapeutic agent for those with sleep disturbance after TBI. Melatonin was shown to be beneficial to sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Additional clinically relevant outcomes of improved mental health suggest that melatonin use may be a promising treatment option for individuals experiencing co-occurring disorders of mood and sleep disturbance post-injury.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^111TUXob]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria (PICO question)

The population included children and adolescents aged 2–20 years with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, and where sleep hygiene practices were inadequate. The diagnosis of chronic insomnia refers to the diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder found in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 3 (ICSD-3), which includes repeated difficulties with maintaining — or initiating sleep, or issues with the duration or quality of sleep despite adequate circumstances to obtain sleep. These issues should be present for at least 3 months, at least 3 times a week and result in issues with daytime functioning. In accordance with ICSD-3, insomnia symptoms may be seen both in the presence or absence of an underlying medical–or mental condition. From a clinical point of view, treating insomnia in patients with underlying conditions can be especially challenging due to a complex symptom profile and use of concomitant medications and thus treatment is often warranted in specialised medical facilities. To provide a clinical recommendation for these patients, we here chose to include studies investigating the use of melatonin in children and adolescents who displayed chronic insomnia as a secondary symptom to an underlying condition in accordance with the definition provided by ICSD-3. Patients presenting with idiopathic insomnia or with a sleep disorder, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and sleep-related movement disorders, were not considered for inclusion. Participants with insomnia attributed entirely to autism spectrum disorders or ADHD were also excluded, as melatonin is an approved treatment for these conditions and thus recommendations on the use of melatonin in these patients already exist. Studies on neurodevelopmental disorders were included if the number of participants with autism or ADHD was < 30%. This cut-off was based on expert opinions by the guideline panel, and chosen as it was considered a sufficiently low level by which the population could not be considered to primarily represent either ADHD or autism. The intervention was melatonin, with no restrictions on dosage, treatment length, release formula or time of administration. The comparison was no treatment or treatment with any non-pharmacological intervention. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events, assessed at 2–4 weeks following treatment. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness/sleepiness, quality of life, non-serious adverse events and all-cause dropouts, all assessed at 2–4 weeks following treatment as well as quality of sleep and daytime functioning, assessed after 3–6 months of treatment. Assessment of long-term consequences will be published separately. We did not a priori make any requirements on how outcomes were to be assessed.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^112sm2nH]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings are similar to other systematic reviews, which also show a positive effect of melatonin on sleep latency and total sleep time, yet without the reviews providing information on quality of sleep or daytime functioning. Following subgroup analysis, we found that effects were comparable between fast-release and sustained-release formulations and increasing dosages above 5 mg did not seem to further improve outcomes. These subgroup results are based on few studies with high heterogeneity across trials, and thus further research is needed. Nevertheless, our subgroup findings align with current published expert opinions stating that prolonged-release formulations may not be superior to immediate release, and with the recommended dosage for children being 3 mg/nocte and 5 mg/nocte for adolescents. The timing of dosing across studies varied between 20 min and 2 h before bedtime. Timing of administration is of importance and depends on whether melatonin is administered as a chronobiotic (2–3 h before dim-light melatonin onset) or rather as a sleep inductor (30 min before bedtime). As such, the most appropriate timing of administration may likely differ across different disorders, which should be kept in mind if treatment with melatonin is initiated.

In all cases, chronic insomnia should initially be tried resolved by means of sleep hygiene practices and other non-pharmacological measures. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed that encouraging earlier bedtimes, may increase the total sleep time by 47 min in healthy children. It is noteworthy, that only 4 out of the 13 included studies reported that sleep hygiene practices had been tested prior to initiating treatment with melatonin. Healthcare decision-makers seeking to adopt this recommendation should be aware that access to non-pharmacological interventions may hinder the feasibility of implementation. Treatment with melatonin is off-label for all patients included in this review, which is something families should be made aware of if treatment is initiated. The decision to initiate off label treatment and the consequences this may have, is the responsibility of the prescribing clinician. In accordance, we recommend that treatment with melatonin should only be initiated and monitored by a specialist with knowledge of the underlying disorder.

Melatonin for the treatment of primary insomnia — recommendation and evidence: Recommendation 12 states, "We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK]", with the remark that this is based on trials of 2 mg doses of melatonin. Three studies addressed melatonin 2 mg in older adults (> 55 years); meta-analysis was only achievable for sleep quality and indicated a SMD of +0.21 (CI: −0.36 to +0.77 SMD), which was not clinically significant, with the overall quality of evidence very low and no adequate data for meta-analysis of adverse effects available.

### Effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep: a meta-analysis [^115sZ44K]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Exogenous melatonin reportedly induces drowsiness and sleep, and may ameliorate sleep disturbances, including the nocturnal awakenings associated with old age. However, existing studies on the soporific efficacy of melatonin have been highly heterogeneous in regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria, measures to evaluate insomnia, doses of the medication, and routes of administration. We reviewed and analyzed (by meta-analysis) available information on effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep. A MEDLINE search (1980 to December 2003) provided English-language articles, supplemented by personal files maintained by the authors. The analysis used information derived from 17 different studies (involving 284 subjects) that satisfied inclusion criteria. Sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, and sleep efficiency were selected as the outcome measures. The study effect size was taken to be the difference between the response on placebo and the mean response on melatonin for each outcome measured. Melatonin treatment significantly reduced sleep onset latency by 4.0 min (95% CI 2.5, 5.4); increased sleep efficiency by 2.2% (95% CI 0.2, 4.2), and increased total sleep duration by 12.8 min (95% CI 2.9, 22.8). Since 15 of the 17 studies enrolled healthy subjects or people with no relevant medical condition other than insomnia, the analysis was also done including only these 15 studies. The sleep onset results were changed to 3.9 min (95% CI (2.5, 5.4)); sleep efficiency increased to 3.1% (95% CI (0.7, 5.5)); sleep duration increased to 13.7 min (95% CI (3.1, 24.3)).

### Melatonin natural health products and supplements: presence of serotonin and significant variability of melatonin content [^112XMXAB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Melatonin is an important neurohormone, which mediates circadian rhythms and the sleep cycle. As such, it is a popular and readily available supplement for the treatment and prevention of sleep-related disorders including insomnia and jet lag. This study quantified melatonin in 30 commercial supplements, comprising different brands and forms and screened supplements for the presence of serotonin.

Methods

A total of 31 supplements were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection for quantification of melatonin and serotonin. Presence of serotonin was confirmed through analysis by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection.

Results

Melatonin content was found to range from -83% to +478% of the labelled content. Additionally, lot-to-lot variable within a particular product varied by as much as 465%. This variability did not appear to be correlated with manufacturer or product type. Furthermore, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), a related indoleamine and controlled substance used in the treatment of several neurological disorders, was identified in eight of the supplements at levels of 1 to 75 μg.

Conclusions

Melatonin content did not meet label within a 10% margin of the label claim in more than 71% of supplements and an additional 26% were found to contain serotonin. It is important that clinicians and patients have confidence in the quality of supplements used in the treatment of sleep disorders. To address this, manufacturers require increased controls to ensure melatonin supplements meet both their label claim, and also are free from contaminants, such as serotonin.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^113CXS4c]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia — melatonin (systematic review): A new systematic review evaluated 16 RCTs using melatonin 2 to 10 mg over 4 days to 6 months in children, adolescents, and adults (n = 1,710), with formulations including transbuccal, fast release, immediate release, and controlled release compared to placebo. In adult patients, there was no statistically significant improvement in sleep onset latency (SOL) (reduced by 2.25 minutes, n = 1,349), total sleep time (TST) (increased by 1.23 minutes, n = 1,029), sleep efficiency (SE) (improved by 1.22%, n = 269) or sleep quality by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) or Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A subgroup analysis based on melatonin formulation was not performed, safety outcomes and adverse events were not reviewed, and the quality of evidence was rated as low due to high risk of bias from non-random approaches, inadequate allocation concealment, attrition bias, reporting bias, unclear endpoints, and lack of wash-out periods.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^112FzMCX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendation

The guideline panel put emphasis on the evidence showing a moderate clinical improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency, yet without melatonin having an impact on the remaining outcomes concerning benefits. This was weighed against uncertain long-term consequencesand that melatonin does not seem to increase adverse events, however further assessment across the different disorders is needed. The overall certainty of evidence was low (see Tables 2 and 3). The guideline panel suggests that both patients and parents show an increased motivation for testing melatonin as a sleep aid (see Table 3). However, the guideline panel agrees that sleep hygiene practices and non-pharmacological interventions are always to be considered first choice of treatment, which must be sufficiently tested and proven inadequate before treatment with melatonin is considered.

Table 3
Evidence to decision framework (EtD).

As such, a conditional recommendation was given in favour of melatonin as a treatment in children and adolescents aged 2–20 years, who despite optimisation of sleep hygiene practices continue to display deficits in daytime functioning due to chronic insomnia attributed to an underlying disorder.

The guideline panel assumes that the implementation of this recommendation may be challenged by access to non-pharmacological interventions, including counselling in sleep hygiene practices. The guideline panel believes that treatment with melatonin for these patients should be initiated and monitored by a medical specialist with knowledge of the underlying condition. Access to a medical specialist may also hinder the implementation. Also, the families need to be made aware that melatonin is only approved for a narrow set of paediatric patients, and thus for the majority of patients it is considered off-label. Resources may be influenced by the price of the prescribed melatonin product. Equity may be affected by price differences and by variations in access across the country to counselling in sleep hygiene practices and other non-pharmacological interventions (see Table 3).

### Evidence for the efficacy of melatonin in the treatment of primary adult sleep disorders [^112uT4QN]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Melatonin is a physiological hormone involved in sleep timing and is currently used exogenously in the treatment of primary and secondary sleep disorders with empirical evidence of efficacy, but very little evidence from randomised, controlled studies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the evidence base for the therapeutic effects of exogenous melatonin in treating primary sleep disorders. An electronic literature review search of MEDLINE (1950-present) Embase (1980- present), PsycINFO (1987- present), and Scopus (1990- present), along with a hand-searching of key journals was performed in July 2013 and then again in May 2015. This identified all studies that compared the effect of exogenous melatonin and placebo in patients with primary insomnia, delayed sleep phase syndrome, non 24-h sleep wake syndrome in people who are blind, and rapid eye movement-behaviour disorder. Meta-analyses were performed to determine the magnitude of effect in studies of melatonin in improving sleep. A total of 5030 studies were identified; of these citations, 12 were included for review based on the inclusion criteria of being: double or single-blind, randomised and controlled. Results from the meta-analyses showed the most convincing evidence for exogenous melatonin use was in reducing sleep onset latency in primary insomnia (p = 0.002), delayed sleep phase syndrome (p < 0.0001), and regulating the sleep-wake patterns in blind patients compared with placebo. These findings highlight the potential importance of melatonin in treating certain first degree sleep disorders. The development of large-scale, randomised, controlled trials is recommended to provide further evidence for therapeutic use of melatonin in a variety of sleep difficulties.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^114Q2Ue1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Certainty of evidence

The certainty of evidence was very low on quality of sleep and low for daytime functioning. None of the studies provided any information on serious adverse events. Thus, the overall certainty of evidence was very low (see Table 3).

Table 3
Evidence to decision framework (EtD).

Evidence-based recommendation

Emphasis was put on evidence showing a moderate reduction in sleep latency and moderate increase in the total sleep time as assessed by sleep diary, yet without melatonin having an impact on quality of sleep and daytime functioning. This was weighed against an increased risk of adverse events, yet with no indication of them being serious of nature, and the uncertain long-term consequences. The overall certainty of evidence was very low (see Table 3). The guideline panel believes that melatonin should never be the first choice of treatment for insomnia in children and adolescents. However, due to the potential negative impact of chronic insomnia, carefully monitored short-term treatment may be tried in those who continue to display deficits in daytime functioning. For these individuals and their families, the guideline panel believes that there is a general interest in trying melatonin as a treatment option.

Therefore, a conditional recommendation was provided for the use of melatonin to treat idiopathic chronic insomnia in children and adolescents (5–20 years), who continue to display deficits in daytime functioning, despite the optimisation of sleep hygiene practices. If sleep hygiene practices have proven inadequate, the guideline panel believes that non-pharmacological interventions should also be considered prior to initiating treatment with melatonin. In accordance, some effects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as other psychological treatments, have been found for treating insomnia in children and adolescents. The working group recommends that treatment with melatonin should be as short as possible and always be re-assessed after 14 days, and again after three months. If there is little or no effect, as assessed by sleep diary on parameters such as total sleep time and sleep latency, use of melatonin should be discontinued.

The implementation of this recommendation may be affected by the accessibility of non-pharmacological interventions and counselling on sleep hygiene measures. Equity and resources may be affected by the price of the melatonin product being prescribed. The guideline panel believes that the child/adolescents and parents consider melatonin to be an acceptable treatment for chronic insomnia. This has also been found by others. Nevertheless, the use of melatonin for idiopathic chronic insomnia is off-label, which the child/adolescents and family needs to be made aware of prior to initiating treatment (see Table 3).

### Melatonin for blood pressure control in adults [^112fetxk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows:

Critical objective

To assess the effects of oral melatonin supplementation (immediate‑release (IR) and controlled‑/sustained‑release CR/SR; any dose; ≥ 1 week) versus placebo or no treatment on change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) in adults.

Important objectives

To examine dose‑response relationships between melatonin dose and changes in SBP and DBP.
To assess effects by key participant and intervention characteristics (prespecified subgroups): baseline blood pressure status; concomitant antihypertensive medication use; presence of diagnosed sleep disorder/insomnia; melatonin formulation (IR versus CR/SR); blood pressure measurement method (office versus ambulatory versus home; daytime versus nocturnal); age (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years); sex.
To evaluate adverse events (serious and non‑serious) and select patient‑important outcomes (quality of life, sleep quality).
To describe any reported longer‑term cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. incident cardiovascular disease events, mortality) when sufficient data are available. These analyses are exploratory given anticipated sparse data.

### Melatonin treatment for age-related insomnia [^115Vg1nV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Older people typically exhibit poor sleep efficiency and reduced nocturnal plasma melatonin levels. The daytime administration of oral melatonin to younger people, in doses that raise their plasma melatonin levels to the nocturnal range, can accelerate sleep onset. We examined the ability of similar, physiological doses to restore nighttime melatonin levels and sleep efficiency in insomniac subjects over 50 yr old. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects who slept normally (n = 15) or exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency (n = 15) received, in randomized order, a placebo and three melatonin doses (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg) orally 30 min before bedtime for a week. Treatments were separated by 1-wk washout periods. Sleep data were obtained by polysomnography on the last three nights of each treatment period. The physiologic melatonin dose (0.3 mg) restored sleep efficiency (P < 0.0001), acting principally in the midthird of the night; it also elevated plasma melatonin levels (P < 0.0008) to normal. The pharmacologic dose (3.0 mg), like the lowest dose (0.1 mg), also improved sleep; however, it induced hypothermia and caused plasma melatonin to remain elevated into the daylight hours. Although control subjects, like insomniacs, had low melatonin levels, their sleep was unaffected by any melatonin dose.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^111F9VmE]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients aged 65 years and over with primary insomnia are likely to have a good response to melatonin therapy and the response will increase and be sustained over a period of 6 months. Further studies of the age cut-off for response are warranted. A low melatonin excretion level, regardless of age, is not useful in predicting response to PRM in insomnia and this is probably due to wide variation among individuals. Thus, clinicians do not require melatonin measurements prior to treatment. There were no rebound or withdrawal effects upon the discontinuation of PRM following long-term use.

The safety and efficacy profile of PR melatonin, as demonstrated in this study, supports its continuous use for 6 months in the treatment of primary insomnia in the target population.

### Ramelteon… [^115R7xMr]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How safe and effective are melatonin receptor agonists for treating insomnia in older adults. Evidence-Based Answer Melatonin preparations reduce sleep-onset latency, increase total sleep time, and slightly improve sleep efficiency. Prolonged-release melatonin reduces sleep-onset latency in older adults and has rates of adverse effects similar to those of placebo. Overall, melatonin treatment reduced sleep-onset latency, increased total sleep time, and improved sleep efficiency compared with placebo. Melatonin reduced sleep-onset latency at three weeks and at 26 weeks compared with placebo.

Adverse effects that were presumed to be drug related occurred in 6. 1% of patients taking melatonin and
5. 3% of those taking placebo. In the second study, researchers randomized 354 patients 55 to 80 years of age with primary insomnia to prolonged-release melatonin or placebo for three weeks. 3 The primary outcome was a favorable response, defined as a 10% improvement on both the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire "quality of sleep" and "behavior following wakefulness" scales. Treatment with melatonin doubled the odds of a favorable response and reduced sleep-onset latency. 4 Prolonged-release melatonin improved sleep quality and morning alertness on the Leeds questionnaire compared with placebo. In a two-week posttreatment washout period, no withdrawal effects occurred.

### Melatonin effective for some sleep disorders… [^117BAMhK]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is melatonin effective for insomnia and other sleep problems. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Meta-analysis Synopsis: The authors of this systematic review evaluated the role of melatonin in the treatment of various sleep problems in a variety of patients. The authors performed a thorough search of the literature, although they limited the research to English-language publications. Potential research was screened by two independent reviewers and data were abstracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by another. Controlled clinical trials were included and all studies were reviewed for quality using the established Jadad criteria. In patients with normal sleep patterns, melatonin had a clinically insignificant effect on the time to sleep onset or on the amount of time actually spent asleep. Melatonin in doses of 1 to 3 mg caused an average delay of 12.

7 minutes in the onset of rapid eye movement compared with placebo. In patients with simple insomnia, melatonin helped adults fall asleep an average of 10. 7 minutes faster. Children had a better response, falling asleep an average of 17 minutes sooner. Melatonin was particularly effective in patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome, a condition in which a person's circadian rhythm is misaligned without an external cause such as jet lag or shift work. In patients with jet lag, melatonin did not decrease sleep onset latency or increase sleep efficiency, sleep quality, or the time spent in REM sleep, although it was effective in increasing the total sleep time. In one study, melatonin had an effect similar to zolpidem in patients with jet lag. Melatonin was not effective in patients with a secondary sleep disorder. Bottom Line: Melatonin in doses from 0.

1 to 10 mg is effective in helping adults and children who have difficulty falling asleep. It is particularly helpful in patients whose circadian rhythm is permanently disrupted. Melatonin increases sleep length, but not sleep quality, in patients who perform shift work or who have jet lag.

### Comparative effects of pharmacological interventions for the acute and long-term management of insomnia disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114XvfUB]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Behavioural, cognitive, and pharmacological interventions can all be effective for insomnia. However, because of inadequate resources, medications are more frequently used worldwide. We aimed to estimate the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for the acute and long-term treatment of adults with insomnia disorder.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and websites of regulatory agencies from database inception to Nov 25, 2021, to identify published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We included studies comparing pharmacological treatments or placebo as monotherapy for the treatment of adults (≥ 18 year) with insomnia disorder. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (ie, quality of sleep measured by any self-rated scale), treatment discontinuation for any reason and due to side-effects specifically, and safety (ie, number of patients with at least one adverse event) both for acute and long-term treatment. We estimated summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with Open Science Framework, https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF. IO/PU4QJ.

Findings

We included 170 trials (36 interventions and 47950 participants) in the systematic review and 154 double-blind, randomised controlled trials (30 interventions and 44089 participants) were eligible for the network meta-analysis. In terms of acute treatment, benzodiazepines, doxylamine, eszopiclone, lemborexant, seltorexant, zolpidem, and zopiclone were more efficacious than placebo (SMD range: 0.36–0.83 [CINeMA estimates of certainty: high to moderate]). Benzodiazepines, eszopiclone, zolpidem, and zopiclone were more efficacious than melatonin, ramelteon, and zaleplon (SMD 0.27–0.71 [moderate to very low]). Intermediate-acting benzodiazepines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and eszopiclone had fewer discontinuations due to any cause than ramelteon (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.52–0.99; moderate], 0.70 [0.51–0.95; moderate] and 0.71 [0.52–0.98; moderate], respectively). Zopiclone and zolpidem caused more dropouts due to adverse events than did placebo (zopiclone: OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.28–3.13; very low]; zolpidem: 1.79 [1.25–2.50; moderate]); and zopiclone caused more dropouts than did eszopiclone (OR 1.82 [95% CI 1.01–3.33; low]), daridorexant (3.45 [1.41–8.33; low), and suvorexant (3.13 [1.47–6.67; low]). For the number of individuals with side-effects at study endpoint, benzodiazepines, eszopiclone, zolpidem, and zopiclone were worse than placebo, doxepin, seltorexant, and zaleplon (OR range 1.27–2.78 [high to very low]). For long-term treatment, eszopiclone and lemborexant were more effective than placebo (eszopiclone: SMD 0.63 [95% CI 0.36–0.90; very low]; lemborexant: 0.41 [0.04–0.78; very low]) and eszopiclone was more effective than ramelteon (0.63 [0.16–1.10; very low]) and zolpidem (0.60 [0.00–1.20; very low]). Compared with ramelteon, eszopiclone and zolpidem had a lower rate of all-cause discontinuations (eszopiclone: OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.20–0.93; very low]; zolpidem: 0.43 [0.19–0.95; very low]); however, zolpidem was associated with a higher number of dropouts due to side-effects than placebo (OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.11–3.70; very low]).

Interpretation

Overall, eszopiclone and lemborexant had a favorable profile, but eszopiclone might cause substantial adverse events and safety data on lemborexant were inconclusive. Doxepin, seltorexant, and zaleplon were well tolerated, but data on efficacy and other important outcomes were scarce and do not allow firm conclusions. Many licensed drugs (including benzodiazepines, daridorexant, suvorexant, and trazodone) can be effective in the acute treatment of insomnia but are associated with poor tolerability, or information about long-term effects is not available. Melatonin, ramelteon, and non-licensed drugs did not show overall material benefits. These results should serve evidence-based clinical practice.

### Melatonin for primary insomnia? [^111xjw6R]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, has a key role in regulating circadian rhythms, most importantly, the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin's action has led to its being tried as a treatment for a wide range of sleep disorders, such as jet lag, primary insomnia, sleep-wake cycle disruption and sleep problems in children with neuro-developmental disorders. Until recently, it had not been licensed in the UK for any indication. Prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin - Lundbeck) has now been licensed as a treatment for primary insomnia. Here we consider whether this product has a place in the management of people with this condition.

### Targeting sleep and the circadian system as a novel treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease [^112TjkPw]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Targeting melatonin dysregulation

The effects of supplemental melatonin on sleep behavior in PD have been tested in several studies with mixed results, potentially due to the varying dopaminergic treatment of study participants impacting on melatonin amplitude. A recent meta-analysis and systematic review of 7 studies concluded that melatonin significantly improved objective (total sleep time as assessed with polysomnography) and subjective sleep quality (assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire). However, supplemental melatonin is not effective in decreasing excessive daytime sleepiness and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), two commonly experienced sleep disturbances in PD. An evidence-based review on the treatment of non-motor symptoms in PD concluded that although there is insufficient evidence for melatonin to be beneficial for treatment of insomnia, it is regarded as "possibly useful".

Exercise- and fasting-directed chronotherapy approaches

Prescribed exercise is another circadian-based strategy that has been developed to restore circadian function. Whilst proof-of-concept studies were originally developed in rodent models, they have since been translated into the PD population showing both improvements in objective and subjective sleep measurements.

Intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to be protective against nigral dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neuronal injury in mice and neuronal excitotoxicity in rats and mice. A 6-month study of caloric restriction in a primate PD model led to better locomotor activity with higher striatal dopamine levels relative to ad libitum-fed controls. Similarly, Griffioen and colleagues showed that IF led to a decreased burden of alpha-synuclein in the brainstem that contributes to autonomic dysfunction commonly seen in PD.

The circadian clock intimately interacts with nutrient-sensing pathways, allowing feeding-fasting rhythms to enhance the robustness of the oscillation of circadian activator and repressor components that bind to the transcriptional regulatory regions of thousands of genes, which in turn generate rhythms in metabolism, cell division and repair, and growth. Accordingly, fasting-associated interventions may be targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and its downstream consequences rather than acting as a nutritional supplement, as it likely targets several physiological pathways. Thus fasting-associated interventions would appear feasible, effective, and inexpensive circadian-based treatments that are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical settings.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^1178NcfC]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

There is evidence of improvements of additional sleep and daytime parameters with PRM. Global PSQI scores were improved in PRM patients aged 65 and older, in both the short and long term. Notably, in this trial, patients with poor quality of sleep alone were not entered; patients had also to have some difficulty in falling asleep to be included. It is therefore not surprising that in the short term, these overall effects may mainly be driven by reductions in sleep latency (component 2). In the long term, however, there was evidence of treatment benefits with respect to both sleep latency and sleep quality (component 1). There was also evidence of a delayed effect of PRM treatment in improve morning alertness (as measured by the diary) over the 6-month treatment period. Improvement in sleep quality and morning alertness were consistently found in clinical trials with PRM but not in studies with immediate release melatonin formulations or the MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon. Such improvements were also difficult to demonstrate with other insomnia drugs. Furthermore, the benefit of PRM in the patients' overall clinical status (as measured by the CGI-I scores) improved after long-term treatment, in patients aged 65–80 years.

### Improving insomnia with melatonin, magnesium, and zinc… [^114LUYVD]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Background: Insomnia affects up to 50 percent of older adults, and has been correlated with morbidity and mortality in this population, as well as poorer quality of life. Melatonin supplementation may improve total sleep time because of its effect on regulating the sleep-wake cycle. This may be particularly useful in older patients, because of an age-related decline in melatonin production and because melatonin levels are lower in adults with insomnia than in those who report getting good sleep. Other micronutrients such as zinc and magnesium may also play a role in facilitating sleep because they are important in the endogenous synthesis of melatonin. Rondanelli and colleagues conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether melatonin, magnesium, and zinc would improve symptoms of insomnia among older adults living in a long-term care facility.

Patients were randomized to treatment with placebo or a combination of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc administered one hour before bedtime daily for eight weeks. The primary outcome was sleep quality as defined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which was measured at baseline and again at the end of the study. Secondary outcomes were changes in sleep quality and daily activity according to other questionnaires, including the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Results: The treatment group reported more significantly improved sleep quality. Significantly more patients in the treatment group had a final PSQI score of 5 or less, a cutoff that is 89. 6 percent sensitive and
86. 5 percent specific in differentiating good sleepers from poor sleepers.

The treatment group also had significantly better scores in all four components of the LSEQ, including getting to sleep, sleep quality, hangover on awakening from sleep, and alertness the following morning. No differences were noted in daytime sleepiness between groups. Conclusion: Sleep quality was significantly improved among older adults living in a long-term care facility who received a nightly dose of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc, as was morning alertness. The authors suggest that this may also be a helpful sleep aid for the general older population.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^1178mumb]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Endogenous melatonin levels decrease with age, presumably due to an age-related decline in SCN circadian rhythmic functions or the calcification of the pineal gland. Since endogenous melatonin has beneficial effects on sleep in man and helps stabilize the physiological circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle in humans, decline in melatonin levels may contribute to the common complaint of poor sleep quality seen amongst the elderly. This raised the possibility of improving sleep in elderly patients with insomnia by appropriately timed treatment with melatonin.

Early studies have shown an improvement of sleep in elderly insomnia patients by prescribing very high doses of melatonin. Later studies, mostly done with lower doses of immediate release melatonin preparations and in younger people suggested a limited efficacy in primary insomnia with short-term use (4 weeks or less).

Prolonged-release melatonin (PRM 2 mg), a formulation that releases melatonin gradually in the gut when administered orally in order to introduce melatonin into the circulation over the following 8–10 h, has proven efficacious and safe for the short-term treatment (3 weeks) of adults aged 55 years and older who have primary insomnia. It has been licensed since June 2007 in Europe and in other countries for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia characterized by poor quality of sleep in patients who are aged 55 years or above. Some young patients also may have low melatonin levels and the important clinical question is whether the population most likely to respond is defined by age or by low melatonin levels. Another important issue with the use of melatonin in clinical practice, considering the chronic nature of insomnia at older age, is whether long-term use is justified and safe.

This study was therefore designed to elucidate whether PRM efficacy is related to low endogenous melatonin levels or age, which is associated with declining melatonin production. The maintenance of efficacy and the safety of PRM beyond the acute treatment were also investigated.

In healthy adults, the nocturnal melatonin production rate is normally 10 to 80 μg/night and urinary excretion of the main melatonin metabolite, 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) is 8 to 56 μg/night but with wide variability. Thus, low endogenous melatonin in adults was defined as urinary excretion of the major melatonin metabolite of < 8 μg 6-SMT per night.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^116QzFE2]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, we found evidence of low certainty showing a moderate clinical effect of melatonin on sleep continuity parameters, without it translating into an impact on daily functioning and quality of sleep, in patients presenting with chronic insomnia primarily due to underlying medical conditions. It remains to be investigated whether melatonin may provide a differential magnitude of effect and adverse event profile across different disorders. The long-term consequences still need further assessment. Based on a combined assessment, we provide a conditional recommendation for use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 2–20 years, who despite optimisation of sleep hygiene practices, continue to present with difficulties in daily functioning, due to chronic insomnia attributed to an underlying disorder. The off-label use of melatonin for these patients should never be first choice of treatment, but may be considered by a medical specialist with knowledge of the underlying disorder, if non-pharmacological interventions have proven to be inadequate.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^112Z8ger]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia is a common disorder, the diagnosis of which is based on a patient's complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or sleep that is of inadequate quality (non-restorative sleep). The sleep disturbance should have been present for at least 1 month and be associated with a negative impact on functioning the following day. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the USA. About one-third of the adult population has experienced insomnia at some time and approximately 10% have a persistent problem.

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is the major hormone produced nocturnally by the pineal gland in a process driven by the biological clock residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Melatonin is a sleep regulator and signal of darkness in humans. Thus, the circadian rhythm in the synthesis and secretion of melatonin is closely associated with the sleep rhythm in both sighted and blind subjects. Melatonin promotes sleep in humans, presumably by inhibiting circadian wakefulness mechanisms and affects the activity of brain networks compatible with sleep induction. Exogenous melatonin has clock-shifting effects and may advance or delay the sleep phase depending on the time of administration according to the Phase-Response Curve.

### Efficacy of melatonin for sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: a randomised controlled trial [^113aJhHC]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In the current study, melatonin had a moderate effect size for improving sleep quality (d = 0.46). This magnitude of improvement in sleep quality is double that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) relative to no treatment, when administered to patients with TBI over the same time period (d = 0.21). As melatonin was well tolerated in the current study, with no serious adverse events reported, melatonin offers clinicians an alternative treatment to that of conventional sleeping medications.

While melatonin was found to be effective in alleviating sleep disturbances, it is acknowledged that the mechanisms underpinning sleep disturbances in TBI involve multiple biological and psychological systems, such as alterations in monoaminergic neurons and wake-promoting hypocretin-1 neurons, and alterations in melatonin levels, as well as pain and mood disturbance. This suggests that while melatonin supplementation may alleviate sleep disturbance in individuals with TBI, melatonin is unlikely to address all sleep problems. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown efficacious in TBI populations. Due to the multi-factorial nature of sleep disturbances following TBI, complementing melatonin supplementation with CBT-I may prove beneficial.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^116FePMz]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Melatonin is extensively used in the USA in a non-regulated manner for sleep disorders. Prolonged release melatonin (PRM) is licensed in Europe and other countries for the short term treatment of primary insomnia in patients aged 55 years and over. However, a clear definition of the target patient population and well-controlled studies of long-term efficacy and safety are lacking. It is known that melatonin production declines with age. Some young insomnia patients also may have low melatonin levels. The study investigated whether older age or low melatonin excretion is a better predictor of response to PRM, whether the efficacy observed in short-term studies is sustained during continued treatment and the long term safety of such treatment.

Methods

Adult outpatients (791, aged 18–80 years) with primary insomnia, were treated with placebo (2 weeks) and then randomized, double-blind to 3 weeks with PRM or placebo nightly. PRM patients continued whereas placebo completers were re-randomized 1:1 to PRM or placebo for 26 weeks with 2 weeks of single-blind placebo run-out. Main outcome measures were sleep latency derived from a sleep diary, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Quality of Life (World Health Organzaton-5) Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) and adverse effects and vital signs recorded at each visit.

Results

On the primary efficacy variable, sleep latency, the effects of PRM (3 weeks) in patients with low endogenous melatonin (6-sulphatoxymelatonin [6-SMT] ≤ 8 μg/night) regardless of age did not differ from the placebo, whereas PRM significantly reduced sleep latency compared to the placebo in elderly patients regardless of melatonin levels (-19.1 versus -1.7 min; P = 0.002). The effects on sleep latency and additional sleep and daytime parameters that improved with PRM were maintained or enhanced over the 6-month period with no signs of tolerance. Most adverse events were mild in severity with no clinically relevant differences between PRM and placebo for any safety outcome.

Conclusions

The results demonstrate short- and long-term efficacy and safety of PRM in elderly insomnia patients. Low melatonin production regardless of age is not useful in predicting responses to melatonin therapy in insomnia. The age cut-off for response warrants further investigation.

### The efficacy of melatonin and melatonin agonists in insomnia-an umbrella review [^114UVUso]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted an umbrella review to summarize all available systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the efficacy of melatonin and melatonin agonists in primary and comorbid insomnia disorders. Two independent reviewers conducted a search of Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, PROSPERO and grey literature from inception to July 2018. Methodological quality was assessed using the revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews Instrument. Eighteen studies were found, with methodological quality ranging from Moderate to Critically Low. Of the twelve papers evaluating melatonin, there is statistically significant improvement in sleep latency and total sleep time, with a lack of consensus on whether these are clinically meaningful. Similar results are observed across the three reviews on ramelteon. The evidence for other melatonin agonists is sparse. We conclude that existing evidence is limited by disparate methodological quality of the papers, as well as a lack of consensus regarding the type, definition and interpretation of outcome measures in the evaluation of efficacy for insomnia.

### Medications for insomnia treatment in children… [^112y4tzf]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are there safe and effective medications for the treatment of insomnia in children. Evidence-Based Answer Melatonin may be effective for treating insomnia in healthy children and in those with physical or learning disabilities. Short-term use of melatonin is safe in children, but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate its long-term effects and optimal dosage. Diphenhydramine is no more effective than placebo. The safety and effectiveness of benzodiazepines and newer hypnotic agents in children with insomnia have not been studied. Several researchers have studied the effectiveness of melatonin in healthy children. These studies had small numbers of participants and varied in the measurements used to assess improvements in sleep.

One four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 38 healthy children six to 12 years of age found that 5 mg of melatonin taken at 6 p. m. improved sleep onset compared with placebo and total sleep time. Lights-off time was 34 minutes earlier in the melatonin group versus eight minutes earlier in the placebo group. No significant differences were seen in sleep latency or wake-up time. 2 Another four-week randomized controlled trial of 62 Dutch children six to 12 years of age showed that 5 mg of melatonin at 7 p. m. advanced sleep onset by 57 minutes, advanced wake-up time by nine minutes, and decreased sleep latency by 17 minutes compared with placebo.
3. 4; however, there were no significant effects on daytime drowsiness scores or sleep fragmentation scores.

Another RCT of 27 children six to 14 years of age with stimulant-treated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who had not responded to sleep hygiene intervention showed that 5 mg of melatonin administered 20 minutes before bedtime over 30 days significantly improved sleep latency, decreasing it from 62. 1 minutes with placebo to
46. 4 minutes with melatonin.
5. Recommendations from Others The American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Sleep Foundation recognize that there are inadequate data to guide pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in children. 8.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116h4D8y]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — adverse events and patient preference considerations explains that beyond the quality of evidence for or against use of a given drug for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, the task force also considered the relative benefit:harm ratio and the likelihood that an informed patient would use a specific agent, and that assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events often rely on spontaneous reporting by research participants with frequencies so low that reported studies are underpowered to find a difference from placebo. It adds that this implies the effect size for a TEAE would be very small and that it is unlikely the clinical significance of TEAEs has been underestimated, but some TEAEs are very infrequent yet very serious when they occur (for example, sleep-related behaviors with BzRA), clinical trials are likely to underestimate such risks due to the limited number of patients and limited duration of treatment, and as a result assessment of potential harms is largely derived from clinical experience and theoretical considerations rather than well-documented evidence; additionally, the task force judged likelihood of patient use and in most cases these judgments were in agreement with recommendations, while in certain cases (e.g., melatonin) informed patients may be likely to use a specific drug even when data do not clearly support a recommendation for use.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^116Ypnw4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Melatonin has become a widely used sleeping aid for young individuals currently not included in existing guidelines. The aim was to develop a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 2–20 years, with chronic insomnia due to disorders beyond indication.

Methods

We performed a systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomised trials (RCTs) in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A separate search for adverse events was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 17, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (2–20 years of age) with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. Studies exclusively on autism spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactive disorder were excluded. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events, assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, non-serious adverse events, and all-cause dropouts (assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment), plus quality of sleep and daytime functioning (assessed at 3–6 months post-treatment). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse variance random effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using I 2 statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. A multidisciplinary guideline panel constructed the recommendation using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation and its impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

Findings

We identified 13 RCTs, including 403 patients with a wide range of conditions. Melatonin reduced sleep latency by 14.88 min (95% CI 23.42–6.34, 9 studies, I² = 60%) and increased total sleep time by 18.97 min (95% CI 0.37–37.57, 10 studies, I² = 57%). The funnel plot for total sleep time showed no apparent indication of publication bias. No other clinical benefits were found. The number of patients experiencing adverse events was not statistically increased however, safety data was scarce. Certainty of evidence was low.

Interpretation

Low certainty evidence supports a moderate effect of melatonin in treating sleep continuity parameters in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia due to primarily medical disorders beyond indication. The off-label use of melatonin for these patients should never be the first choice of treatment, but may be considered by medical specialists with knowledge of the underlying disorder and if non-pharmacological interventions are inadequate. If treatment with melatonin is initiated, adequate follow-up to evaluate treatment effect and adverse events is essential.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^115vQAE4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We recommend that melatonin may be used for a short period of time to treat idiopathic chronic insomnia in children and adolescents (5–20 years), yet with the prerequisite that sleep-hygiene practices and non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and other measures, have proven inadequate, and only in cases where daytime functioning is compromised. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical, evidence-based recommendation on the topic.

Our body of evidence consists of eight RCTs investigating the effect of melatonin in 419 participants, aged 6–19 years, diagnosed with idiopathic chronic sleep onset insomnia. For these individuals, melatonin led to a moderate increase in total sleep time with 30 min and a moderate decrease in sleep latency with approximately 18 min, in both cases when assessed using sleep diaries. These results are however based on few studies with small sample sizes and rely on estimates provided by the parents or the participants themselves, and thus the data bears a considerable level of uncertainty. One study with few patients (n = 54) reported that melatonin may increase wakening after sleep onset, however further studies on this matter are needed. We found no other clinical–or statistical effect of melatonin on the remaining outcomes. Thus, it seems that the effect of melatonin is restricted to a moderate improvement in sleep continuity parameters, without this translating into a positive effect on personal perceived outcomes such as quality of sleep and daytime functioning. If treatment with melatonin is considered, these limited benefits, including what may be considered realistic magnitudes of effect, are important when consulting the parents and young individuals. Due to the lack of data, it was not possible to investigate the impact of dosage, timing of administration or release formula. The decision on these variables continues to rely on expert-opinions and consensus reports, until further studies have been conducted. None of the included studies provided information on whether any serious adverse events were found when melatonin was used in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia. Yet, others have shown that melatonin, in general, is not associated with serious adverse events when assessed across a wider population. Treatment with melatonin however increased the number of participants experiencing non-serious adverse events, which included a range of unwanted events such as headache, nausea, red eyes, drowsiness, change in mood and cognition and gastrointestinal problems. The certainty of evidence for non-serious adverse events was downgraded to moderate due to a wide confidence interval, indicating some level of uncertainty regarding the extent to which melatonin leads to non-serious adverse events. The current evidence on safety has several limitations. Only half of the identified studies reported on adverse events, and of these, the systematic assessment of adverse events in all cases relied on spontaneous reporting either by the parents or the participant. None of the studies provided an extensive list of all the adverse events that occurred during the trial period. Despite an increase in unwanted events, melatonin did not impact all-cause dropouts, indicating that treatment is tolerable. We were able to identify 14 existing systematic reviews that came close to our subject, yet without them being a complete match. Nevertheless, there was a considerable overlap of the included primary studies across the existing reviews, and thus not surprisingly, reviews tended to report on the same effects, as also found here. To go beyond what has already been identified and published, there is a need for new, larger randomised studies, which apart from evaluating efficacy beyond 4–5 weeks of treatment also should include a systematic safety assessment. The guideline panel agrees that optimisation of sleep hygiene practices constitutes the first choice of treatment for children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia, alongside trying non-pharmacological interventions. The feasibility of implementing our recommendation may, however, be affected by especially the access to counselling in sleep hygiene practices and non-pharmacological measures. Here, it is worth mentioning, that only five out of eight studies had tested sleep hygiene practices prior to initiating treatment with melatonin, despite it being simple and straightforward to perform. The importance of optimising bed-time behaviour and routines to improve sleep in young individuals should not be underestimated. A recent meta-analysis showed that interventions simply focusing on earlier bedtimes, may increase sleep duration by 47 min in healthy children. The equity may also be affected by our recommendation, due to the price of the melatonin products available for prescription. The issues of high costs may favour the use of self-bought products, which has been reported in Sweden. The use of melatonin products not prescribed by a physician should be discouraged, as studies have found that the content may vary significantly from what is being advertised, with some products having serotonin content at potential clinically important levels.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation appears to have modest benefit for improving ADHD symptoms. Melatonin appears to be effective in treating chronic insomnia in children with ADHD but appears to have minimal effects in reducing core ADHD symptoms. Many other natural supplements are widely used in the United States despite minimal evidence of efficacy and possible side effects. This review synthesizes and evaluates the scientific evidence regarding the potential efficacy and side effects of natural supplements and herbal remedies for ADHD. We provide clinicians with recommendations regarding their potential use and role in overall ADHD treatment.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1127ngmr]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that the pathophysiology of long COVID and its impact on sleep is not fully understood, the development of targeted treatments remains uncertain. Currently, there is no standardized protocol specifically addressing long COVID–associated sleep disturbances, though interventions involving nonpharmacological approaches are increasingly explored due to their generally lower risks and side effects. Guezguez et alsuggest that recommendations endorsed by the European Academy for managing sleep problems during the pandemic can be extended to patients with long COVID. This includes cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, sleep hygiene improvement, and relaxation therapies. On the pharmacological side, National Center for Infectious Diseases physicians manage symptoms through the use of melatoninand antidepressants. However, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against the use of melatonin and trazodone for the treatment of chronic insomnia, citing insufficient evidence of efficacy. The application of these agents in long COVID may reflect off-label use driven by clinical need, although further research is warranted. This divergence reflects a broader lack of consensus on managing of long COVID–associated sleep disturbances, underscoring the need for high-quality studies to inform standardized care and determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of various interventions for sleep disturbances in long COVID.

This research aims to compile and evaluate current evidence on the interventions for sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID, through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. By assessing effectiveness, it seeks to identify promising interventions and pinpoint areas requiring further research, aiming to enhance clinical decision-making and care quality for affected individuals.

### Efficacy of melatonin for sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: a randomised controlled trial [^113xghuN]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of melatonin in alleviating sleep disturbance in patients with TBI and insomnia. We found that melatonin improved subjective sleep quality and actigraphic sleep efficiency. Melatonin also reduced self-reported anxiety symptomatology and fatigue, whilst improving self-perceived vitality and mental functioning as assessed by the SF-36 v1 health survey. No improvement was observed for daytime sleepiness, depressive symptomatology or the six remaining SF-36 v1 domains. The present results, therefore, suggest that melatonin may be useful in treating sleep disturbances in patients with TBI.

Our study is limited by the following factors. Firstly, the sample recruited was smaller than intended. Due to the poor recruitment of stroke patients, we cannot determine whether melatonin can improve sleep following a stroke. Secondly, we did not determine endogenous melatonin concentrations and circadian phase in all participants. In a subset of TBI participants (n = 9), we demonstrated a 42% reduction in overnight salivary melatonin production (d = 0.87; p = .034) and delayed circadian phase (d = 1.23; p = .003) relative to age and-gender matched controls with similar sleep schedules. As melatonin concentrations and phase were not captured, we are unable to determine the extent to which changes in sleep quality were mitigated by alterations in circadian phase. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of melatonin supplementation in TBI regardless of melatonin production and circadian phase, given that such information is not measured in the clinical setting. The current study was designed to exploit the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin, which have been previously characterised, utilising a prolonged-release preparation that mimics the endogenous profile and targets sleep maintenance problems. Therefore, timing of treatment was selected to harness the sleep prompting effects, with time of administration consistent with directions for use as indicated by the manufacturer. Although additional information regarding endogenous melatonin profiles would have been useful, melatonin supplementation was found to be therapeutic. Phenotyping circadian phase (e.g. dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)) would be an important step for future studies by informing the treatment approach by targeting underlying circadian misalignment for maximal benefit. Furthermore, recent discussions regarding the therapeutic outcomes between short-acting vs. long-acting melatonin preparations suggest comparative studies are needed for evidence-based recommendations.

### Melatonin for blood pressure control in adults [^113mko4H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows: Critical objective To assess the effects of oral melatonin supplementation (immediate‑release (IR) and controlled‑/sustained‑release CR/SR; any dose; ≥ 1 week) versus placebo or no treatment on change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) in adults. Important objectives To examine dose‑response relationships between melatonin dose and changes in SBP and DBP. To assess effects by key participant and intervention characteristics (prespecified subgroups): baseline blood pressure status; concomitant antihypertensive medication use; presence of diagnosed sleep disorder/insomnia; melatonin formulation (IR versus CR/SR); blood pressure measurement method (office versus ambulatory versus home; daytime versus nocturnal); age (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years); sex. To evaluate adverse events (serious and non‑serious) and select patient‑important outcomes (quality of life, sleep quality). To describe any reported longer‑term cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. incident cardiovascular disease events, mortality) when sufficient data are available. These analyses are exploratory given anticipated sparse data.

### Effectiveness of melatonin treatment for sleep disturbance in orthopaedic trauma patients: a prospective, randomized control trial [^111zpdV4]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Explore sleep disturbance in postoperative orthopedic trauma patients and determine the impact of melatonin supplementation on postoperative sleep, pain, and quality of life.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective, randomized controlled trial at a Level I trauma center, 84 adult orthopedic trauma patients with operative fracture management were randomized 2-weeks postoperatively to either the melatonin or placebo group. Patients randomized to the melatonin group (42 subjects, mean age 41.8 ± 15.5 years) received 5 mg melatonin supplements. Patients in the placebo group (42 subjects, mean age 41.3 ± 14.0 years) received identical glucose tablets. Both groups were instructed to take the tablets 30 minutes before bed for 4 weeks and received sleep hygiene education and access to the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) Coach app.

Main Outcome Measures

Our primary outcome was sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes were pain measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), quality of life measured by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and opioid use.

Results

Patients in both groups had significant sleep disturbance (PSQI ≥ 5) at 2-weeks (83%) and 6-weeks (67%) postoperatively. PSQI improved by 3.3 points (p < 0.001) at follow-up, but there was no significant difference between groups (melatonin PSQI = 5.6, placebo PSQI = 6.1, P = 0.615). Compared to placebo, melatonin did not affect VAS, SF-36, or opioid use significantly.

Conclusion

Sleep disturbance is prevalent in orthopedic trauma patients. Melatonin treatment did not significantly improve subjective sleep quality, pain, quality of life or opioid use.
