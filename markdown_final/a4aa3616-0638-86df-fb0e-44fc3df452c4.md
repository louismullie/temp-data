## Question

List them medications for treatment of gout

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a list of medications for the treatment of gout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phases of gout and the distinct treatment goals. Then, I should verify first-line therapies for acute flares and their comparative evidence. Next, I will review urate-lowering therapy options, dosing principles, and treat-to-target strategy. After that, I need to check prophylaxis during ULT initiation and special populations, especially CKD. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, categorized medication list with key safety pearls and reconcile any guideline differences, ensuring I anchor each point to high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework so I don't miss anything important. Gout management spans two main phases: treating acute flares and preventing future flares via long-term urate-lowering therapy, with a third, often overlooked, element of flare prophylaxis when starting ULT. I should also remember that asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication for pharmacologic ULT, which I need to explicitly state to avoid overtreatment [^fa894f3f] [^c2dd3093].

> Now, for acute flares, I need to verify first-line options and their relative standing. The ACR 2020 guideline strongly recommends colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids as first-line therapy for gout flares, and when colchicine is chosen, low-dose regimens are preferred over high-dose due to similar efficacy with fewer adverse effects. This is supported by randomized trials and Cochrane reviews showing low-dose colchicine improves pain versus placebo with a more favorable GI tolerability profile than high-dose regimens [^44adb76c] [^4f70a8a2] [^5138ace2].

> Wait, let me verify the NSAID evidence and whether COX-2 inhibitors differ meaningfully. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors have similar analgesic efficacy for acute gout, but nonselective NSAIDs have higher rates of adverse events and withdrawals, whereas glucocorticoids achieve comparable pain relief to NSAIDs with different safety trade-offs. This aligns with ACR's stance that agent selection should be individualized to comorbidities and tolerability [^560eed0d] [^413976cd] [^44adb76c].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of IL-1 blockade in acute flares. ACR 2020 conditionally recommends IL-1 inhibitors when first-line anti-inflammatories are contraindicated or not tolerated, reflecting their mechanism at the NLRP3 inflammasome and evidence that canakinumab reduces recurrent flares in selected patients. I need to ensure I note infection risk and that IL-1 agents are not first-line for routine flares [^d564c1b6] [^3d0ffebe] [^a1a71167].

> Next, I will examine urate-lowering therapy and the treat-to-target paradigm. I should confirm that ACR 2020 strongly recommends initiating ULT for patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage, or frequent flares, and that allopurinol is the preferred first-line agent for all patients, including those with CKD stage ≥ 3, with dosing started low and titrated every 2–5 weeks to achieve and maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL. This is reinforced by EULAR's treat-to-target recommendation to maintain SU < 6 mg/dL lifelong, with a lower target of < 5 mg/dL in severe disease [^a3f9b726] [^6239eda6] [^ea2706e3] [^d44e3f77] [^839e9040].

> Let me think about dosing specifics for allopurinol so I don't overgeneralize. ACR advises starting allopurinol ≤ 100 mg/day, and even lower in CKD, then increasing by 100 mg increments about every 2–4 weeks toward a typical effective range of 100–800 mg/day, with the maximum FDA-labeled dose of 800 mg/day acceptable when needed. I should double-check that this applies even in CKD, where the risk relates more to starting dose than to the final dose, which is supported by pharmacologic and guideline data [^9565e93d] [^287dee90] [^189a75ce].

> I will now examine alternatives when allopurinol is not suitable. Febuxostat is a nonpurine xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is noninferior to allopurinol for preventing flares and achieves target urate more readily at 80 mg/day, but ACR recommends it as an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated or contraindicated, particularly given cardiovascular safety concerns in some patients. I should confirm that ACR advises switching away from febuxostat after a new CV event when feasible [^eb86b515] [^6575affc] [^af44b55a].

> But wait, what about uricosurics and when they fit. Probenecid is a uricosuric option, historically favored as first-line uricosuric in older ACR guidance, though contemporary ACR 2020 places it behind allopurinol and febuxostat and advises against its use in moderate-to-severe CKD or nephrolithiasis. I should also note that ACR 2020 conditionally recommends against checking urinary uric acid or alkalinizing urine for uricosuric therapy, reflecting limited benefit evidence [^0413f02c] [^349f1f91] [^9565e93d].

> Let me consider refractory disease and biologics. Pegloticase, a pegylated uricase, is reserved for severe, refractory, tophaceous gout or when oral ULTs are contraindicated or ineffective, with rapid urate lowering but infusion reactions and antibody development risks. I should confirm that ACR recommends against pegloticase as first-line ULT, reserving it for appropriate refractory cases [^c87d10a9] [^9565e93d].

> Next, I should review prophylaxis during ULT initiation, because flares commonly occur in the first months. ACR 2020 strongly recommends concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months when starting or uptitrating ULT, with colchicine 0.5–1 mg/day as a common choice, NSAIDs as an alternative if not contraindicated, and prednisone/prednisolone as another option. I need to ensure I note dose adjustments in CKD and drug–drug interactions with colchicine, especially with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors [^6239eda6] [^2f3fbfbd] [^947be412].

> I should double-check special populations, particularly CKD, where choices and dosing matter. In CKD, allopurinol remains first-line with low starting doses and cautious titration, colchicine should be dose-reduced or avoided depending on eGFR, NSAIDs are generally avoided in advanced CKD, and glucocorticoids are often preferred for flares. G-CAN highlights evidence gaps and proposes research priorities, underscoring the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment in this group [^9565e93d] [^87471a25] [^367705b1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to start ULT after a first flare. ACR 2020 expands indications beyond frequent flares to include tophi or radiographic damage and conditionally supports ULT after a first flare with marked hyperuricemia, whereas ACP 2017 recommends against routine ULT after a first attack or in infrequent flares. I should clearly present this discordance and emphasize shared decision-making and patient-specific risk factors [^c9b7306e] [^3f84f809] [^af19a095].

> Let me synthesize the medication list succinctly while preserving the key distinctions. For acute flares: colchicine (prefer low-dose), NSAIDs including COX-2 inhibitors, and glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) are first-line, with IL-1 inhibitors reserved for contraindications to standard therapy. For chronic urate lowering: allopurinol is preferred first-line, febuxostat is an alternative, probenecid is a uricosuric option in selected patients, and pegloticase is for refractory disease. For prophylaxis during ULT: colchicine, NSAIDs if tolerated, or prednisone/prednisolone are recommended for at least 3–6 months, with agent selection tailored to comorbidities and interactions [^44adb76c] [^a3f9b726] [^6239eda6].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've addressed practical pearls that change outcomes. Start low and go slow with allopurinol to mitigate hypersensitivity risk, monitor serum urate every 2–5 weeks during titration to a target < 6 mg/dL, and consider lower targets in severe disease. Review and adjust contributing medications like thiazides when feasible. And educate patients on early flare recognition and a medication-in-pocket strategy to enable prompt treatment, which improves adherence and outcomes [^6239eda6] [^ea2706e3] [^29230ad4] [^6575affc].

Gout treatment uses **three classes** of medications: **anti-inflammatory agents for acute flares** (NSAIDs, colchicine, glucocorticoids) [^44adb76c], **urate-lowering therapy for chronic control** (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, pegloticase) [^a3f9b726], and **prophylaxis to prevent flares during ULT initiation** (low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs) [^6239eda6]. Allopurinol is **first-line ULT** [^9565e93d] and should be titrated to a serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^b2544b44]; febuxostat is an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated or contraindicated [^6575affc]. Pegloticase is reserved for refractory disease [^c87d10a9]. Therapy should be individualized to comorbidities, especially renal and cardiovascular disease [^87471a25] [^af44b55a].

## Anti-inflammatory medications for acute gout flares

These agents provide rapid symptom relief during acute attacks; **early initiation within 24 hours** is recommended [^d6940733].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | - Ibuprofen <br/> - Naproxen <br/> - Indomethacin <br/> - COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib) | Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain | - First-line unless contraindicated <br/> - Use gastroprotection (PPIs) in high-risk patients <br/> - Caution in renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular disease [^notfound] |
| Colchicine | Colchicine | Inhibits microtubule polymerization, reducing neutrophil migration and inflammation | - Low-dose regimen preferred (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg in 1 hour) [^44adb76c] <br/> - Avoid in severe renal impairment <br/> - Monitor for GI toxicity [^2f3fbfbd] |
| Glucocorticoids | - Prednisone <br/> - Prednisolone <br/> - Methylprednisolone <br/> - Intra-articular triamcinolone | Potent anti-inflammatory via glucocorticoid receptor signaling | - Use when NSAIDs/colchicine contraindicated <br/> - Short courses (≤ 5 days) to minimize adverse effects <br/> - Intra-articular steroids for monoarticular flares [^53f529f0] |

---

## Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for chronic gout management

ULT aims to **reduce serum urate below 6 mg/dL** [^b2544b44] to dissolve crystals and prevent flares; it is indicated for frequent flares, tophi, or radiographic damage [^a3f9b726].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Xanthine oxidase inhibitors | - Allopurinol <br/> - Febuxostat | Inhibit uric acid synthesis | - Allopurinol first-line; start low (≤ 100 mg/day) and titrate every 2–5 weeks to target urate [^9565e93d] <br/> - Febuxostat alternative; monitor cardiovascular risk [^af44b55a] |
| Uricosurics | - Probenecid <br/> - Lesinurad (with allopurinol) | Increase renal uric acid excretion | - Use when xanthine oxidase inhibitors contraindicated <br/> - Avoid in renal stones or moderate-to-severe CKD [^349f1f91] |
| Uricase therapy | Pegloticase | Converts uric acid to allantoin | - Reserved for refractory, tophaceous gout <br/> - Infusion reactions and antibody development common [^c87d10a9] |

---

## Prophylactic therapy during ULT initiation

Flares are common when starting ULT; **prophylaxis for 3–6 months** is recommended [^6239eda6].

- **Colchicine**: 0.5–1 mg/day; adjust dose in renal impairment [^2f3fbfbd].
- **NSAIDs**: Low-dose regimens with gastroprotection if colchicine contraindicated [^947be412].
- **Glucocorticoids**: Low-dose prednisone if both colchicine and NSAIDs are contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel agents

Several new agents are under investigation or recently approved, including **IL-1 inhibitors** (anakinra, canakinumab) for refractory flares [^3d0ffebe] and **selective urate reabsorption inhibitors** (e.g. verinurad) in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat [^e13e99a6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Allopurinol is first-line with dose adjustment; avoid high-dose colchicine and NSAIDs in severe CKD [^9565e93d] [^87471a25].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Prefer allopurinol over febuxostat; monitor closely if febuxostat is used [^6575affc] [^af44b55a].
- **Hepatic disease**: Avoid febuxostat; prefer allopurinol or probenecid with caution [^notfound].

---

Gout management relies on **anti-inflammatories for acute flares** and **urate-lowering therapy for chronic control**, with prophylaxis during ULT initiation. Allopurinol is **first-line ULT** [^9565e93d], and therapy should be individualized to comorbidities and patient preferences [^647133e7].

Introduction

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Treatment guidelines in gout [^07985e5e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

### The challenges of approaching and managing gout [^f8aef601]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite many effective treatments for gout, its management remains a challenge internationally. Options for optimizing gout management may differ in different practice sizes and settings. Gout incidence is rising and it continues to be associated with increased mortality. Education of patients and medical providers is essential, and newer gout medications need to be used in the most appropriate ways for cost-effective therapy. Special consideration needs to be given to such populations as the elderly and those with renal and cardiovascular disease in gout management. New agents are in development, which may add to the armamentarium for gout management.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Recent pharmacological advances in the management of gout [^cd8c930c]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and reports show that despite availability of therapies, management is still suboptimal. The new EULAR 2016 recommendations for the treatment of gout highlight the huge development in gout therapies, and the number of drugs being trialled only continues to increase. A clinical review of the evidence that underlies the recommendations from EULAR can reveal possible gaps in the literature and avenues for future research into gout therapies.

### Why better treatment of gout is needed [^b56854e7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of gout is thought to be simple, but in reality we are confronted regularly with patients who do not adhere to treatment and patients who have other medical conditions that render the choice of therapy difficult. A treat-to-target approach is essential in order to manage hyperuricaemia effectively and this, combined with a better use of existing treatments, offers the best way forward.

### Safety of urate-lowering therapies: managing the risks to gain the benefits [^fc6a2400]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a metabolic disorder of purine metabolism and uric acid elimination. Over time, acute gout can develop into a chronic, disabling arthropathy, often associated with multiple comorbidities. Gout patients have often been undertreated, partly because of the clinician's perceived risks of a therapy outweighing its potential benefits. The approval of new therapies to treat hyperuricemia in gout has led to a new understanding of gout management and medication safety regarding new and old therapies. This review focuses on potential safety issues of currently available urate-lowering therapies and outlines strategies to minimize risks so their benefits can be reached.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^356223da]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Up-to-date management of gout [^5a718f99]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is a true crystal deposition disease, extremely painful and bone and tissue damaging if untreated. It is the only curable form of arthritis. Although we have many treatments to cure gout, it is a disease that is consistently undertreated/mismanaged and perceived by clinicians and the lay public as a 'laughable condition' with the patients' lifestyle often held erroneously to account. This article would give you a good understanding of modern and established pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments used in the management of acute and chronic gout and how to 'treat to target' to cure the disease.

Recent Findings

Many of the drugs we use to manage patients with gouty arthritis have been in existence since the 1970s and 1980s. In the past few years, because of the improved physiological understanding of gout, new innovative treatments such as anti-IL inhibitors, a nonxanthine oxidase inhibitor and the uricase enzymes have been developed adding to our armamentarium of drugs.

Summary

With the introduction of new research, we have been able to explore how to also use established treatments more effectively, raising the profile of gout and its best management and introducing the principle of treating the patient to urate target.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^d6940733]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to treat acute flares of gout as early as possible. Educate fully informed patients to self-medicate at the first warning symptoms. Decide on the drug choice based on the presence of contraindications, the patient's previous experience with treatments, time of initiation after flare onset and the number and type of joints involved.

### New developments in gout [^e13e99a6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. This review summarizes the most recent studies on newer therapeutics, disease management strategies and treatment recommendations.

Recent Findings

There are several new therapeutic agents being investigated both for the management of the acute gout symptoms, targeting interleukin-1β, as well as urate-lowering therapies including uricase and inhibitors of renal urate transporter proteins. Interventions led by pharmacists and nurses, which include patient education, lifestyle advice, monitoring and titration of urate-lowering medications have been implemented to improve gout management. Recently, the American College of Rheumatology has published guidelines for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches for hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis.

Summary

New therapeutic agents targeting the mechanism of inflammation (IL-1β) are under investigation. In addition, new urate-lowering medications to be used alone or in combination with allopurinol are undergoing rigorous evaluation to use for patients not responding to or unable to take current therapies. There is also increasing interest in redesigning clinical care to improve patient education, self-management training and urate-lowering medication titration. Although we await results of these investigations, the American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines provide a framework for clinicians in order to provide optimal gout care.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^4e9e571a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^367705b1]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently coexist, but quality evidence to guide gout management in people with CKD is lacking. Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in the context of advanced CKD varies greatly, and professional bodies have issued conflicting recommendations regarding the treatment of gout in people with concomitant CKD. As a result, confusion exists among medical professionals about the appropriate management of people with gout and CKD. This Consensus Statement from the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) discusses the evidence and/or lack thereof for the management of gout in people with CKD and identifies key areas for research to address the challenges faced in the management of gout and CKD. These discussions, which address areas for research both in general as well as related to specific medications used to treat gout flares or as ULT, are supported by separately published G-CAN systematic literature reviews. This Consensus Statement is not intended as a guideline for the management of gout in CKD; rather, it analyses the available literature on the safety and efficacy of drugs used in gout management to identify important gaps in knowledge and associated areas for research.

### Updates in the management of gout [^b56ff43f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^44adb76c]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH," and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects." For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH." If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)." As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment." For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)."

### Refractory gout: what is it and what to do about it? [^ebebeea4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to discuss the defining characteristics of refractory gout and the pharmacological management of this problem.

Recent Findings

Refractory gout refers to those patients who have ongoing symptoms of active disease and cannot maintain a target serum urate less than 6 mg/dl. Patients with refractory gout have reduced quality of life, functional impairment, and joint destruction. Multiple factors contribute to refractory gout, and they often relate to delayed or insufficient dosing with allopurinol. Chronic kidney disease imparts a dose limitation on allopurinol that further impairs the effectiveness of urate-lowering therapy. Febuxostat, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor, represents a potential alternative to allopurinol in refractory gout patients. Uricase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of uric acid into allantoin, is showing promise with its ability to rapidly diminish serum urate levels. The recently defined role of the NALP3 inflammasome in the inflammatory phase of gout suggests a potential role for interleukin-1 inhibition in urate crystal-induced inflammation.

Summary

Refractory gout occurs when urate levels are not adequately controlled. Emerging therapies may improve the clinical course of patients with recalcitrant disease.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of acute gout [^413976cd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with better outcomes than cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors or placebo in the treatment of acute gout?

Bottom Line

NSAIDs are not significantly associated with a difference in pain reduction compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids for treating acute gout. However, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of adverse events and higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^5138ace2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of acute and prevention of recurrent gout – a systematic review [^706e9ef7]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for acute gout and the prevention of recurrent gout.

Method

Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of treatments for gout from their inception to the end of 2004. No language restrictions were applied. All randomized controlled trials of treatments routinely available for the treatment of gout were included. Trials of the prevention of recurrence were included only if patients who had had gout and had at least 6 months of follow-up were studied.

Results

We found 13 randomized controlled trials of treatment for acute gout, two of which were placebo controlled. Colchicine was found to be effective in one study; however, the entire colchicine group developed toxicity. The only robust conclusion from studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is that pain relief from indometacin and etoricoxib are equivalent. We found one randomized controlled trial, reported only as a conference abstract, of recurrent gout prevention.

Conclusion

The shortage of robust data to inform the management of a common problem such as gout is surprising. All of the drugs used to treat gout can have serious side effects. The incidence of gout is highest in the elderly population. It is in this group, who are at a high risk of serious adverse events, that we are using drugs of known toxicity. The balance of risks and benefits for the drug treatment of gout needs to be reassessed.

Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy (ULT) — For patients receiving ULT, a treat-to-target management strategy that includes ULT dose titration and serial serum urate (SU) measurements to achieve a target SU, over a fixed-dose ULT strategy, is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT; achieving and maintaining an SU target of < 6 mg/dl over the use of no target is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT, and ULT titration should occur over a reasonable time frame (e.g., weeks to months, not years).

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^c87d10a9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

### Gout: thoughts about a Treat-to-target programme [^dc5b2130]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a rheumatic disease resulting from deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues and fluids within the body. The pathogenesis involves underexcretion or overproduction of uric acid, a biproduct of metabolism of purines, resulting in a metabolic disorder commonly known as hyperuricaemia, has a relatively high prevalence in the population (0.5–1%, similar to rheumatoid arthritis). Patients with hyperuricaemia are at risk to develop acute gouty attacks which may be severely painful. The attacks tend to occur episodically over a few days up to a week or two, but gout may later become chronic. Different aims of therapy and management are well suited as targets of treatment, including reduction of purine intake, increased of excretion of uric acid, mobilisation of urate pools within the body, and reduction of acute and chronic inflammation through anti-inflammatory medications.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^560eed0d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs)) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases. We report numerical data for the primary comparison NSAIDs versus placebo and brief results for the two comparisons - NSAIDs versus COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs versus glucocorticoids. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) from 1 trial (30 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to placebo. More participants (11/15) may have a 50% reduction in pain at 24 hours with NSAIDs than with placebo (4/15) (risk ratio (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 6.7), with absolute improvement of 47% (3.5% more to 152.5% more). NSAIDs may have little to no effect on inflammation (swelling) after four days (13/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 12/15 participants taking placebo; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), with absolute improvement of 6.4% (16.8% fewer to 39.2% more). There may be little to no difference in function (4-point scale; 1 = complete resolution) at 24 hours (4/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 1/15 participants taking placebo; RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 31.7), with absolute improvement of 20% (3.3% fewer to 204.9% more). NSAIDs may result in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (0 events in both groups) or in total adverse events; two adverse events (nausea and polyuria) were reported in the placebo group (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 3.8), with absolute difference of 10.7% more (13.2% fewer to 38% more). Treatment success and health-related quality of life were not measured. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 6 trials (1244 participants) shows non-selective NSAIDs compared to selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs). Non-selective NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) 0.03, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.14 higher), swelling (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.22 higher), treatment success (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 lower to 0.2 higher), or quality of life (MD -0.2, 95% CI -6.7 to 6.3) compared to COXIBs. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests no difference in function (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.25) between groups. Non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) and total adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8). Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) based on 5 trials (712 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids. NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 3.0), inflammation (MD 0.3, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.6), function (MD -0.2, 95% CI -2.2 to 1.8), or treatment success (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events with NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids (RR 2.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 14.2). There was a decrease in total adverse events with glucocorticoids compared to NSAIDs (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence from 1 placebo-controlled trial suggests that NSAIDs may improve pain at 24 hours and may have little to no effect on function, inflammation, or adverse events for treatment of acute gout. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that COXIBs and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial with regards to improvement in pain, function, inflammation, and treatment success, although non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs probably are equally beneficial in terms of pain relief, improvement in function, and treatment success. Withdrawals due to adverse events were also similar between groups, but NSAIDs probably result in more total adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests no difference in inflammation between groups. Only low-certainty evidence was available for the comparisons NSAID versus rilonacept and NSAID versus acupuncture from single trials, or one NSAID versus another NSAID, which also included many NSAIDs that are no longer in clinical use. Although these data were insufficient to support firm conclusions, they do not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, findings for other inflammatory arthritis, and expert consensus, all of which support the use of NSAIDs for acute gout.

### Treatment… [^6ccf8b51]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Gout, caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and tissues, is commonly encountered in primary care. This article provides a review of patient-oriented evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of gout. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY: ACUTE EPISODE Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. 33 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatment unless use is contraindicated. 8 Oral prednisolone is equal to naproxen in the treatment of acute gout, with no significant difference in pain relief or adverse effects.
34. In acute gout, low-dose colchicine was as effective as high-dose colchicine and had fewer adverse effects. Nearly 77% of patients treated with high-dose colchicine reported adverse effects compared with 36% in the low-dose colchicine group and 27% in the placebo group. 35 Further investigation is required to support routine use of interleukin-1 inhibitors. 36Interleukin-1 inhibitors may benefit select patients, including those with frequent gout flare-ups resistant to standard treatments or in whom current therapies are contraindicated. 21, 37 There are several indications for urate-lowering therapy 31, 37–39. Allopurinol is the drug of choice for patients choosing urate-lowering therapy. The dosage of allopurinol will vary with the severity of disease, with a typical initial dosage of 100 mg orally once per day.

The daily dosage should be titrated gradually to avoid precipitating a flare-up. Dosages of more than 300 mg per day are given in divided doses after meals, with a maximum of 800 mg per day. 40 Febuxostat is noninferior to allopurinol in preventing acute gout episodes.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^815e9aaa]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Association of uric acid-lowering therapies on gout frequency with bempedoic acid: clinical insights from CLEAR outcomes [^49e852cb]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Does uric acid–lowering medication use impact gout adverse events in patients receiving bempedoic acid, with or without prior gout and/or baseline elevated uric acid?

What is the main finding?

Gout incidence was lower with uric acid–lowering medication use during CLEAR Outcomes.

Table 1
Uric Acid–Lowering Medication Use and Incidence of Gout Adverse Events by History of Gout or Elevated Uric Acid Level at Baseline

Among patients without prior gout or elevated UA, gout was infrequent in both treatment groups (< 1%). For patients with prior gout who never received UA-lowering medications during follow-up, 2.2% of bempedoic acid patients and 0.6% of placebo patients experienced gout. When a UA-lowering medication was used, either at baseline or after a gout event, the incidence of gout was similar to or lower in bempedoic acid–treated patients vs placebo (3.2% vs 9.1% and 0.5% vs 0%, respectively). In patients with elevated UA but no history of gout, incidence of gout among those who never received UA-lowering therapies occurred twice as often with bempedoic acid (1.7%) vs placebo (0.7%) but occurred less often with any use of UA-lowering therapies either at baseline or after an episode of gout (< 1%) in both bempedoic acid and placebo patients. Patients with both a prior history of gout and elevated UA had the highest use of UA-lowering medications at baseline (43.7% for bempedoic acid and 40.8% for placebo) and the highest overall incidence of gout in both treatment groups (20.5% in bempedoic acid and 26.2% in placebo). In this subset of patients, gout occurred less frequently when UA-lowering medications were used at baseline for both bempedoic acid (6.8%) and placebo (11.0%), and after these medications were initiated during the study (3.2% and 2.1%, respectively). The adjusted hazard ratios for the effect of bempedoic acid on MACE-4 was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63–1.21) in those with a prior history of gout (n = 720) and was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79–0.96) among those without (n = 13,245) (P interaction = 1.00).

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^94de9e78]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^189a75ce]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^29230ad4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — management of concurrent medications states: Switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible is conditionally recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Choosing losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible is conditionally recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Stopping low-dose aspirin (for patients who are taking this medication for appropriate indications) is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Switching, stopping, or adding a medication should only be considered when the potential SU concentration/gout benefits exceed the potential risks or harms of the medication change. Recognizing that there are few practical alternatives to low-dose aspirin, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against its cessation as a means of SU reduction when a patient is taking it for an appropriate indication.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^4f70a8a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^5168a7c3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Allopurinol for chronic gout [^eb86b515]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here. Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function. Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period. Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^a1a71167]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^3de76f6c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

Gout — choice of initial ULT — treatment with allopurinol as the preferred first-line agent, over all other ULTs, is strongly recommended for all patients, including those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (stage ≥ 3); dosing efficacy is noted when dosed appropriately, often requiring > 300 mg/day up to the maximum FDA-approved dose of 800 mg/day. In patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (stage ≥ 3), the choice of either allopurinol or febuxostat over probenecid is strongly recommended, and the choice of pegloticase as a first-line therapy is strongly recommended against.

### Improving the use of allopurinol in chronic gout: monitoring oxypurinol levels to guide therapy [^0296d1df]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), adjusted to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid (SUA) of < 6 mg/dl, remains the standard of care for the chronic management of gout. New urate-lowering medications are important options; however, these agents should be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or cannot achieve SUA < 6 mg/dl on allopurinol. The result of oxypurinol monitoring to guide allopurinol therapy suggests that allopurinol should still be considered first-line ULT for gout.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Gout and its comorbidities: implications for therapy [^aa46bd78]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Gout is a common form of arthritis. It is associated with a number of comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidaemia and frequently in a combination known as the metabolic syndrome. These comorbidities and their treatment may have an effect on the development of gout and on the choice of therapeutic agent. Treatment of acute gout with short-term corticosteroids may be a safer option than either NSAIDs or colchicine in patients with significant renal and/or cardiac impairment. Sustained reduction of serum urate < 0.36 mmol/l is required for long-term management of gout. The optimal dosing regimen for patients with renal impairment is the subject of on-going investigation. There is less experience with newer urate-lowering therapies. This review will consider the relationship between comorbidities and gout with a particular focus on the treatment of gout and the potential interactions between drugs used for gout and those for comorbid conditions.
