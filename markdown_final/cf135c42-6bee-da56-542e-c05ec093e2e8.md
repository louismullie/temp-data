## Question

What are symptoms of rabies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of rabies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease course and incubation period. Then, I should verify the prodromal symptoms and their timing. Next, I will examine the two classic clinical forms, furious and paralytic, and their distinguishing features. After that, I need to check for atypical or variant presentations and diagnostic pitfalls. Finally, I will integrate the terminal phase and synthesize a concise, stage-based summary with key differentiators and red flags, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the disease course and incubation, because symptom onset depends on when the virus reaches the central nervous system. Rabies has a long, variable incubation averaging weeks to months, influenced by inoculation site, severity, age, and prior vaccination; once neurologic symptoms begin, progression is rapid and almost uniformly fatal without aggressive supportive care, typically culminating in death within 7–10 days if untreated, though survival is rare in exceptional circumstances [^ee9a4aaf] [^e4578e32] [^e14b38dc].

> I will now examine the prodromal phase, since early symptoms are nonspecific and often missed. Wait, let me verify the timing and content: the prodrome lasts several days and includes flu-like symptoms such as fever, malaise, headache, and weakness, frequently accompanied by local paresthesias, pain, pruritus, or dysesthesia at the exposure site; these local sensations are highly suggestive and should raise suspicion when paired with an animal exposure history, even if the bite was weeks earlier [^ee9a4aaf] [^edf16b7c] [^e14b38dc].

> Next, I should review furious rabies, the encephalitic form that most people recognize. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — furious rabies is not just "aggression". It features prominent anxiety, insomnia, confusion, agitation, and delirium, with autonomic dysfunction including hypersalivation, diaphoresis, and cardiovascular instability; hallmark features are hydrophobia and aerophobia from painful pharyngeal spasms, and patients may have seizures and fluctuating consciousness, often with a shorter clinical course than paralytic disease due to higher CNS viral burden and weaker immune control [^ee9a4aaf] [^e14b38dc] [^5d19a700].

> Now, I need to check paralytic rabies, which is frequently misdiagnosed. Let me think about the key differentiators: paralytic rabies begins with progressive, often ascending weakness and flaccid paralysis, sometimes starting at the inoculation site, with relative sparing of consciousness early on; autonomic instability and cranial nerve involvement can occur, but classic hydrophobia may be absent or delayed, leading to confusion with Guillain-Barré syndrome or other acute flaccid paralyses; CSF may show pleocytosis in some series, and MRI can show nerve root enhancement, which complicates differentiation from GBS [^ee9a4aaf] [^74e74136] [^88185ddc] [^dd87b8a6].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the exposure history is missing. I should double-check for variant features: limbic or behavioral changes, including inappropriate sexual behaviors, have been reported; ocular or facial pain with cranial neuropathies can occur in bat-associated disease; and in children, atypical seizures or cerebellar signs may precede classic features, so a high index of suspicion is essential when encephalitis is unexplained, especially in endemic settings or with any animal exposure history [^22ac9cf6] [^8e369268] [^460c1026].

> I will now examine the terminal phase, because rapid progression is a key clinical signal. Hold on, I should verify the sequence: after the neurologic phase, patients deteriorate into coma within days, with respiratory failure, circulatory collapse, and multiorgan dysfunction; without intensive supportive care, death typically occurs within about 7–10 days from first neurologic symptom, though aggressive ICU management can modestly extend survival in rare cases, sometimes with severe neurologic sequelae in survivors [^ee9a4aaf] [^e4578e32] [^7446558c].

> Let me synthesize a stage-based summary to ensure nothing is missed. Prodrome: flu-like symptoms plus local paresthesias at the bite site for several days. Acute neurologic phase: either furious features (anxiety, insomnia, confusion, agitation, delirium, hydrophobia, aerophobia, hypersalivation, autonomic instability, seizures) or paralytic features (ascending flaccid paralysis, early preservation of consciousness, minimal or delayed hydrophobia). Terminal phase: rapid progression to coma, respiratory failure, and death within about a week without supportive care, with the caveat that rare survivals have occurred under experimental protocols or with robust immune responses [^ee9a4aaf] [^e14b38dc] [^7446558c].

> Finally, I should confirm the diagnostic red flags and pitfalls, because early recognition changes outcomes for contacts if not for the patient. A history of animal exposure with a compatible prodrome, local paresthesias, rapidly progressive encephalitis or ascending paralysis, and exclusion of other etiologies should prompt urgent public health consultation and antemortem testing of saliva, serum, CSF, and nuchal skin biopsy; paralytic rabies must be distinguished from GBS by the presence of fever early, pain at the exposure site, cranial nerve involvement, and rapid evolution to coma, and serial sampling improves diagnostic yield when rabies is suspected [^e14b38dc] [^94a7589c] [^74e74136] [^fb3e38e7].

Rabies in humans presents in two forms: **furious (encephalitic)** and **paralytic (dumb)** [^e82ebf34]. The furious form is more common and features **hydrophobia**, **aerophobia**, hypersalivation, agitation, and seizures, whereas the paralytic form presents with progressive flaccid paralysis and is often misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barré syndrome [^74e74136]. Early symptoms are nonspecific — fever, headache, malaise, and local paresthesia at the bite site — followed by rapid neurologic decline, coma, and death within 7–10 days once neurologic signs appear [^ee9a4aaf] [^e4578e32]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by antemortem testing of saliva, serum, CSF, and nuchal skin biopsy [^94a7589c]; once symptoms begin, rabies is almost always fatal, so immediate post-exposure prophylaxis after exposure is critical [^7f20e8bd].

---

## Clinical presentation and progression

Rabies progresses through distinct clinical phases, each with characteristic symptoms:

| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Incubation | Weeks to months (average 20–90 days) | Asymptomatic; virus travels from peripheral nerves to CNS [^ee9a4aaf] [^e14b38dc] |
| Prodrome | 2–10 days | - Fever <br/> - Headache <br/> - Malaise <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Local paresthesia/pain at bite site [^ee9a4aaf] [^edf16b7c] |
| Acute neurologic | 2–7 days | - Anxiety <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Agitation <br/> - Hallucinations <br/> - Hydrophobia <br/> - Aerophobia <br/> - Hypersalivation <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Autonomic dysfunction [^ee9a4aaf] [^e14b38dc] |
| Coma | 2–14 days | - Progressive coma <br/> - Respiratory failure <br/> - Cardiac arrhythmias <br/> - Multi-organ failure [^ee9a4aaf] [^e4578e32] |

---

## Furious rabies (encephalitic form)

Furious rabies is the **most common form**, accounting for approximately 80% of cases [^3f0fe5e6]. It is characterized by:

- **Hydrophobia**: Fear of water due to painful pharyngeal spasms triggered by attempts to drink [^ee9a4aaf].
- **Aerophobia**: Fear of air or drafts, causing violent spasms.
- **Hypersalivation**: Excessive salivation due to autonomic dysfunction.
- **Agitation and aggression**: Marked irritability, aggressive behavior, and confusion [^e14b38dc].
- **Seizures**: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are common [^ee9a4aaf].
- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Hyperthermia, sweating, and cardiovascular instability [^e14b38dc].

---

## Paralytic rabies (dumb form)

Paralytic rabies accounts for approximately 20% of cases and is characterized by **progressive flaccid paralysis** without the prominent behavioral changes seen in furious rabies [^notfound]. Key features include:

- **Ascending paralysis**: Begins in the limbs and progresses to involve the trunk and respiratory muscles [^notfound].
- **Absence of hydrophobia and aerophobia**: These classic features are typically absent or mild [^notfound].
- **Sensory disturbances**: Paresthesia and numbness are common [^74e74136].
- **Respiratory failure**: Due to diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle paralysis [^ee9a4aaf].

Paralytic rabies is frequently misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barré syndrome or other acute flaccid paralyses, especially when there is no clear history of animal exposure [^74e74136] [^88185ddc].

---

## Atypical presentations

Atypical presentations of rabies have been reported, including:

- **Limbic system involvement**: Rare cases presenting with inappropriate sexual behaviors or other limbic symptoms [^22ac9cf6].
- **Psychiatric manifestations**: Initial presentation with psychotic symptoms or behavioral changes [^74e74136].
- **Non-bite exposures**: Cases resulting from organ transplantation, corneal grafts, or aerosol exposure in bat-infested caves [^953f2aa3] [^3dd8e84e].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Diagnosis of rabies is primarily clinical, supported by laboratory testing. Antemortem diagnosis involves detection of rabies virus antigen or RNA in saliva, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and nuchal skin biopsy [^94a7589c]. Postmortem diagnosis relies on immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue [^94a7589c]. Common diagnostic pitfalls include misdiagnosis of paralytic rabies as Guillain-Barré syndrome, especially in the absence of a clear exposure history [^74e74136] [^88185ddc].

---

## Prognosis

Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is almost invariably fatal, with a case fatality rate approaching 100% [^7f20e8bd]. Only a handful of documented survivors have been reported, most of whom received experimental treatments or had atypical courses of disease [^7446558c] [^c6be0fee].

---

## Conclusion

Rabies in humans presents with a rapidly progressive neurologic syndrome characterized by either furious or paralytic features. Early symptoms are nonspecific, but the disease quickly escalates to severe neurologic dysfunction, coma, and death. Prompt recognition and immediate post-exposure prophylaxis are essential to prevent fatal outcomes [^7f20e8bd].

### Human rabies: a disease of complex neuropathogenetic mechanisms and diagnostic challenges [^e82ebf34]. The Lancet: Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Rabies is inevitably fatal and presents a horrifying clinical picture. Human rabies can manifest in either encephalitic (furious) or paralytic (dumb) forms. The brainstem is preferentially involved in both clinical forms, though there are no clinical signs of brainstem dysfunction. Differences in tropism at the inoculation site or the CNS, in the route of spread, or in the triggering of immune cascades in the brainstem may account for clinical variation. Rabies still poses diagnostic problems, particularly the paralytic form, which closely resembles Guillain-Barré syndrome, or when a patient is comatose and cardinal signs may be lacking. Molecular methods allow reliable detection of rabies-virus RNA in biological fluids or tissue before death. Deviations from the recommendations on prophylaxis of the World Health Organization lead to unnecessary loss of life. To date, attempts to treat human rabies have been unsuccessful.

### Rabies [^7f20e8bd]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Rabies is a life-threatening neglected tropical disease: tens of thousands of cases are reported annually in endemic countries (mainly in Africa and Asia), although the actual numbers are most likely underestimated. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that is caused by infection with viruses of the Lyssavirus genus, which are transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal. Dogs are the most important reservoir for rabies viruses, and dog bites account for > 99% of human cases. The virus first infects peripheral motor neurons, and symptoms occur after the virus reaches the central nervous system. Once clinical disease develops, it is almost certainly fatal. Primary prevention involves dog vaccination campaigns to reduce the virus reservoir. If exposure occurs, timely post-exposure prophylaxis can prevent the progression to clinical disease and involves appropriate wound care, the administration of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccination. A multifaceted approach for human rabies eradication that involves government support, disease awareness, vaccination of at-risk human populations and, most importantly, dog rabies control is necessary to achieve the WHO goal of reducing the number of cases of dog-mediated human rabies to zero by 2030.

### Rabies: rare human infection-common questions [^16bcacf3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Rabies is an acute, rapidly progressive encephalitis that is almost always fatal. Prophylaxis is highly effective but economics limits disease control. The mechanism of death from rabies is unclear. It is poorly cytopathic and poorly inflammatory. Rabies behaves like an acquired metabolic disorder. There may be a continuum of disease severity. History of animal bite is rare. The diagnosis is often missed. Intermittent encephalopathy, dysphagia, hydrophobia and aerophobia, and focal paresthesias or myoclonic jerks suggest rabies. Laboratory diagnosis is cumbersome but sensitive. Treatment is controversial but survivors are increasingly reported, with good outcomes in 4 of 8 survivors.

### Perspectives in diagnosis and treatment of rabies viral encephalitis: insights from pathogenesis [^a0d606e1]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Rabies viral encephalitis, though one of the oldest recognized infectious disease of humans, remains an incurable, fatal encephalomyelitis, despite advances in understanding of its pathobiology. Advances in science have led us on the trail of the virus in the host, but the sanctuaries in which the virus remains hidden for its survival are unknown. Insights into host-pathogen interactions have facilitated evolving immunologic therapeutic strategies, though we are far from a cure. Most of the present-day knowledge has evolved from in vitro studies using fixed (attenuated) laboratory strains that may not be applicable in the clinical setting. Much remains to be unraveled about this elusive virus. This review attempts to re-examine the current advances in understanding of the pathobiology of the rabies virus that modulate the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this fatal disease.

Rabies treatment — current status: No evidence-based approach to treating rabies patients is available. Most cases are managed with symptomatic and palliative supportive care. Survival after the clinical phase of rabies virus infection is incredibly rare, but case reports continue to provide insight into potential therapeutic options, and experimental treatment regimens continue to be investigated.

### Human rabies: neuropathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^5d19a700]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Rabies is an almost invariably fatal disease that can present as classic furious rabies or paralytic rabies. Recovery has been reported in only a few patients, most of whom were infected with bat rabies virus variants, and has been associated with promptness of host immune response and spontaneous (immune) virus clearance. Viral mechanisms that have evolved to minimise damage to the CNS but enable the virus to spread might explain why survivors have overall good functional recovery. The shorter survival of patients with furious rabies compared with those with paralytic rabies closely corresponds to the greater amount of virus and lower immune response in the CNS of patients with the furious form. Rabies virus is present in the CNS long before symptom onset: subclinical anterior horn cell dysfunction and abnormal brain MRI in patients with furious rabies are evident days before brain symptoms develop. How the virus produces its devastating effects and how it selectively impairs behaviour in patients with furious rabies and the peripheral nerves of patients with paralytic rabies is beginning to be understood. However, to develop a pragmatic treatment strategy, a thorough understanding of the neuropathogenetic mechanisms is needed.

### Rabies and other lyssavirus diseases [^5edbaa78]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The full scale of the global burden of human rabies is unknown, owing to inadequate surveillance of this fatal disease. However, the terror of hydrophobia, a cardinal symptom of rabies encephalitis, is suffered by tens of thousands of people each year. The recent discovery of enzootic European bat lyssavirus infection in the UK is indicative of our expanding awareness of the Lyssavirus genus. The main mammalian vector species vary geographically, so the health problems created by the lyssaviruses and their management differ throughout the world. The methods by which these neurotropic viruses hijack neurophysiological mechanisms while evading immune surveillance is beginning to be unravelled by, for example, studies of molecular motor transport systems. Meanwhile, enormous challenges remain in the control of animal rabies and the provision of accessible, appropriate human prophylaxis worldwide.

### Vaccinating children in high-endemic rabies regions: what are we waiting for? [^66de85ec]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

On September 28 this year, the World Rabies Day came as a reminder that a fully preventable viral encephalitis still claims at least 59 000 victims per year in over 150 countries; and particularly in rural Africa and Asia, where over 40% of individuals bitten by a suspect rabid animal are children. Sadly, these figures are probably underestimated.

Rabies is one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) announced by the WHO, that is, a diverse group of communicable diseases that particularly affect poor populations, without adequate sanitation, and living in close contact with infectious vectors. In 2013, the World Health Assembly called to intensify measures against NTDs. In 2015, the WHO called for action to achieve zero dog-mediated rabies deaths in humans by 2030. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance prevention, diagnosis, control and treatment through an integrated One Health approach. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with rabies vaccine plays an important role in prevention but is almost unavailable in high-endemic settings.

### Estimating the public health impact of rabies [^9a6ca966]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Rabies is a fatal, preventable zoonosis, but it is not effectively controlled throughout much of the developing world. The impetus for control is hampered by a lack of awareness of its true impact. We estimate a disability-adjusted life year (DALY) score for rabies to quantify the disease impact relative to other diseases to set priorities for public health interventions.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^e20425cc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Human rabies — treatment after clinical onset — rabies is associated with the highest case fatality rate of any infectious disease, and no proven effective medical treatment is recognized after the development of clinical signs. Initiation of rabies vaccination after onset of clinical symptoms in patients with confirmed rabies diagnoses is not recommended and might be detrimental. Survival has been well documented for only six patients; in five of these cases, the persons had received rabies vaccination before the onset of disease, and only one patient has recovered from rabies without the institution of rabies vaccination. Rapid antemortem diagnosis is a priority, and when a definitive diagnosis is obtained, primary health-care considerations should focus, at a minimum, on comfort care and adequate sedation of the patient in an appropriate medical facility. Sedation is often necessary because patients might become extremely agitated in response to stimuli such as loud noises, air currents, and the sight or sound of running water, particularly during the acute neurologic phase of the disease. At specialized tertiary care hospitals, medical staff might consider institution of an aggressive approach to experimental therapies after in depth discussions and informed consent; patients should be aware of the high probability for treatment failure, anticipated expenses, and that recovery, when it occurs, might involve neurologic deficits requiring lengthy rehabilitation.

World Health Organization human rabies case definitions — A clinical case is an acute neurologic syndrome (encephalitis) with forms of hyperactivity (furious rabies) or paralytic syndromes (paralytic rabies) progressing toward coma and death, usually by cardiac or respiratory failure, typically within 7–10 days after the first symptom if no intensive care is instituted; symptoms include aerophobia, dysphagia, hydrophobia, nausea or vomiting, paresthesia, localized pain, or localized weakness. Human rabies: suspected is a case compatible with the clinical case definition; human rabies: probable is a suspected case plus a reliable history of contact with a suspected, probable, or confirmed rabid animal; human rabies: confirmed is a suspected or probable case confirmed through appropriate laboratory testing.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Detention facility settings provide extensive opportunities for disease transmission, including rabies, and a complex network of potential disease contacts. Law enforcement and public health officials, when working cohesively, can quickly identify potentially exposed persons and provide life-saving medical recommendations. A diagnosis of rabies should be considered in patients hospitalized with unexplained acute progressive encephalitis, especially when the patient comes from a region with endemic rabies or has a known history of animal exposure.

Ministries of health responses to the International Health Regulations notification of potential human-to-human rabies transmission varied. Several countries attempted to locate all persons recommended for risk assessment; however, one country chose not to conduct an investigation and another did not provide details on how it responded. The outcome of these differing responses resulted in a low (54%) completion rate of confirmed rabies risk assessment among detainees. Human-to-human transmission of rabies is rare, and as such, public health programs must consider the costs and benefits of large-scale investigations. In countries where public health infrastructure can efficiently locate and treat contacts of rabies patients, this vaccine-preventable, fatal disease is usually thoroughly investigated. Development of streamlined approaches to human rabies contact investigations can enhance public health infrastructure and support best practices for use of public health and vaccine resources even in resource-limited countries.

### Comparative pathogenesis of rabies in bats and carnivores, and implications for spillover to humans [^be99e974]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Bat-acquired rabies is becoming increasingly common, and its diagnosis could be missed partly because its clinical presentation differs from that of dog-acquired rabies. We reviewed the scientific literature to compare the pathogenesis of rabies in bats and carnivores-including dogs-and related this pathogenesis to differences in the clinical presentation of bat-acquired and dog-acquired rabies in human beings. For bat-acquired rabies, we found that the histological site of exposure is usually limited to the skin, the anatomical site of exposure is more commonly the face, and the virus might be more adapted for entry via the skin than for dog-acquired rabies. These factors could help to explain several differences in clinical presentation between individuals with bat-acquired and those with dog-acquired rabies. A better understanding of these differences should improve the recording of a patient's history, enable drawing up of a more sophisticated list of clinical characteristics, and therefore obtain an earlier diagnosis of rabies after contact with a bat or carnivore that has rabies.

### Management of rabies in humans [^a8b8fedc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Rabies is a fatal disease in humans, and, to date, the only survivors of the disease have received rabies vaccine before the onset of illness. The approach to management of the rabies normally should be palliative. In unusual circumstances, a decision may be made to use an aggressive approach to therapy for patients who present at an early stage of clinical disease. No single therapeutic agent is likely to be effective, but a combination of specific therapies could be considered, including rabies vaccine, rabies immunoglobulin, monoclonal antibodies, ribavirin, interferon-alpha, and ketamine. Corticosteroids should not be used. As research advances, new agents may become available in the future for the treatment of human rabies.

### About rabies… [^d419110d]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Rabies is a viral disease that is deadly if people don't receive medical care before symptoms start.
- Rabies spreads primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal.
- The animals most frequently found with rabies in the U. S. are bats, skunks, raccoons, and foxes.
- Around 100, 000 Americans are vaccinated against rabies following a potential rabies exposure each year. What you need to know Rabies is deadly Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can be spread to people and pets through the bites and scratches of an infected animal. Rabies primarily affects the central nervous system, leading to severe brain disease and death if medical care is not received before symptoms start. After a rabies exposure, the rabies virus must travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is the incubation period, which may last for weeks to months.

The first symptoms of rabies may be like the flu, including weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. There also may be discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. Usually, severe disease appears within two weeks of the first symptoms, when the rabies virus causes anxiety, confusion, agitation, and hallucinations. This includes the "classic" rabies symptoms of being very thirsty but panicked by fluids, having lots of saliva, and aggressive behavior like thrashing and biting. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal. Rabies vaccination in people If you may have been exposed to rabies, you should urgently seek medical attention. Medical care following a rabies exposure is called post-exposure prophylaxis. PEP includes wound care, human rabies immune globulin, and a series of four or five rabies vaccines, which must be given as soon as possible after an exposure.

You must get this care to prevent the disease from developing, and it's nearly 100% effective if you get it after exposure. People who travel Since 1990, more than 80 people in the United States have died after being infected with rabies during travel. In Africa, Asia, and specific areas of Central and South America, rabies in dogs is still a major problem. Additionally, access to PEP may be hard to get in those places. As a result, tens of thousands of people die of the disease each year.

Rabies diagnosis — Diagnosis can be made in a patient with a compatible exposure history and a classic clinical presentation (Box 4.15.2). Clinical suspicion and prioritization of differential diagnoses can be complicated by variations in clinical presentation and a lack of exposure history. Because several weeks to months could have elapsed since exposure, and an accurate exposure history can be difficult to elicit in a patient exhibiting signs of rabies, patients might not reveal potential rabies virus exposures.

### Rabies re-examined [^ff7b7400]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Rabies is an acute, progressive, incurable viral encephalitis. The causative agents are neurotropic RNA viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. Mammalian reservoirs include the Carnivora and Chiroptera, but rabid dogs still pose the greatest hazard worldwide. Viral transmission occurs mainly via animal bite, and once the virus is deposited in peripheral wounds, centripetal passage occurs towards the central nervous system. After viral replication, there is centrifugal spread to major exit portals, the salivary glands. The epidemiological significance of any host "carrier" state remains highly speculative. Although incubation periods average 1–3 months, disease occurrence days or years after exposure has been documented. Rabies should be suspected in patients with a concomitant history of animal bite and traditional clinical presentation, but a lack of such clues makes antemortem diagnosis a challenge. Pathogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood, and current care entails palliative measures only. Current medical emphasis relies heavily on prevention of exposure and intervention before clinical onset. Prophylaxis encompasses thorough wound treatment, vaccine administration, and inoculation of rabies immunoglobulin. Although it is a major zoonosis, canine rabies can be eliminated, and application of new vaccine technologies permits significant disease control among wildlife species. Nevertheless, despite much technical progress in the past century, rabies is a disease of neglect and presents a modern public-health conundrum.

### Temporal evolution on MRI of successful treatment of rabies [^81d3746c]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Rabies is a nearly uniformly fatal disease for individuals who develop clinical symptoms. We report a case of a patient with paralytic rabies who survived after being treated with what is now known as Milwaukee protocol. This is only the third known case of rabies survival after being treated with the protocol. We present sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the brain and lumbar spine throughout the course of her treatment. In doing so, we provide insight into the temporal evolution of MRI findings in the brain and lumbar spine.

World Health Organization, animal rabies case definition — Clinical case definition is an animal that presents with any of the following signs: Hypersalivation; Paralysis; Lethargy; Unprovoked abnormal aggression (e.g., biting two or more people, animals, or inanimate objects); Abnormal vocalization; Diurnal activity of nocturnal species. Animal rabies: suspected is a case compatible with a clinical case definition of animal rabies; animal rabies: probable is a suspected case with a reliable history of contact with a suspected, probably, or confirmed rabid animal, or an animal with suspected rabies that has been killed, has died, or has disappeared within 4–5 days of illness being observed; animal rabies: confirmed is a suspected or probable case that is confirmed in a laboratory; not a case is a suspected or probable case that is ruled out by laboratory tests or epidemiological investigation.

### Rabies death attributed to exposure in central America with symptom onset in a U.S. detention facility-Texas, 2013 [^bedbfc34]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Each year approximately 55,000 persons worldwide die from rabies, a progressive encephalitic disease with a near 100% mortality rate. More than 98% of human rabies deaths are the result of transmission from the bite of a rabid dog. Nearly half of the world's population currently lives in countries in which canine rabies is endemic. In the United States, only 34 human rabies cases were reported during 2003–2013, of which 10 (29%) were attributed to rabid animal exposures abroad.

What is added by this report?

In June 2013, a Guatemalan national aged 28 years was the first person known to have developed symptoms of rabies while in a United States detention facility. He developed insomnia, anxiety, nausea, dysphagia, and hypersalivation while detained. After hospitalization, his mental and respiratory status deteriorated, and 24 days after hospitalization he was declared brain dead. No animal exposures were reported, but phylogenetic analysis determined that the virus variant was associated with a canine variant found in Latin America. Of 742 detainee, enforcement officer, and medical contacts, 25 were recommended for and received postexposure prophylaxis.

### U.S-acquired human rabies with symptom onset and diagnosis abroad, 2012 [^d40101dd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

On July 8, 2012, a U.S. resident was admitted to a hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for evaluation of right arm spasticity, anxiety, and malaise. By the next day, the patient had become comatose following a period of agitation. On July 31, he died. Investigators from CDC, state, and local health departments determined that the patient acquired rabies from contact in March with a bat in California. Person-to-person transmission of rabies has been documented in cases of organ and tissue transplantation and is theoretically possible if infectious saliva or tears are introduced into fresh open wounds or onto mucous membranes. Once symptoms begin, rabies is almost always fatal. While he was potentially infectious, during June 11-July 31, the patient traveled on eight international flights through six countries. To date, 59 persons have been identified as contacts, and 23 persons have been administered postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); no secondary cases have been identified. Bites or scratches from bats or other animals suspected of having rabies should be regarded seriously; victims should promptly seek consultation with public health practitioners and medical-care providers. This report highlights the need for collaboration to 1) identify persons who potentially had contact with infectious materials from a person infected with rabies, 2) conduct a risk assessment, and 3) provide prophylaxis to all those with a reasonable risk for contact with infectious materials (e.g., tears, saliva, or neural tissue from a person with rabies contacting open wounds or mucous membranes of an uninfected person).

Conclusion

In conclusion, paralytic rabies should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any case of acute flaccid paralysis, particularly in endemic areas. Despite the atypical presentation and imaging findings that may mislead the diagnosis, early suspicion of paralytic rabies is critical for improving patient outcomes and ensuring appropriate management.

### Rabies: changing prophylaxis and new insights in pathophysiology [^256b7fd8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite great progress in decoding disease mechanisms, rabies remains one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. Towards the elimination of human rabies deaths by 2030, feasible and affordable post (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must be available with expansion to rural areas in rabies endemic countries. Vaccination and population control of dogs, principal reservoirs and transmitters, must be done in concert.

Recent Finding

Advances in the understanding of rabies neuropathogenesis and pathophysiology are reviewed, including recent experimental findings on host- and virus-specific mechanisms mediating neuronal survival and explaining clinical differences in furious and paralytic rabies. The forthcoming World Health Organization guide on rabies based on pathogenesis and immunization mechanisms data with support by clinical evidence provide new accelerated 1 week intradermal PrEP and PEP schedules. Rabies immunoglobulin injected into the wound only is endorsed at amounts not exceeding the dose interfering with active immunization. Potential therapeutics as designed in accord with rabies neuro-pathophysiology are plausible.

Summary

Clinical practice and rabies awareness can be leveraged by transboundary collaboration among different areas. Advancement in prophylaxis and perspectives on animal control offer a new path to conquer rabies by 2030.

### Radiculomyelitic rabies: can MR imaging help? [^9cfa1591]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

Radiculomyelitic (silent) rabies and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have similar clinical presentations but distinct management and prognostic implications. It is thus important to differentiate between the two antemortem. Because of their distinct pathologic abnormalities, MR imaging may be helpful in distinguishing between the two entities. We report a case in which MR imaging helped us to diagnose silent rabies antemortem, which was subsequently confirmed at autopsy.

Rabies clinical presentation — After viral invasion of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and then central nervous system (CNS), clinical illness in humans culminates in an acute, fatal encephalitis, and signs and symptoms most commonly develop within several weeks to months after exposure. Pain and paresthesia at the site of exposure are often the first symptoms of disease, with rapid progression from a prodromal phase (fever and non-specific symptoms) to a neurologic phase characterized by anxiety, paralysis, paresis, and other signs of encephalitis. Swallowing muscle spasm can be stimulated by the sight, sound, or perception of water (hydrophobia), and early clinical signs often present as autonomic dysfunction, resulting from infection of the autonomic nervous system; at least 1 traveler underwent cardiac catheterization because a cardiac etiology rather than rabies was initially suspected. Delirium and convulsions can develop, followed soon thereafter by coma and death. Most cases detected by healthcare systems present as classic encephalitic disease that progresses to paralysis and coma ("furious" rabies), whereas paralytic rabies is less commonly diagnosed and typically presents with paralysis at the site of exposure that progresses as an ascending paralysis, ultimately leading to coma ("dumb" rabies). Once clinical signs appear, patients die quickly in the absence of intensive supportive care.

### Discrepancies in data reporting for rabies, Africa [^d58d2824]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In humans, rabies often develops with a wide variety of nonspecific clinical symptoms, and symptoms believed to be typical of rabies (e.g. foaming at the mouth, hydrophobia, and extreme aggressiveness) are frequently not observed. Approximately 30% of human rabies cases develop in the paralytic or dumb form, and the overlap of symptoms with those of other infections often leads to misdiagnosis. Apart from misdiagnosis, rabies exposures are often ignored or deemed as minimal in dog rabies–endemic areas of the world. Because dogs are common as companion animals in most cultures, the exposure risk is actually greater than for many other zoonotic diseases. However, postexposure prophylaxis is unlikely to be sought after lick-associated exposures to dogs. Some cultures are known to believe that the lick from a dog is useful for wound treatment. In conjunction with this belief, some cultures believe that the aggressive and uncharacteristic behavior of persons or animals with symptoms of rabies is caused by sorcery or demon possession. Far too often rabies patients end up at tribal or traditional healers whose treatments include exorcism, administration of toxic herbs, and other such undesirable interventions.

Rabies is one of the oldest recognized diseases in human history, and there is anecdotal evidence of its presence in Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the Mediterranean basin since antiquity. Because this evidence has been known for many years, an unfortunate consequence has been a loss of newsworthiness, which has compromised awareness and priority in public and professional practice. A contrasting example could be witnessed with the newly emerged influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which caused widespread panic and has received much attention over the 3 years since its emergence. In the 17 months from April 2009 through August 2010, a total of 18,000 deaths caused by swine-origin influenza (mostly associated with other primary risk factors) were recorded worldwide. In contrast, rabies is conservatively estimated to cause ≈50,000 deaths per year, mostly in children, and is not associated with any other health risk factors.

### Survival from rabies encephalitis [^7446558c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Rabies is a major public health problem in Asia and Africa, with nearly 60,000 deaths every year, and represents a substantial economic burden. Neurologists frequently encounter atypical cases, and need to make informed decisions regarding diagnosis and management. No therapy has been shown to unequivocally improve survival in rabies till date. Despite the overwhelmingly fatal nature of this disease, a small number of patients have been reported to survive acute rabies encephalitis with varying degrees of neurological sequelae. This paper presents the eleventh documented case of survival from rabies, which developed after being bitten by a stray dog, albeit with severe neurological residua. Similar to patients in previous reports, this man demonstrated a robust immune response as indicated by peripheral viral clearance and very high serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibody titres. Immunologically-mediated virus clearance therefore appears to be a prerequisite for survival. A detailed review of previously reported survivors, as well as descriptions of the host response and viral clearance in human rabies, current therapy for this disease and future directions in improving the currently dismal prognosis are provided.

### Exploring the role of infected keratinocytes during rabies virus infection [^fd4011f6]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes at least 59,000 human fatalities per year, of which most cases are reported in Asia and Africa. The disease is characterized by a lethal viral encephalitis that is caused by rabies virus (RABV) or a related lyssavirus. Lyssaviruses are transmitted via the saliva of infected animals, and 99% of the human cases are caused by bites of rabid dogs. Onset of disease can be prevented by rapid post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), consisting of vaccination and local wound treatment with anti-rabies immunoglobulins (RIG) in case the affected person was not previously vaccinated. While proper PEP can save lives, vaccines and especially RIG are often not available in rabies-endemic countries. Alarmingly, it is estimated that only 1–2% of exposed people in rabies-endemic countries have access to RIG. Delayed administration of PEP to a person bitten by a rabid animal allows virus particles from the saliva to infect peripheral nerves, such as those present at neuromuscular junctions. From this site the virus can spread retrograde via the axons to the spinal cord and will finally reach the brain where massive virus replication will occur, leading to the onset of neurological symptoms. Incubation times until the onset of clinical disease can range from a few weeks to several years. There is currently no treatment against rabies once clinical signs have developed and patients will succumb to the disease within an average of 5–11 days after the onset of neurological symptoms. Given this, rabies has a case-fatality rate that approaches 100%, making it the deadliest infectious disease worldwide.

### Use of a modified preexposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule to prevent human rabies: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^d3e3e3e3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Human rabies is an acute, progressive encephalomyelitis that is nearly always fatal once symptoms begin. Several measures have been implemented to prevent human rabies in the United States, including vaccination of targeted domesticated and wild animals, avoidance of behaviors that might precipitate an exposure (e.g. provoking high-risk animals), awareness of the types of animal contact that require postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and use of proper personal protective equipment when handling animals or laboratory specimens. PEP is widely available in the United States and highly effective if administered after an exposure occurs. A small subset of persons has a higher level of risk for being exposed to rabies virus than does the general U.S. population; these persons are recommended to receive preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a series of human rabies vaccine doses administered before an exposure occurs, in addition to PEP after an exposure. PrEP does not eliminate the need for PEP; however, it does simplify the rabies PEP schedule (i.e. eliminates the need for rabies immunoglobulin and decreases the number of vaccine doses required for PEP). As rabies epidemiology has evolved and vaccine safety and efficacy have improved, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations to prevent human rabies have changed. During September 2019–November 2021, the ACIP Rabies Work Group considered updates to the 2008 ACIP recommendations by evaluating newly published data, reviewing frequently asked questions, and identifying barriers to adherence to previous ACIP rabies vaccination recommendations. Topics were presented and discussed during six ACIP meetings. The following modifications to PrEP are summarized in this report: 1) redefined risk categories; 2) fewer vaccine doses in the primary vaccination schedule; 3) flexible options for ensuring long-term protection, or immunogenicity; 4) less frequent or no antibody titer checks for some risk groups; 5) a new minimum rabies antibody titer (0.5 international units [IUs]) per mL); and 6) clinical guidance, including for ensuring effective vaccination of certain special populations.

### Limbic system symptoms of rabies infection [^22ac9cf6]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Rabies is a fatal aggressive disease of the nervous system which predominantly causes motor and autonomic dysfunction. Limbic system involvement has been reported rarely, with limited data on its prevalence. The diagnosis becomes challenging when a patient presents with limbic system involvement in the absence of a clear history of an animal bite. We herein illustrate a case of a young man who presented with recurrent episodes of inappropriate ejaculation. He eventually developed hydrophobia and aerophobia, leading to a diagnosis of rabies. This case emphasises the importance of considering the possibility of rabies encephalitis when a patient presents with symptoms of limbic system involvement since early diagnosis helps in instituting appropriate public health measures and reducing exposure to infection. Furthermore, high-quality intensive care with supportive management is the mainstay of therapy in such patients until we have novel and effective antiviral drugs for rabies treatment.

### Human rabies-Utah, 2018 [^71e15bdb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Human rabies deaths are rare in the United States, and early recognition of the disease can reduce the number of health care–associated exposures and ensure timely receipt of PEP. Considerations for early recognition include providing education to medical providers (especially those in rural areas) regarding clinical symptoms, identifying patient exposures to wild animals such as bats, and emphasizing the importance of PEP if an exposure occurs. In Utah, humans and animals are most likely to be infected with rabies through exposure to bats, the only known rabies reservoir in Utah. * The Mexican free-tailed bat is the most common host species detected in Utah through public health surveillance (42% of all bats) followed by the Big Brown (21%) and the Silver Haired (15%).

During the past 10 years, an average of 95 bats per year were submitted to the Utah Public Health Laboratory for testing, with 15–25 bats found to be rabid; however, this only accounts for bats tested through the state laboratory and does not count all bats in Utah. The delayed diagnosis of rabies in the patient in this report prevented him from receiving any early treatment for rabies and also resulted in potential rabies exposures for 279 persons in multiple settings during the patient's infectious period. Structured collaboration between public health partners and health care facilities, as well as the use of online exposure assessment, permitted rapid assessment of exposed persons across numerous settings, facilitating timely recommendation and administration of PEP.

### Rabies encephalitis in a child: a failure of rabies post exposure prophylaxis? [^460c1026]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Rabies remains a serious public health problem in many developing countries. The diagnosis is easy when a non-immunised patient presents with hydrophobia and hypersalivation after a bite by a known rabid animal but more difficult when a patient presents atypical symptoms after having received rabies postexposure prophylaxis. Rabies postexposure prophylaxis failure is rare. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy who presented febrile seizure with agitation and cerebellar signs, without hydrophobia or hypersalivation, 17 days after a dog bite. Despite four doses of rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin, he died. Diagnostic confirmation of rabies encephalitis was made in post mortem on brain biopsies by fluorescent antibody technique.

### Reemerging rabies and lack of systemic surveillance in people's republic of China [^7c8cf236]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Carrier or Asymptomatic Rabies

Typically, rabies is fatal once clinical signs develop. Although persistent infections occur regularly for other virus infections, they have not been documented unquestionably in rabies, mainly because of the added complexity of the disease's relatively long incubation period. The carrier or asymptomatic rabies state was once considered to be important for public health, despite lack of adequate evidence that the phenomenon actually exists. This concern has been raised repeatedly from the early 1930s until recently. Reported carrier hosts have included vampire bats, cats, dogs, and hyenas. Because rabid dog bites are responsible for ≈99% of all human rabies cases in the world, the possibility of a carrier state or asymptomatic form of canine rabies deserves serious evaluation. Unfortunately, this possibility remains highly speculative. Although some investigators have questioned reports of a carrier state in dogs, an author reported RABV isolation from brains of healthy dogs. Carrier dog RABV isolates were even characterized at the molecular level in 1996.

### Discrepancies in data reporting for rabies, Africa [^522d8a75]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Rabies, despite its high case-fatality rate and preventability (through efficacious preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis), has in recent years progressively become established as a neglected disease, and most human cases are associated with dog rabies endemic to countries in Africa and Asia. However, there are numerous other serious infectious diseases that, like rabies, are underreported and linked with poverty in the developing world. How then should these diseases be prioritized?

This report presents considerations that influence the priority status of rabies, as well as issues that could differentiate rabies and should play a role in establishing the relative role of this disease in Africa and other parts of the developing world. It also discusses 1 key area that needs to be addressed before a bona fide demonstration of rabies incidence and progress toward effective dog rabies control will be feasible. This area is the need for true cooperation and synergy between global organizations and national authorities with respect to responsibilities related to effective and thorough surveillance with synchronized and responsible data reporting. Analyses of examples from Africa indicate that the above aspects are seriously compromised.

### Human rabies – south carolina, 2011 [^c77fe2b4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

This report describes the first human rabies death reported in South Carolina in more than 50 years. Human rabies has a protean clinical presentation that might be confused with other comorbidities, such as cardiac disease. Therefore, rabies should be considered for any progressive encephalitis of unknown etiology. Although human-to-human transmission has been well documented only in cases of organ or tissue transplantation, rabies virus transmission is considered possible through contamination of wounds or mucus membranes with saliva, tears, or neural tissue from infected patients. Use of appropriate protective equipment is vital for preventing health-care provider exposure to rabies virus when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed rabies. This includes use of face shields to protect mucous membranes and gloves or gowns to cover skin cuts when performing procedures, such as suctioning and spinal taps, which entail risk for exposure to infectious saliva or cerebrospinal fluid. Health-care providers should take standard precautions to prevent aerosol transmission during high-risk activities, such as intubation and suctioning.

What is already known on this topic?

Since 1995, over 90% of domestically acquired human rabies cases in the United States have been linked epidemiologically to bats. So-called "cryptogenic" human rabies (i.e. illness in patients who lack a definitive history of animal exposure) constitutes an increasing proportion of these bat-associated cases.

What is added by this report?

In December 2011, a woman aged 46 years was the first resident of South Carolina to die from rabies in more than 50 years. She had been hospitalized because of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, chills, and intermittent paresthesia; rabies was not suspected until family members revealed that bats had been observed in the patient's home during the previous summer. CDC confirmed infection with a rabies virus variant associated with free-tailed bats. Of 188 family, social, and health-care contacts, 22 persons (12%) were recommended for and received postexposure prophylaxis.

### Neurotropic virus infections as the cause of immediate and delayed neuropathology [^8e369268]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Rabies virus

Rabies is a neurological disease characterized by a fatal encephalitis, caused by RABV or one of the other lyssaviruses, which are usually transmitted through a bite or scratch of infected carnivores (terrestrial rabies) or bats (bat rabies). Rabies presents as either furious or paralytic rabies (67 and 33%, respectively). Approximately 55,000 to 60,000 people are reported to die annually as a result of rabies. Clinical manifestations of terrestrial and bat rabies are different. This difference may be associated with differences between strains of RABV from terrestrial carnivores and bats, as well as the route of viral spread. Patients infected with RABV typically go through different stages of disease: the incubation, prodromal, neurological, and comatose stages and finally death. The incubation time of rabies is on average 2 months, but can vary from weeks to up to 1 year. In the prodromal phase, patients may experience mild and non-specific symptoms such as fever and gastrointestinal discomfort. In the neurological phase, furious rabies patients may develop paresthesia at the site of exposure, anxiety or agitation, dysautonomia (autonomic dysfunction) including inspiratory spasms, hypersalivation hydrophobia, sometimes in combination with aerophobia and fluctuating mental state. Later in the disease, patients may develop altered levels of consciousness, before they eventually enter into the comatose stage. Patients with furious rabies who enter the comatose stage may develop flaccid limb weakness, which could be misinterpreted as paralytic rabies. The last stage of the disease is a painful and excruciating death. The paralytic form of rabies is rather characterized by progressive weakness and paralysis, with absence of many of the symptoms seen in the neurologic phase of furious rabies. Paralytic rabies is often misdiagnosed as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), autoimmune disease or stroke. In general, weakness is the initial manifestation in paralytic rabies and GBS. Paralytic rabies is more often seen in bat rabies and especially in patients who received post-exposure vaccination. The muscle weakness observed in paralytic rabies is likely caused by peripheral nerve dysfunction and/or the involvement of anterior horn cells or of motor nerve fibers. Bat-associated RABV infection usually presents with myoclonus, hemichorea and symptoms related to a one-side deficiency of the sympathetic trunk activity, such as a weak, droopy eyelid, constricted pupil, decreased sweating and in some cases an inset eyeball. The presence of myoedema and urinary incontinence in patients differentiate paralytic rabies from GBS.

Examples of High-Consequence Pathogens

Rabies

Rabies, one of the oldest known infectious diseases, is nearly 100% fatal and continues to cause tens of thousands of human deaths globally. Canine rabies has been eliminated in North America and many South American and European countries, but it is still the source of most human rabies cases in other areas, primarily in many African and Asian countries. Urbanization and lack of aggressive rabies elimination programs may have contributed to resurgence of canine rabies–associated human deaths in several provinces in China. In the United States, the number of human deaths from rabies has declined to an average of 3 cases per year during the last several decades. Apart from a few imported canine rabies cases, most human cases in the United States resulted primarily from bat rabies virus variants. Nonetheless, suspected or confirmed human exposures in the United States result in tens of thousands of postexposure prophylaxis regimens every year.

### Rabies specimen collection… [^94a7589c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Always consult your state health department before collecting and submitting samples to the CDC National Rabies Reference Laboratory. After consulting with the state health department, direct any remaining questions can be directed to the CDC rabies duty officer at 404-639-1050. Specimen types Antemortem samples Antemortem rule-out testing involves multiple specimen types and assays. To rule out rabies before death, saliva, nuchal skin biopsy, serum, and cerebral spinal fluid all must be collected and tested. All tests must be negative to rule out rabies. Saliva
- Patients with rabies intermittently shed saliva.
- It may be necessary to collect of four or more samples over 24 hours.
- Using a sterile eyedropper pipette, collect saliva and place it in a small sterile container that can be sealed securely.
- Do not add preservatives or additional material.
- Tracheal aspirates and sputum are not suitable for rabies tests, and contamination with blood can reduce test accuracy. Saliva is tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of extracted nucleic acids to detect rabies RNA. Serum
- Collect at least 0. 5 mL of serum; do not add preservatives.
- Do not send whole blood.
- Indicate if vaccine or rabies immune serum have been given. Serum is tested using an indirect fluorescent antibody test and a virus neutralization test to detect rabies antibodies. The presence of antibodies to rabies virus in the serum can confirm a rabies diagnosis if no rabies vaccine or immune serum have been administered. Cerebrospinal fluid
- Collect at least 0. 5 mL of CSF.
- Do not add preservatives.
- Indicate if vaccine or rabies immune serum has been given. CSF is tested using an indirect fluorescent antibody test and a virus neutralization test to detect rabies antibodies.

Antibody to rabies virus in CSF, regardless of immunization history, suggests a rabies virus infection. Rabies virus, antigen, and RNA are rarely found in CSF; therefore, antigen and molecular test methods are not routinely performed. Postmortem diagnosis of rabies is made by immunofluorescent staining of viral antigen in touch impressions of the medulla, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus.

Animal rabies epidemiology — Wild terrestrial carnivores — Raccoons, skunks, and foxes are the terrestrial carnivores most often infected with rabies in the United States; suggestive clinical signs cannot be interpreted reliably and all bites by such wildlife should be considered possible exposures to rabies virus. Wild terrestrial carnivores that are available for diagnostic testing should be euthanized as soon as possible and the brain submitted for rabies diagnosis; if the results are negative by immunofluorescence, human rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is not necessary. Other factors that might influence the urgency of decision-making before diagnostic results are known include the species, the animal's appearance and behavior, whether the encounter was provoked, and the severity and location of bites.

Rabies — Pediatric risk considerations note that children are at greater risk for rabies exposure and subsequent illness because of their inquisitive nature and inability to read behavioral cues from dogs and other animals. The smaller a child's stature, the more likely they are to experience severe bites to high-risk areas such as the head and face, and children's attraction to animals plus the possibility that they might not report an exposure also contribute to higher risk.

### Human rabies-Utah, 2018 [^8f9da830]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

On November 3, 2018, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) was notified of a suspected human rabies case in a man aged 55 years. The patient's symptoms had begun 18 days earlier, and he was hospitalized for 15 days before rabies was suspected. As his symptoms worsened, he received supportive care, but he died on November 4. On November 7, a diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by CDC. This was the first documented rabies death in a Utah resident since 1944. This report summarizes the patient's clinical course and the subsequent public health investigation, which determined that the patient had handled several bats in the weeks preceding symptom onset. Public health agencies, in partnership with affected health care facilities, identified and assessed the risk to potentially exposed persons, facilitated receipt of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and provided education to health care providers and the community about the risk for rabies associated with bats. Human rabies is rare and almost always fatal. The findings from this investigation highlight the importance of early recognition of rabies, improved public awareness of rabies in bats, and the use of innovative tools after mass rabies exposure events to ensure rapid and recommended risk assessment and provision of PEP.

Rabies transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis in travelers — The normal and most successful mode of rabies virus transmission is via the bite of a rabid animal, and viral shedding typically occurs just days prior to onset of clinical signs in infected animals and humans. In the context of foreign travel, any bite or scratch exposure from a mammal that is not available for observation and is consistent with the World Health Organization's (WHO's) case definition for a suspected rabid animal should lead to rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, and observation is rarely an option in the context of foreign travel. International health agencies have only established observation periods for dogs, cats, and ferrets, and in those animals an animal that stays healthy for 10 days after the exposure event is considered not to have been infectious for rabies at the time of the exposure. Exposure of highly innervated tissues (e.g., those in the face and hands) can increase the risk for successful infection, exposures occurring closer to the central nervous system (CNS) (e.g., head, neck) can potentially shorten the incubation period, and rabies virus can be found in central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissue, and in tears; infection from non-bite exposures has occurred, but human-to-human transmission generally does not occur.

### Human rabies – Minnesota, 2007 [^70ff4cb9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

On October 20, 2007, a Minnesota resident died from rabies, approximately 1 month after initial symptoms of limb paresthesia, which progressed to flaccid weakness and ataxia. This was the only human rabies case reported in the United States in 2007. A presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic transverse myelitis was considered initially, because of abnormalities detected via spinal cord imaging studies and a lack of laboratory confirmation of a specific infectious etiology. The presumptive diagnosis subsequently was changed to include rabies, based on the patient's rapidly deteriorating neurologic status and elicitation of a history involving bat exposure during the month before illness onset. This report summarizes the medical and epidemiologic investigation by the Minnesota Department of Public Health and CDC and the ensuing public health response. The findings underscore the need for early inclusion of rabies in the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive encephalitis, improved public awareness of the risks associated with animal bites, and appropriate rabies prophylaxis after exposure.

### Rabies symptoms and specimen collection… [^edf16b7c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of rabies After a rabies exposure, the rabies virus must travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is the incubation period. It may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on:

- the location of the exposure site,
- the severity of exposure,
- the age of the patient, and
- whether the person had ever received a rabies vaccine. The first symptoms of rabies, called prodrome, may be like the flu, including weakness, discomfort, fever, or headache. There also may be discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. These symptoms may last for several days. Usually, severe disease appears within two weeks of the first symptoms, when the rabies virus causes brain dysfunction. Rabies symptoms in humans may include one or more of the following:

- Anxiety
- Insomnia
- Confusion
- Agitation
- Delirium
- Hallucinations
- Hydrophobia
- Hypersalivation
- Seizures Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. Less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented. Only a few survivors had no history of rabies vaccination before disease onset. Positive Indicators for rabies
- Nonspecific prodrome phase prior to onset of neurologic signs
- **Neurologic signs consistent with encephalitis or myelitis**:

Negative Indicators for rabies
- Improvement or no change in neurologic status after several weeks of illness
- Illness persisting greater than 4 weeks
- A diagnosis of an alternative cause for encephalitis.

### Human rabies-Utah, 2018 [^d35654cd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

On November 3, 2018, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) was notified of a suspected human rabies case in a man aged 55 years. The patient's symptoms had begun 18 days earlier, and he was hospitalized for 15 days before rabies was suspected. As his symptoms worsened, he received supportive care, but he died on November 4. On November 7, a diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by CDC. This was the first documented rabies death in a Utah resident since 1944. This report summarizes the patient's clinical course and the subsequent public health investigation, which determined that the patient had handled several bats in the weeks preceding symptom onset. Public health agencies, in partnership with affected health care facilities, identified and assessed the risk to potentially exposed persons, facilitated receipt of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and provided education to health care providers and the community about the risk for rabies associated with bats. Human rabies is rare and almost always fatal. The findings from this investigation highlight the importance of early recognition of rabies, improved public awareness of rabies in bats, and the use of innovative tools after mass rabies exposure events to ensure rapid and recommended risk assessment and provision of PEP.

### Overlap of pathology in paralytic rabies and axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome [^88185ddc]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

We describe clinical and pathological features of a case of paralytic rabies with acute axonal neuropathy that closely resembled axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome. This case emphasizes that there is overlap of both clinical and pathological features in paralytic rabies and axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome. These findings raise the possibility that infectious and autoimmune etiologies can lead to similar morphological changes in the nerves.

### Rabies encephalitis [^3dd8e84e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Rabies is an almost always fatal disease that physicians and patients dread due to its dismal prognosis and limited treatment options. Transmission of this disease occurs through the bite of dogs and wild animals (like jackal in our case). Other rare forms of transmission may be through inhalation in bat-infested caves and human-to-human transmission by infected corneal transplants, solid organ and tissue transplantation, and sometimes in laboratory settings. Its diagnosis is usually clinical in the absence of availability of special laboratory investigations at the point-of-care facility. Few people have described the role of imaging in diagnosis. We hereby report a patient with rabies encephalitis, having a history of jackal bite and classical MRI findings that we can use for early diagnosis in the absence of typical clinical features and specialised diagnostic testing.

### Evidence of rabies virus exposure among humans in the Peruvian amazon [^19e1ed4f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Rabies has the highest case fatality rate of any conventional infectious disease, approaching 100%. The likelihood of a productive rabies infection after exposure to a lyssavirus is known to depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to dose, route of exposure, site of exposure, variant, host genetic makeup, pre- and/or post-exposure prophylaxis (PreEP and PEP, respectively), etc. All mammals are susceptible to lyssavirus infection, but species-level variation in susceptibility has long been recognized. Among reservoir species, foxes and other canids seem to be quite susceptible to RABV infection, characterized by little to no (e.g. 0–5%) rabies virus neutralizing antibody (rVNA) seroprevalence (i.e. animals developing virus neutralizing antibodies after RABV exposure) among natural populations. Contrastingly, bat populations seem to be less susceptible to RABV infection and are characterized by relatively high (e.g. 5–50%) rVNA seroprevalence in the wild.–One experiment suggested that non-human primates might be resistant to infection from rabid bats, but bat-associated human rabies deaths worldwide show human susceptibility to lyssavirus infection by bat bite.–The work by Bellargued provocatively that abortive RABV infections were readily observed and reproducible in animals, and thus, they should be considered a possible outcome for humans. Reports of human survival after rabies infection, despite clinical presentation, are quite rare in the literature.–However, a recent case of presumed abortive rabies infection in the United States highlights a rare event of human survival after presentation of clinical symptoms and minimal intervention treatment.

The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors for bat and RABV exposure in Amazonian communities that were suspected to be at high risk of vampire bat depredation based on their proximity to recent outbreaks in Perú and rural living conditions. A survey questionnaire was used to capture demographic information of the study populations, salient details of any previous bat exposure, and self-reported vaccination history among respondents sampled.

### From initial suspicion to accurate diagnosis: unmasking rabies in a case of suspected Guillain-Barre syndrome [^3f0fe5e6]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rabies virus is a highly neurotropic pathogen that affects the central nervous system (CNS), causing acute encephalitis. It's a single-stranded negative RNA virus belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family and the Lyssavirus genus. The virus is mainly transmitted by the saliva of wild animals that infect wounds, bites, or scratches. Common reservoirs include dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Following viral inoculation, it travels through the peripheral nerves to replicate in the spinal ganglia, where the signs and symptoms begin. These include pain and paresthesias at the wound site, flu-like symptoms, fever, delirium, convulsions, hydrophobia, and paralysis. Rabies can present in two distinct forms: the furious (encephalitic) form which is the most common (80% of cases), characterized by fluctuating consciousness, inspiratory spasms, hydrophobia, and signs of autonomic dysfunction; and the paralytic form, which begins with ascending muscle weakness and preserves consciousness until the later stages of the disease. Without treatment, both forms inevitably lead to coma and death.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the peripheral nerves. Demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis is the classic form of GBS, characterized by ascending paralysis, areflexia, and elevated CSF protein without pleocytosis. Paralytic rabies can mimic GBS due to its similar presentation, starting with weakness in the bitten extremity and progressing to quadriparesis and bifacial weakness.

The encephalitic stage of rabies frequently indicated by hydrophobia and anxiety. Fever, tachycardia, excessive salivation, delirium and other signs of autonomic instability become more apparent as the disease progress. As the encephalitis worsen, cranial nerve deficit may occur such as ophthalmoplegia, facial palsy and bulbar dysfunction. The presence of these signs raises the possibility of an infectious etiology rather than autoimmune processes.

Despite being a well-known clinical entity, paralytic rabies remains challenging to diagnose and requires a high index of suspicion, especially when it presents with atypical features, as seen in our case that closely resembled GBS.

### Estimating the public health impact of rabies [^b350cdbb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The value of providing a quantitative estimate of disease impact due to rabies, even with the inaccuracies of existing case data, should not be underestimated. Rabies is often perceived as a rare or insignificant disease of humans in developing countries; this perception has been a major factor hampering the development of disease control initiatives. Furthermore, control of rabies is often seen as the responsibility of veterinary authorities, but demonstration of the public health importance of rabies and the benefits of disease control to the public health authorities (both in terms of DALYs saved and reduced costs of postexposure treatment) will encourage involvement of the health sector in control efforts. Integration of medical and veterinary sectors is likely to be crucial for effective disease control, as shown by the success of recent rabies control programs in Central and South America, where medical authorities have taken a lead role in implementing mass dog vaccination programs.

This first estimate of a global DALY score for rabies, together with the Tanzania-specific example, indicates that the disease exerts a considerable public health impact, exceeding other prominent diseases that currently achieve a higher priority for disease control. Furthermore, the human disease effects of rabies could be eliminated through vaccination of animal reservoirs by using technologies and methods that are available and accessible.

### Key points… [^e14b38dc]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Rabies is an acute disease that typically causes death within four weeks of symptom onset.
- Initial symptoms of rabies are flu-like; advanced cases present with brain dysfunction.
- All patients with rabies present with encephalitis.
- Clinicians who suspect a patient has rabies should consult with their public health department to determine the need and procedures for diagnostic testing. Common signs and symptoms After a rabies exposure in the absence of post-exposure prophylaxis, the virus must travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms. Therefore, the incubation period may last for weeks to months based on:

- Location of the exposure site
- Severity of exposure
- Patient age, as younger children may have shortened incubation periods
- Rabies vaccination status.

The first symptoms of human rabies may last for several days:

- Prodrome including weakness, discomfort, fever, or headache
- Discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite Usually, severe disease causes brain dysfunction within two weeks of the first symptoms. Signs of dysfunction may include one or more of the following:

- Anxiety
- Insomnia
- Confusion
- Agitation
- Delirium
- Hallucinations
- Hydrophobia
- Hypersalivation
- Seizures Rabies causes encephalitis in infected patients. While all patients with encephalitis may not have rabies, all patients with rabies present with encephalitis. Rabies is rare in the U. S., and other more common causes of encephalitis should be ruled out before pursuing rabies testing unless a recent suspect rabies exposure occurred. Rabies and encephalitis. Clinical assessment Rabies presents as a severe, acute illness with hospitalization required within days to several weeks of initial symptom onset.

Positive indicators for rabies
- Nonspecific prodrome phase prior to onset of neurologic signs
- Neurologic signs consistent with encephalitis or myelitis
- Dysphagia, hydrophobia, paresis, and autonomic instability
- Progression of neurologic signs
- Negative test results for other etiologies of encephalitis
- Herpesvirus, arboviruses, enteroviruses, autoimmune disorders, certain cancers.

### Human rabies-Texas, 2021 [^3f5260a5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

In late August 2021, a boy aged 7 years was bitten by a bat while he was playing outside his apartment home in Medina County, Texas. He informed his parents; however, no rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) was sought because there were no visible bite marks, and the family was unaware that contact with a bat, including in the absence of visible bite marks, might cause rabies. Approximately 2 months later, the child was hospitalized for altered mental status, seizures, and hypersalivation and ultimately received a diagnosis of rabies. Experimental therapies were attempted; however, the child died 22 days after symptom onset. Fifty-seven persons who met criteria for suspected or known exposure to infectious secretions in this case were advised to consult with a medical provider about the need for rabies PEP in accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines. Rabies, an acute, progressive neuroencephalitis, is nearly always fatal. Although dogs are the most common source of human rabies deaths worldwide and account for an estimated 59,000 annual cases of human rabies globally, bats are the most common source of domestically acquired rabies in the United States and have been implicated in 31 (81.6%) of 38 human infections since 2000. Attempts to prevent death or poor neurologic outcomes once rabies symptoms develop have been largely unsuccessful. Administration of rabies PEP, comprising rabies immunoglobulin and a series of doses of rabies vaccine, is critical to preventing rabies after an exposure; enhanced public education about the risk posed by bats, and the availability of PEP to prevent rabies, is needed.

### From initial suspicion to accurate diagnosis: unmasking rabies in a case of suspected Guillain-Barre syndrome [^47b227d0]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rabies is a fatal viral infection with clinical presentation that can mimic other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Both conditions can present in early stages with same signs, including muscle weakness and paralysis, leading to diagnostic confusion. In this case report, we present a patient residing in Palestine who was initially diagnosed with GBS but was later found to have rabies. Early diagnosis of rabies is important because once clinical symptoms appear, the disease almost fatal. This case highlights the importance of increased awareness and consideration of rabies in differential diagnoses, especially in areas where the disease is endemic.

Case presentation

We describe an 8-year-old male patient presenting with bilateral lower limb weakness, areflexia, urinary incontinence, and progressive respiratory decline, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. A lumbar puncture indicated elevated protein and zero cells, Brain and spinal MRI revealed enhancement of the cauda equina roots consistent with GBS. Despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), his condition worsened. Rabies was suspected after a history of a stray dog scratch two months prior and a nuchal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient's condition worsened, and he developed seizures, heart block, and cardiorespiratory arrest, leading to death on hospital day 17.

Conclusion

This case emphasizes the need to include rabies in the differential diagnosis for patients with rapidly worsening neurological symptoms, especially in endemic areas. Early detection of rabies is crucial as its progression is rapid and fatal, highlighting the importance of early intervention and post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals at risk.

### Atypical rabies with MRI findings: clue to the diagnosis [^979b4c21]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Rabies is known for most as a fatal infectious disease, mainly transmitted to both humans and animals through bites by rabid animals. In its classical form, rabies is well recognised, but when it presents atypically in paralytic form, it may become difficult to distinguish from Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or myelitis, particularly where history is not forthcoming or concealed. The authors report here an atypical case of paralytic rabies presenting with descending paralysis followed by furious form where clue to suspicion was MRI findings. Imaging in rabies is seldom done. MRI ﬁndings of rabies encephalitis are well known, but in myelitis these need to be further characterised. The authors present MRI ﬁndings in a conﬁrmed case of rabies myelitis. The differential diagnosis of the imaging ﬁndings as well as the role and the relevance of imaging in the diagnosis of this disease are discussed.

### Human rabies-Missouri, 2008 [^d3e05417]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

On November 24, 2008, the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory notified CDC of suspected rabies in a man aged 55 years from Missouri. The man had been bitten by a bat 4–6 weeks before symptom onset and had not sought medical care at the time of the bite. After visiting two emergency departments (EDs) with symptoms consistent with rabies, he was hospitalized on November 23 and treated using the Milwaukee protocol. On November 26, infection with a rabies virus variant associated with silver-haired bats was confirmed. The patient died on November 30. This report summarizes the patient's treatment and clinical course. The report highlights the importance of raising public awareness of rabies, particularly the risk for rabies after bat and other wildlife exposures. Health-care providers should maintain a high clinical suspicion for rabies in patients with a recent animal bite history and unexplained encephalitis.

### Rabies: relevance, prevention, and management in travel medicine [^6a0f5b34]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease, transmitted only in mammals. Terrestrial rabies, predominantly transmitted by dogs, is the most important rabies cycle threatening humans. The causative neurotropic virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus of the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. This genus contains several rabies-related viruses. All variants are known or suspected to cause rabieslike diseases. Transmission occurs by the virus entering through the skin or the mucosa after bites, scratches, or preexisting injuries contaminated by the saliva of an infected mammal. Only 51 human rabies cases that have not been transmitted by animal bites are described.

### Rabies viral encephalitis: clinical determinants in diagnosis with special reference to paralytic form [^74e74136]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rabies is an important public health problem in developing countries such as India where an alarmingly high incidence of the infection is reported every year despite the availability of highly effective, potent and safe vaccines. In clinical practice, diagnosis of the furious (encephalitic) form of rabies poses little difficulty. In contrast, the paralytic form poses a diagnostic dilemma, to distinguish it from Guillain-Barré syndrome. The problem is further compounded in the absence of a history of dog bite, clinical features resembling a psychiatric syndrome.

Method

The present study analysed the spectrum of neurological manifestations in 47 cases of rabies encephalitis (34 paralytic, six encephalitic, and seven psychiatric manifestations) from two hospitals in south India, confirmed at post-mortem by demonstration of a viral antigen in the brain. A history of dog bite was elicited in 33 patients and fox bite in one. Twenty-two patients received postexposure prophylaxis. The incubation period ranged from 7 days to 4 years. Clinical features were analysed, looking for any clinical pointers that provide clues to a diagnosis of paralytic rabies.

Results and Discussion

Fever, distal paresthaesias, fasciculation, alteration in sensorium, rapid progression of symptoms and pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid should alert the neurologist to consider rabies encephalomyelitis. Detection of the viral antigen in the corneal smear and a skin biopsy from the nape of the neck had limited usefulness in the ante-mortem diagnosis. Although a few clinical signs may help indicate rabies encephalomyelitis antemortem, confirmation requires neuropathological/neurovirological assistance. The preponderance of atypical/paralytic cases in this series suggests that neurologists and psychiatrists need to have a high index of clinical suspicion, particularly in the absence of a history of dog bite.

### Human rabies – south carolina, 2011 [^510547b2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Public health officials at the local, state, and national levels should work closely with non–health-care entities that receive public inquiries concerning wildlife to establish a standard referral process and regularly scheduled training about rabies risks. The diagnosis of rabies should be considered in patients hospitalized with progressive encephalopathy when other causes cannot be found or with a known history of animal exposure. This can lead to earlier adoption of staffing and infection control measures to decrease the number of health-care workers exposed to infectious body fluids or tissue for whom rabies postexposure prophylaxis might subsequently need to be provided.

Bat exposure in the home was the likely source of infection in this case. Over 90% of domestically acquired human rabies cases reported in United States since 1995 have been linked epidemiologically to bats. Cryptogenic human rabies (i.e. cases where a definitive history of animal exposure is lacking) constitutes an increasing proportion of these bat-associated cases. Rabies virus transmission can occur from seemingly minor or unrecognized bites. A complete rabies virus exposure risk assessment is recommended for any person reporting potential exposure to a bat, even in the absence of a documented bite.

The patient in this case sought information on bat removal but was not advised of the health risks associated with bat exposures. Lack of referral to guidance concerning health risks associated with bats living in the home was possibly a missed opportunity to prevent rabies infection. Because authority over wildlife management and animal bite reporting varies among states, citizens might reach out to diverse entities, including public health, animal control, law enforcement, or wildlife agencies, as initial points of contact for bat concerns. Provision of training, educational resources, and expert consultation to agencies, institutions, and organizations that provide assistance with wildlife concerns is a valuable public health service. Such service requires strong partnerships and clear communication among public health officials and diverse community partners.

Human rabies is preventable by avoiding contact with animal vectors and by receiving prompt and appropriate wound care and PEP after a suspected rabies virus exposure. Public health officials should work closely with non–health-care partners that receive public inquiries concerning wildlife to establish a standard referral process and regularly scheduled training about rabies risks. The public should also be educated about the risk for rabies from bat exposures, and options for the safe removal and exclusion of bats from human dwellings.

### Imaging findings in rabies encephalitis [^b6dc8054]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Summary

Rabies encephalitis is perhaps one of the few infectious diseases that command attention and fear not only from the layman but also from physicians. The unique mode of transmission, the virtually exclusive neurotransmission shown by the agent, and the complete hopelessness of the established disease sets rabies apart from other zoonoses transmitted to man. Rabies encephalitis is a fatal disease and its diagnosis is usually based on the clinical presentations and findings. Hence, imaging in rabies is seldom done, and imaging findings in rabies encephalitis have rarely been described. We present the imaging findings in two confirmed cases of rabies encephalitis in which antemortem diagnosis was obtained by corneal impression smears showing the presence of viral antigens. The differential diagnosis of the imaging findings as well as the role and the relevance of imaging in the diagnosis of this disease are discussed. The current literature on the subject is also reviewed.

### Probable rabies virus transmission through organ transplantation, China, 2015 [^0eff50a6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Based on a regulation issued by the China Ministry of Health in 2006, organs or tissues from HIV-infected or AIDS patients, hepatitis B virus carriers, and persons with other bloodborne diseases, syphilis, or malignant tumors cannot be used for transplantation. Rabies was not specifically mentioned in the regulation, so it is a challenge to have donors screened for rabies. In some remote or rural areas in China, it is difficult to definitively diagnose the cause of infectious encephalitis, and rabies cases with atypical symptoms might be misdiagnosed. Given that laboratory diagnosis of rabies can only be conducted at prefecture-level and above China CDC laboratories, it is difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis of suspected rabies cases within the short window of time for organ transplantations. Therefore, to reduce infections transmitted from organ donors, we recommend development and implementation of standard questionnaires or tables for use in interviewing relatives of persons who died from infectious encephalitis to identify any rabies exposure history and associated symptoms. Implementation of this questionnaire would prompt regional CDCs to collect specimens from potential donors in time for testing. Cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and skin biopsies are generally considered as critical samples for antemortem human rabies testing, and brain tissue is considered critical for postmortem confirmation. If time does not permit testing, the presence of infectious encephalitis symptoms in the donor should lead to a determination that organs and tissues are not suitable for transplantation, especially in regions with a high incidence of rabies.

### Case reports: survival from rabies: case series from India [^603aa2c5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Rabies, a zoonotic viral encephalitis, continues to be a serious public health problem in India and several other countries in Asia and Africa. Survival is rarely reported in rabies, which is considered to be almost universally fatal. We report the clinical and radiological findings of eight patients with laboratory-confirmed rabies who survived the illness. With the exception of one patient who recovered with mild sequelae, all survivors had poor functional outcomes. The reported survival from rabies in recent years may reflect an increased awareness of the disease and greater access to better critical care facilities in rabies-endemic countries. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need to focus on preventive strategies to reduce the burden of this dreadful disease in rabies-endemic countries.

### Vital signs: trends in human rabies deaths and exposures-United States, 1938–2018 [^d08b9fcc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

A critical component of rabies prevention in the United States is to avoid contact with wildlife, especially bats. Contact with a bat includes bites and scratches, which are often small and can be overlooked. Contact might also occur unknowingly if a bat is present in a room with a young child or mentally impaired person, including a child or person under the influence of medication, drugs, or alcohol or a person who is asleep. In those cases where unrecognized contact might have occurred, persons should assume they have a potential exposure to rabies if the bat is not available for testing and urgently seek care from their medical provider. If the bat can be safely collected and tested, this can inform the need for PEP.

CDC Travelers' Health provides vaccination recommendations for international travelers. Although the risk of travel-associated rabies infection is generally low, travelers should know the risk, avoid contact with animals, have a plan to get care if they are scratched or bitten, and have travel health insurance to pay for treatment should they need it. Travelers at higher risk (i.e. those who might be working with animals abroad or come into close contact with animals while traveling) should additionally consider preexposure prophylaxis vaccination and be aware that PEP is still recommended after a potential exposure, even among vaccinated persons.

Human rabies is 99% fatal. However, it is 100% preventable through vaccinating pets against rabies, avoiding contact with wildlife and unknown animals, and seeking medical care as soon as possible after being bitten or scratched by an animal.

### Recovery of a patient from clinical rabies – Wisconsin, 2004 [^c6be0fee]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

Rabies is a viral infection of the central nervous system, usually contracted from the bite of an infected animal, and is nearly always fatal without proper postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). In October 2004, a previously healthy female aged 15 years in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, received a diagnosis of rabies after being bitten by a bat approximately 1 month before symptom onset. This report summarizes the investigation conducted by the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH), the public health response in Fond du Lac County, and the patient's clinical course through December 17. This is the first documented recovery from clinical rabies by a patient who had not received either pre- or postexposure prophylaxis for rabies.

### Human rabies cluster following badger bites, people's republic of China [^0050ae4e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor: From February 2002 to April 2004, 7 rural residents of Coteau County (population 450,000) in western Zhejiang Province in eastern People's Republic of China died of rabies following badger bites (Figure). In this county, 89% of residents are farmers. The county covers 4,475 km 2, and the terrain is mountainous. No other cases of human rabies had been reported from this county since 1986. We investigated the cluster to ascertain characteristics of these exposures.

Figure
Badger: a new natural reservoir of human rabies? (Image source: Ian Stickland)

Rabies testing was not readily available. In China, the national case definition is based on clinical compatibility with appropriate animal exposure. Doctors are required to report rabies according to a general case description published by the Ministry of Health. Laboratory confirmation is not generally performed. We defined a rabies case as any person from Coteau County in whom rabies was diagnosed by a physician from February 2002 through March 31, 2007. We interviewed family members of case-patients and neighbors about the characteristics of the illness and activities associated with badgers, dogs, and other animals that are potential rabies reservoirs.

From February 2002 to April 2007, a total of 8 human rabies cases were reported from Coteau County. Seven case-patients had badger exposure and 1 had cat exposure. Badger-associated rabies occurred from February 2002 to December 2004; 1- to 2-month intervals generally occurred between cases. The average yearly incidence rate for human rabies in the county was 0.52 per 100,000 compared to 0.15 per 100,000 for China for the same period. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 76 years (mean 54 years). Badger-associated rabies was confined to 7 contiguous townships in the center of the county. Signs and symptoms were typical of rabies, namely, fever, excitation, aerophobia, hydrophobia, dysphagia, and hypersalivation, leading to coma and death. Incubation periods ranged from 31 to 100 days (mean 45 days).

### Canine rabies ecology in Southern Africa [^e275921b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Rabies Virus Biology

Rabies virus is transmitted in saliva through the bite of an infected animal. After gaining entry to the central nervous system by peripheral nerves, it causes encephalitis, leading to fulminant, progressive neurologic disease, characterized by excitement, muscular paralysis, impaired responses to social and environmental signals, and other abnormal neurologic signs. The incubation period is unusually variable and can be long; clinical disease and virus shedding are not seen during this period. Infection of the salivary glands during the clinical stage leads to shedding of virions in saliva.

Rabies virus has a broad mammalian host range. However, in any ecologic zone, a single species, the maintenance host, is usually principally responsible for supporting the virus cycle. The virus variant of the maintenance host is intimately adapted to the host's physiology and biochemistry to ensure effective transmission. Maintenance hosts are usually extremely sensitive to their variant but relatively resistant to rabies virus variants of other species. In maintenance hosts, the probability is high that the virus will establish infection, will induce the appropriate behavioral changes, such as aggressive biting behavior, and will prolong the clinical survival period in which salivary virus shedding takes place; all of these factors lead to maximal virus transmission.

### From initial suspicion to accurate diagnosis: unmasking rabies in a case of suspected Guillain-Barre syndrome [^dd87b8a6]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rabies can be in the form of either furious or paralytic. One third of patients develop the paralytic form. Although the paralytic form resembles GBS, there are several points that help differentiating these two disorders (Table 3). Our patient initially presented with fever which treated as tonsillitis. Later, acute lower limb paralysis occurred. CSF and MRI findings increased the index of suspicion for GBS and treated as such. However, the rapid progression of symptoms and the subsequent emergence of encephalitic features, along with a later history of a dog scratch, were key factors that guided us to the correct diagnosis of the paralytic form of rabies.

Table 3
Comparison between furious and paralytic forms of rabies

It's challenging to distinguish between GBS and paralytic rabies based on neuroimaging without a typical history of a dog bite as both can present with cauda equina nerve root enhancement (Table 4). Furthermore, in contrast to the typical Brain MRI findings of comatose phase of rabies as well as furious form of rabies, our patient's brain MRI remained unremarkable during the course of the disease even when repeated at later stages.

### Cost-effectiveness evaluation of a novel integrated bite case management program for the control of human rabies, Haiti 2014–2015 [^4401b50c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Last, we only included costs per outpatient visits and assumed that no bite victim was hospitalized, as the evidence suggests that only a few episodes of rabies, if any, are hospitalized, probably because once symptoms appear the disease is almost always fatal. But we cannot confirm that this was always the case, due to limitations in reporting, surveillance, and laboratory capacity, and to the similarity of clinical symptoms of rabies with other diseases, such as cerebral malaria. Our results confirmed that rabies is underreported in Haiti, and our estimated deaths under the HARSP scenario seem reasonable and in agreement with previous estimates of rabies burden in the country.

Overall, HARSP substantially reduced the expected risk of rabies transmission, resulting in more averted deaths and YLG, and was more cost-effective than the scenario without HARSP (NBCM). However, implementing and operating HARSP was more costly to the government than not having the program largely due to active community investigation components and the associated higher PEP costs. Additionally, HARSP helped to establish a better estimate of the disease burden of rabies in the three communes where the program operated, reduce the number of expected deaths from rabies exposures, and determine categories of dog rabies infections (i.e. confirmed, probable, suspected, and negative) for a more targeted use of PEP regimes. Improved surveillance data from HARSP can be used to track rabies disease burden, evaluate intervention programs and strategies, and focus on disease elimination. In sum, HARSP offers a cost-effective human rabies prevention solution for countries transitioning from reactive to preventive strategies (i.e. comprehensive dog vaccination). This evaluation is intended to provide policy-makers, donors, and the public affected by dog rabies with evidence to inform decisions about rabies prevention and program replication.

Human Rabies Case Data

A human case of rabies was defined according to diagnostic criteria (WS281–2008) of the Health Department of the People's Republic of China. A person with rabies had to have the following features: a history of being bitten or scratched by a dog, cat, or a wild animal, or had a wound that was licked by these animals; and clinical manifestations of itching, pain, numbness, and formication around the healed wound, followed by hyperactivity, hydrophobia, aerophobia, spasms of the pharyngeal muscle, and sympathetic excitability. The prodromal stage of paralytic rabies shows hyperpyrexia, headache, emesis, and pain at the site of the wound. Muscles of patients gradually become paralyzed, and patients with rabies die of cardiorespiratory arrest within a few days.

A case-patient with laboratory-diagnosed rabies had RABV antigen, antibody, or nucleic acid was detected in specimens. In China, rabies is a reportable disease; all human cases are reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and nearly all cases are confirmed by clinical features, rather than laboratory diagnosis. A person who satisfied these criteria was confirmed as having a clinical case of rabies.

Human rabies case data were obtained from an infectious disease database report that was officially compiled by the Yunnan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Chinese CDC. Detailed information was obtained by epidemiologic investigations. These data were sorted and analyzed by using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and a descriptive epidemiologic method.

### Vital signs: trends in human rabies deaths and exposures-United States, 1938–2018 [^5c99f4d0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusions

Bats are currently the leading cause of human rabies deaths in the United States. Unlike rabies management programs targeting raccoon, fox, and coyote populations, bat vaccination is not yet logistically feasible, nor are any rabies vaccines currently approved for use in bats. Despite the rabies exposure risk, the vast majority of bats submitted for testing (94%) do not have rabies. Thus, widespread killing of bats is not recommended to prevent rabies. However, increased awareness of the risk for rabies from bats and knowledge of when to seek medical attention for PEP are needed. In addition to bat rabies cases, international travel-related rabies cases occur because of a lack of awareness about the ongoing global risk of rabies in dogs.

Efforts to control rabies in wildlife and maintain canine rabies elimination in the United States require ongoing, high-quality rabies surveillance and timely response capabilities. Rabies continues to be a priority zoonotic disease for One Health collaboration, requiring multi-agency cooperation to ensure continued success of the U.S. rabies control program. Currently, U.S. public health laboratories and United States Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services test approximately 100,000 animals per year, and approximately 5,000 are rabies-positive. Although CRVV has been eliminated from the United States, dogs might still acquire rabies from wildlife.

This was the ninth death in the United States from rabies infection acquired while traveling or working abroad since 2008. These events underscore the importance of obtaining a thorough pretravel health consultation, particularly when visiting countries with high incidence of emerging or zoonotic pathogens, to ensure awareness of health risks and appropriate pretravel and postexposure health care actions.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^4a2a7632]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Rabies — Prevention counseling for travelers emphasizes that rabies is still considered universally fatal for practical purposes and that avoiding rabies virus exposures remains the most important prevention measure; for those who are (or who suspect they might have been) exposed, urgently taking the prevention measures described is the only way to optimize survival. Travelers can best prevent rabies by learning about infection risks and the need to avoid bites and scratches from mammals, consulting with travel health professionals to determine whether pre-exposure vaccination is recommended, knowing how to prevent rabies after a bite, and knowing how to obtain PEP, which might involve urgent importation of rabies biologics or travel to somewhere PEP is available; if infected, not seeking PEP or receiving inadequate care likely will result in death from rabies.

### Human rabies-Virginia, 2017 [^4913eed3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

On May 9, 2017, the Virginia Department of Health was notified regarding a patient with suspected rabies. The patient had sustained a dog bite 6 weeks before symptom onset while traveling in India. On May 11, CDC confirmed that the patient was infected with a rabies virus that circulates in dogs in India. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient died, becoming the ninth person exposed to rabies abroad who has died from rabies in the United States since 2008. A total of 250 health care workers were assessed for exposure to the patient, 72 (29%) of whom were advised to initiate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The total pharmaceutical cost for PEP (rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccine) was approximately $235,000. International travelers should consider a pretravel consultation with travel health specialists; rabies preexposure prophylaxis is warranted for travelers who will be in rabies endemic countries for long durations, in remote areas, or who plan activities that might put them at risk for a rabies exposures.

### Human rabies-Virginia, 2017 [^749f4f6a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The canine rabies virus variant was eliminated from the United States in 2004, but remains endemic in 122 countries and is the leading global cause of human deaths secondary to zoonotic pathogens (estimated at 59,000 per year). Recognizing that the reduced burden of human rabies deaths in the United States might result in a lack of awareness of risk when traveling abroad, CDC publishes pretravel vaccination recommendations. Travelers to India, which has the world's largest incidence of dog-mediated human rabies deaths, are recommended to receive pretravel rabies vaccination if they will be involved in outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, biking, adventure travel, and caving) that put them at risk for animal bites. In the case of the yoga retreat tour, given the extended length of the tour and the rural and community activities involved, pretravel rabies vaccination should have been considered. In the event of a suspected rabies exposure, PEP is recommended as soon as possible and has been shown to be highly effective at preventing rabies if administered prior to symptom onset (typically 3 weeks to 3 months after exposure). Persons with a history of vaccination should receive a 2-dose booster vaccination series if exposed, whereas persons with no history of vaccination require a 4-dose vaccination series with rabies immune globulin administered at the site of exposure.

CDC recommends using standard precautions when providing care to persons suspected of having clinical rabies, including wearing gowns, goggles, masks, and gloves, particularly during procedures that might result in splashes or sprays from body fluids. Enhanced precautions such as droplet and contact precautions are not considered necessary for prevention of health care–associated rabies virus exposures. In the case described, implementation of enhanced precautions after the patient developed a urinary tract infection did not significantly reduce the daily rate of health care worker exposures, which supports ACIP guidance that standard precautions, when applied appropriately, are adequate to minimize health care–associated rabies virus exposures. Health care–associated rabies virus exposures declined significantly after a diagnosis of rabies was confirmed, suggesting that early consideration of rabies virus infection coupled with timely diagnosis might result in improved adherence to standard infection control precautions and a reduction in exposures and related PEP costs.

### Inadequate antibody response to rabies vaccine in immunocompromised patient [^ced97a2f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Rabies is a rapidly progressive viral encephalitis caused by RNA viruses of the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. Dogs are the major reservoir for these viruses worldwide and usually transmit the virus by conveying their infected saliva through the penetrated skin of bitten humans or animals. The usual incubation period in humans ranges from 10 days to 1 year (average 20–60 days). Rabies causes 30,000–70,000 human deaths throughout the world each year. The rabies-related death rate is ≈100% in unvaccinated patients. Thus, preexposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) are the main effective approaches for treating the disease.

We describe a case in which an acceptable antibody response to rabies vaccine did not develop in an immunocompromised patient. We also searched the literature for similar cases and summarize the demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of such case-patients to date.

### Encephalitis caused by pathogens transmitted through organ transplants, United States, 2002–2013 [^953f2aa3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Rabies Virus

Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) is an enveloped, negative, single-stranded RNA virus. After the virus is inoculated into humans, typically through the saliva or bites or scratches from infected animals, it is taken up through peripheral nerves. Then, through retrograde transport, the virus infects the central nervous system and causes encephalitis; this process may take weeks or months. Clinical manifestations of rabies virus infection include a nonspecific prodrome (malaise, fever, headache) that lasts days to weeks, followed by confusion and paresthesias, which progress to paresis, hydrophobia, coma, and death. Rabies is nearly always fatal once neurologic signs develop. In industrialized countries, the disease occurs infrequently because of good veterinary public health practices and postexposure prophylaxis of person exposed or potentially exposed to rabies virus. However, in developing countries, rabies is a common cause of encephalitis.

The transmission of rabies virus through cornea transplantation has been described, but transmission through solid organ transplantation was not recognized before 2004. In July 2004, CDC was notified that 3 recipients of solid organs and 1 recipient of an iliac artery segment from a common donor had died from encephalitis, which was eventually found to be caused by rabies virus infection. The initial link to rabies virus was made by histopathologic evaluation and immunohistochemical testing of central nervous system tissue (Figure 2). The common-source outbreak of donor-derived rabies infection highlighted the difficulties inherent in the evaluation of encephalopathy in a potential organ donor. Before dying, the donor associated with this outbreak cluster had been evaluated twice in an emergency department for nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. He eventually sought care for a subarachnoid hemorrhage and then died. After it was determined that rabies virus had been transmitted to multiple recipients of organs from this donor, it was noted that the donor had had other symptoms consistent with encephalitis and had been bitten by a bat.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^127369a5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies — burden, urgency, effectiveness, and safety are described as follows: Approximately 16,000–39,000 persons come in contact with potentially rabid animals and receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis each year. Administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency, not a medical emergency, but decisions must not be delayed. Studies indicated that postexposure prophylaxis combining wound treatment, local infiltration of rabies immune globulin (RIG), and vaccination is uniformly effective when appropriately administered, though rabies has occasionally developed among humans when key elements were omitted or incorrectly administered. Prophylaxis is occasionally complicated by adverse reactions, but these reactions are rarely severe, and practical and accurate health education, domestic animal vaccination and responsible pet care, modern stray animal control, and prompt diagnosis can minimize unnecessary animal exposures and prevent many circumstances that result in the need for rabies prophylaxis.

### Vital signs: trends in human rabies deaths and exposures-United States, 1938–2018 [^e5828630]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Each year, rabies causes approximately 59,000 deaths worldwide, including approximately two deaths in the United States. Before 1960, dogs were a common reservoir of rabies in the United States; however, increasingly, species of wildlife (e.g., bats, raccoons) are the main reservoirs. This report characterizes human rabies deaths, summarizes trends in rabies mortality, and highlights current rabies risks in the United States.

Methods

Rabies trends in the United States during 1938–2018 were analyzed using national rabies surveillance data. Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 2006–2014 were used to estimate the number of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) visits per 100,000 persons during 2017–2018. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' average sales price data were used to estimate PEP costs.

Results

From 1960 to 2018, a total of 125 human rabies cases were reported in the United States; 36 (28%) were attributed to dog bites during international travel. Among the 89 infections acquired in the United States, 62 (70%) were attributed to bats. In 2018, approximately 55,000 persons sought PEP after contact with a potentially rabid animal.

Conclusions and Comments

In the United States, wildlife rabies, especially in bats, continues to pose a risk to humans. Travelers also might be exposed to canine rabies in countries where the disease is still present; increased awareness of rabies while traveling abroad is needed. Vaccinating pets, avoiding contact with wildlife, and seeking medical care if one is bitten or scratched by an animal are the most effective ways to prevent rabies. Understanding the need for timely administration of PEP to prevent death is critical.

Rabies is a zoonotic disease transmitted primarily through virus-laden saliva from the bite of an infected mammal. The typical incubation period from exposure to symptom onset is 3–12 weeks. Rabies is nearly always fatal once symptoms develop but nearly always preventable when PEP is administered in accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. † During 1960–2018, approximately 70% of 89 human rabies cases acquired in the United States were caused by exposures to bats. Although human rabies deaths in the United States are rare, rabid animals and rabies exposures are relatively common. Since 2014, all states except Hawaii have reported rabid bats. In 2020, public health programs tested approximately 24,000 bats for rabies, 1,401 (5.8%) of which were confirmed positive. CDC estimates that 60,000 persons each year receive rabies PEP following animal exposures, approximately two-thirds of these may be attributed to bats, depending on the local rabies epidemiology.

### From initial suspicion to accurate diagnosis: unmasking rabies in a case of suspected Guillain-Barre syndrome [^4dd54bdb]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

To confirm the diagnosis, virus isolation methods like the rapid tissue culture infection test (RTCT) and mouse inoculation test (MIT) are frequently required. In the absence of a history of vaccination, the diagnosis may also be supported by the finding of rabies antibodies in CSF. PCR can detect viral RNA in saliva, CSF, urine, and hair follicles.

Since the prognosis is very poor in both types of rabies, recovery is extremely rare. There is no proven standard treatment for rabies; the mainstay is to use rabies immunoglobulins, vaccination, antiviral medications (ribavirin), and interferon alpha. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ketamine, or intravenous morphine can be used for symptom relief. Nimodipine can also be used to relieve vasospasm.

Large doses of intravenous immunoglobulins have shown success in alleviating autonomic symptoms, as occurred in our patient. However, once the virus enters the CNS, the prognosis is very poor, and death is inevitable.

When an animal bite occurs, the wound should be cleaned right away. To lower the risk of infection, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advises delaying wound suturing. Prompt administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes the rabies vaccination and immunoglobulin, is necessary. If a dog or other biting animal is available, it should be monitored for ten days. PEP should be started right away if the animal is unavailable. Additionally, conventional precautions should be taken to isolate patients suspected of having rabies.

Early diagnosis of paralytic rabies is vital to provide the patient's family with the true prognosis, to implement proper infection control measures, and to consider newer treatment modalities.

### Nucleic-acid sequence based amplification in the rapid diagnosis of rabies [^fb3e38e7]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Current serological tests do not reliably diagnose rabies. We describe a technique based on amplification of nucleic-acid sequences to detect rabies-specific RNA in the saliva and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of four living patients with rabies. Rabies RNA could be detected in either saliva or CSF, or both, in all patients and as early as day 2 after onset of symptoms. Both saliva and CSF should be serially tested because not every sample can be expected to be positive. The whole process, including automated extraction, isothermal amplification, and detection can be done within 4 h.

### Cost-effectiveness evaluation of a novel integrated bite case management program for the control of human rabies, Haiti 2014–2015 [^05615ea9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rabies is a viral zoonosis that imposes a substantial burden in many developing countries, with approximately 59,000 annual deaths globally.–Rabies transmission occurs in more than 150 countries and affects roughly half of the world's population. Human rabies is almost certainly fatal once clinical symptoms appear, but can be prevented if the bite victim is promptly administered postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are numerous rabies reservoir species globally; however, the vast majority of human rabies deaths are due to the virus variant enzootic in domesticated dog populations. Controlling dog rabies substantially reduces human exposure to the virus, which can be accomplished through periodical mass dog vaccination. But the costs of vaccination campaigns can be substantial. The Republic of Haiti has the highest human rabies burden in the Western Hemisphere, with an estimated 130 annual human deaths. As in other developing countries,–many human and dog rabies cases are not recognized and are not reported to health authorities, thus limiting rabies awareness, funding, and prevention efforts. Dog bite victims often do not present to health-care facilities and PEP supplies may be limited. Budget constraints have resulted in limited passive rabies surveillance, inadequate laboratory capacity, few trained professionals, and NBCM (thus, all dog bites are treatedas suspected rabies exposures). Government-sponsored dog vaccination campaigns in Haiti have not been conducted to the frequency and intensity required for rabies elimination.

Methods

Data source

We obtained data from patient immunisation record books maintained at the National Rabies Prevention and Control Centre (NRPCC) located in the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from 2011 to 2023. The NRPCC, Bangladesh's primary referral center for animal bites and rabies, offers free vaccination and treatment for most cases nationwide, with the Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Diseases (BITID) in Chittagong serving as the secondary referral center for rabies after NRPCC. Besides NRPCC and BITID, 66 public District Rabies Prevention and Control Centres (DRPCCs) exist, with at least one centre in each of the 64 districts, which provides free PEP and treatment to individuals who have suffered animal bites. The data included demographic information of patients, details on the type and dosages of vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) administered to bite victims and reported cases of rabies in humans. For data regarding MDV, we used the MDV database of the Communicable Disease Control Division (CDC), Bangladesh's Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), from November 2011 to April 2023. The database includes data on all estimated and vaccinated dogs, human-to-dog ratios, and vaccination coverage in all 64 districts of Bangladesh.

Human rabies surveillance

Human rabies surveillance in Bangladesh was conducted by CDC DGHS, with local health officials reporting epidemiological information on animal exposures and rabies cases to central authorities. Data was primarily collected on paper, with limited disaggregation and manual transfer into the national District Health Information (DHIS2) system. Laboratory confirmation of human rabies cases needed to be improved due to cultural sensitivity and logistical constraints. Diagnosis was mainly based on clinical symptoms and verbal autopsy, highlighting the need for improved surveillance accuracy. The DGHS has a central core committee overseeing human rabies surveillance activities. CDC DGHS led this committee, and additional personnel were included, such as the deputy director, deputy programme manager, and surveillance medical officer. The Upazila (sub-district) Rapid Response Team (URRT), comprised of medical professionals, health assistants, and other health personnel, has been investigating reports of patients who have had contact with animals (typically bites or scratches) with information shared with central rabies teams. The CDC and NRPCC's central rabies teams and the intermediate-level (Civil Surgeon) rabies teams have regularly received information and aggregate statistics from the local level.

### Rabies vaccine hesitancy and deaths among pregnant and breastfeeding women-Vietnam, 2015–2016 [^38941ebc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Investigation and Results

Human rabies cases are reportable to MoH in Vietnam within 48 hours after clinical diagnosis, based on the World Health Organization's probable case definition *. Probable cases of human rabies are investigated by MoH staff members from the National Rabies Control Program, using a standardized form to collect information on demographics, exposure, clinical symptoms, treatment, barriers to receipt of PEP, and outcomes. Although confirmatory laboratory testing is available, for various reasons including cultural barriers, hesitation by medical providers to collect specimens, and the cost of shipping specimens to the national laboratory, very few specimens are collected. Vietnam is committed to increasing accessibility of PEP throughout the country. Bite victims can receive care at any district or provincial medical center but are responsible for PEP-associated costs (approximately $153 USD for a full course, about equal to the average monthly salary in Vietnam).

To assess risk factors for not receiving rabies PEP, investigation forms for probable rabies cases identified during 2015–2016 were reviewed. To evaluate the accessibility of PEP to the six pregnant or breastfeeding women with rabies, the distance and estimated travel time by automobile or motorized scooter (the primary mode of transportation) to district and provincial-level medical centers from the homes of the six patients were measured. The median age of the six pregnant or breastfeeding women with rabies was 27 years (range = 19–33 years), and all patients had attended at least junior high school (Table). The mean incubation period (from dog exposure to symptom onset) was 85 days (range = 49–126 days). The median interval from symptom onset to death was 2 days (range = 1–4 days).

Domestic dogs, cats, and ferrets — post-bite observation and testing guidance state that animals that remain alive and healthy 10 days after a bite would not have been shedding rabies virus in their saliva and would not have been infectious at the time of the bite, and domestic dogs, cats, and ferrets kept as pets should be vaccinated against rabies; even if not vaccinated, such animals might be confined and observed for 10 days after a bite to determine risk. Any illness during confinement should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported immediately to the local public health department, and if signs suggestive of rabies develop, postexposure prophylaxis of the bite victim should be initiated; the animal should be euthanized and its head removed and shipped, under refrigeration, for examination. If the biting animal is stray or unwanted, it should either be confined and observed for 10 days or euthanized immediately and submitted for rabies diagnosis, and for exposures to other domestic animal species, local or state health departments should be consulted before deciding to euthanize and test the animal or initiate postexposure prophylaxis.

### About rabies… [^2b6a7364]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Rabies is a viral disease that is deadly if people don't receive medical care before symptoms start.
- Rabies spreads primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal.
- The animals most frequently found with rabies in the U. S. are bats, skunks, raccoons, and foxes.
- Around 100, 000 Americans are vaccinated against rabies following a potential rabies exposure each year. What you need to know Rabies is deadly Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can be spread to people and pets through the bites and scratches of an infected animal. Rabies primarily affects the central nervous system, leading to severe brain disease and death if medical care is not received before symptoms start. After a rabies exposure, the rabies virus must travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is the incubation period, which may last for weeks to months.

The first symptoms of rabies may be like the flu, including weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. There also may be discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. Usually, severe disease appears within two weeks of the first symptoms, when the rabies virus causes anxiety, confusion, agitation, and hallucinations. This includes the "classic" rabies symptoms of being very thirsty but panicked by fluids, having lots of saliva, and aggressive behavior like thrashing and biting. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal. Rabies vaccination in people If you may have been exposed to rabies, you should urgently seek medical attention. Medical care following a rabies exposure is called post-exposure prophylaxis. PEP includes wound care, human rabies immune globulin, and a series of four or five rabies vaccines, which must be given as soon as possible after an exposure.

You must get this care to prevent the disease from developing, and it's nearly 100% effective if you get it after exposure. People who travel Since 1990, more than 80 people in the United States have died after being infected with rabies during travel. In Africa, Asia, and specific areas of Central and South America, rabies in dogs is still a major problem. Additionally, access to PEP may be hard to get in those places. As a result, tens of thousands of people die of the disease each year.

### Reemerging rabies and lack of systemic surveillance in people's republic of China [^eb0514bc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Rabies Diagnosis in China

A well-established surveillance system for infectious diseases depends on reliable, laboratory-based diagnostic methods. Human and animal rabies cases in China have been reported mainly on the basis of clinical presentations and retrospective epidemiologic surveys. Animal rabies is rarely diagnosed in China. Human rabies diagnosis based solely on clinical symptoms is unreliable because human rabies can be confused with Guillain-Barré syndrome, poliomyelitis, and other types of encephalitis. Similarly, rabies in animals is difficult to distinguish from canine distemper and other encephalitic conditions. Postmortem rabies diagnosis should be routinely performed on rabid animals, animals that have bitten victims, and human patients who die after an animal bite. Antemortem diagnosis of rabies in humans is challenging because of the disease's long and variable incubation period. Also, distribution of virus antigens, virus nucleic acids, and antibodies is unpredictable at this stage. Consequently, all countries should establish standardized national rabies diagnostic protocols for postmortem examinations.

The DFA method, first introduced in the 1950s, is the global standard procedure for rabies diagnosis. It is simple, economical, and reliable. This method is approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and has served as a cornerstone for rabies diagnosis for the past half century. All rabies diagnostic laboratories should follow a single standard protocol. Whether such a standard exists in China is unclear, and diagnostic reagents, equipment, and qualified diagnosticians are in short supply. The ELISA for RABV antigen detection is carried out in a few laboratories, but this method requires performance evaluation using the standard DFA method to assess specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. An ELISA-based rapid rabies enzyme immunodiagnosis (RREID) method that uses monoclonal antibodies against nucleocapsid and glycoprotein for rabies diagnosis has been developed at the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. One analysis used the RREID method to detect potential virus antigens in dog saliva; when verified by the DFA method, all 15 samples showed false-negative results.

### Six fatal cases of classical rabies virus without biting incidents, iran 1990–2010 [^d49ddf67]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Rabies is an endemic fatal zoonotic disease, commonly transmitted to humans through contact (bites and scratches) with infected animals.

Objectives

During the years 1990–2010, six patients with the clinical symptoms of rabies (fever, tinnitus, buzzing, delirium and hydrophobia), with no history of a bite, were diagnosed by physicians in Iran. To obtain laboratory confirmation of rabies infection, different clinical specimens from each patient were sent to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Pasteur Institute of Iran. The first case was a 39-year-old male veterinary technician who entered his uncovered scratched hand into the mouth of a rabid bovine and became infected. Two years later, a herd of sheep being tended by a shepherd and his two sons were attacked by a rabid wolf. All three individuals were infected when they applied burnt thorny wool to the sheep's wounds as a bandage. Their hands were scratched and then infected through contact with the remaining saliva of the rabid wolf on the sheep's wounds. In 1994, two other human cases occurred through corneal transplantation from the same donor who had died with the clinical signs of food poisoning (according to his hospital record), which probably was a misdiagnosis of rabies infection.

Study Design

This is a case series study that describes human rabies cases without biting incidents. According to the WHO recommendation, human rabies cases are notifiable, therefore, in Iran, a rabies surveillance system has been established to follow these cases. During the last decade, six patients with no 'history of a bite' were hospitalised with growing symptoms of rabies. The data were collected from each patient by the physicians and transferred to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran, and to the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Pasteur Institute of Iran as the only testing laboratory. Thus, they came to the attention of the surveillance system. Ante-mortem diagnosis was performed on saliva, cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples that were collected from the first patient by the physicians. Fresh brain specimens from all patients were kept in a mixture of 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and transported on ice to the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies.

Results

For the first patient, rabies virus was investigated in saliva using the rapid tissue cell inoculation test (RTCIT) and the mouse inoculation test (MIT). Anti-rabies antibodies in this patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were examined using the mouse neutralisation test (MNT). Fresh brain specimens from all patients were examined using the fluorescence antibody test (FAT) as recommended by the WHO laboratory manual in rabies as the post-mortem diagnostic test for rabies. Rabies infection was confirmed in all of the deceased patients. Anti-rabies antibodies were identified only in one patient's serum specimen. Testing also showed that the rabies virus isolated was the classic rabies virus (serotype 1), which is widespread in Iran.

Conclusions

Prevention and control of this fatal disease require a sensitive surveillance system to follow 'suspected' animal and human rabies cases thoroughly through the improved reporting system, which contains the history of exposure, clinical examinations, symptoms and laboratory results. This study describes some notable human rabies infections and their transmission modes to prevent occupational accidents.
