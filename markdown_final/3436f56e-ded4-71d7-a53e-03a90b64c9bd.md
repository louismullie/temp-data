## Question

Treatment for leg swelling

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for leg swelling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the etiology and urgency of edema. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and staging. Next, I will consider first-line conservative therapies by cause, followed by advanced options and special populations. Finally, I need to ensure monitoring, follow-up, and a concise algorithmic summary with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: leg swelling is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and treatment hinges on identifying the cause and acuity because misclassification leads to harm, such as missing DVT or heart failure, or overtreating bilateral dermatitis as cellulitis [^68479008] [^dc2c4974].

> I need to check the major etiologic buckets and their clinical implications. Venous insufficiency is the most common cause in older adults, lymphedema is suggested by a > 3-month history or cancer treatment, systemic causes include heart, liver, renal disease and endocrine or medication effects, and acute unilateral swelling mandates exclusion of DVT and May-Thurner physiology; bilateral erythema should trigger caution about pseudocellulitis from stasis dermatitis rather than true infection [^68479008] [^19dbd4d8] [^bcf1520c] [^b474ff19] [^dc2c4974].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the diagnostic approach. For suspected venous disease, duplex ultrasound is first-line to assess reflux and obstruction, whereas lymphedema is primarily a clinical diagnosis with optional confirmatory imaging such as lymphoscintigraphy or indocyanine green lymphography in select cases; CEAP and VCSS should be used to classify severity and track outcomes, and objective limb volume measurement improves longitudinal care [^06168405] [^2f804ba7] [^cfba9abb].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative therapy for venous edema. Graduated compression stockings are the cornerstone, with class 2 (20–30 mmHg) generally appropriate for symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency; short-stretch bandaging is preferred for active ulcers or marked edema, and leg elevation, calf-muscle activation, and weight management are adjuncts; I initially thought class 3 stockings were routinely better, but wait, let me verify — evidence is mixed and some data show no clear advantage of higher grades for symptom control, so I should individualize based on tolerance and severity [^6afcc79c] [^e751265c] [^78b15a5d].

> For lymphedema, I should confirm that complete decongestive therapy is the gold standard, typically delivered in two phases: intensive MLD with multilayer bandaging and skin care, followed by maintenance with custom compression garments and lifelong self-care; consensus supports MLD as a core component, though I need to acknowledge that some debate exists about the incremental benefit of each element, and adherence to compression is critical to prevent recurrence [^1b6209a2] [^22076daa] [^889fca9a].

> Let me consider pharmacologic adjuncts for venous symptoms when compression is insufficient or not tolerated. Venoactive drugs such as micronized purified flavonoid fraction and Ruscus extracts have moderate-quality evidence for reducing edema and symptoms, while horse chestnut seed extract has supportive data; I should emphasize these are supplements and not FDA-approved drugs, and they are best viewed as adjuncts rather than replacements for compression [^7b0e037c] [^d9d59575] [^0f194067].

> I should double-check the role of intermittent pneumatic compression. For venous leg ulcers, IPC may modestly improve healing when added to compression, but evidence quality is limited; for lymphedema, IPC is a reasonable adjunct in advanced disease or when manual therapy is impractical, with some data suggesting improved mobility even if volume effects are modest, so I need to set expectations and integrate IPC within a comprehensive program [^7214038d] [^a210808a] [^1b6209a2].

> Now, I will examine advanced interventions for refractory venous disease. Superficial venous ablation is appropriate when reflux contributes to edema, with appropriate-use criteria supporting treatment in C3 patients with reflux; for deep venous insufficiency, valvuloplasty or other deep reconstructions have limited high-quality evidence and should be reserved for select cases after conservative therapy fails; I need to ensure patients understand the uncertain magnitude of benefit and potential risks [^e670f5a5] [^d945a02d].

> For lymphedema refractory to optimized conservative therapy, I should review surgical options. Physiologic procedures such as lymphaticovenous anastomosis or vascularized lymph node transfer are considered in earlier stages, whereas debulking via suction-assisted lipectomy is appropriate for advanced fibrotic disease; patient selection and expectations are key, and these should be coordinated in specialized centers [^2fd8dfbc] [^a9284106].

> But wait, what if the swelling is bilateral and red — could this be cellulitis or stasis dermatitis. I need to ensure I do not mislabel stasis dermatitis as bilateral cellulitis, which is rare; careful skin exam, distribution, and history help avoid unnecessary antibiotics and direct therapy toward compression, elevation, and skin care for stasis changes [^dc2c4974] [^54775286].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In elderly patients with chronic venous insufficiency, compression reduces ulcer recurrence but adherence is challenging; in obesity, compression is effective but application difficulties and skin folds require tailored devices; in cancer survivors, treatment-related edema is common and warrants early lymphedema-informed care; in long COVID, new or worsening leg swelling may reflect autonomic or cardiovascular sequelae and merits targeted evaluation [^35b1402a] [^aa30551d] [^8ce816ef] [^3d305c58].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Objective volume or circumference tracking, CEAP/VCSS scoring, and patient-reported symptoms should be documented at baseline and intervals; for lymphedema, maintenance compression and skin surveillance reduce progression and infection risk; I need to ensure patients receive education on donning techniques, skin care, and when to seek urgent care for infection or rapid worsening [^cfba9abb] [^889fca9a] [^883fee42].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. First, triage for acuity and red flags such as acute unilateral swelling, pain, or dyspnea to exclude DVT, PE, or acute heart failure; second, classify etiology with history, exam, and duplex as indicated; third, initiate cause-specific first-line therapy such as compression with adjuncts for venous disease or CDT for lymphedema; fourth, escalate to IPC, pharmacologic venoactives, or procedural options if refractory; fifth, embed longitudinal monitoring and patient education to sustain gains and prevent complications [^68479008] [^06168405] [^883fee42].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-aligned. Compression is the cornerstone for venous edema and a core element of lymphedema care, CDT is first-line for lymphedema, most pharmacologic options are adjunctive rather than curative, and procedural therapies should be reserved for appropriately selected patients after optimized conservative care; throughout, accurate diagnosis and staged, individualized management yield the best outcomes and minimize iatrogenic harm [^6afcc79c] [^1b6209a2] [^7b0e037c] [^e670f5a5].

Leg swelling is most often due to **venous insufficiency** or **lymphedema**, so treatment should be tailored to the cause. For venous edema, **graduated compression stockings** (20–30 mmHg) [^6afcc79c], leg elevation, and calf-muscle activation are first-line [^68479008]; for lymphedema, **complex decongestive therapy** (manual lymphatic drainage, multilayer bandaging, exercise, and skin care) is essential [^1b6209a2]. Diuretics are only for systemic causes (heart, liver, kidney) [^a74457ab] and are not effective for primary venous or lymphatic edema [^e79302b3]. If swelling persists or worsens, evaluate for DVT, malignancy, or other systemic disease and consider advanced therapies such as pneumatic compression [^7214038d] or surgical options [^2fd8dfbc].

---

## General principles of management

- **Identify and treat the underlying cause**: Venous insufficiency, lymphedema, systemic disease, or medication-induced edema require different approaches [^68479008].

- **Elevation and exercise**: Elevate the legs above heart level when possible and perform regular calf-muscle exercises to enhance venous return and lymphatic flow [^68479008].

- **Weight management**: Excess weight exacerbates venous and lymphatic edema; weight loss can reduce swelling and improve mobility [^notfound].

---

## Compression therapy

Compression is the cornerstone for venous and lymphatic edema; **graduated compression stockings** (20–30 mmHg) are first-line for venous insufficiency and reduce edema, improve symptoms, and prevent progression [^6afcc79c]. For lymphedema, **complex decongestive therapy** — manual lymphatic drainage, multilayer bandaging, exercise, and skin care — is the gold standard [^1b6209a2]. Adjustable Velcro wraps are useful for patients with difficulty donning stockings or for irregular limb shapes [^a210808a].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Diuretics are indicated only for **systemic causes** such as heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or renal disease; they are not effective for primary venous or lymphatic edema and may worsen lymphedema by concentrating protein-rich fluid [^e79302b3]. Venoactive drugs (e.g. micronized purified flavonoid fraction, horse chestnut extract) may reduce symptoms in chronic venous disease but have modest evidence and are adjuncts to compression [^7b0e037c] [^d9d59575].

---

## Advanced therapies

Intermittent pneumatic compression is an adjunct for lymphedema or refractory venous edema, especially when manual therapy or stockings are insufficient [^a210808a]. Surgical options include venous ablation for reflux, lymphaticovenous anastomosis or bypass for lymphedema, and liposuction for refractory lymphedema; these are reserved for selected patients after conservative therapy fails [^e670f5a5] [^2fd8dfbc].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

- **Sodium restriction**: Limit dietary sodium to reduce fluid retention [^a74457ab].

- **Skin care**: Regular moisturizing and prompt treatment of infections prevent complications, especially in lymphedema [^54775286].

- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged standing; take frequent breaks to move and elevate the legs [^54775286].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track limb volume or circumference and symptoms to guide therapy and detect progression [^cfba9abb]. Educate patients on adherence, skin care, and when to seek care for infection or sudden worsening [^f1a08bcf].

---

## When to seek medical attention

- **Sudden unilateral swelling**: Suspect DVT and seek urgent evaluation [^9677e7ad].

- **Painful swelling with redness or warmth**: Possible cellulitis or infection; prompt treatment is needed [^54775286].

- **Swelling with systemic symptoms**: Shortness of breath, fatigue, or weight gain may indicate heart, liver, or renal disease [^b074b323].

---

Effective management of leg swelling requires a **cause-specific approach**, with compression as the foundation, lifestyle measures to support control, and escalation to advanced therapies when conservative care fails. Persistent or unexplained swelling warrants further evaluation to exclude serious disease.

### Bandages or double stockings for the initial therapy of venous oedema? A randomized, controlled pilot study [^a4857c7a]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective/Background

Treatment for leg oedema conventionally starts with compression bandaging followed by elastic stockings once swelling is reduced. The aim was to investigate if a kit consisting of a liner and outer stocking, each exerting 20 mmHg of pressure, would be equally effective in achieving and maintaining volume reduction compared with short-stretch bandaging (2 weeks) followed by a class II (23–33 mmHg) stocking (2 weeks).

Methods

Forty legs (28 patients) with chronic venous oedema were randomised to either short-stretch bandages applied weekly for 2 weeks, followed by an elastic stocking for 2 weeks (group A) or a light stocking ("liner") for 1 week followed by superimposing a second stocking for 3 weeks (group B). Interface pressures and leg volumes were measured weekly.

Results

Despite differences in the pressure (median ± interquartile range) applied (bandage: 67 mmHg [55.7–73.0] vs. liner 24.5 mmHg [21.2–26.5]) volume reduction after 1 week was equal (12.8% [8.7–16.5] and 13.0% [10.4–20.6]). After 2 weeks (group A: 17.8% [10.6–20.0] vs. group B 16.2% [13.0–25.4]) and 4 weeks (group A: 17.3% [9.6–22.8] vs. group B: 17.0% [13.1–24.1]) volume reductions remained identical.

Conclusions

The initial improvement in leg volume (1 week) was independent of the pressure applied and the reduction was maintained by superimposing a second stocking. This offers a simple alternative for managing leg oedema with reduced staffing costs.

Lymphedema evaluation — swelling quantification and AFTD-pitting test emphasize objective measurement at baseline and follow up and describe a consensus tool with a duration threshold. The page states that to evaluate treatment one "has to be able to quantify the amount of swelling at initial visit and during follow up", and because swelling is the presenting symptom it is "important to have an objective measure of initial swelling… and progressively evaluate whether the treatment reduces swelling". Practicality and standardization concerns are noted, yet a consensus "advocated the use of the AFTD-pitting test… using edema of > 3 months duration as a surrogate for lymphedema", although "low inter-observer reliability was reported in another cohort with milder lymphedema". For diagnostic confidence in early disease, "some of the experts consider additional assessment such as limb volume, physiologic changes, or lymphatic imaging necessary to make a confident diagnosis of Stage 0 and 1 lymphedema", and "Patients want to have confidence in their diagnosis… some are interested" in imaging to increase diagnostic confidence.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework — these recommendations have been determined by the method suggested by the GRADE working group. For each guideline, the letter A, B or C marks the quality of current evidence as high, medium or low quality. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs. the expected benefit. The words 'we recommend' are used for GRADE 1 — strong recommendations — if the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words 'we suggest' are used for GRADE 2 — weak recommendations — when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens. Where current evidence is weak or lacking, the degree of consensus of the committee reflects the grade with the quality of the recommendation adjusted accordingly.

### Intermittent pneumatic compression for treating venous leg ulcers [^7214038d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is a mechanical method of delivering compression to swollen limbs that can be used to treat venous leg ulcers and limb swelling due to lymphoedema.

Objectives

To determine whether IPC increases the healing of venous leg ulcers. To determine the effects of IPC on health related quality of life of venous leg ulcer patients.

Search Methods

In April 2014, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of IPC with control (sham IPC or no IPC) or made comparisons between IPC treatment regimens, in venous ulcer management.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors reviewed titles and abstracts and agreed on full studies to be retrieved. One review author extracted data and assessed studies for risk of bias and this was checked by a second review author.

Main Results

We identified nine randomised controlled trials (including 489 people in total). Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall having reported adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment. In one trial (80 people) more ulcers healed with IPC than with dressings (62% vs 28%; p = 0.002). Five trials compared IPC plus compression with compression alone. Two of these (97 people) found increased ulcer healing with IPC plus compression than with compression alone. The remaining three trials (122 people) found no evidence of a benefit for IPC plus compression compared with compression alone. Two trials (86 people) found no difference between IPC (without additional compression) and compression bandages alone. One trial (104 people) compared different ways of delivering IPC and found that rapid IPC healed more ulcers than slow IPC (86% vs 61%).

Authors' Conclusions

IPC may increase healing compared with no compression. It is unclear whether it can be used instead of compression bandages. There is some limited evidence that IPC may improve healing when added to compression bandages. Rapid IPC was better than slow IPC in one trial. Further trials are required to determine the reliability of current evidence, which patients may benefit from IPC in addition to compression bandages, and the optimum treatment regimen.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d35a8e76]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Based on the results of this systematic review, medical compression stockings probably reduce leg ulcer recurrence up to one year in elderly people, but the effect after one year is unclear. However, the evidence of initial treatment with compression stockings in patients with venous insufficiency or swollen legs is lacking.

### The effect of muscles in the treatment of lower limb lymphedema: respiratory muscles or leg muscles? [^6d86ac07]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introductıon

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive condition caused by abnormal development or damage to the lymphatic system, leading to the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial tissue spaces. Patients with lower extremity lymphedema (LLL) commonly experience swelling, reduced joint range of motion, fatigue, infections, ulceration, sensory impairment, deformity, body asymmetry, and muscle weakness. The increased volume in the affected limb due to edema, along with a sensation of heaviness, can make walking and daily activities challenging, ultimately reducing functional capacity and performance. The primary goals of treatment for lower limb lymphedema (LLL) are to minimize swelling, prevent complications, and restore limb functionality. Managing LLL typically requires lifelong care and may involve conservative, medical, and sometimes surgical interventions. The gold standard treatment is complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP), which includes manual lymphatic drainage and bandaging (MLDB), skin care, and exercise, all provided by trained physiotherapists. CDP has been shown to effectively reduce limb volume and edema while improving function and quality of life (QoL) in patients with lymphedema.

Exercise activates the musculoskeletal system, increasing lymph flow and accelerating protein reabsorption. Additionally, deep inspiration during respiration increases tidal volume, triggering diaphragmatic movement and causing more pronounced pressure changes in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Since these cavities house major veins and lymphatic collecting channels, deep and effective inspiration is expected to enhance lymphatic return, given the slow, rhythmic movement of larger lymphatic collectors and their anatomical positioning within intrathoracic and intra-abdominal cavities.

The pump function of skeletal muscles, particularly the calf muscles in LLL and the respiratory muscles, supports venous return, indirectly stimulating lymph circulation and reducing edema. Studies have shown that improved respiratory and calf muscle pump function positively affects venous refilling time in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Since venous and lymphatic return work in parallel, an increase in venous return can positively impact lymphatic flow. However, most studies have focused on breast cancer-related upper limb lymphedema, reporting that different exercise training programs influence function and QoL in varying ways. In contrast, lower-limb exercises, including hip, knee, and ankle mobility exercises, as well as active range of motion exercises that do not specifically target the calf muscles, have been reported to be effective in reducing lower-limb edema secondary to cancer.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^d558502c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, most commonly in the extremities, leading to swelling, limb heaviness, and susceptibility to infections, among other uncomfortable pathologies. This condition can develop in two main forms: primary lymphedema, which is typically caused by genetic factors, and secondary lymphedema, which often results from trauma, surgical procedures, or radiation therapy, especially related to cancer treatment.

The treatment of lymphedema can be separated into medical and surgical arms, which in the ideal setting, work synergistically to improve quality of life of patients with this debilitating condition. Medical therapies consist of a combination of weight management, physical therapy, compression garments, and avoidance of infection, while surgical options can include physiological and debulking procedures. With advancements in our understanding of lymphedema, we have enhanced our ability to provide a wider range of treatments and improve patient outcomes. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for lymphedema, highlighting recent therapeutic advances and clinical practices.

### Approach to leg edema of unclear etiology [^68479008]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A common challenge for primary care physicians is to determine the cause and find an effective treatment for leg edema of unclear etiology. We were unable to find existing practice guidelines that address this problem in a comprehensive manner. This article provides clinically oriented recommendations for the management of leg edema in adults. We searched on-line resources, textbooks, and MEDLINE (using the MeSH term, "edema") to find clinically relevant articles on leg edema. We then expanded the search by reviewing articles cited in the initial sources. Our goal was to write a brief, focused review that would answer questions about the management of leg edema. We organized the information to make it rapidly accessible to busy clinicians. The most common cause of leg edema in older adults is venous insufficiency. The most common cause in women between menarche and menopause is idiopathic edema, formerly known as "cyclic" edema. A common but under-recognized cause of edema is pulmonary hypertension, which is often associated with sleep apnea. Venous insufficiency is treated with leg elevation, compressive stockings, and sometimes diuretics. The initial treatment of idiopathic edema is spironolactone. Patients who have findings consistent with sleep apnea, such as daytime somnolence, loud snoring, or neck circumference > 17 inches, should be evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with an echocardiogram. If time is limited, the physician must decide whether the evaluation can be delayed until a later appointment (eg, an asymptomatic patient with chronic bilateral edema) or must be completed at the current visit (eg, a patient with dyspnea or a patient with acute edema [< 72 hours]). If the evaluation should be conducted at the current visit, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 could be used as a guide. If the full evaluation could wait for a subsequent visit, the patient should be examined briefly to rule out an obvious systemic cause and basic laboratory tests should be ordered for later review (complete blood count, urinalysis, electrolytes, creatinine, blood sugar, thyroid stimulating hormone, and albumin).

### The 2020 appropriate use criteria for chronic lower extremity venous disease of the American Venous Forum, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the American Vein and Lymphatic Society, and the Society of Interventional Radiology [^e670f5a5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). High credibility.

C3 edema — panel ratings and clinical considerations: The panelists rated interventions for treatment of leg edema due to venous disease (CEAP class 3) as may be appropriate for several scenarios in considering saphenous vein ablations and perforator, iliac, and IVC treatments. Panelists indicated that swelling may be multifactorial and can be associated with numerous coexisting nonvenous causes that would not be expected to benefit from venous interventions. In contrast, when a patient presents with varicose veins, reflux, and edema, the group thought intervention more likely to be of benefit with improved reduction of swelling, in which case the indication for treating venous reflux would be stronger. Unilateral limb swelling was also noted by panelists to be a potential predictor of a favorable response. The response of edema C3 to either ablation for isolated below-knee GSV reflux or segmental vein reflux is not supported by data and led to a rating of may be appropriate, and more research is needed to determine its usefulness for these indications. In general, for several C3 indications, a wide dispersion of ratings was observed, which may at least in part have been due to differences in how C3 was perceived.

### Methodology for the American Society of Hematology VTE guidelines: current best practice, innovations, and experiences [^9677e7ad]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^53e20d5a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of lymphedema continues to evolve, with both medical and surgical treatments playing crucial roles in improving patient outcomes. Conservative approaches, including compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and exercise, remain foundational in symptom management and improving quality of life. Surgical treatments have emerged as promising options for long-term relief and functional improvement. Ongoing research and advancements in diagnostic tools are likely to further refine treatment strategies in the future.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^e79302b3]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Optimal treatment for lymphedema begins with an accurate diagnosis as delineated above. Management of lymphedema includes both surgical and nonsurgical approaches, with the latter categorized into physiological and debulking procedures. Patients are initially referred for conservative management, and those who meet criteria may then proceed to surgical intervention.

Nonsurgical Management

Pharmacologic Treatment

Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of medications for treating lymphedema. Various pharmaceutical agents, including diuretics, coumarin, vitamin E, and steroids, have been discussed, but none have demonstrated compelling efficacy in managing lymphedema.

While diuretics may reduce limb volume, this effect is largely anecdotal and likely results from their action on swelling caused by conditions such as heart failure or venous stasis, rather than from treating lymphedema itself. In fact, some authors have raised concern that diuretics may exacerbate the condition by increasing the concentration of high protein fluid in the interstitial space. Similarly, coumarin, vitamin E, and pentoxifylline have been explored for their potential in preventing or treating lymphedema, but there is no supporting evidence for their effectiveness. Steroids have been shown to have a temporary benefit in lymphedema treatment, however, this effect is short-lived, and was not shown to extend beyond a month.

### Don't routinely use antibiotics to treat bilateral swelling and… [^dc2c4974]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Research has suggested that bilateral lower leg cellulitis is very rare. Patients with swelling and redness of both legs most likely have another condition, such as dermatitis resulting from leg swelling, varicose veins, or contact allergies. To ensure appropriate treatment, doctors must consider the likelihood of diagnoses other than cellulitis when evaluating swelling and redness of the lower legs. Misdiagnosis of bilateral cellulitis can lead to overuse of antibiotics and subject patients to potentially unnecessary hospital stays.

### Impact of treatment suspension on health-related quality of life in the EMBARK trial: a post hoc analysis [^7f255f0f]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to all other HRQoL measures which were unaffected by treatment suspension, we observed a gradual improvement in QLQ-PR25 hormonal treatment-related symptoms across all treatment arms. The QLQ-PR25 hormonal treatment-related symptoms score is comprised of six items: hot flashes, gynecomastia, swelling in legs or ankles, weight loss, weight gain, and feeling less masculine. Fatigue and gynecomastia were the most common treatment-related adverse events for enzalutamide monotherapy in EMBARK, whereas fatigue and hot flash were most commonly reported with enzalutamide combination and leuprolide alone. Consistent with this side effect profile and with hot flashes and gynecomastia being items within the hormonal treatment-related symptoms, it is unsurprising that patients experienced deterioration in hormonal treatment-related HRQoL in all treatment arms. The observed improvement in hormonal treatment-related symptoms upon treatment suspension in the current analysis may therefore be a reflection of the deterioration of these symptoms during treatment, but gives some reassurance to patients that these symptoms are not permanent and will improve over time once treatment is suspended.

It should also be noted that questionnaire items that comprise the QLQ-PR25 domain include gynecomastia and swelling. Swelling may be related to changes in weight, and gynecomastia has a relatively low likelihood of resolving once developed. Therefore, without some intervention, increased tissue that results from hormonal stimulation may take longer to resolve following treatment discontinuation, as in the case of swelling, or may not resolve, as in the case of gynecomastia. Furthermore, not all patients may have experienced these symptoms at week 37, resulting in limited potential for longitudinal improvement once treatment is suspended (i.e. ceiling effect). Moreover, some items within this domain, such as weight loss or gain, may be influenced by broader physiological, lifestyle, or treatment-related variables, reducing the sensitivity of this domain to hormonal changes. Collectively, these considerations may account for the lack of improvements in hormonal symptom scores immediately following treatment suspension. Recognizing this complexity underscores the challenges in capturing nuanced changes in symptoms related to hormone-driven QoL. Nevertheless, our results suggests that these symptoms are reversible and can improve when the treatment is discontinued, underscoring the possibility of mitigating one of the challenging aspects of treatment.

### Comprehensive assessment of lower limb edema and its association with quality of life among men with prostate cancer [^8ce816ef]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer and its treatment can contribute to lower limb edema (LLE). LLE is an accumulation of excess fluid within the body's tissues, commonly presenting as swelling in areas such as the legs, ankles, and feet. LLE can arise from multiple factors, including cancer itself, cancer treatments, and other systemic health disorders. This condition typically presents with swelling, as well as sensations of heaviness and tightness in the limbs and genital area. While initially reversible, LLE can progress to a chronic condition over time, with permanent intradermal fibrosis and tissue inflammation.

The risk of LLE for men with prostate cancer is explained through several mechanisms. Prostate cancer often spreads to lymph nodes in the pelvic area, and this lymphatic obstruction may cause lymphedema in the legs and genital area. In addition, treatment-related factors may play a substantial role in the development of LLE. Hormone therapies for prostate cancer, such as abiraterone, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, and enzalutamide, are associated with increased fluid retention or elevated blood pressure, which may lead to LLE. Also, chemotherapy, e.g. docetaxel can contribute to LLE by increasing blood vessel permeability, leading to fluid leakage into the surrounding tissue, and disrupting fluid balance and lymphatic drainage. Finally, surgery and radiation treatments targeting pelvic lymph nodes, while important for prognosis, may damage the lymphatic system, thereby exacerbating the risk of LLE.

### Surgery for deep venous insufficiency [^d945a02d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic deep venous insufficiency is caused by incompetent vein valves, blockage of large-calibre leg veins, or both; and causes a range of symptoms including recurrent ulcers, pain and swelling. Most surgeons accept that well-fitted graduated compression stockings (GCS) and local care of wounds serve as adequate treatment for most people, but sometimes symptoms are not controlled and ulcers recur frequently, or they do not heal despite compliance with conservative measures. In these situations, in the presence of severe venous dysfunction, surgery has been advocated by some vascular surgeons. This is an update of the review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical management of deep venous insufficiency on ulcer healing and recurrence, complications of surgery, clinical outcomes, quality of life (QoL) and pain.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases, and the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 23 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical treatment versus another surgical procedure, usual care or no treatment, for people with deep venous insufficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We were unable to pool data due to differences in outcomes reported and how these were measured. Outcomes of interest were ulcer healing and recurrence, complications of surgery, clinical changes, QoL and pain.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (273 participants) comparing valvuloplasty plus surgery of the superficial venous system with surgery of the superficial venous system for primary valvular incompetence. Follow-up was two to 10 years. All included studies investigated primary valve incompetence. No studies investigated other surgical procedures for the treatment of people with deep venous insufficiency or surgery for secondary valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for risk of bias concerns and imprecision due to small numbers of included trials, participants and events. None of the studies reported ulcer healing or ulcer recurrence. One study included 27 participants with active venous ulceration at the time of surgery; the other three studies did not include people with ulcers. There were no major complications of surgery, no incidence of deep vein thrombosis and no deaths reported (very low-certainty evidence). All four studies reported clinical changes but the data could not be pooled due to different outcome measures and reporting of the data. Two studies assessed clinical changes using subjective and objective measurements, as specified in the clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification score (low-certainty evidence). One study reported mean CEAP severity scores and one study reported change in clinical class using CEAP. At baseline, the mean CEAP severity score was 18.1 (standard deviation (SD) 4.4) for limbs undergoing external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system and 17.8 (SD 3.4) for limbs undergoing surgery to the superficial venous system only. At three years post-surgery, the mean CEAP severity score was 5.2 (SD 1.6) for limbs that had undergone external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system and 9.2 (SD 2.6) for limbs that had undergone surgery to the superficial venous system only (low-certainty evidence). In another study, participants with progressive clinical dynamics over the five years preceding surgery had higher rates of improvement in clinical condition in the treatment group (valvuloplasty plus ligation) compared with the control group (ligation only) (80% versus 51%) after seven years of follow-up. Participants with stable preoperative clinical dynamics demonstrated similar rates of improvement in both groups (95% with valvuloplasty plus ligation versus 90% with ligation only) (low-certainty evidence). One study reported disease-specific QoL using cumulative scores from a 10-item visual analogue scale (VAS) and reported that in the limited anterior plication (LAP) plus superficial venous surgery group the score decreased from 49 to 11 at 10 years, compared to a decrease from 48 to 36 in participants treated with superficial venous surgery only (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported pain. Within the QoL VAS scale, one item was 'pain/discomfort' and scores decreased from 4 to 1 at 10 years for participants in the LAP plus superficial venous surgery group and increased from 2 to 3 at 10 years in participants treated with superficial venous surgery only. A second study reported that 'leg heaviness and pain' was resolved completely in 36/40 limbs treated with femoral vein external valvuloplasty plus high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and percutaneous continuous circumsuture and 22/40 limbs treated with high ligation and stripping of GSV and percutaneous continuous circumsuture alone, at three years' follow-up (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We only identified evidence from four RCTs for valvuloplasty plus surgery of the superficial venous system for primary valvular incompetence. We found no studies investigating other surgical procedures for the treatment of people with deep venous insufficiency, or that included participants with secondary valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. None of the studies reported ulcer healing or recurrence, and few studies reported complications of surgery, clinical outcomes, QoL and pain (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Conclusions on the effectiveness of valvuloplasty for deep venous insufficiency cannot be made.

The negative impact of advanced lymphedema on the physical and emotional health of cancer survivors cannot be understated.–Symptomatic management, rather than cure, is available for the large proportion of breast (21%), gynecologic (20%), melanoma (16%), and genitourinary (10%) cancer survivors (among others) who develop lymphedema. Early lymphedema swelling can usually be managed with decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT): lymphatic drainage massage, compression garments, exercises, and skin care. However, until recently no further treatments existed for advanced lymphedema resistant to DLT. This report presents volume, bioimpedance, functional, and emotional outcomes from the first Australian clinic conducting liposuction for advanced lymphedema.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad57eaca]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study selection, data extraction and analysis

We included systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the following criteria: (a) study population of elderly (≥ 70 years) with venous insufficiency and swollen legs without recent (≤ 2 years) deep vein thrombosis; (b) evaluating the preventive effects of European standard compression stockings class 2 or 3; (c) compared to a different class of compression stockings, other interventions to promote venous backflow or no intervention; (d) assessed on thrombosis, leg ulcer and mobility (primary outcomes) or other health related outcomes such as pain, discomfort, quality of life or post-thrombotic syndrome (secondary outcomes). Compliance was not defined as an outcome in the original protocol, but following feedback, we included compliance as a secondary outcome post hoc.

Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of records identified by the search. Records appearing to meet the inclusion criteria and those with insufficient details were obtained in full text. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text publications according to a pre-defined inclusion form. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

The first author (KTD) described the included trials with regard to population, intervention, comparison, outcome and main results in tables. Another reviewer (HTM) checked the extracted information. Two reviewers (KTD, HTM) independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Risk of Bias assessment tool.

We conducted meta-analysis in Review Manager (RevMan5.3) software, when studies were sufficiently similar in terms of design, population, interventions and outcomes. We calculated relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random effects model to account for pooling effects due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies. Double-data entries were performed. We planned to do subgroup analysis based on population and degree of compression, but due to the small number of studies, this was not feasible.

We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The assessment involves within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, inconsistency of effect estimates (heterogeneity), precision of effect estimate and risk of publication bias. The GRADE assessment indicates the extent to which we can have confidence in the effect estimate. Confidence of the effect estimates were described as high, moderate, low and very low (Table 1).

### Peripheral edema [^b3ef6797]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

The decision on whom to offer surgical interventions for lymphedema requires collaboration and input from all involved specialists and should address patients' expectations, invasiveness of procedures, and disease severity. There is no consensus on what constitutes success or failure of complex decongestive therapy and when to pursue surgical intervention. Surgery has the potential to fundamentally affect the pathophysiology of the disease state and can be a powerful tool when used correctly. The dogma of which surgery to offer for a given clinical situation has been undergoing revision and is an area of ongoing research.

### Lymphedema: diagnostic workup and management [^b0e0b11d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. It is caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is a chronic progressive disease with serious physical and psychosocial implications. It can be challenging to diagnose, especially in obese patients and in those with coexisting venous disease. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, lymphedema management, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. There are currently no standard guidelines for the diagnosis of lymphedema. There is no cure yet for lymphedema, and the objective for management is to limit disease progression and prevent complications.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^7ba1e224]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Varicose veins of the lower extremities are among the most frequent medical conditions affecting millions of people worldwide. Chronic venous disease (CVD) may cause minimal symptoms, but varicose veins may often also be the source of discomfort, pain, swelling, thrombosis, bleeding, and ulcerations, causing disability and a negative impact on physical, psychological, and social functioning components of quality of life (QOL). Patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may progress to phlebolymphedema, skin changes with chronic inflammation, and venous leg ulcerations.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society have collaborated to update the 2011 SVS/AVF guidelines on CVD, and recently published Part I of the 2022 clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. All recommendations in Part I were based on a new, independent systematic review and meta-analysisthat provided the latest scientific evidence to support updated or completely new guidelines on evaluation with duplex scanning and on the management of superficial truncal reflux in patients with varicose veins. The writing committee recognized, however, that several additional important clinical issues need to be addressed, but many have varying levels of scientific evidence. When a systematic review was not available, the writing committee based ungraded statements on a comprehensive review of the literature, combined with unanimous consensus of the expert panel.

### The role of venoactive compounds in the treatment of chronic venous disease [^d9d59575]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of evidence on VACs efficacy on venous symptoms

The results of the studies presented have been the background for the recommendations made by the various guidelines. The relative efficacy of the most commonly used VACs, according to the European Venous Forum/International Union of Angiology guidelines is shown in Table IV. It is clear that the two VACs with the most scientific evidence are MPFF and Ruscus extracts, and that there are relative differences in the efficacy of the various VACs. Using the Cohen classification that defined a SMD of 0.8 or greater as large, the reader can realize that the effect of VACs on several symptoms shown in the Table III is clinically significant, fact that is also supported by a very low NNT. Furthermore, these two VACs are the only ones with multiple symptoms being awarded a high certainty of evidence according to the GRADE system. A similar distinction was recently made by the 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities, in favor of MPFF and Ruscus extracts, which have been studied more extensively in double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs and meta-analyses. For patients with symptomatic CVD, who are not undergoing interventional treatment, are awaiting intervention, or have persisting symptoms after intervention, the European Society for Vascular Surgery CVD guidelines suggest that based on the available evidence for each individual drug, medical treatment with venoactive drugs should be considered.

Table IV
Relative efficacy of the most commonly used venoactive compounds (VACs)

Swelling and edema

A 2020 Cochrane review including 69 RCTsreported only moderate-certainty evidence that VACs reduce edema in the lower legs compared with placebo (RR, 0.70). However, meta-analyses and RTCs for individual VACs provided high-quality evidence of benefit for some compounds.

A meta-analysis of 10 calcium dobesilate RCTs found that reductions in malleolar swelling and leg volume were more pronounced in severe disease compared with those with mild disease. Another meta-analysis comparing results of calcium dobesilate RCTs with several VACs found it to be the most effective in reducing foot volume (mean reduction of −85 cm³/mL vs placebo).

For diosmin, a review of three RCTs found that its effects on the sensation of leg swelling are comparable with MPFF, in contrast with a meta-analysis by Allaert.

MPFF

A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs on 1692 patients with CVD, studied the effectiveness of MPFF across the spectrum of defined venous symptoms, QoL, and treatment assessment by the physician. On qualitative analysis, MPFF, compared with placebo, significantly improved nine defined leg symptoms, including pain, heaviness, feeling of swelling, cramps, paresthesia, burning sensation, and pruritus, as well as functional discomfort and QoL. On quantitative analysis, MPFF compared with placebo, assessed as a categorical variable, showed a statistically significant reduction of leg pain (risk ratio [RR], 0.53; number needed to treat [NNT], = 4.2), heaviness (RR, 0.35; NNT, 2.0), feeling of swelling (RR, 0.39; NNT, 3.1), cramps (RR, 0.51; NNT, 4.8), paresthesia (RR, 0.45; NNT, 3.5), and functional discomfort (RR, 0.41; NNT, 3.0). Similarly, MPFF compared with placebo, assessed as a continuous variable showed a statistically significant reduction of pain (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.25), heaviness (SMD, −0.80), feeling of swelling (SMD, −0.99), burning sensation (SMD, −0.46), cramps (SMD, −0.46), and functional discomfort (SMD, −0.87). Regarding objective assessments of leg edema, the use of MPFF compared with placebo showed a statistically significant clinical improvement as assessed by the physician (RR, 0.28; NNT, 2.5) and also improvement of QoL (SMD, −0.21). Heterogeneity was mostly minimal, although the existing evidence, where sufficient, was mostly of high certainty, indicating that further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect. Real-world studies, such as VEIN STEP (Chronic VEnous dIsorders maNagement and Treatment effectivenesS evaluaTion in Chronic vEnous Disease, an International Program) have confirmed the clinical effectiveness of MPFF. In an emerging area to improve patient symptoms after intervention, a beneficial effect has been shown and acknowledged by the guidelines.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8274b46a]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The available evidence suggests that compression stockings may play a role in the prevention of ulcer recurrence, but the evidence has limitations. In addition to lack of blinding, attrition bias associated with incomplete outcome assessment and poor patient compliance reduces the quality of evidence. Patient compliance with the recommended regimen varies between studies and between treatment groups and it seems like the compliance rates decrease for stockings with higher compression grades. Three of the included studies did not report reasons for noncompliance, whereas one study reported that noncompliance was explained by tightness, inability to apply or remove the compression stockings and skin sensitivity. The same study reported that poor compliance was associated with lower effect, but these findings were contradicted by studies reporting that the overall results did not change significantly when non-compliant patients were excluded from the analysis.

It is reasonable to expect that poor compliance not only impact the effect of compression stockings, but also poses a challenge in ordinary practice. Healthcare professionals should focus on methods that improve patient compliance. Compression stockings may be a resource-demanding intervention, as elderly people with chronic venous insufficiency often need assistance from home care personnel to administer the stockings. Health professionals in close dialogue with each individual patient should evaluate the need for compression stockings before and during the treatment, because of the personnel cost, and the sparse and inconsistent body of the evidence.

A major strength of this systematic review is the extensiveness of the systematic search. Even though the search was comprehensive, only five randomized trials were included and no relevant ongoing studies were found. It is a limitation that the quality of the evidence was graded from moderate to very low, implying there is a need for further research on these topics before we can make a firm conclusion about the effects of preventive use of compression stockings.

Based on this systematic review, the prevalence of venous disease and the resources associated with the treatment, the research activity should continue to target this very important issue, preferably with more well-designed RCTs. In particular, there is a need for further studies about the preventive use of compression stockings for elderly patients with venous insufficiency and swollen legs. It is important to measure outcomes such as vein thrombosis and mobility in addition to leg ulcers.

### Is iPad-based three-dimensional scanning the future for evaluating lower extremity volume or edema in clinic? [^cfba9abb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

As mentioned by the authors, objectively measuring lower extremity volumes may be beneficial, particularly for patients with venous disease, because edema is one of the most cumbersome symptoms that our patients suffer from. It is difficult to evaluate the success of treatment, particularly when the main symptom is limb swelling. Traditionally, lower extremity edema or volume has been quantified by measuring the extremity diameter at different points including the ankle, calf, and thigh and comparing those values with previous measurements. However, based on varying techniques, this approach can cause large variations, rendering the measurements inaccurate and unreliable as a way to quantify limb volumes. Specifically for venous disease the Clinical Etiological Anatomical Pathophysiological score is used, but does not really make a differentiation on the severity of edema. The revised Venous Clinical Severity score takes into consideration the severity of the edema: edema is scored as mild if it is limited to the foot and ankle, moderate if it extends above the ankle but below the knee, and severe if it extends to the knee and above. Much clinical decision-making is also based on patient perception of their symptoms. Usually, patients can tell if their edema is stable, improving, or worsening. However, no objective data can be collected based on patient report. Therefore, the authors' attempt to measure lower extremity edema objectively can be very useful in the clinic setting to correlate volume with symptoms and even gauge treatment result.

Methods

This systematic review follows the recommendations of the Cochrane handbook of systematic reviews of interventions. The protocol of this systematic review was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) with registration number CRD42018092944.

Search methodology

An information specialist (HS) planned and performed a systematic search in the following databases: Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL in March 2018. We used a combination of subject headings and text words for venous insufficiency and compression stockings. In addition, searches were made in WHO International Clinical Trials Registry andfor ongoing studies in August 2018. The search strategies were adapted to each database as presented in Additional file 1.

### Review of the evidence of lymphedema treatment effect [^c0f785c8]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Lymphedema treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, and reduce risk for skin infection. Mainstream treatment options have been investigated in more than 160 studies. Findings from these studies have been included in at least 1 of more than 20 literature reviews. A critique of these reviews was undertaken to summarize efficacy findings. The quality of the reviews was evaluated, and gaps in the research were identified to better guide clinical practice. Overall, there was wide variation in review methods. The quality of studies included in reviews, in study design and reporting overall, has been poor. Reviews consistently concluded that complex physical therapy is effective at reducing limb volume. Volume reductions were also reported after the use of compression garments, pumps, and manual lymphatic drainage. However, greatest improvements were reported when these treatments formed a combined treatment program. Large, well-designed, evaluated, and reported randomised, controlled trials are needed to evaluate and compare treatments. Consistent outcome measures will allow better quality reviews and meta-analysis in the future.

Abiraterone acetate tablets may cause serious side effects including:

- High blood pressure (hypertension), low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), fluid retention (edema), and irregular heartbeats can happen during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets. This can be life threatening. To decrease the chance of this happening, you must take prednisone with abiraterone acetate tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will check your blood pressure, do blood tests to check your potassium levels, and check for any signs and symptoms of fluid retention every month during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets.

 Tell your healthcare provider if you get any of the following symptoms:

o dizziness o confusion

o fast or irregular heartbeats o muscle weakness

o feet faint or lightheaded o pain in your legs

o headache o swelling in your legs or feet

- Adrenal problems may happen if you stop taking prednisone, get an infection, or are under stress.

- Severe l iver problems. You may develop changes in liver function blood tests. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your liver before treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets and during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets. Liver failure may occur, which can lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you notice any of the following changes:

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^35b1402a]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review, we aimed to summarize the preventive effects of medical compression stockings for patients with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs. We included five randomized controlled trial. The main finding is that compression stockings class 2 probably reduce the risk of leg ulcer recurrence compared to compression stockings class 1. One included study suggests that stockings of higher compression (class 3) were better than medium compression (class 2), but the study only included 100 participants and overall evidence was assessed as having low quality. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether the use of stockings with higher compression grades is associated with a further risk reduction. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the use of compression stockings reduces subjective symptoms and foot volume for patients with chronic venous insufficiency. We found no studies investigating the preventive use of compression stockings for patients with venous insufficiency or swollen legs on vein thrombosis or mobility.

The results we present on risk of ulcer recurrence are in accordance with the review of Nelson et al. The evidence is sparse, but class 2 compression stockings seem to be more effective than lower class stockings in the prevention of ulcer recurrence. Consistent with our findings, another review states that the evidence is too sparse to allow firm conclusions about the effects of compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins in patients without ulceration.

Two additional primary studies have shown that compression stockings are effective in reducing pain and symptoms in patients younger than 70 years suffering from chronic venous insufficiency. Moreover, a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of progressive compression stockings (compression with maximal pressure at calf) reported that progressive compression stockings (10 mmHg at ankle, 23 mmHg at upper calf) were more effective than ordinary compressive stockings (30 mmHg at ankle, 21 mmHg at upper calf) in reducing pain and heavy legs. However, the patients in the latter studies were too young to be included in our review, and the applicability to a geriatric population can be questioned.

The CEAP classification was designed at a consensus meeting of international experts in 1994, it was updated in 2004, and most recently in 2020. The classification is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classification reports the single highest C class, and the advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb. Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and < 3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, < 1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥ 3 mm in diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP Class C2. CVD is defined as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6. The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a). Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning, cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg or itching. The most important of these have been identified as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching. CEAP is a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring system, or an outcome measure that reflects changes over time. For a table of the updated CEAP classification please see Part I of the Guidelines.

1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.

### Lymphedema: a comprehensive review [^25770f9c]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema is a chronic, debilitating condition that has traditionally been seen as refractory or incurable. Recent years have brought new advances in the study of lymphedema pathophysiology, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic tools that are changing this perspective.

Objective

To provide a systematic approach to evaluating and managing patients with lymphedema.

Methods

We performed MEDLINE searches of the English-language literature (1966 to March 2006) using the terms lymphedema, breast cancer-associated lymphedema, lymphatic complications, lymphatic imaging, decongestive therapy, and surgical treatment of lymphedema. Relevant bibliographies and International Society of Lymphology guidelines were also reviewed.

Results

In the United States, the populations primarily affected by lymphedema are patients undergoing treatment of malignancy, particularly women treated for breast cancer. A thorough evaluation of patients presenting with extremity swelling should include identification of prior surgical or radiation therapy for malignancy, as well as documentation of other risk factors for lymphedema, such as prior trauma to or infection of the affected limb. Physical examination should focus on differentiating signs of lymphedema from other causes of systemic or localized swelling. Lymphatic dysfunction can be visualized through lymphoscintigraphy; the diagnosis of lymphedema can also be confirmed through other imaging modalities, including CT or MRI. The mainstay of therapy in diagnosed cases of lymphedema involves compression garment use, as well as intensive bandaging and lymphatic massage. For patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy, several surgical options with varied proven efficacies have been used in appropriate candidates, including excisional approaches, microsurgical lymphatic anastomoses, and circumferential suction-assisted lipectomy, an approach that has shown promise for long-term relief of symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of lymphedema requires careful attention to patient risk factors and specific findings on physical examination. Noninvasive diagnostic tools and lymphatic imaging can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of lymphedema or to address a challenging clinical presentation. Initial treatment with decongestive lymphatic therapy can provide significant improvement in patient symptoms and volume reduction of edematous extremities. Selected patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy can achieve similar outcomes with surgical intervention, most promisingly suction-assisted lipectomy.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78b15a5d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a condition with impaired blood flow in the deep leg veins, and is usually caused by inadequate venous valves. The condition is characterized by symptoms like oedema, skin changes, fatigue, leg pain and a sensation of heaviness in the leg, and can be diagnosed by using ultrasound techniques to detect venous reflux and pooling of blood in deep leg veins. Venous insufficiency may develop into chronic leg ulcer and deep vein thrombosis. Venous thrombosis may damage the valves, and symptoms and signs of chronic venous insufficiency following a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are called post-thrombotic syndrome. The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification is an accepted standard for classifying chronic venous disorders. The chronic venous disorders are classified from C0 to C6 based on the severity of venous symptoms. The prevalence of venous insufficiency varies considerably between genders, ethnic backgrounds and age groups. A German cross-sectional study from 2008 included more than 3000 people aged 18 to 79 years, and estimated the overall prevalence of venous insufficiency to 31%. The risk of venous insufficiency increases with age.

Physical activity, smoking cessation, weight reduction, leg elevation, anticoagulant drugs and medical compression stockings may reduce symptoms and prevent progress of chronic venous insufficiency. External compression, such as medical compression stockings, may reduce oedema and swelling, and improve microcirculation. Medical compression stockings reach the knee or the hip and usually exert a pressure of 20 to 40 mmHg. Different standards exist, but according to the European standard, compression stockings are categorised into four classes. Class 1 stockings exert pressures below 20 mmHg and are used to prevent oedema. Class 2 stockings exert pressures between 20 and 30 mmHg and are used in the prevention of venous insufficiency and varicose veins. Class 3 stockings result in high compressions between 30 and 40 mmHg and are used for chronic venous insufficiency, whereas class 4 stockings exert very high compression above 40 mmHg and are primarily used in the treatment of lymphoedema.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^6afcc79c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

In patients with varicose veins, compression therapy has been used for decades to decrease pain and swelling. Graduated elastic compression stockings oppose tissue expansion when muscles contract. It can narrow the superficial veins diameter and therefore decrease the venous reflux and venous hypertension, key elements in the pathophysiology of CVD.

Evidence

The clinical benefit of compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins has been studied in a recent Cochrane review of 13 trials, encompassing > 1000 patients(Table III). Compression stockings were compared with no stockings or placebo stockings. Four RCTs showed improvement in symptoms, but they were subject to bias. Three of the four studies reported side effects of discomfort, appearance, and application difficulty. The benefits of stockings were offset by highly variable reports of compliance, presumably due to the most common side effects of itching and irritation. Graduated compression stockings are classified according to the pressure applied at the level of the ankle: Class 1, low-pressure stockings exert an ankle pressure < 20 mm Hg; Class 2, moderate compression is between 20 and 30 mm Hg; and Class 3 stocking are high compression stockings with ankle pressures of > 30 mm Hg. When comparing against different levels of compression and lengths of stockings, there was no clear difference in this Cochrane review. Patient preference for one stocking over another was largely driven by comfort. None of the studies assessed QOL. Overall, there was insufficient high quality of evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins and if one stocking is better than the other. Real-world data suggest that compliance with compression stockings can be as low as 37%. For additional evidence, see Part I of the Guidelines.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^1b6209a2]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complete Decongestive Therapy

Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) has been a mainstay in nonsurgical management since its introduction in the 1980s. Once a diagnosis of lymphedema is confirmed, patients are referred to a licensed lymphedema therapist who supervises the implementation of CDT, which includes manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression, exercise, skin care, and education. The success of this treatment largely depends on patient adherence to the regimen, which involves regular visits with the specialist divided into two phases. Phase I typically consists of an intensive 6-week program aimed at reducing the size of the swollen limb and preventing infection. Phase II follows, during which the focus shifts to maintenance therapy, promoting self-management for patients. They are encouraged to wear custom-fitted garments designed specifically for their limb to provide continuous compression and to maintain limb size.

CDT is often regarded as the first-line treatment for lymphedema, with studies revealing reduction in limb volumes and improvement in quality of life. – There is ongoing debate in the literature regarding which components of complete decongestive therapy are essential for effective volume reduction. Some studies suggest that individual elements, such as compression, physical exercise, or manual lymphatic drainage, may be sufficient on their own. – These studies, however, may be limited by small sample sizes. More recently, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) has been proposed as a viable adjunct to CDT for select patients with lymphedema. A 2024 systematic review assessing IPC found that, although its addition did not affect limb volume significantly, it significantly improved external joint mobility.

### Results from a comparative study to evaluate the treatment effectiveness of a nonpneumatic compression device vs an advanced pneumatic compression device for lower extremity lymphedema swelling (TEAYS study) [^edc9d5e8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, lymphedema is a disease without a cure and has many consequences for patients, including significant impairments to their life and function. If left untreated, lymphedema can lead to severe pain, infection, ulceration, and life-threatening infections. The debilitating aspects of lymphedema include loss of mobility, impaired range of motion, skin breakdown (aside from ulceration), skin weeping, psychosocial aspects related to image, and inability to complete activities of daily living independently. The chronic ailment and progression can magnify risk of infection, cellulitis, ulceration, as well as an increased risk of hospitalization. Treatment goals for lymphedema include limb volume decrease and prevention of infections. Complete decongestive therapy remains the cornerstone for treatment of lymphedema. Complete decongestive therapy involves a combination treatment protocol and requires a synergy of five components that include skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, a multilayered bandaging system application with adjunct compression garments and devices, decongestive exercises, and patient education for risk decrease strategies. In the home setting, intermittent pneumatic compression devices (PCDs), including advanced pneumatic PCDs or APCDs (calibrated gradient air compressor with multiple cells), have been used in the ongoing management of this condition. Pneumatic compression treatment typically involves the patient lying down in a supine position for the entirety of the treatment duration, which can be ≤ 1 hour each day. Although effective, adherence remains a challenge for such therapies. Additionally, the lack of mobility during treatment remains counterproductive to recommended modalities where exercise and movement are needed for enabling the venous return and lymphatic transport and clearance.

### Developing drugs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what have we learned from clinical trials? [^ba5e868e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Pathophysiologically, HF is defined as the inability of the heart to provide adequate perfusion to the body and its tissues. Clinically, HF is defined as a syndrome with typical signs (pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure) and symptoms (dyspnea, ankle swelling, and fatigue), which result from abnormal cardiac structure or function. 1, 2 HF is a highly prevalent disease, affecting 5.8 million people in the USA and nearly 15 million in Europe. 3, 4 The symptoms and the need for frequent hospitalizations in HF cause a significant burden on individual patients. At the same time, HF is a major public health concern due to the need for frequent and intense healthcare resource utilization. 1, 2, 4, 5 Further, despite the use of currently available therapies, the prognosis of patients with HF is considerably poor, with 5‐year survival rates of 50%, a prognosis even worse than that of patients with advanced cancer or stroke. 6

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9e8f4a90]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many home-dwelling elderly use medical compression stockings to prevent venous insufficiency, deep venous thrombosis, painful legs and leg ulcers. Assisting users with applying and removing compression stockings demands resources from the home based health services, but the effects are uncertain. This systematic review aims to summarize the effects of preventive use of medical compression stockings for patients with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs.

Methods

We conducted a search in six databases (Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL) in March 2018. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the preventive effects of European standard compression stockings class 3 or 2 for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs were included. Primary outcomes were thrombosis, leg ulcers and mobility. Secondary outcomes were other health related outcomes, e.g. pain, compliance.

We assessed risk of bias in the included studies and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool for evaluating the overall quality of evidence.

Results

Five randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Comparing compression stockings class 2 to class 1, meta-analysis showed a reduction in leg ulcer recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88). The quality of evidence was assessed as moderate by GRADE. One study (100 participants) did not detect a difference between compression stockings class 3 versus class 2 on ulcer recurrence after six months (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.20 to 2.03). In another study, patients wearing class 3 compression stockings had lower recurrence risk compared with patients without stockings (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76) at six months and (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.69) at 12 months. We found no difference between class 2 and class 1 stockings on subjective symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency or outcomes of vein thrombosis or mobility.

Conclusion

Compression stockings class 2 probably reduce the risk of leg ulcer recurrence compared to compression stockings class 1. It is uncertain whether the use of stockings with higher compression grades is associated with a further risk reduction. More randomized controlled trials on vein thrombosis and mobility are needed.

### Compression therapy for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome [^b180defa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by chronic pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One of every three people with DVT will develop post-thrombotic complications within five years. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. Clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of the utility of compression therapy for treatment of DVT. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To determine relative effectiveness and rate of complications when compression therapy is used in people with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (20 March 2017) and CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2). The CIS also searched trial registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of compression therapy, such as bandaging and elastic stockings, in people with clinically confirmed DVT. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PTS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK and EvL) identified and assessed titles and abstracts for relevance, and a third review author (DA) verified this assessment independently. Review authors imposed no restrictions on date or language of publications. Three review authors (DA, DK, EvL) used data extraction sheets to independently extract study data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

We identified 10 RCTs with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy. The overall methodological quality of these trials was low. We used only five studies in meta-analysis owing to differences in intervention types and lack of data. Three studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg at the ankle) versus no intervention. Two studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure 20 to 40 mmHg) versus placebo stockings. Overall, use of elastic compression stockings led to a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of PTS (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01; P = 0.05; 1393 participants; 5 studies; low-quality evidence); no reduction in the incidence of severe PTS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; 1224 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence); and no clear difference in DVT recurrence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.28; 1212 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). We did not pool data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism because this information was poorly reported, but we observed no differences between groups included in individual studies (low-quality evidence). Two studies evaluated effects of compression in the acute phase versus no compression treatment and found no differences in the incidence of PTS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; P = 0.2; 101 participants). One study reported that thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6; 267 participants). Another trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence. Two of the 10 included studies described patient satisfaction and quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), using different measurement systems. The first study showed significant improvement in well-being and DVT-related quality of life with compression treatment (P < 0.05) compared with bed rest, and the second study showed no differences in quality of life scores between compression and placebo groups. Four studies poorly reported side effects (low-quality evidence) that included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction and described no serious adverse events. Compliance with wearing of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence suggests that elastic compression stockings may reduce the occurrence of PTS after DVT. We downgraded the quality of evidence owing to considerable heterogeneity between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. No serious adverse effects occurred in these studies. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings because of current lack of high-quality evidence and considerable heterogeneity.

### Compression for venous leg ulcers [^409741a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Up to one percent of people in industrialised countries will suffer from a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (or varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment is the application of a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it was unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and, if so, which method of compression is the most effective.

Objectives

To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects on venous ulcer healing of compression bandages and stockings. Specific questions addressed by the review are:1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing? 2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective?

Search Methods

For this second update we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (31 May 2012); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 5, 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to May Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 30 May 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 21); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 May 2012). No date or language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

RCTs recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression stockings were eligible for inclusion. Eligible comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. RCTs had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). SECONDARY OUTCOMES of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction was performed by one review author and verified independently by a second review author.

Main Results

Forty-eight RCTs reporting 59 comparisons were included (4321 participants in total). Most RCTs were small, and most were at unclear or high risk of bias. Duration of follow-up varied across RCTs. Risk ratio (RR) and other estimates are shown below where RCTs were pooled; otherwise findings refer to a single RCT. There was evidence from eight RCTs (unpooled) that healing outcomes (including time to healing) are better when patients receive compression compared with no compression. Single-component compression bandage systems are less effective than multi-component compression for complete healing at six months (one large RCT). A two-component system containing an elastic bandage healed more ulcers at one year than one without an elastic component (one small RCT). Three-component systems containing an elastic component healed more ulcers than those without elastic at three to four months (two RCTs pooled), RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.67), but another RCT showed no difference between groups at six months. An individual patient data meta-analysis of five RCTs suggested significantly faster healing with the four-layer bandage (4LB) than the short stretch bandage (SSB): median days to healing estimated at 90 and 99 respectively; hazard ratio 1.31 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.58). High-compression stockings are associated with better healing outcomes than SSB at two to four months: RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.10), estimate from four pooled RCTs. One RCT suggested better healing outcomes at 16 months with the addition of a tubular device plus single elastic bandage to a base system of gauze and crepe bandages when compared with two added elastic bandages. Another RCT had three arms; when one or two elastic bandages were added to a base three-component system that included an outer tubular layer, healing outcomes were better at six months for the two groups receiving elastic bandages. There is currently no evidence of a statistically significant difference for the following comparisons:⋅alternative single-component compression bandages (two RCTs, unpooled);⋅two-component bandages compared with the 4LB at three months (three RCTs pooled);⋅alternative versions of the 4LB for complete healing at times up to and including six months (three RCTs, unpooled);⋅4LB compared with paste bandage for complete healing at three months (two RCTs, pooled), six months or one year (one RCT for each time point);⋅adjustable compression boots compared with paste bandages for the outcome of change in ulcer area at three months (one small RCT);⋅adjustable compression boots compared with the 4LB with respect to complete healing at three months (one small RCT);⋅single-layer compression stocking compared with paste bandages for outcome of complete healing at four months (one small RCT) and 18 months (another small RCT);⋅low compression stocking compared with SSB for complete healing at three and six months (one small RCT);⋅compression stockings compared with a two-component bandage system and the 4LB for the outcome of complete healing at three months (one small, three-armed RCT); and,⋅tubular compression compared with SSB (one small RCT) for complete healing at three months.

Secondary Outcomes

4LB was more cost-effective than SSB. It was not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding other secondary outcomes including recurrence, adverse events and health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear to be more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents. Two-component bandage systems appear to perform as well as the 4LB. Patients receiving the 4LB heal faster than those allocated the SSB. More patients heal on high-compression stocking systems than with the SSB. Further data are required before the difference between high-compression stockings and the 4LB can be established.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^13413bb4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We aim to review the current medical and surgical management strategies for lymphedema and present methods for their successful integration into clinical practice. In addition, the following summary background data is provided. Lymphedema is a chronic condition resulting from impaired lymphatic drainage, leading to significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Traditional management includes conservative therapies such as compression garments and physical therapy. However, advancements in surgical techniques have opened new avenues for treatment. This review aims to synthesize the available literature on both medical and surgical approaches to lymphedema management.

Materials and Methods

This article explores the senior author's strategies and experiences in lymphedema treatment, supplemented by a literature review that supports the described techniques.

Results

Effective lymphedema management is multifaceted, necessitating accurate diagnosis, medical treatment, and in some cases, surgical intervention. The senior author has sought to streamline his approach to this complex condition, and this article outlines his algorithm and techniques for treatment.

Conclusions

While conservative treatments remain the foundation of lymphedema management, surgical options in the properly selected patients have shown promising results. The integration of these approaches could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve quality of life for individuals affected by lymphedema.

### An under-diagnosed cause of leg swelling [^c8fdbffa]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A grossly obese woman was wrongly diagnosed throughout her adult life of having lymphoedema. Her condition was subsequently confirmed as lipoedema, an entirely different condition, which is noted in medical text books but is seldom taught to medical students or to general practitioners. The condition is caused by abnormal deposition of adipose tissue in the extremities (usually the lower limbs) and almost exclusively affects women. It often starts at puberty or may occur after pregnancy. The exact aetiology is not yet understood but genetic and hormonal factors may be implicated. The problem is that misdiagnosis leads to inappropriate tests and improper treatment to the patient. When recognised it is often too late to do anything for the patient and they become highly dependent on social care. This case describes how the diagnosis can be confirmed through an ultrasound image and illustrates the need for early recognition to facilitate specialist care.

### The effect of muscles in the treatment of lower limb lymphedema: respiratory muscles or leg muscles? [^3d99a1d5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions

MLDB

The MLDB program, which includes manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging, and skin care, was administered in the Vodder's technique by a physiotherapist specialized in lymphedema to all groups (30 min per day, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks). MLD involves a gentle, skin-stretching massage aimed at facilitating the drainage of lymphatic fluid from the swollen limb. The drainage procedures involved positioning the patient in different postures and targeting specific anatomical regions. In the supine and prone position, drainage was performed in the cervical and abdominal regions, and for the affected lower limbs. Additionally, appropriate anastomoses were established to direct towards the axilla and unaffected inguinal region. After completing MLD in all patients, the process moved on to the skin care phase. The lower limbs were moistened with a neutral pH water-based moisturizer.

The compression bandage was applied after skin care and involved the use of stockinette, finger bandages, cotton, sponges, and short stretch bandages applied from the toes to the groin. In routine conditions, patients were asked to protect their bandages on until the next session. They were also provided with instructions on how to consult with us if they experienced symptoms such as bruising or numbness in their toes, and how to safely remove the bandages if needed.

CMT

Progressive resistance exercises for calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) performed by physiotherapists, using elastic bands (red–green–blue bands, starting from low to high resistance), single and double leg heel/toe raises with body weight, standing still exercises, ankle pumping, mini squat exercises were implemented, increasing sets and repetitions, for 30 min per day, 5 days a week, over 3 weeks. The one repetition of maximum for muscle strength was measured again at the beginning of each week to determine the new workload.

### Guidelines relevant to diagnosis, assessment, and management of lymphedema: a systematic review [^364cf163]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Lymphedema is a common, distressing and debilitating condition with various etiologies. Effective diagnosis, assessment, and management rely on evidence-based clinical practice guidelines ("guidelines"). This study aims to describe and compare international guidelines on lymphedema diagnosis, assessment, and management. Recent Advances: The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Systematic searches of electronic literature databases and the web were completed in December 2020 for lymphedema guidelines published in English since 2000. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)-II reporting checklist. Synthesis took a narrative approach to compare guideline recommendations and associated levels of evidence. Critical Issues: This systematic review of 1,564 articles and 159 web pages yielded 14 guidelines. All guidelines were from high-income countries. Ten focused exclusively on lymphedema, and four on cancer. Most (n = 13) guidelines recommended an integrated medical, psychological assessment, and physical examination, with a limb volume measurement of > 10% in the affected limb compared, confirming a lymphedema diagnosis. Recommended management involved Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) followed by self-management using skincare, self-lymphatic drainage massage, exercise, and compression. Future Directions: The underlying etiology of lymphedema appeared to make little difference to guideline recommendations regarding care. High-quality guidelines are available to guide lymphedema care. However, their suitability for low-resource settings is unclear.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^8a1f1bdb]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg — this introductory page outlines the scope and evidence approach, stating that the American College of Phlebology prepared a summation document reflecting evidence-based recommendations from the Gloviczki paper and other current studies, with additional guidance based on ACP expert consensus where research is sparse yet therapy is considered standard of care. It notes that ultrasound, endovenous ablation devices, foam sclerotherapy and tumescent anesthesia have moved treatment from the operating room to office or radiology settings and that medical necessity policy for chronic venous disease (CVD) has become fragmented and inconsistent across the U.S. The authors suggest that evidence based medical necessity should not vary greatly by geography or insurer and introduce the concept of "medically significant venous insufficiency" or "evidence-based medical significance". They state that medical evidence should determine the definition of medically significant venous insufficiency using a combination of CEAP and VCSS classifications and propose that payers retain this evidence-based definition while choosing whether it becomes a "covered benefit" or a "non-covered benefit", with medical necessity guidelines to follow in summary format.

### Learning from a lymphedema clinic: an algorithm for the management of localized swelling [^e0034bfb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema is a chronic disease causing significant morbidity for affected patients. It can be difficult to diagnose, and patients are often frustrated by multiple referrals and inadequate therapies. Centralized, comprehensive care for the patient presenting with lymphedema or other causes of localized swelling allows for appropriate evaluation and provides improved management and treatment.

Methods

A 4-year review of the first 100 patients seen at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Lymphedema Clinic was performed. On the basis of the clinical experience from these patients, an algorithm for diagnosing and managing patients with localized swelling was developed.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 50 years, and 81 percent of the patients were women. On average, patients had experienced their symptoms for 11.6 years (range, 3 months to 60 years). Lymphoscintigraphy was performed on 43 patients, 81 percent of whom showed lymphatic obstruction or dysfunction. In total, 75 percent of patients were diagnosed with lymphedema based on clinical presentation or additional testing. Fourteen of these patients underwent subsequent excisional procedures, whereas the rest were managed conservatively with compression garments.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with swollen extremities can frequently be diagnosed through history and physical examination alone, but many patients require more extensive diagnostic workup. An algorithm for the management of these patients can facilitate evaluation and treatment.

American Venous Forum/American Vein and Lymphatic Society/Society for Vascular Medicine consensus — scope of agreement: The consensus process demonstrated that lymphedema experts agree on the majority of the statements related to risk factors for lymphedema and the diagnostic workup for lymphedema patients, with less agreement on statements related to treatment of lymphedema; this consensus suggests that variability in lymphedema care is high even among the experts, and developers of future practice guidelines for lymphedema should consider this information, especially in cases of low-level evidence that supports practice patterns with which the majority of experts disagree.

Results

The result of the study selection is shown in Fig. 1. The search yielded 1027 unique references, and 47 references were retrieved and reviewed in full text. Five randomized controlled trials were included. We found no relevant ongoing studies. The studies were published between 1997 and 2013 and included a total of 684 participants with chronic venous insufficiency. Two studies were from Australia, one from England, one from Ireland and one from Sweden.

PRISMA Flowchart of the study selection process

Description of studies

An overview of included studies is presented in Table 2. Four studies with 653 participants examined the effects of compression stockings treatment on ulcer recurrence for patients with recently healed venous leg ulcers. Four studies used European standard for defining compression classes, and they compared different grades of compression. One study used British standard and we redefined this to European standard. Two of the included studies reported education related to skin care and the use of compression stockings as part of the intervention, and two studies included self-reported assessment of compliance as part of the provided intervention.

1 Pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs and night cramps

One study included patients with signs of chronic venous insufficiency, whereas another study included patients with lipodermatosclerosis. In two studies about 70% of the participants were women. Comorbidity and details about the application of the compression stockings were poorly reported in the included studies. However, in one study the participants had to apply the compression stockings themselves. The fifth study included 31 participants with chronic venous insufficiency grade II, comparing compression stockings class 2 and compression stockings class 1.

Risk of bias

The risk of bias assessments are summarized in Fig. 2. Four studies had low risk of selection bias. Three studies had high risk of performance and detection bias, whereas three studies had low risk of attrition bias, four studies had low risk of reporting bias and two studies had other biases (Fig. 2).

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^a210808a]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Velcro wraps and pneumatic compression devices (SPC/APCD) in lymphedema — patient selection, consensus position, and evidence are summarized as follows: Velcro circumferential wraps are inelastic devices that are an alternative to compression garments; in early or uncomplicated lymphedema stage I, Velcro devices may be over treating and elastic compression stockings may be as effective, whereas Velcro may be a better option for lymphedema stage II and III. These wraps can fit very large legs, accommodate varied leg shapes, and are adjustable, but they require education for proper donning, some patients need assistance, devices may be uncomfortable in warmer humid weather, and patient compliance and preference are important for success. There was general consensus that SPC be recommended as an adjuvant within a multidisciplinary program including manual decongestive therapy, compression, and skin care for more advanced stages; some panelists felt SPC should be used in all stages, while others noted limited data for lower classes of lymphedema versus inelastic compression. Although one study showed superiority of an APCD over a standard device in breast cancer related lymphedema, there is no GRADE A or Level 1 evidence supporting any treatment method, including pneumatic compression, for reduction and/or maintenance of swelling. In a study of 100 consecutive lymphedema patients (78% with a secondary etiology) adding an advanced sequential (intermittent) pneumatic compression device to compression, SPC was well tolerated and associated with reduced limb girth, improved quality of life, and fewer cellulitis episodes over a 12-month period compared to the prior year. Two commercial claims-based studies found reduced healthcare costs with an advanced SPC device — one in mixed cancer and non-cancer lymphedema of upper and lower extremities and another in phlebolymphedema patients, almost all with either C5 or C6 CVL — driven primarily by fewer cellulitis-related inpatient/outpatient treatments and reduced use of physical and occupation therapy. Sequential pneumatic compression, often combined with exercise, meticulous skin hygiene, static compression, and complete decongestive therapy, has shown benefit in numerous studies.

### Treatment of edema [^a74457ab]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Edema is the result of an imbalance in the filtration system between the capillary and interstitial spaces. The kidneys play a key role in regulating extracellular fluid volume by adjusting sodium and water excretion. Major causes of edema include venous obstruction, increased capillary permeability, and increased plasma volume secondary to sodium and water retention. A systematic approach is warranted to determine the underlying diagnosis. Treatment includes sodium restriction, diuretic use, and appropriate management of the underlying disorder. Leg elevation may be helpful in some patients. Loop diuretics often are used alone or in combination. In patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV congestive heart failure, spironolactone has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites is treated with paracentesis and spironolactone. Dihydropyridine-induced edema can be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Lymphedema occurs when a protein-rich fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Compression garments and range-of-motion exercises may be helpful in patients with this condition.

### Compression therapy for occupational leg symptoms and chronic venous disorders-a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^41b9a810]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Leg discomfort and oedema are commonly attributed to a venous disorder (CVD) or chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and treated with compression hosiery. The pressure needed to achieve clinical benefit is a matter of debate.

Design

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared stockings exerting an ankle pressure of 10-20mmHg with placebo or no treatment and with stockings exerting a pressure of more than 20mmHg.

Methods

RCT were retrieved and analysed with the tools of the Cochrane Collaboration. Each study was reviewed independently. Subjective dichotomous and continuous factors and objective findings were pooled for statistical treatment.

Results

Eleven RCT fulfilled the predefined criteria. They included 1453 randomised subjects, 794 healthy people exposed to various forms of stress, 552 patients with a chronic venous disorder or chronic venous insufficiency and 141 patients after varicose vein surgery. Over all, compression with 10-20mmHg had a clear effect on oedema and symptoms as compared with < 10mmHg pressure, placebo stockings, or no treatment (p < .0001). No study showed a difference between 10–20 and > 20mmHg stockings.

Conclusions

Despite important methodological heterogeneity and sometimes sub-standard reporting the meta-analysis suggests that leg compression with 10-15mmHg is an effective treatment for CVD. Less pressure is ineffective and higher pressure may be of no additional benefit.

### Lymphedema: surgical and medical therapy [^1a704791]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary lymphedema is a dreaded complication that sometimes occurs after treatment of malignancies. Management of lymphedema has historically focused on conservative measures, including physical therapy and compression garments. More recently, surgery has been used for the treatment of secondary lymphedema.

Methods

This article represents the experience and treatment approaches of 5 surgeons experienced in lymphatic surgery and includes a literature review in support of the techniques and algorithms presented.

Results

This review provides the reader with current thoughts and practices by experienced clinicians who routinely treat lymphedema patients.

Conclusion

The medical and surgical treatments of lymphedema are safe and effective techniques to improve symptoms and improve quality of life in properly selected patients.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^329e944a]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Effects on secondary outcomes

Jungbeck et al. compared compression stockings class 2 and class 1 in 31 patients with chronic venous insufficiency grade II. The effects were assessed measuring foot volume and subjective symptoms (e.g. pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs and night cramps) after eight weeks. Subjective symptoms were assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). The authors were not able to detect a difference between class 2 and class 1 stockings on subjective symptoms after eight weeks, nor did they find a difference in foot volume or reflux values between the two groups. As the latter results were based on a single study with few participants and high risk of bias, we have very low confidence in these effect estimates.

### Systematic review of May-Thurner syndrome with emphasis on gender differences [^b474ff19]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is increasingly recognized as a frequent source of leg swelling and a precipitating factor for venous thromboembolism. This paper is a systematic review of the English literature on MTS with an analysis focusing on gender differences in presentation and treatment.

Methods

A systematic review of the English literature between April 1967 and December 2014 was performed using the following terms: "May-Thurner syndrome", "Cockett syndrome", and "iliac vein compression syndrome". After review, there were 174 articles in the analysis. We first analyzed all presented cases, followed by a gender comparison if case reports and case series had detailed description. Asymptomatic patients with just anatomic compression without symptoms were excluded. Statistical differences between data sets were assessed using χ² test and Student t-test.

Results

There were 1569 patients with MTS after exclusion of articles based on our criteria. The female to male ratio was 2:1 (976 [67.1%] vs 480 [32.9%]). Women presented at a younger age compared with men (38.7 ± 14.0 years vs 46.2 ± 16.9 years; P = 0.02). Gender comparison at presentation, which was available for 254 patients, showed that men had significantly more reported leg swelling (92.7% vs 80.8%; P = 0.037) and more leg pain (88% vs 74.3%; P = 0.045) compared with women. There was no difference in the reported proportion of patients presenting with deep venous thrombosis between the two groups (88.9% vs 81.7%; P = 0.14). However, women were significantly more likely to have a pulmonary embolus on presentation compared with men (9.9% vs 1.6%; P = 0.035). Treatment modalities included endovascular interventions without thrombolysis (53%) or with thrombolysis (33.2%), open surgery (6.8%), and medical management (7%). Endovascular treatment was more common than surgical or medical treatment (P < .001). Because of lack of granularity in the data, it was not possible to distinguish treatment methods between female and male patients. There was no statistically significant difference in complication rate between men and women based on the articles that provided that information (P = 0.34). However, open procedures had significantly higher complications compared with endovascular interventions (P = 0.021).

Conclusions

Based on the reported literature, MTS is more common in women and is at least twice as frequent in women as in men. Men tend to have more pain and swelling in the legs, whereas women tend to be younger and more likely to have a pulmonary embolus on presentation. MTS and iliac vein compression are sometimes used interchangeably in an inaccurate manner.

### Stasis dermatitis… [^54775286]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

This condition may occur when veins function ineffectively, leading to fluid pooling within the legs. As a result, the skin of the lower legs may become swollen, itchy, and discolored. Stasis dermatitis is more common in older adults. With age, 1-way valves within veins may not work effectively and allow blood to pool in the legs. This causes leg swelling and skin inflammation that leads to a rash. Medical conditions that affect blood flow in the legs, such as a blood clot, surgery that affects leg veins, or congestive heart failure, may also lead to stasis dermatitis. Patients with stasis dermatitis typically have swelling of 1 or both legs that can be more noticeable over the course of the day. They develop a red or brown itchy rash on 1 or both of their lower legs. The areas of the rash may be scaly and dry or drain clear liquid.

If blood flow is severely affected, skin sores may develop. Your physician may be able to diagnose this condition by examining your skin. They may order additional tests to evaluate your veins. Treatment of stasis dermatitis includes identifying the underlying cause of venous stasis as well as taking steps to reduce leg swelling and blood pooling within the leg veins. Minimize standing for long periods, elevate your legs when seated, and lose weight, if appropriate. Your physician may also recommend compression stockings or medicated leg wraps. Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers for the skin and moisturize with creams or ointments, such as petrolatum. Avoid using topical antibiotics that contain neomycin or bacitracin, as you may develop a skin allergy that may make your rash worse. Medicated steroid creams or ointments may be prescribed to help reduce skin inflammation or itch. If skin sores develop, these may require special wound care.

Seek immediate medical care if your legs become red and painful or you have symptoms like fever and chills. This could be a sign of an infection of the deeper layers of the skin that is caused by bacteria, which could require treatment with antibiotics.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^f6b2e4e3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Operative/endovascular management for venous leg ulcers — The quality of evidence to support recommendations for operative and endovascular management is limited to level C evidence, attributed to the absence of comparative prospective RCTs, with the exception of a few studies that address treatment of superficial venous disease. Even the data in the treatment of superficial insufficiency, as suggested by the commissioned meta-analysis, are limited in scope, and the data derived from open procedures (ligation and stripping RCTs) have been extrapolated to results that might be achieved with thermal ablation. Many recommendations regarding healed patients or patients with potential VLU are based on extrapolations from the data obtained from patients with active VLUs, and each specific patient condition needs focused investigation to determine what "best care" is. Several methods of great and small saphenous ablation are under investigation and may provide even less risk for the benefits provided. Deep venous reconstruction has often been reserved for cases in which nothing else has been successful; this treatment option has been a forgotten therapeutic alternative for patients with deep venous insufficiency in whom nonsurgical and superficial venous intervention has been unsuccessful, and there is room to reinvestigate this assumption by comparing repair of deep venous insufficiency vs outflow obstruction interventions in patients who have both conditions.

### Compression therapy for chronic venous insufficiency [^ec42235b]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Compression therapy provides a means to treat venous stasis, venous hypertension, and venous edema. Different methods of compression therapy have been described periodically over the last 2,000 years. In addition to static compression, specialized compression pumps have been developed and a technique of massage called manual lymphatic drainage has emerged to treat primary and secondary lymphedema. Objectives of compression therapy are to reduce the swollen limb to minimum size, maintain that size, and allow the patient to participate in the care of his limb whenever possible. Reduction therapy is achieved by limb elevation, compression pumps as necessary, and compression wraps. Maintenance therapy largely consists of compression wraps or compression stockings. Nonelastic devices have found a place in treating severe lymphedema but it should be emphasized that periodic follow-up must be done during maintenance therapy so that adjunctive maintenance measures can be added as needed.

### Compression therapy to prevent recurrent cellulitis of the leg [^3e6c8f24]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Chronic edema of the leg is a risk factor for cellulitis. Daily use of compression garments on the leg has been recommended to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis, but there is limited evidence from trials regarding its effectiveness.

Methods

In this single-center, randomized, nonblinded trial, we assigned participants with chronic edema of the leg and recurrent cellulitis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive leg compression therapy plus education on cellulitis prevention (compression group) or education alone (control group). Follow-up occurred every 6 months for up to 3 years or until 45 episodes of cellulitis had occurred in the trial. The primary outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis. Participants in the control group who had an episode of cellulitis crossed over to the compression group. Secondary outcomes included cellulitis-related hospital admission and quality-of-life assessments.

Results

A total of 183 patients were screened, and 84 were enrolled; 41 participants were assigned to the compression group, and 43 to the control group. At the time of a planned interim analysis, when 23 episodes of cellulitis had occurred, 6 participants (15%) in the compression group and 17 (40%) in the control group had had an episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.59; P = 0.002; relative risk [post hoc analysis], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.02), and the trial was stopped for efficacy. A total of 3 participants (7%) in the compression group and 6 (14%) in the control group were hospitalized for cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.09 to 1.59). Most quality-of-life outcomes did not differ between the two groups. No adverse events occurred during the trial.

Conclusions

In this small, single-center, nonblinded trial involving patients with chronic edema of the leg and cellulitis, compression therapy resulted in a lower incidence of recurrence of cellulitis than conservative treatment.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^5aeb6c98]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema compression garments — circular knit and flat knit characteristics and selection are contrasted as follows: Circular knit garments are seamless and generally not as dense or stiff as flat knit garments, and these garments are typically the first line of compression garments used by patients with relatively mild swelling and normal shaped legs. Flat knit machines create a sheet of fabric that must be cut and sewn, and this process allows for customization to accommodate any shaped leg; clinical indications for flat knit garments include significant differences in leg circumference as well as deep skin folds and edema of the toes/forefoot. However, these garments tend to be significantly more expensive which is often a barrier to acquisition. The prevailing opinion that flat‑knit garments offer intrinsically better containment was challenged by an International Compression Club study concluding the dynamic stiffness of circular and flat knit fabrics are not different. Practical considerations include patient compliance, cost, and reimbursement.

### Differential diagnosis of angioedema [^241656f5]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

There are many conditions that may present with swelling that mimics angioedema. When swelling persists for greater than a few days or is unresponsive to treatment for urticaria/angioedema, other etiologies should be considered. In most instances, a thorough history and physical examination will define other etiologies. However, for more persistent conditions, further laboratory evaluation and a biopsy may be required to define the diagnosis. Rarely is a more aggressive approach required to make the diagnosis. Clinicians should remember that if the swelling does not act like angioedema, it more than likely is not angioedema.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^4da79567]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

Lower leg ulcers can be associated with various underlying pathologies (venous insufficiency, arterial disease, diabetes) or a combination thereof. Proper assessment and diagnosis are important to choose the appropriate course of treatment. When venous disease is suspected, Doppler and Duplex scanning should be used to evaluate the venous and arterial circulations and confirm diagnosis.

Compression is the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic CVD and for venous ulcers. It is underutilized because of a lack of clinician knowledge, unclear referral pathways, local unavailability of compression, and patient unwillingness to receive compression. A fear of adverse events can be another reason for underutilization, but those are very rare if compression is used correctly and contraindications are taken into consideration. Compression, however, is not a long-term solution by itself and the option of interventional correction should be offered early to prevent or slow disease progression and reduce recurrence.

### Evaluation and management of the fat leg syndrome [^3d4ce7ab]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Discuss the initial evaluation of a patient presenting with lower extremity enlargement. 2. Distinguish underlying medical conditions causing lower extremity enlargement, including lymphedema and lipedema. 3. Discuss appropriate management and treatment for patients presenting with these conditions.

Background

Given the epidemic of obesity in the United States, many patients will consult the plastic surgeon with complaints of lower extremity enlargement secondary to "fat legs". In addition to cosmetic disfigurement, some patients may suffer from underlying medical conditions that are responsible for their symptoms. Knowledge of these other causes, including lymphedema and a disorder of abnormal fat deposition known as lipedema, ensures appropriate management and/or surgical treatment for affected patients.

Methods

Initial evaluation for lower extremity enlargement should include a discussion of pertinent medical history and a focused physical examination for findings that might indicate a pathologic underlying cause. When indicated, patients should undergo additional testing, including radiologic studies, to confirm their diagnoses.

Results

For those patients found to have lymphatic dysfunction, conservative management, such as massage therapy, use of compression garments, and limb elevation, should be initially recommended. Excisional or suction-assisted lipectomy may be considered in patients who fail conservative therapy. More extensive consultation with the plastic surgeon is recommended for patients seeking aesthetic improvement in contour and shape of large legs without a specified underlying abnormality.

Conclusions

Patients with lower extremity enlargement may present to the plastic surgeon unsure of the specific cause of their deformity. A broad differential diagnosis exists for their presentation, which can be narrowed by using the common features and unique manifestations of the conditions.

### Compression for venous leg ulcers [^e22f6a75]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Around one percent of people in industrialised countries will suffer from a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment has been a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it is unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and which compression garment is the most effective.

Objectives

To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials of the clinical effectiveness of compression bandage or stocking systems in the treatment of venous leg ulceration. Specific questions addressed by the review are:1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing? 2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective?

Search Strategy

For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (14/10/08); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2008); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to October Week 1 2008); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 41) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to October Week 1 2008). No date or language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression hosiery were eligible for inclusion. Comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. Trials had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). Secondary outcomes of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction was performed by one review author and verified independently by a second review author.

Main Results

Overall, 39 RCTs reporting 47 comparisons were included. Review question 1: there was reasonable evidence from seven RCTs that venous ulcers heal more rapidly with compression than without. Review question 2: findings from six trials of single-component compression suggested that this strategy was less effective than multi-component compression. Evidence from compression systems with two components (3 trials) and three components (4 trials) suggested better outcomes when an elastic component was included. Different versions of compression with four-components (based on the Charing Cross four-layer bandage system) have similar effectiveness (3 trials). Compression with four components (variants of the Charing Cross four-layer bandage) is more effective than multi-component compression that includes a short-stretch bandage (6 trials). It is difficult to determine the relative effectiveness of the four-layer bandage compared with paste bandage systems because of differences in the paste systems (5 trials). There was no difference in effectiveness between the adjustable compression boot and compression bandages (2 trials) or between single-layer compression stockings and paste bandages (2 trials). Two-layer stockings appeared more effective than the short-stretch bandage (2 trials). The relative effectiveness of tubular compression when compared with compression bandages was not clear from current evidence (2 trials). Three trials reported ulcer recurrence; because of sparseness of data and trials not being primarily designed to assess this outcome, firm conclusions could not be drawn. Although several trials included cost data, only one reported a rigorously conducted cost-effectiveness analysis with findings suggesting that the four-layer bandage was more cost-effective than multi-component compression comprising a short-stretch bandage. Seven trials assessed health-related quality of life and none observed significant differences between treatment groups. Several trials evaluated pain either as a stand-alone outcome, or as part of the assessment of adverse events. In general, the data did not indicate clear differences between treatment groups. It is possible that stockings could be associated with less pain than bandages but in view of scarcity of available data this requires further evaluation. Many of the trials reported adverse events and / or withdrawals. Overall, these outcomes appeared similar across different treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents.

Cancer-related therapy (CRT) and lymphedema — The panel's support for a CRT–lymphedema association is drawn from the extensive breast cancer literature, and edema has been estimated to occur in 19% of people with advanced cancer. From a Western medical context, CRT remains the most prevalent cause of lymphedema, and when addressing an individual who will be treated for cancer, the subject of lymphedema risk should be addressed and, where appropriate, surveillance and risk-reduction measures should be undertaken.

### Surgical intervention for lymphedema [^2fd8dfbc]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive disease with no curative treatment. Breast cancer therapy is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in the developed world. Treatment includes nonsurgical and surgical strategies. Conservative measures are reserved for subclinical lymphedema. Surgical options are divided into physiologic (to restore function) and reductive (to remove diseased tissue). Early stage disease is managed with physiologic procedures. Reductive treatment is reserved for moderate to severe staged disease owing to high morbidity. Surgical options effectively decrease edema and improve quality of life. However, further research is necessary to best establish management of lymphedema.

Treatment with compression therapy

Of the total group the majority received compression therapy (78.3%). Good control of swelling was judged by the clinician in 62.3% (4243/6815). Type of treatments are presented in Table 2.

Characterization of patients with obesity (univariate analysis)

Eighteen factors were found to be significantly associated with increased weight categories in patients with chronic leg oedema, Table 3. Increased weight category was positively associated with: longer swelling duration, decreased leg mobility, diabetes, presence of a leg wound, cellulitis within 12 months (e.g. affecting 13.7% in the normal weight, 15.9% in class I-II obesity and 19.8% in class III obesity), secondary lymphoedema, non-cancer lymphoedema, cancer treatment, oedema due to immobility, obesity, or filariasis, having bilateral lymphoedema (compared to unilateral), treatment in specialized lymphoedema clinics, and receiving compression therapy. Increased weight category was inversely associated with: age, peripheral arterial disease, metastatic cancer and oedema due to venous disease.

Lymphedema consensus methodology and evidence limitations state that results should be interpreted with several limitations, including that a systematic review was not conducted and the included studies' level of evidence was not graded using GRADE; a 6‑point Likert scale rather than a 5‑point Likert scale was used to increase precision; no specific pneumatic compression device was mentioned and evidence was based on clinical experience and judgement; the literature on all questions was weak and when agreement was very strong it was solely based on common sense and current clinical practice; no bias based on COI was identified, emphasizing the substantial need for further and more robust research and for well clinically and methodologically designed studies in lymphedema care.

Lymphedema treatment principles and compression technologies — The condition "is a progressive and incurable disease", making "early diagnosis and intervention, analogous to treatments for cancer or other progressive disease, is paramount", with "Intervention at pre-fibrotic (Stages 1–2) or even subclinical (Stage 0) stages is widely considered optimal for best results". For venous overlap, "All patients with edema due to chronic venous insufficiency should be considered for treatment similar to lymphedema patients", and recognition of coexistence "should prompt consideration for instituting advanced compressive modalities such as complete decongestive lymphatic physiotherapy and pneumatic compression pumps". For maintenance, "The expert panel identified the use of compression for maintaining limb volume reduction as opposed to a primary method of decongestion", and "Circular knit compression, flat knit compression and Velcro devices all garner support from the panelists". "Decongestive therapy with SPC and MLD as part of an overall complex decongestive therapy program were also recognized, while surgical therapy had less support from the expert panel". Device-oriented evidence noted that "APCDs (advanced pneumatic compression devices with calibrated gradient pressure) were superior to simpler devices (without calibrated gradient pressure)", and "The use of the trunk piece was felt by some to augment the physiologic effect".

Abstract

Lymphedema (LE) is characterized by the accumulation of lymph in the extremities, impairing functionality and quality of life. Despite its prevalence, accurate diagnoses and management remains complex because of inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria and limited epidemiological studies. This review aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of LE classifications, diagnostic approaches, and current management strategies. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of LE for improvement of clinical consistency and education.

Introduction

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a prevalent condition that tends to worsen with time. Patients initially seek treatment to relieve symptoms of leg pain, heaviness, and swelling, all of which impact their well-being. As the disease progresses varicose veins become more evident, there can be proinflammatory skin changes, and in some cases, there is venous ulceration. These conditions negatively impact patient quality of life and place substantial financial burdens on healthcare resources. Once venous insufficiency develops a vicious cycle of inflammation and leukocyte recruitment can lead to further deterioration of vein walls and valves, increased venous hypertension, and release of additional proinflammatory mediators that further influences the progression of the problem. Early treatment of CVD at the physiological level can help break the inflammatory cycle and alleviate symptoms and reduce progression to advanced disease.

Lymphedema diagnosis — clinical examination and imaging describe that clinical exam can be sufficient for characteristic presentations, with ultrasound broadly used for venous evaluation and selective confirmatory imaging in lower stages. It is stated that the diagnosis of Clinical Stage 2–3 lymphedema can be confidently made with clinical examination alone based on very characteristic findings. The page notes, "Ultrasound will be done in nearly all patients to evaluate the venous system", but also that evaluation for lower stage disease is "limited to centers of excellence". When invasive treatment or a research trial is planned, "an imaging or physiological test is required", and such information "is also valuable to help educate patients, encourage the use of compression, and to guide and assess treatment responses". For confirmatory testing, "Lymphoscintigraphy was the most commonly cited", though it "involves several hours of a patient's time" and intradermal radiotracer injection into the foot. Indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence lymphography "requires equipment that is currently only found in select lymphatic surgery centers", yet is "increasingly being used by lymphatic surgeons to refine assessment of the clinical stage, observe lymphatic function real-time, and localize lymphatic reflux and leak points".
