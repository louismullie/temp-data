## Question

What is significance of low free T in middle aged male with normal serum testosterone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of low free testosterone in a middle-aged man with normal total testosterone, and how to interpret and manage this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of SHBG and why free testosterone can be low despite normal total testosterone. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of low free testosterone, including symptom associations and outcomes. Next, I will review guideline positions on when and how to measure free testosterone. After that, I need to check for confounders and reversible causes, especially obesity, diabetes, and medications. Finally, I will consider management options, including lifestyle therapy, when to consider a monitored testosterone trial, and what to avoid, and I will close with a concise synthesis and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. Total testosterone includes free testosterone plus albumin-bound and SHBG-bound fractions; only about 2–4% is free, and SHBG rises with age while falling with obesity and diabetes, so a man can have normal total testosterone yet low free testosterone if SHBG is high, which is common in aging and in certain conditions like liver disease or anticonvulsant use, whereas obesity tends to lower SHBG and can mask low total testosterone by preserving free testosterone, creating pseudohypogonadism [^113VMm27] [^1138udww] [^115qUems].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance. Observational data in middle-aged and older men show that low calculated free testosterone with normal total testosterone is associated with more sexual and physical symptoms, lower hemoglobin, and worse bone parameters compared with men with normal free testosterone, supporting the biological plausibility that free testosterone better reflects tissue androgen exposure in some contexts [^114XFAuG]. I should also note that low free testosterone correlates with adverse outcomes in some cohorts, including higher fracture risk and possibly higher mortality, though confounding by comorbidity is common and causality cannot be inferred from observational designs [^113Wbnwe] [^112UtKEe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing strategy. Guidelines diverge: the Endocrine Society and EAU endorse measuring free testosterone when total testosterone is borderline or when SHBG is abnormal, whereas the AUA advises that free testosterone adds little when total testosterone is clearly low and should be reserved for equivocal cases, reflecting concerns about assay variability and limited outcome data. The ACP focuses on sexual dysfunction outcomes and does not position free testosterone as a primary diagnostic tool in age-related low testosterone [^115dQsiH] [^1145zyce] [^111GBUFL] [^1168ToX4]. I should double-check that calculated free testosterone is acceptable when using validated equations and reliable SHBG assays, and avoid direct analog immunoassays for free testosterone due to poor accuracy [^115dQsiH] [^114Cpe8q].

> I need to ensure we screen for confounders and reversible causes before labeling this as hypogonadism. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, chronic opioid or glucocorticoid use, and acute or chronic systemic illness can suppress the HPT axis and lower testosterone; weight loss of about 10% can raise total testosterone by roughly 50–100 ng/dL, and in many older obese men the biochemical pattern is low total testosterone with low SHBG and normal free testosterone, indicating a functional, reversible process rather than organic hypogonadism [^111tuHFS] [^112MhEgS] [^113BAEvt]. But wait, what if SHBG is high and total testosterone looks "normal"? That pattern can hide true androgen deficiency, so I should confirm SHBG and recalculate free testosterone before concluding anything definitive [^1138udww].

> Next, I should review how to confirm the diagnosis. I should confirm low total testosterone with a second early-morning fasting sample using a reliable assay, and if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, obtain SHBG and calculate free testosterone with a validated equation or use equilibrium dialysis where available; I should also measure LH and FSH to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism and consider prolactin, TSH, and iron studies if indicated, reserving pituitary imaging for low gonadotropins with low testosterone or other red flags [^115dQsiH] [^115LrmTB] [^11738iP2]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not diagnosing hypogonadism on a single low value, given substantial biological and analytical variability and the risk of false positives [^1122nN1A].

> I will now examine management when free testosterone is low and symptoms are present. First-line therapy is comprehensive lifestyle modification targeting weight loss, exercise, sleep apnea treatment, and optimization of comorbidities; this can meaningfully increase testosterone and improve overlapping symptoms, and in many men this obviates the need for testosterone therapy [^113BAEvt] [^112MhEgS]. If symptoms persist after 6–12 months of lifestyle therapy and both total and free testosterone remain unequivocally low on repeat testing, a shared decision-making discussion about a time-limited testosterone trial is reasonable, with counseling that benefits are modest and largely limited to sexual function, while long-term cardiovascular and prostate risks remain uncertain; I should set stop rules and reassess at 3–6 months [^1168ToX4] [^111u6X2r] [^11798Y7c]. I should confirm there are no contraindications such as untreated sleep apnea, erythrocytosis, recent cardiovascular events, or active prostate cancer before initiating therapy [^115dQsiH].

> Let me consider what to avoid. I should not start testosterone for nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, low mood, or poor cognition in the absence of consistent biochemical deficiency, given weak and uncertain benefit for these domains and potential harms; I should also avoid testosterone in men planning fertility, given suppression of spermatogenesis, and I should avoid overpromising benefits beyond what trials have shown, which is primarily improvement in sexual function and modest gains in bone density and hemoglobin in appropriately selected men [^116aoqZ4] [^11798Y7c] [^111u6X2r]. I should double-check that I am not using testosterone to treat obesity itself; testosterone is not indicated for weight loss, though weight loss improves testosterone, and conflating these can mislead patients [^111tuHFS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought low free testosterone might directly track with better cardiovascular outcomes, but I should correct that. Some observational data suggest lower free testosterone associates with less prostate cancer risk, yet this is not a reason to target low free testosterone therapeutically, and cardiovascular data remain mixed with no proven outcome benefit from raising free testosterone in older men; thus, I should not extrapolate observational associations into treatment indications [^111rtRHy] [^113Vw3oH]. I need to ensure shared decision-making emphasizes uncertainty and the need for ongoing monitoring of hematocrit, PSA, and symptom response if therapy is initiated [^115dQsiH].

> In summary, low free testosterone with normal total testosterone in a middle-aged man signals that tissue androgen availability may be reduced, particularly when SHBG is high, and it can be associated with sexual and physical symptoms and adverse outcomes; however, I should confirm the biochemical pattern with repeat morning testing, assess SHBG, and actively search for reversible causes before diagnosing hypogonadism, and I should prioritize lifestyle therapy first, reserving testosterone for persistent, symptomatic, biochemically confirmed deficiency after shared decision-making and with explicit stop criteria [^114XFAuG] [^115dQsiH] [^113BAEvt] [^1168ToX4].

---

Low free testosterone with normal total testosterone in middle-aged men is **clinically significant** because it reflects true androgen deficiency when SHBG is elevated or total testosterone is borderline [^115dQsiH] [^112Cpy5a]. This pattern is linked to **sexual dysfunction, fatigue, and metabolic risks** [^114XFAuG] [^113gXMH4], and guidelines advise measuring free testosterone in this context [^115dQsiH] [^114mNUJU]. Management should confirm with repeat morning testing, assess SHBG, and address reversible causes; testosterone therapy is reserved for **persistent symptoms with confirmed low free testosterone** after shared decision-making [^115dQsiH] [^1168ToX4].

## Physiological basis of low free testosterone with normal total testosterone

Total testosterone includes free, albumin-bound, and SHBG-bound fractions; only free testosterone is **biologically active** [^113VMm27]. SHBG rises with age, lowering free testosterone even when total testosterone is normal [^116yEGXD]. Thus, low free testosterone with normal total testosterone reflects **reduced bioavailable androgen** [^113VMm27].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Low free testosterone with normal total testosterone is associated with **symptoms and health risks**:

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, and decreased morning erections [^1132uPEZ] [^114XFAuG].
- **Fatigue and mood**: Increased fatigue, low mood, and reduced vitality [^114XFAuG].
- **Metabolic effects**: Higher risk of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes [^113gXMH4] [^115DMt7g].
- **Bone health**: Lower bone mineral density and higher fracture risk [^113Wbnwe] [^114gaRmZ].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis requires **careful testing and interpretation**:

- **Confirm low free testosterone**: Repeat morning fasting total testosterone and SHBG, then calculate free testosterone using a validated method [^115dQsiH] [^114Cpe8q].
- **Assess SHBG abnormalities**: Evaluate for liver disease, hyperthyroidism, or medications that alter SHBG [^1138udww].
- **Exclude acute illness**: Avoid testing during acute illness or medication use that suppresses testosterone [^115dQsiH] [^114Pw7bk].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **targeted free testosterone testing**:

- **Endocrine Society**: Measure free testosterone when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^115dQsiH].
- **AUA**: Free testosterone helps when total testosterone is 230–317 ng/dL or SHBG is altered [^111GBUFL].
- **EAU**: Consider free testosterone < 225 pmol/L as a possible cut-off for late-onset hypogonadism [^112Cpy5a] [^114uFEqc].

---

## Management strategies

Management should be **individualized and evidence-based**:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, exercise, and treatment of comorbidities can raise free testosterone and improve symptoms [^113BAEvt] [^112MhEgS].
- **Testosterone therapy**: Reserve for persistent symptoms with confirmed low free testosterone after shared decision-making and discussion of risks and benefits [^115dQsiH] [^1168ToX4].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly reassess symptoms, testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate health during therapy [^115dQsiH] [^11798Y7c].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

Controversies include the **accuracy of free testosterone assays** [^114kbPD3], the **definition of "low" free testosterone** [^117GN7s7], and the **long-term risks and benefits** of testosterone therapy in this setting [^114N8dPG]. Ongoing research aims to clarify these issues [^113Vw3oH].

---

Low free testosterone with normal total testosterone in middle-aged men is **clinically meaningful** and associated with symptoms and metabolic risks; **confirm with repeat testing**, assess SHBG, and address reversible causes before considering testosterone therapy.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (ie, 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism are needed. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases) (Table 2). Marked SHBG elevations leading to misleadingly normal or even high total testosterone are relatively uncommon, whereas pseudohypogonadism in men with diabetes and/or obesity is very common.

What is the Evidence for Lifestyle Measures?

In middle-aged and older men not selected for a low serum testosterone, moderate exercise (eg, 90 minutes thrice weekly) improves sense of well-being, sarcopenia/physical function, bone mass, and cardiovascular risk factors, and might additively improve erectile function with PDE5-inhibitor treatment.

In a 2013 meta-analysis of studies of adult men with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 kg/m², a hypocaloric diet leading to a 9.8% loss of body weight was associated with an increase in mean serum total testosterone concentration of 83 ng/dL (95% CI, 48–117) (2.87 nmol/L; 95% CI, 1.68–4.07), representing increases ranging from 10% to 30% of the baseline serum testosterone. Younger age and magnitude of weight loss were associated with the increment in serum testosterone. The studies included in the meta-analysis were small (generally < 50 men), short term (< 12 months), and predominantly recruited men < 50 years of age. Furthermore, some men had normal baseline testosterone concentrations, and the overall effect was largely driven by a single study. In a 2016 RCT of a hypocaloric diet and testosterone vs placebo of obese men (baseline median age 53 years; BMI 37 kg/m²; serum total testosterone 202 ng/dL [7.0 nmol/L]), the mean weight loss of 9.1% achieved with the hypocaloric diet alone was associated with a 52 ng/dL (1.8 nmol/L) increase in total testosterone (a 20% increase from baseline). Neither weight loss nor serum total testosterone increase were maintained after supervised weight loss intervention ended. In a 12-month RCT of frail obese men ≥ 65 years with a baseline serum total testosterone concentration of 211 to 274 ng/dL [7.3–9.5 mmol/L], weight loss by diet (mean loss 10.1 kg) and diet plus exercise (mean loss 9.1 kg) increased serum testosterone concentrations by 21.0 ng/dL (0.73 nmol/L) and by 49.9 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L), respectively, without any changes in serum calculated free testosterone. The diet plus exercise group also had improved physical function. It is uncertain whether the increases in serum testosterone play a role in improved outcomes seen with weight loss. For example, some studies suggest that improved sexual function after bariatric surgery more closely correlates with the amount of weight loss than the rise of serum testosterone.

Serum Free Testosterone Assessments

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected (Table 2; Fig. 1). A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations (see below). The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (ie, pseudohypogonadism; Fig. 1) are obesity and T2D (Table 2).

Table 2.
Causes of high and low circulating SHBG

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

Endocrine Society guideline — serum total testosterone (TT) definition, binding, and clinical implications: Serum TT concentration represents the sum of unbound and protein-bound T in circulation, most T is bound to SHBG and albumin and only 2.0% to 4.0% is unbound or free; "bioavailable T" refers to unbound T plus albumin-bound T, and the free hormone hypothesis states that biologic activity depends on free hormone concentrations. Analysis of European Male Ageing Study data showed that men with low FT concentrations had sexual and physical symptoms consistent with T deficiency regardless of their TT, whereas men with low TT but normal FT were more obese and did not have associated sexual or physical symptoms.

What Additional Diagnostic Evaluation Is Necessary to Exclude Classic Organic Hypothalamic-Pituitary Pathology in a Man With Low Serum Total Testosterone and Normal Serum Gonadotropin Concentrations?

Most middle-aged and older, obese men with a low testosterone will have secondary hypogonadism with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. Men with secondary hypogonadism should be clinically assessed for Cushing syndrome and sleep apnea. Evaluation for identifiable hypothalamic and pituitary pathology should be individualized because the yield is typically low. In men ≥ 50 years old with low serum testosterone and normal gonadotropin concentrations, clinical experience suggests that the probability of classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology is inversely related to BMI, age, number of comorbidities, and testosterone concentration. In older, obese men, pseudohypogonadism due to obesity is the most common cause for the biochemical constellation of low serum total testosterone (due to low SHBG), normal serum free testosterone, and normal gonadotropins, reflecting a eugonadal state. In secondary hypogonadism due to structural or genetic hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, gonadotropins are often low or undetectable.

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and SHBG increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free T (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

Objective

Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints.

Methods

A total of 3334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) with those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

Results

A total of 2641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter), 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23), 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20), and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and LH and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

Conclusions

Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms. Normal cFT, despite low TT, is not associated with cognate symptoms; therefore, cFT levels should be assessed in men with suspected hypogonadal symptoms.

### Debate about the free testosterone hypothesis: useful tool or misguided mirage? [^117GN7s7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In this debate, two clinicians discuss the merits and demerits of the free testosterone hypothesis. Although most clinical guidelines recommend the measurement of free testosterone in the evaluation for male hypogonadism (at least in men with suspected low serum sex hormone binding globulin), there remains controversy about underlying hypothesis that serum free testosterone is a significant contributor to androgen effect. In this debate, Dr. Anawalt presents evidence to support the free testosterone hypothesis and advocates for the usefulness of accurate assessment of free testosterone in the evaluation of male hypogonadism. Dr. Handelsman argues that the evidence is unconvincing, the hypothesis is flawed and biologically invalid, and free testosterone cannot be accurately assessed in clinical practice.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### 'What should I do with a 60-year old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins'? [^112kDkJD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether or not he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex, which comprises both symptoms as well as biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma. International guidelines have been published which provide recommendations to aid the clinician in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be made once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis and diabetes. Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels then a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

Evidence base characteristics — The evidence review identified 38 randomized controlled trials; across studies, the mean age was 66 years and follow-up ranged from 6 to 36 months; in most studies, participants had a mean baseline total testosterone level of 10.4 nmol/L (300 ng/dL) or lower (20 studies), and outcomes did not vary substantially by baseline testosterone levels or testosterone formulations.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m 2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^111GBUFL]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — role of free testosterone: The Panel does not recommend using free testosterone measurements as the primary diagnostic method for testosterone deficiency, and total and free testosterone are not to be considered interchangeable measures; in an analysis of 3,219 men (mean age 58 years) with a single morning testosterone measurement, using a free testosterone level added no value when the total testosterone level was < 231 ng/dL, whereas when total testosterone was between 230–317 ng/dL, free testosterone measurement may be helpful in diagnosis, and free testosterone also has a place in the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency in highly symptomatic patients with total testosterone levels in the low/normal or equivocal range.

Age-related low testosterone — epidemiology and threshold definition: A gradual, age-associated decline in serum total testosterone levels begins in men in their mid-30s and continues at an average rate of 1.6% per year, with the incidence of low testosterone in the United States reported to be approximately 20% in men older than 60, 30% in those older than 70, and 50% in those older than 80 years; the prevalence of syndromic low testosterone is lower and is defined as at least 3 sexual symptoms with a total testosterone level < 11.1 nmol/L [320 ng/dL].

### The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment in older hypogonadal men [^11347UaQ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

As men age, their serum testosterone concentrations decrease-the total testosterone very little but the free testosterone more. Testosterone treatment of older men whose serum testosterone concentrations are unequivocally low to bring their testosterone levels to normal for young men improves their sexual function, walking, mood, bone mineral density, and hemoglobin, but does not improve their sense of vitality or cognitive function. This treatment has also been suspected of increasing the risk of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and heart disease, but these possible risks have neither been confirmed nor refuted.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: a collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^117GQs7n]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

Our results indicate that men in the lowest study-specific tenth of calculated free testosterone concentration have a 23% reduced risk of prostate cancer compared with men with higher concentrations. Above this very low concentration, prostate cancer risk did not change with increasing free testosterone concentration. We also found evidence that this association varied by tumour grade. This is the largest collection of data on hormones and prostate cancer risk available, and is the first large-scale prospective evidence supporting an association between low free testosterone concentrations and prostate cancer risk.

The observed association between low free testosterone and lower prostate cancer risk may be due to a direct biological effect. Across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations, stimulation of prostatic androgen receptors may remain relatively constant, due to stable intraprostatic DHT concentrations and/or saturation of androgen receptors. Therefore, variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not be associated with a prostate cancer risk. However, when circulating concentrations are very low, reduced androgen receptor signalling may lead to a reduction in prostate cancer risk.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^116hDa3i]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation and Management of Testosterone Deficiency — prevalence indicates that the prevalence of testosterone deficiency in the American male population is difficult to quantify; among the 40 studies (N = 37,565; age 43–82 years) that met inclusion criteria, the prevalence of low testosterone, defined as the lower normal limit of the assay used, ranged from 2–77%, and the authors noted differing thresholds and approaches: total testosterone was used in 29 studies, range 200–433 ng/dL; bioavailable testosterone was used in 9 studies, range 6.4–198.4 ng/dL; and free testosterone was used in 4 studies, range 4.6–7.0 ng/dl; across the prevalence literature, the cut-off values used to define low testosterone vary widely and heterogeneity exists in the populations studied.

### The significance of biological variation in the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency, and consideration of the relevance of total, free and bioavailable testosterone determinations [^116nFE2H]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency syndrome is based on clinical manifestations and documentation of low testosterone. Which biochemical tests to use and the importance of morning sampling are still controversial. Biological variation (including interindividual and intraindividual biological variation) must be considered when interpreting individual results as it determines the usefulness of reference intervals and the change (reference change value) necessary for a significant difference between results.

Materials and Methods

A total of 87 healthy men (50 to 70+ years old) provided blood in the morning of the first day, and 4 weeks later in the morning and afternoon. Samples were frozen (-70C) and analyzed in the same run for serum testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin, and bioavailable testosterone and free testosterone were calculated.

Results

Serum testosterone was lower in the afternoon by 1.5 nmol/l (43 ng/dl, p < 0.05), with larger changes observed with higher morning values. However, this diurnal effect was dwarfed by the normal biological variation observed for repeat morning samples (serum testosterone ± 4 nmol/l [115 ng/dl]). Between day intra-individual biological variation for morning serum testosterone was 18.7% while within day intra-individual biological variation was 12.9%. A change of 52% (reference change value) is necessary between serial morning results to confirm a significant difference. The biological variation parameters of calculated bioavailable testosterone and calculated free testosterone confer no advantage over total testosterone.

Conclusions

Marked individuality of serum testosterone is evident even in healthy men. Because intraindividual biological variation is less than interindividual biological variation, reference intervals are marginally useful. The homeostatic set point of a patient could decrease by half and still be within the reference interval. Prospective establishment of an individual's baseline over repeated measurements or symptoms regardless of serum testosterone concentration should be used to guide clinical decisions.

### Long-term testosterone administration on insulin sensitivity in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels [^115Lx2ez]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Serum testosterone levels and insulin sensitivity both decrease with age. Severe testosterone deficiency is associated with the development of insulin resistance. However, the effects of long-term testosterone administration on insulin sensitivity in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels remain unknown.

Methods

The Testosterone Effects on Atherosclerosis in Aging Men Trial was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. The participants were 308 community-dwelling men, ≥ 60 years old, with total testosterone 100 to 400 ng/dL or free testosterone < 50 pg/mL. A subset of 134 nondiabetic men (mean age, 66.7 ± 5.1 years) underwent an octreotide insulin suppression test at baseline and at 3 and 36 months after randomization to measure insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity was estimated as the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration at equilibrium during octreotide and insulin administration. Secondary outcomes included total lean mass (TLM) and total fat mass (TFM) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.

Results

There was a significant (P = 0.003) increase in SSPG in the placebo group, whereas no change was seen in testosterone-treated subjects from baseline to 36 months; however, the between-group differences in change in SSPG over 3 years were not statistically significant (+15.3 ± 6.9 mg/dL in the placebo group vs +6.2 ± 6.4 mg/dL in the testosterone group; mixed-model effect, P = 0.17). Changes in SSPG with testosterone treatment were not associated with changes in serum total or free testosterone concentrations. Changes in TFM but not TLM were associated with increases in SSPG. Stratification by age or baseline total testosterone level did not show significant intervention effects.

Conclusion

Testosterone administration for 36 months in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels did not improve insulin sensitivity.

### What we have learned from the testosterone trials [^117VdDEU]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

As men age, their serum concentration of total testosterone decreases only slightly, but because the concentration of sex hormone binding globulin increases, the concentration of free testosterone decreases to a greater degree. The testosterone trials demonstrated that testosterone treatment of elderly men who have low serum testosterone levels increases their sexual function, hemoglobin, and bone mineral density to moderate degrees, and their walking, vitality, and mood slightly. Testosterone treatment increases coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume. However, the trials were not large enough or long enough to know if testosterone treatment increases clinical heart disease or prostate disease.

How Should the Clinical Suspicion of Androgen Deficiency Be Assessed Biochemically?

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 Am) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (eg, specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing very mild hypogonadism in older men over misdiagnosing eugonadal men as hypogonadal. The benefit of testosterone therapy on vitality and bone (and likely other parameters) is related to the change from baseline serum testosterone in older men; men with lower serum baseline testosterone concentrations are more likely to benefit from normalization of serum testosterone. Therefore, borderline low serum testosterone concentrations or multiple serum testosterone measurements that are discordant (eg, one result that is slightly low and one that is normal) should be interpreted cautiously and generally not as confirmatory evidence of hypogonadism.

Serum testosterone measurement — serum testosterone (T) concentrations exhibit a diurnal variation with peak values in the morning, aging reduces the magnitude of this rhythm, glucose and food intake suppress T concentrations, and therefore clinicians should measure T concentrations in the morning after an overnight fast; notably, a substantial fraction of 65- to 80-year-old men with low afternoon T concentrations will have normal morning values.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency a in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

### Associations of serum testosterone and SHBG with incident fractures in middle-aged to older men [^113Wbnwe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures increase with age as bone mass decreases, bone microarchitecture deteriorates, and the propensity to fall increases. Although osteoporotic fractures are more common in women than in men, as many as 1 in 4 men sustain an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. Men have higher mortality than women following a fracture, thus it is of concern that men at high risk of fractures are often untreated.

As men age, their circulating testosterone (T) decreases, circulating SHBG increases, and risk of fracture increases. However, it is unclear if circulating T per se, independently of comorbidities, contributes to the increased fracture incidence in older men. Prospective observational studies examining the associations between circulating T and incident fractures have yielded inconsistent results. These studies have included up to 4324 men with up to 342 incident fracture cases and have reported inconsistent associations of circulating T and incident fracture risk. This inconsistency may be due to the fact that the study populations may differ concerning the prevalence of hypogonadism, risk of falls, and muscle mass of the individuals, factors that could impact the association between T and fracture risk. In contrast, most previous prospective observational studies demonstrate that high circulating SHBG and low circulating calculated free T (cFT), calculated using total T and SHBG, are associated with increased fracture risk in men.

### The decline of androgen levels in elderly men and its clinical and therapeutic implications [^116hwrmC]. Endocrine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Aging in men is accompanied by a progressive, but individually variable decline of serum testosterone production, more than 20% of healthy men over 60 yr of age presenting with serum levels below the range for young men. Albeit the clinical picture of aging in men is reminiscent of that of hypogonadism in young men and decreased testosterone production appears to play a role in part of these clinical changes in at least some elderly men, the clinical relevancy of the age-related decline in sex steroid levels in men has not been unequivocally established. In fact, minimal androgen requirements for elderly men remain poorly defined and are likely to vary between individuals. Consequently, borderline androgen deficiency cannot be reliably diagnosed in the elderly, and strict differentiation between "substitutive" and "pharmacological" androgen administration is not possible. To date, only a few hundred elderly men have received androgen therapy in the setting of a randomized, controlled study, and many of these men were not androgen deficient. Most consistent effects of treatment have been on body composition, but to date there is no evidence-based documentation of clinical benefits of androgen administration to elderly men with normal or moderately low serum testosterone in terms of diminished morbidity or of improved survival or quality of life. Until the long-term risk-benefit ratio for androgen administration to elderly is established in adequately powered trials of longer duration, androgen administration to elderly men should be reserved for the minority of elderly men who have both clear clinical symptoms of hypogonadism and frankly low serum testosterone levels.

### Don't prescribe testosterone therapy unless there is… [^1146Egtj]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Many of the symptoms attributed to male hypogonadism are commonly seen in normal male aging or in the presence of comorbid conditions. Testosterone therapy has the potential for serious side effects and represents a significant expense. It is therefore important to confirm the clinical suspicion of hypogonadism with biochemical testing. Current guidelines recommend the use of a total testosterone level obtained in the morning. A low level should be confirmed on a different day, again measuring the total testosterone. In some situations, a free or bioavailable testosterone may be of additional value.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis, testing, and initial treatment for male hypogonadism states that we recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test, and we recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone–binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula, and in men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism.

### Association of free testosterone with hypogonadal symptoms in men with near-normal total testosterone levels [^115atxss]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between hypogonadal symptoms and free testosterone (FT) levels in men with near-normal total testosterone (T) levels (250–350 ng/dL) and to determine whether a discriminatory threshold for FT exists below which hypogonadal symptoms become more prevalent.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of 3167 men who presented to an outpatient men's health clinic. Two hundred thirty-one men had symptoms of "low testosterone" and serum testosterone levels between 250 and 350 ng/dL. We evaluated hypogonadal symptoms using the Androgen Deficiency in the Adult Male (ADAM) and quantitative ADAM (qADAM) questionnaires. Serum levels of T and sex hormone-binding globulin were collected on the same day that men completed their questionnaires. We used linear regression to determine whether a threshold of FT exists for hypogonadal symptoms. We performed univariate and multivariable analyses to evaluate factors that predicted a low FT level.

Results

The median age was 43.5 years, and the median testosterone and FT levels were 303 ng/dL and 6.3 ng/dL, respectively. Prevalence and severity of hypogonadal symptoms (ADAM and qADAM) were similar between men with low (< 6.4 ng/mL) and normal FT levels. There was an association between age and 3 of the 10 hypogonadal symptoms (decreased enjoyment in life, sadness, and deterioration of work performance) with a low FT on a univariate analysis. Only younger age was positively associated with FT on multivariable analysis.

Conclusion

We did not observe a relationship between hypogonadal symptoms and FT in men with near-normal testosterone levels. Symptom-specific FT thresholds could not be defined, as age remains an important confounder.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: a collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^111rtRHy]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental and clinical evidence implicates testosterone in the aetiology of prostate cancer. Variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not lead to changes in prostate biology, unless circulating concentrations are low. This may also apply to prostate cancer risk, but this has not been investigated in an epidemiological setting.

Objective

To examine whether men with low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

Design, setting, and participants

Analysis of individual participant data from 20 prospective studies including 6933 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed on average 6.8 yr after blood collection, and 12 088 controls in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis

Odds ratios (ORs) of incident overall prostate cancer and subtypes by stage and grade, using conditional logistic regression, based on study-specific tenths of calculated free testosterone concentration.

Results and limitations

Men in the lowest tenth of free testosterone concentration had a lower risk of overall prostate cancer (OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.86; p < 0.001) compared with men with higher concentrations (2nd–10th tenths of the distribution). Heterogeneity was present by tumour grade (p het = 0.01), with a lower risk of low-grade disease (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.88) and a nonsignificantly higher risk of high-grade disease (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.95–2.57). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by tumour stage. The observational design is a limitation.

Conclusions

Men with low circulating free testosterone may have a lower risk of overall prostate cancer; this may be due to a direct biological effect, or detection bias. Further research is needed to explore the apparent differential association by tumour grade.

Patient summary

In this study, we looked at circulating testosterone levels and risk of developing prostate cancer, finding that men with low testosterone had a lower risk of prostate cancer.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise. He had lost a total of 6.3 kg (∼6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L), and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

### Andropause or male menopause? Rationale for testosterone replacement therapy in older men with low testosterone levels [^112PNaFU]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide rationale for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older men with low testosterone levels and symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency.

Methods

The relevant literature was reviewed using PubMed.

Results

Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies indicate that total and free testosterone levels fall with aging, and they may be accompanied by symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency. Testosterone treatment of younger men with very low testosterone levels and hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular disease is associated with improvements in symptoms, body composition, bone density, and hematocrit/hemoglobin. Studies evaluating testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels are limited, but they suggest some increase in fat free mass, some decrease in fat mass, and some increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.

Conclusion

The Testosterone Trial should provide definitive information regarding the potential benefits of TRT in men ≥ 65 years of age. If efficacy is confirmed, we will still need more information regarding the risks of TRT in older men.

### Hypogonadism and androgen replacement therapy in elderly men [^113r6Dfe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The decrease in testosterone levels with age is both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testicular) origin. Because serum levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin increase with aging, the decrease in free testosterone is of even greater magnitude. Recent long-term studies of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal elderly men have shown beneficial effects on bone density, body composition, and muscle strength without any substantial adverse effects on lipids and the prostate. Total testosterone level is the test of choice for initial screening of elderly men who present with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. If the level is below 300 ng/dL, replacement therapy should be initiated. If the level is normal in a symptomatic patient, free or bioavailable testosterone should be determined. The pros and cons of testosterone therapy should be discussed in depth with every patient, and decisions should be made on an individual basis. This review summarizes the trials of testosterone replacement therapy in elderly men and outlines a diagnostic approach to these patients.

In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

### Hormone levels in middle-aged and elderly men with and without erectile dysfunction in Taiwan [^113QZgWM]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

The change in sexual hormones with age in middle-aged and elderly Chinese men, with and without erectile dysfunction (ED), was investigated. Total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were determined from fasting serum samples by radioimmunoassay in 627 middle-aged and elderly ethnic Chinese men with and without ED. Calculated FT was derived from TT and SHBG. Patients with ED were subdivided into groups having low serum TT (< 2.7 ng/ml) and normal TT (≥ 2.7 ng/ml). FT and DHEAS declined and SHBG rose with age in both normal patients and in patients with ED. TT and SHBG were lower in patients with ED than in normal subjects at all ages. In contrast to findings in previous studies, levels of FT were higher in patients with ED than in normal subjects. Hormonal changes in this Chinese population generally mirrored those in previously studied ethnic populations, except for higher FT in patients with ED. This suggests that hormonal levels in patients with ED may vary in different populations. The significance and reproducibility of this finding remains to be determined.

### Effects of testosterone administration for 3 years on subclinical atherosclerosis progression in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels: a randomized clinical trial [^111J1i5i]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Testosterone use in older men is increasing, but its long-term effects on progression of atherosclerosis are unknown.

Objective

To determine the effect of testosterone administration on subclinical atherosclerosis progression in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Testosterone's Effects on Atherosclerosis Progression in Aging Men (TEAAM) was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group randomized trial involving 308 men 60 years or older with low or low-normal testosterone levels (100–400 ng/dL; free testosterone < 50 pg/mL), recruited at 3 US centers. Recruitment took place between September 2004 and February 2009; the last participant completed the study in May 2012.

Interventions

One hundred fifty-six participants were randomized to receive 7.5 g of 1% testosterone and 152 were randomized to receive placebo gel packets daily for 3 years. The dose was adjusted to achieve testosterone levels between 500 and 900 ng/dL.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coprimary outcomes included common carotid artery intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcium; secondary outcomes included sexual function and health-related quality of life.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between groups: patients were a mean age of 67.6 years; 42% had hypertension; 15%, diabetes; 15%, cardiovascular disease; and 27%, obesity. The rate of change in intima-media thickness was 0.010 mm/year in the placebo group and 0.012 mm/year in the testosterone group (mean difference adjusted for age and trial site, 0.0002 mm/year; 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.003, P = 0.89). The rate of change in the coronary artery calcium score was 41.4 Agatston units/year in the placebo group and 31.4 Agatston units/year in the testosterone group (adjusted mean difference, -10.8 Agatston units/year; 95% CI, -45.7 to 24.2; P = 0.54). Changes in intima-media thickness or calcium scores were not associated with change in testosterone levels among individuals assigned to receive testosterone. Sexual desire, erectile function, overall sexual function scores, partner intimacy, and health-related quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. Hematocrit and prostate-specific antigen levels increased more in testosterone group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels, testosterone administration for 3 years vs placebo did not result in a significant difference in the rates of change in either common carotid artery intima-media thickness or coronary artery calcium nor did it improve overall sexual function or health-related quality of life. Because this trial was only powered to evaluate atherosclerosis progression, these findings should not be interpreted as establishing cardiovascular safety of testosterone use in older men.

### Approach to the patient: low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^114kbPD3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Free Testosterone

Free testosterone, whether measured or calculated using equilibrium binding or empirical equations, is advocated by some experts to appraise androgen status in certain circumstances. However, such recommendations are based on observational data and received wisdom rather than objective evidence from controlled clinical testing and therefore in our opinion add nothing useful to the clinical evaluation. The free testosterone hypothesis, which asserts that free testosterone is the most biologically active moiety of testosterone, is conceptually flawed in that unbound testosterone is equally accessible to sites of degradation as it is to target tissues, so there is no logical basis to claim it is more (rather than less) biologically active. In addition, reference laboratory dialysis-based measurements of free testosterone are nonrobust, costly, and rarely available. Most laboratories report calculations based on formulae incorporating serum testosterone and SHBG measurements. However, such calculations are consistently inaccurate relative to dialysis-based measurements due to assumptions such as using SHBG mass as a substitute for SHBG binding capacity, the use of 4 different nonharmonized SHBG immunoassays, and the use of 5 different empirical estimates of testosterone-SHBG binding affinity. Furthermore, free testosterone is not a valid analytical variable, as it lacks a certified reference standard, violating a fundamental principle of analytical chemistry requiring comparison of like with like. As a result, free testosterone lacks sufficient quality controls required to form reference ranges or compare results from 1 center/laboratory to another.

Values and preferences — older men with age-related low testosterone concentrations: The recommendation not to treat asymptomatic older men with age-related declines in testosterone concentration places a higher value on avoiding unknown long-term risks and a lower value on the limited evidence of potential benefits. Clinicians should recognize considerable expert disagreement due to incomplete evidence; nonspecific age-related symptoms and low testosterone often coexist without a clear causal link; although evidence suggests benefits for sexual function, anemia, vertebral and femoral bone mineral density, and possibly walking distance, the risks remain unknown, and long-term efficacy for patient-important outcomes (disability, falls, fractures, low-grade progressive depressive disorder, and progression to diabetes or dementia) is not known.

### Declining testicular function in aging men [^114Sw16y]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Age-related decline in male sex hormones, particularly testosterone, is referred to as andropause. Like menopause, andropause is associated with physical and emotional changes that may be alleviated by hormone replacement therapy. Hypogonadism in aging men, as defined by a low free testosterone index, is due to declining testosterone production and increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels. About 30% of men in their 60s and more than 80% of men over 80 y may have a low free testosterone index. Diagnosis of hypogonadism is based on clinical symptoms (eg, decreased muscle mass, fractures, loss of libido) and laboratory determinations of serum testosterone-usually total testosterone levels. Measuring bioavailable testosterone, or free testosterone, is expensive and time-consuming, but may more accurately detect hypogonadism. Testosterone replacement therapy is generally safe in aging men and may improve libido, cognition, bone mineral density, body mass composition, and serum lipoproteins. Although contraindicated in men with prostate or breast cancer, testosterone replacement therapy in aging men warrants examination. Any of the available testosterone formulations can be used, but injectable forms have certain advantages, including excellent dose adjustability, lack of skin irritation, and low cost.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

A systematic approach to diagnose hypogonadism initially establishes the presence of symptoms/signs of testosterone deficiency, considers other potential causes of manifestations, and excludes conditions that transiently suppress testosterone. Hypogonadism is confirmed by measuring fasting serum total testosterone in the morning on at least 2 separate days, or free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone in men with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin or serum total testosterone near lower limit of normal. To guide management, further evaluation is performed to identify the specific cause of hypogonadism and whether it is potentially reversible or an irreversible pathologic disorder.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — obesity and anthropometric risk factors for low testosterone: Men who are obese (BMI ≥ 30) or who have increased waist circumference (> 40 inches) should have their testosterone levels checked, and obese men are almost five times more likely to have low testosterone than men who are not obese (OR = 4.89; CI: 2.35, 10.17). In unadjusted baseline measurements of 1,687 middle-aged men classified as normal weight, overweight, or obese, nearly a third of overweight/obese subjects had low total testosterone (< 300 ng/dL) compared to 6.4% of men of normal weight. In younger men aged 19–24 years with erectile dysfunction (ED), the prevalence of low testosterone differed significantly between BMI < 27 and BMI > 27 groups (p < 0.001). A study in 225 men found a 2.0 fold increase in the odds of low testosterone for every 5-point increase in BMI.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Testosterone and ill-health in aging men [^115DMt7g]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Medium credibility.

As men age, testosterone levels decline, and decreased testosterone levels are associated with increased risks of osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and mortality. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether reduced testosterone level is a cause of ill-health or a marker of pre-existing disease, as systemic illness lowers testosterone levels. Most circulating testosterone is bound to sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin, whereas a small proportion circulates as free testosterone. Decreased SHBG level is associated with increased risks for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, although it would also be expected to be associated with increased free testosterone level. During male aging, total and free testosterone levels fall while SHBG level rises. Thus, associations between decreasing androgens and negative health outcomes might differ across men of various ages. Trials of testosterone therapy report benefits for body composition and BMD, but there are limited data on the effect of testosterone supplementation on cardiovascular risk. Whereas men who have androgen deficiency should be considered for testosterone therapy, the role of testosterone supplementation in older men who are not clearly hypogonadal requires further clarification. Further studies are also needed to establish whether the age-related decline in circulating testosterone level in men can be modified or prevented.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^112VkCBb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

Methods

A narrative review.

Results

Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥ 2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy. Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea. Testosterone replacement therapy should be accompanied by a standardized monitoring plan.

Conclusion

A shared decision of the patient and physician to treat should be guided by the consideration of the burden of symptoms, potential benefits and risks, patient's values, and the cost and burden of long-term treatment and monitoring.

### Approach to the patient: low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^111tuHFS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In most men with obesity, measured serum testosterone will be only modestly reduced, but very low concentrations can occur particularly in men with extreme obesity (eg, BMI > 40 kg/m²). In such cases, the presence of a low serum testosterone, with proportionately low serum SHBG and normal-range serum LH and FSH (typical features of the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity) in conjunction with a normal testicular examination is reassuring. These findings suggest that the hormonal aberrations are likely reversible due to obesity and will improve with significant weight loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary and measurement of other anterior pituitary hormones is only required if specific additional clinical signs are present (ie, headache, galactorrhea, bitemporal hemianopia), if serum LH and FSH are very low or undetectable, or when serum testosterone concentration does not increase following clinically significant weight loss. Key features distinguishing cases of pathological hypogonadism from the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2.
Distinguishing factors between pathological hypogonadism and the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity

Treatment Recommendations

Testosterone is not indicated for treatment of reduced serum testosterone concentrations in men with overweight and obesity, except where there is also pathological hypogonadism, which should be excluded by history, physical examination, and relevant laboratory testing. In simple obesity, weight loss is critical to restoring health, with meta-analyses on the effect of diet, exercise, and bariatric surgery showing marked increases in serum testosterone concentrations proportionate to the degree of weight loss achieved (Fig. 1).

### Identification of late-onset hypogonadism in middle-aged and elderly men [^1132uPEZ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

The association between aging-related testosterone deficiency and late-onset hypogonadism in men remains a controversial concept. We sought evidence-based criteria for identifying late-onset hypogonadism in the general population on the basis of an association between symptoms and a low testosterone level.

Methods

We surveyed a random population sample of 3369 men between the ages of 40 and 79 years at eight European centers. Using questionnaires, we collected data with regard to the subjects' general, sexual, physical, and psychological health. Levels of total testosterone were measured in morning blood samples by mass spectrometry, and free testosterone levels were calculated with the use of Vermeulen's formula. Data were randomly split into separate training and validation sets for confirmatory analyses.

Results

In the training set, symptoms of poor morning erection, low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, inability to perform vigorous activity, depression, and fatigue were significantly related to the testosterone level. Increased probabilities of the three sexual symptoms and limited physical vigor were discernible with decreased testosterone levels (ranges, 8.0 to 13.0 nmol per liter [2.3 to 3.7 ng per milliliter] for total testosterone and 160 to 280 pmol per liter [46 to 81 pg per milliliter] for free testosterone). However, only the three sexual symptoms had a syndromic association with decreased testosterone levels. An inverse relationship between an increasing number of sexual symptoms and a decreasing testosterone level was observed. These relationships were independently confirmed in the validation set, in which the strengths of the association between symptoms and low testosterone levels determined the minimum criteria necessary to identify late-onset hypogonadism.

Conclusions

Late-onset hypogonadism can be defined by the presence of at least three sexual symptoms associated with a total testosterone level of less than 11 nmol per liter (3.2 ng per milliliter) and a free testosterone level of less than 220 pmol per liter (64 pg per milliliter).

### Endogenous testosterone and cardiovascular disease in healthy men: a meta-analysis [^114uJxmi]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The literature provides no clear answer as to whether low endogenous testosterone increases risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in healthy men.

Objective

Our purpose was to estimate the predictive value of testosterone for CVD and to identify study features explaining conflicting results.

Data Sources

Articles were identified by a Medline and Embase search and citation tracking.

Study Selection

Eligible were prospective population-based cohort and nested case-control studies of testosterone and atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, death from coronary heart disease or mortality.

Data Extraction

Two independent researchers re-expressed associations of testosterone and CVD in a uniform manner to be used in meta-regression analyses for identification of study features explaining conflicting results, and to estimate the predictive value of testosterone for CVD.

Results and Conclusions

19 potentially eligible articles were identified. Overall, a weak independent association was found with an estimated summary RR of 0.89 for a change of one standard deviation in total testosterone level (95% CI 0.83 to 0.96). Age of study population and year of publication modified the relationship between testosterone and CVD. The estimated summary RR was 1.01 (0.95 to 1.08) for studies of men younger than 70 years of age, and 0.84 (0.76 to 0.92) for studies including men over 70 years of age. The latter studies showed a particular pronounced association if published after 1 January 2007. Results were largely confirmed by separate analyses of free- and bioavailable testosterone. The systematic review displayed no association between endogenous testosterone and risk for CVD in middle-aged men. In elderly men, testosterone may weakly protect against CVD. Alternatively, low testosterone may indicate a poor general health.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113Vw3oH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular health

Effects of testosterone treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown because there are no published long-term, placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone therapy and cardiovascular outcomes as a primary outcome. The first such study, TRAVERSE (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03518034) has completed enrollment (n > 5200 men), and the findings of this study with ∼5-year follow-up are expected to be released in 2023; the study was fully recruited and was not ended early for prespecified cardiovascular outcomes; see(accessed January 2023). In some observational studies, higher endogenous serum testosterone concentrations have been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events, but higher endogenous serum testosterone might be a marker of better overall health and fewer major comorbidities. Retrospective studies of testosterone treatment have suggested either reduced risks of cardiovascular events, neutral effects, or increased risks; such retrospective studies have significant methodologic shortcomings, including confounding by indication (ie, preferential treatment of healthier men) and time-related biases. Clinical trials of testosterone treatment have been mixed with 1 study in older men with mobility limitations reporting an increased risk of cardiovascular events while there was no increase in a similar trial in frail older men. A total of 17 RCTs shared their individual patient data (n = 3431) to the Testosterone Efficacy and Safety Consortium (TestES) to report mortality and cardiovascular endpoints. Eighteen deaths (6 in testosterone- and 12 in placebo-treated men), and 230 cardiovascular events (120, testosterone; 110, placebo) were reported, without any significant differences between treatment groups. However, this analysis is limited by the short duration of constituent studies (mean 9.5 months) and exclusion of patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease by some studies. Although there was no increase of cardiovascular events in the T-Trials, a T-trial substudy reported, compared to placebo, a greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume with testosterone treatment. However, groups were unbalanced for baseline plaque volumes, and the prognostic importance of the observed change in plaque volume is unclear. Moreover, in a 3-year RCT of men aged 60 years or older with baseline serum testosterone concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 ng/dL (3.5–13.9 nmol/L), testosterone treatment did not affect the change from baseline in coronary artery calcium score or common carotid artery intima-media thickness. Of note, most recent larger clinical trials have excluded men at high risk of cardiovascular events. Whether testosterone treatment increases venous thromboembolic risk remains unresolved. The United States Food and Drug Administration requires a testosterone products label warning of increased risk of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and venous thromboembolic events as a possible consequence of testosterone therapy. The 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend against testosterone therapy in men with uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke within the last 6 months, or with thrombophilia.

Figure 1.
Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years. 1 Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1). 2 Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. 3 Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 Am. 4 Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method. 5 Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also indicated if there are symptoms of a sellar mass, serum LH is undetectable, or serum total testosterone is < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). 6 This includes optimization of management of chronic disease, stopping medications that can suppress the HPT axis if possible (eg, opioids, glucocorticoids), evaluation and treatment of depression and sleep apnea. 7 Consider karyotype for assessment for Klinefelter syndrome; offer testosterone treatment if there is no contraindication (including desire to conceive in the next 1–2 years). 8 The decision to offer testosterone therapy should take into consideration the likelihood of benefit and the potential risk. The benefits are highest in men with lower testosterone concentrations and men with concordantly low total and free testosterone concentrations. A trial of testosterone therapy may be offered if the following conditions are met: 1) there are no contraindications; 2) there has been a discussion regarding potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy and the uncertainties regarding long-term health outcomes; 3) patient-specific goals have been set; and 4) there is agreement that testosterone treatment will be stopped if these goals are not achieved. See text in manuscript. 9 Reassessment of men with high BMI consists of assessment for symptoms and signs of hypogonadism and re-measurement of testosterone. If there are symptoms of hypogonadism and low serum testosterone after 6–12 months of lifestyle changes, then testosterone therapy may be considered. Medical therapy to achieve weight loss and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for men whose BMI remains > 30 kg/m² after 6 months of lifestyle changes. Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FT, free testosterone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.

### Absent diurnal variation in serum testosterone in young men with testosterone deficiency [^1112VEJi]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although healthy young men demonstrate a diurnal pattern of serum testosterone, minimal information is available on diurnal variation in young men with testosterone deficiency.

Materials and Methods

Blood samples were obtained during a 24-hour period at 8 and 11 a.m., 2, 5 and 8 p.m., and 8 a.m. the following morning. Men were categorized with normal or low testosterone if serum testosterone was greater than 300 ng/dl or less than 300 ng/dl at 8 a.m., respectively.

Results

We studied 21 volunteers with a mean age of 31.7 years (range 18 to 49). Testosterone was normal in 11 men and low in 10 and all had a normal luteinizing hormone concentration. The low testosterone group was older (mean age 33.4 vs 30.1 years) with a higher body mass index (mean 32.6 vs 27.5 kg/m²) but the differences were not significant. The highest and lowest overall mean testosterone concentrations were observed at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., respectively. Mean testosterone levels in the normal group declined between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. from 423 to 358 ng/dl, representing a 15% decrease (p = 0.0003). Mean testosterone in the low testosterone group was 228 ng/dl at 8 a.m. and 218 ng/dl at 2 p.m., representing a 4% decline (p = 0.54). Calculated free testosterone paralleled total testosterone with a 14% decrease in the normal testosterone group (p < 0.001) and a 5% decrease in the low testosterone group (p = 0.52). Two of 11 men in the normal group showed no diurnal variation. No subject with baseline testosterone greater than 400 ng/dl had testosterone less than 300 ng/dl at any time point.

Conclusions

Men with low testosterone failed to show diurnal variation on 24-hour blood sampling. We speculate that similar central mechanisms may be involved in the pathophysiology leading to secondary testosterone deficiency as well as the loss of circadian rhythms.

What Additional Diagnostic Evaluation Would Be Helpful in an Older Man With a Low Serum Testosterone Concentration That Has Been Appropriately Confirmed?

We have now confirmed that this patient has low serum testosterone concentrations. Does he have nongonadal illness or hypogonadism? The first step is the determination of serum gonadotropin concentrations. Elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations would be consistent with primary hypogonadism. Primary hypogonadism increases to 2% to 7% prevalence in men over age 70; age over 70 is associated with a progressive decline of serum testosterone concentration and a rise of serum LH concentration (to > 15 IU/L) in many men. If this man has elevated FSH and LH concentrations, then he is hypogonadal. If he has low or normal serum gonadotropin concentrations, then he should be evaluated for causes of hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction. To minimize phlebotomies and expedite the evaluation, we recommend ordering early morning, fasting serum total testosterone, SHBG, and gonadotropins at the first clinic visit.

Using serum gonadotropins as a pivot in the evaluation of possible hypogonadism is very useful. Although many causes of hypogonadism may affect the central (hypothalamus and/or pituitary) and peripheral (testes) components of the HPT axis, the serum gonadotropins indicate the site of the principal dysfunction. Primary hypogonadism defined by low testosterone concentrations and elevated gonadotropins is generally irreversible in older men, whereas many causes of secondary hypogonadism might be reversible. Thus, affirmation of elevated serum gonadotropins (FSH > LH) clinches the diagnosis of primary hypogonadism in a man with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of hypogonadism and a low serum testosterone concentration.

Although classic pathologic causes of hypogonadism have been described as organic and potentially reversible, nonclassic causes of hypogonadism such as obesity have been described as functional; we recommend classifying hypogonadism as primary or secondary and potentially reversible or irreversible. Klinefelter syndrome is an example of irreversible primary hypogonadism. Very high BMI (usually ≥ 40 kg/m 2) (for review see), severe systemic disease, endogenous Cushing syndrome, endogenous hyperprolactinemia, and treatment with corticosteroids, opioids, and anti-dopaminergic medications are common causes of potentially reversible secondary (or combined secondary and primary) hypogonadism. This typology of potentially reversible or irreversible primary and secondary hypogonadism is informative and clearer and more useful than organic and functional.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116p4z6a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Prostate health

Testosterone therapy increases serum prostate specific antigen concentrations in hypogonadal men to that of age-matched controls. Although there is no evidence that testosterone treatment increases the risk of de novo prostate cancer, clinical trials have not had enough participants or long enough follow-up to be conclusive. Testosterone stimulates metastatic and high-grade prostate cancer, but it is not known whether testosterone treatment stimulates the growth of pre-existing subclinical lower grade prostate cancer. Testosterone treatment has not been shown to have a significant effect on lower urinary tract symptoms; however, clinical trials have generally excluded men with severe benign prostatic hypertrophy. Testosterone should generally not be prescribed for men with prostate cancer (with possible exceptions in carefully selected men such as those with a history of treated low-risk, Gleason < 3 + 4 prostate cancer, undetectable PSA and no clinical evidence of disease after treatment) or to men at higher risk of prostate cancer (unevaluated prostate nodule, PSA > 4 ng/mL), and follow-up of prostate health during testosterone treatment should be individualized. Individualized prostate cancer screening should be offered with a nuanced discussion of the potential benefits (possible early detection of prostate cancer that might improve mortality and decrease the risk of metastatic disease) and the potential harm of increased prostate biopsies and prostate cancer therapies that may cause erectile dysfunction and incontinence and might not always improve long-term, health-related quality of life.

### Testosterone concentration in young patients with diabetes [^112Tc339]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — We have previously shown that hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is common in middle-aged patients with type 2, but not with type 1, diabetes. We have now investigated the total and free testosterone concentrations in young (aged 18–35 years) type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In this study carried out in a tertiary referral center, serum concentrations of total and free testosterone were measured in 38 type 1 diabetic (mean age 26.45 ± 0.89 years) and 24 type 2 diabetic (mean age 27.87 ± 0.97 years) subjects. The mean BMI of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 27.41 ± 1.18 and 38.55 ± 2.04 kg/m², respectively (P < 0.001).

RESULTS — The mean total testosterone concentration of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 22.89 ± 1.23 and 11.14 ± 0.99 nmol/l, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean free testosterone concentration of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 0.489 ± 0.030 and 0.296 ± 0.022 nmol/l, respectively (P < 0.001). Eight of 24 (33%) type 2 diabetic patients had subnormal free testosterone concentrations (< 0.225 nmol/l). Using an age-based reference range, 14 of 24 (58%) type 2 diabetic patients had low free testosterone concentrations (< 0.278 nmol/l). Three of 38 (8%) type 1 diabetic patients had free testosterone concentrations below the lower limit of normal (P = 0.02 when compared with type 2 diabetes). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in type 2 diabetic patients with low free testosterone concentrations were in the normal range and were similar to those in type 1 diabetic patients.

CONCLUSIONS — Young type 2 diabetic patients have significantly lower plasma concentrations of total and free testosterone and inappropriately low LH and FSH concentrations with a very high prevalence of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, when compared with type 1 diabetic patients of a comparable age. The potential implications for their sexual and reproductive function during prime reproductive years are profound.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171UtFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Testosterone assessment and related remarks — age effects, binding, and testing considerations: Testosterone levels demonstrate an age-related decline, with healthy men reaching the highest serum T levels around the age of 30 years and thereafter showing a gradual decline at a rate of 1–2% annually, and the level below which symptoms occur has not been clearly established; about 2% of circulating T is free, 44% is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 54% is bound to albumin and other proteins. For borderline low T values, two measurements performed with the same assay are preferred. When assessing fertility is required, clinicians should perform semen analysis before starting T replacement, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces circulating gonadotropins with reductions of up to 60% for FSH and 50% for LH.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114tZLyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In the population-based European Male Ageing Study, the prevalence of the syndromic association of symptoms of hypogonadism plus low serum testosterone without an identifiable classic HPT axis pathology was determined in men aged 40 to 79 years. Symptoms of hypogonadism were defined as a constellation of low libido, decreased sexual function, and a low serum testosterone. The overall prevalence of this syndrome of androgen-deficiency-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone was 2.1%, and it increased from 0.6% in men 50 to 59 years of age to 5.1% in men 70 to 79 years. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) was associated with a 13-fold increased prevalence compared with normal weight. Likewise, the presence of ≥ 2 comorbidities was associated with a 9-fold increase in the prevalent syndrome of hypogonadism-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone. In the longitudinal follow-up, weight loss was associated with resolution of this syndrome in a significant percentage of the men.

The management of older men with low serum testosterone concentrations is hampered by the fact that many clinical features of androgen deficiency are nonspecific and similar to those associated with obesity or comorbid disease, conditions that are associated with low serum testosterone concentrations. In such men, the conundrum lies in determining the degree to which the (often nonspecific) clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hypogonadism or instead due to obesity and other chronic systemic disorders that suppress the HPT axis (ie, reverse causality). Of note, this assessment is probabilistic rather than deterministic. In many men, this assessment can only be validated during management, by monitoring the response to lifestyle measures, optimization of comorbidities, and in selected cases, a trial of testosterone treatment. However, a trial of testosterone therapy should only be considered when an older man has persistent symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations after a minimum of 6–12 months of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT, including vigorous lifestyle changes for overweight men. It is particularly important to use a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay (if at all possible) when considering a trial of testosterone therapy.

### Does calculated free testosterone overcome total testosterone in protecting from sexual symptom impairment? Findings of a cross-sectional study [^112fC7rm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although erectile dysfunction (ED) has been associated with low circulating total testosterone (TT) levels, the utility of free testosterone (FT) over TT is debatable.

Aim

To assess the relative impact of low TT and low calculated FT (cFT) on androgen-related sexual symptoms in men with ED.

Methods

Data from 485 men were analyzed. Comorbidities were scored with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Beck Inventory for Depression (BDI). Descriptive statistics tested differences between patients with normal TT levels (> 3 ng/mL) and normal cFT levels (> 65 pg/mL; group 1) and men with normal TT and low cFT (group 2), low TT and normal cFT (group 3), and low TT and low cFT (group 4). Linear regression models tested the association between clinical predictors and sexual function impairment.

Outcomes

We assessed the impact of different hormonal categories on androgen-related symptoms and the clinical utility of measuring cFT in men with ED.

Results

Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were composed of 338 (69.6%), 44 (9.1%), 34 (7.0%), and 69 (14.3%) patients, respectively. Compared with group 1, patients in group 2 were older (P < .001), had a higher body mass index (P < .01), and had a larger proportion with CCI scores of at least 1 (P = 0.006). Likewise, group 2 presented lower scores for the IIEF erectile function (P = 0.07), sexual desire (P = 0.04), and orgasmic function (P = 0.007) domains and lower BDI scores (P = 0.02) than group 1. Similar findings were found for group 4 vs 1. Conversely, patients in group 3 had similar scores on the questionnaires to those in group 1. Low cFT and normal or low TT achieved independent predictor status for pathologic IIEF domains and BDI scores after accounting for age, CCI, and body mass index. Conversely, low TT and normal cFT status was not associated with pathologic scores on the questionnaires.

Clinical Implications

The inclusion of cFT in the first-line assessment of hypogonadal symptoms in men with ED has major clinical utility.

Strengths and Limitations

This is the first study evaluating the concomitant impact of TT and cFT on men with ED using well-validated instruments to assess patients' sexuality and depressive symptoms. Limitations are the retrospective nature of the study and lack of physical function data and bone ultrasound measurements.

Conclusions

Although normal cFT was not associated with signs and symptoms suggestive of testosterone deficiency, even when concomitant with low TT or low cFT irrespective of TT values, it was indicative of poorer clinical profiles and impaired sexual and depressive parameters compared with normal TT and normal cFT in a cohort of patients with ED.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BAEvt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Thus, in addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30% that might normalize testosterone concentrations in our patient and might improve many of his symptoms that overlap with hypogonadism. However, the data stem mostly from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions, and these studies had small numbers of participants that were typically younger (30–50 years of age), relatively short follow-up (< 1–2 years), and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations. Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The degree to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for the improvement seen with androgen deficiency-like features (eg, erectile function, physical performance) is not certain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment improves the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study, but preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes (increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet) to reduce weight.

### Androgens and diabetes in men: results from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES III) [^113gXMH4]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Low levels of androgens in men may play a role in the development of diabetes; however, few studies have examined the association between androgen concentration and diabetes in men in the general population. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that low normal levels of total, free, and bioavailable testosterone are associated with prevalent diabetes in men.

Research Design and Methods

The study sample included 1,413 adult men aged ≥ 20 years who participated in the morning session of the first phase of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the U.S. Bioavailable and free testosterone levels were calculated from serum total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin concentrations.

Results

In multivariable models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and adiposity, men in the first tertile (lowest) of free testosterone level were four times more likely to have prevalent diabetes compared with men in the third tertile (odds ratio 4.12 [95% CI 1.25–13.55]). Similarly, men in the first tertile of bioavailable testosterone also were approximately four times as likely to have prevalent diabetes compared with men in the third tertile (3.93 [1.39–11.13]). These associations persisted even after excluding men with clinically abnormal testosterone concentrations defined as total testosterone < 3.25 ng/ml or free testosterone < 0.07 ng/ml. No clear association was observed for total testosterone after multivariable adjustment (P for trend across tertiles = 0.27).

Conclusions

Low free and bioavailable testosterone concentrations in the normal range were associated with diabetes, independent of adiposity. These data suggest that low androgen levels may be a risk factor for diabetes in men.

### Testosterone concentration in young patients with diabetes [^116zH4UL]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We have previously shown that hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is common in middle-aged patients with type 2, but not with type 1, diabetes. We have now investigated the total and free testosterone concentrations in young (aged 18–35 years) type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

In this study carried out in a tertiary referral center, serum concentrations of total and free testosterone were measured in 38 type 1 diabetic (mean age 26.45 ± 0.89 years) and 24 type 2 diabetic (mean age 27.87 ± 0.97 years) subjects. The mean BMI of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 27.41 ± 1.18 and 38.55 ± 2.04 kg/m², respectively (P < 0.001).

Results

The mean total testosterone concentration of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 22.89 ± 1.23 and 11.14 ± 0.99 nmol/l, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean free testosterone concentration of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was 0.489 ± 0.030 and 0.296 ± 0.022 nmol/l, respectively (P < 0.001). Eight of 24 (33%) type 2 diabetic patients had subnormal free testosterone concentrations (< 0.225 nmol/l). Using an age-based reference range, 14 of 24 (58%) type 2 diabetic patients had low free testosterone concentrations (< 0.278 nmol/l). Three of 38 (8%) type 1 diabetic patients had free testosterone concentrations below the lower limit of normal (P = 0.02 when compared with type 2 diabetes). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in type 2 diabetic patients with low free testosterone concentrations were in the normal range and were similar to those in type 1 diabetic patients.

Conclusions

Young type 2 diabetic patients have significantly lower plasma concentrations of total and free testosterone and inappropriately low LH and FSH concentrations with a very high prevalence of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, when compared with type 1 diabetic patients of a comparable age. The potential implications for their sexual and reproductive function during prime reproductive years are profound.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Diagnostic properties of total and free prostate-specific antigen to predict overall and clinically significant prostate cancer among men with low testosterone and prior negative biopsy [^112GxVzo]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether total serum PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density have similar diagnostic properties for detecting prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically-significant (cs) PCa in men with normal testosterone compared to men with low testosterone with a prior negative biopsy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 3295 men undergoing a 2-year prostate biopsy following a negative prestudy biopsy in the placebo arm of the Reduction by Dutasteride of PCa Events (REDUCE) study. Men were divided in 2 groups based on testosterone level < or ≥ 300 ng/dL. Diagnostic properties of total serum PSA, free-PSA ratio, and PSA density to predict PCa and csPCa, defined as Gleason score ≥ 7, were determined for several thresholds and plotted as receiver operator characteristic curves.

Results

A total of 603 men (18.3%) had low testosterone. The prevalence of PCa and csPCa was 92 (15.3%) and 27 (4.5%), respectively, for low testosterone men compared to 458 (17.0%) and 138 (5.1%), correspondingly, for normal testosterone men. Total PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density showed similar sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to predict PCa and csPCa among low testosterone men compared to normal testosterone men.

Conclusion

Among subjects in a clinical trial with a prior negative biopsy, total PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density have comparable diagnostic characteristics for PCa screening in low and normal testosterone men.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115q6JoB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of men with suspected hypogonadism — Endocrine Society guideline: 1.1 We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations (when indicated). Testosterone concentrations exhibit significant diurnal and day-to-day variations and may be suppressed by food intake or glucose. Therefore, clinicians should measure total testosterone concentrations on two separate mornings when the patient is fasting. Clinicians should use an accurate and reliable method, optimally, an assay that has been certified by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program [e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Standardization Program for Testosterone]. In men who have conditions that alter sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) (Table 2), or whose initial total testosterone concentrations are at or near the lower limit of the normal range (Fig. 1), clinicians should determine free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations that use total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations. Clinicians should not use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays, as they are inaccurate. Clinicians should not test men for testosterone deficiency who have or are recovering from an acute illness or are engaged in short-term use of medications (e.g., opioids) that suppress testosterone concentrations.

### Testosterone assays [^114Cpe8q]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Challenges to the accurate and precise measurement of testosterone include deficiencies in standardization, variable reference ranges, expenses related to gold standard equipment, and other challenges. Total testosterone remains the most accessible for standard laboratories, while free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone may be useful adjuncts, particularly in men with low borderline testosterone values. Mass spectrometry is the gold standard measurement modality for total testosterone, while equilibrium dialysis followed by direct assessment with a trusted method is the gold standard technique for measuring free testosterone. Although reference ranges may vary, efforts to adapt reference ranges to different populations include age-adjusted values.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism. Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function. Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible; pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible (eg, hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes). Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon with estimated lifetime prevalence < 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men. The terms functional hypogonadism and late-onset hypogonadism suggest that testosterone treatment might be beneficial, a concept that has not been proven.

### Diurnal rhythms of serum total, free and bioavailable testosterone and of SHBG in middle-aged men compared with those in young men [^113d5esJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Conflicting views are reported on the association between advancing age and gradually diminishing concentrations of serum total testosterone in men. The putative loss of diurnal rhythm in serum total testosterone in older men is reported to be in part due to low concentrations in the morning when compared to concentrations found in young men. We have measured total, free and bioavailable testosterone along with SHBG in samples taken every 30 min throughout a 24-h period in 10 young and eight middle-aged men.

Results

Both young and middle-aged men displayed a significant diurnal rhythm in all variables, with a minimum fall of 43% in total testosterone from peak to nadir in all subjects. Subjecting the data to a time series analysis by least squares estimation revealed no significant difference in mesor (P = 0.306), amplitude (P = 0.061) or acrophase (P = 0.972) for total testosterone between the two groups. Comparing bioavailable testosterone in the two groups revealed no significant difference in mesor (P = 0.175) or acrophase (P = 0.978) but a significant difference (P = 0.031) in amplitude. Both groups display a significant circadian rhythm (middle-aged group P < 0.001; young group P = 0.014). Free testosterone revealed a highly significant rhythm in both the young group (P < 0.001) and the middle-aged group (P = 0.002), with no significant difference between the groups in mesor (P = 0.094) or acrophase (P = 0.698). Although analysis of the SHBG data revealed a significant rhythm in the young group (P = 0.003) and the older group (P < 0.001), the acrophase occurred in the mid afternoon in both groups (15.12 h in the young and 15.40 h in the middle-aged). The older men had a significantly greater amplitude (P = 0.044) but again no significant difference was seen in mesor (P = 0.083) or acrophase (P = 0.477) between the two groups. Acrophases for total, bioavailable and free testosterone occurred between 07.00 h and 07.30 h; for SHBG the acrophase occurred at 15.12 h in the young group and 15.40 h in the middle-aged group.

Conclusions

The study suggests that the diurnal rhythm in these indices of androgen status is maintained in fit, healthy men into the 7th decade of life.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113RxwJ2]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — depression and low testosterone associations report that men with diagnosed depression are more likely to have low testosterone than men who are not depressed (OR = 1.81; CI: 1.48, 2.32), but a meta-analysis of 7 observational studies found no significant difference in depression prevalence between men with low versus normal testosterone (OR = 1.23; CI: 0.92,1.63). Studies focused on depression as a primary endpoint found that men with low testosterone have a significantly higher incidence of depression and a shorter time to onset of depression, and this is particularly pronounced in older men with low testosterone who are 3-times more likely to have increased risk of depression (HR = 3.2; CI: 1.7, 5.9). After adjustment for age and comorbidities, low testosterone remained a statistically significant predictor of the age of onset of depression (HR = 2.1, CI: 1.3, 3.2; p = 0.02).

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114Pw7bk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Back to the Case

Although this man's initial serum total testosterone concentration was very low, he had a recent severe illness, (hospitalization for pneumonia 2 weeks prior to the initial testosterone measurement). Any significant acute systemic illness or flare of chronic systemic illness can transiently suppress the HPT axis and serum testosterone. Assessment for hypogonadism should not be done in men who are acutely unwell (and below their baseline health) or during hospital admission. Although there are no prospective data on the time frame of HPT axis recovery after an acute systemic illness, clinical experience indicates that the time to recovery is inversely related to the severity and duration of the illness. Because making a diagnosis of hypogonadism is not urgent, we recommend deferring testosterone measurements until the patient has recovered to their baseline health for at least 2 months. In patients with a protracted systemic illness lasting more than a few weeks, serial measurements of testosterone over several months are helpful; a pattern of increasing serum testosterone suggests that the HPT axis might fully recover.

In our patient, the initial measurement of serum testosterone was done on a nonfasting afternoon sample. Serum testosterone has a circadian rhythm with highest concentrations in the morning, and the normal range of serum testosterone is based on early morning blood samples. Although this circadian rhythm might be attenuated in many older men, male hypogonadism should be diagnosed based on an early morning testosterone concentration. Lastly, this man's low serum testosterone was not confirmed with a second measurement.

### Low serum testosterone and mortality in older men [^114hTytw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Declining testosterone levels in elderly men are thought to underlie many of the symptoms and diseases of aging; however, studies demonstrating associations of low testosterone with clinical outcomes are few.

Objective

The objective of the study was to examine the association of endogenous testosterone levels with mortality in older community-dwelling men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prospective, population-based study of 794 men, aged 50–91 (median 73.6) yr who had serum testosterone measurements at baseline (1984–1987) and were followed for mortality through July 2004.

Main Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality by serum testosterone level was measured.

Results

During an average 11.8-yr follow-up, 538 deaths occurred. Men whose total testosterone levels were in the lowest quartile (< 241 ng/dl) were 40% [hazards ratio (HR) 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–1.71] more likely to die than those with higher levels, independent of age, adiposity, and lifestyle. Additional adjustment for health status markers, lipids, lipoproteins, blood pressure, glycemia, adipocytokines, and estradiol levels had minimal effect on results. The low testosterone-mortality association was also independent of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and prevalent cardiovascular disease but was attenuated by adjustment for IL-6 and C-reactive protein. In cause-specific analyses, low testosterone predicted increased risk of cardiovascular (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.02–1.85) and respiratory disease (HR 2.29; 95% CI 1.25–4.20) mortality but was not significantly related to cancer death (HR 1.34; 95% CI 0.89–2.00). Results were similar for bioavailable testosterone.

Conclusions

Testosterone insufficiency in older men is associated with increased risk of death over the following 20 yr, independent of multiple risk factors and several preexisting health conditions.

### Low circulating androgens and mortality risk in heart failure [^112UtKEe]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Deficiency of anabolic sex steroids is common in heart failure (HF). The pathophysiological implications of this phenomenon, however, have not been fully elucidated. This clinical study investigated the significance of low serum androgen levels in HF.

Design

Prospective cohort study. Patients and Methods In 191 consecutively recruited men with HF (mean age 64 years; New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-IV 24%/35%/35%/6%) and reduced (ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40%, n = 96) or preserved (EF > 40%, n = 95) left ventricular function total and free serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. The median observation period was 859 days.

Results

During follow-up 53 patients (28%) died. Whereas total serum testosterone was normal in most patients (91%), free testosterone and DHEAS were reduced in 79% and 23%, respectively. DHEAS and free testosterone, but not total testosterone, were inversely associated with NYHA class (both p < 0.01). Lower free testosterone and DHEAS and higher SHBG predicted all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96 per 1 ng/dl free testosterone, p = 0.004; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.00 per 10 microg/dl DHEAS, p = 0.058; and HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33 per 10 nmol/l SHBG, p = 0.006, respectively; adjusted for age and NYHA class). However, further adjustment for carefully selected confounding factors abolished these associations.

Conclusion

In male HF patients, low serum levels of androgens are associated with adverse prognosis, but this relation is confounded by indicators of a poor health state. The results suggest that low serum androgens develop as a sequel of this progressive multifaceted systemic disorder.

Testosterone testing confirmation — because serum testosterone (T) concentrations vary significantly due to diurnal, circadian and circannual rhythms, episodic secretion, and assay variations, it is important to confirm low T concentrations since 30% of men with an initial T concentration in the hypogonadal range have a normal T concentration on repeat measurement, and a small fraction of healthy young men can fall below the normal range during a 24-hour period.

### Association of serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone with blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and elderly men [^116Gpr92]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The age‐related decline in testosterone levels is thought to be of great importance for male aging and cardiovascular diseases. However, data are controversial on whether abnormal sex hormones are linked to the presence of cardiovascular diseases and it is also uncertain how blood pressure modifies the association between testosterone levels and major cardiovascular diseases.

Methods and Results

This is a multicenter, population‐based, cross‐sectional study of 6296 men conducted between 2013 and 2016. Basic information and clinical symptoms were obtained by questionnaires. Blood pressure and plasma levels of total testosterone, sex hormone–binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, and free testosterone were determined in men in a multistage random, cluster sampling in 6 provinces of China. There were 5786 Chinese men (mean [SD] age 55.0 [10.1] years) included after exclusion criteria were applied; 37.2% (2150) of them were diagnosed with hypertension. Total testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone–binding globulin were inversely associated with the prevalence of hypertension. Age > 65 years or body mass index ≥ 24 negatively impacted the inverse correlation between testosterone levels and hypertension, whereas smoking and family history of hypertension strengthened the correlation. In participants with grade 2 hypertension, total testosterone was positively associated with the presence of stroke, and luteinizing hormone was also positively correlated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

Conclusions

Lower total testosterone could be a promising risk marker for prevalent hypertension. Both low and high levels of testosterone are associated with greater cardiovascular risk. Primary hypogonadism may be a risk marker for major cardiovascular diseases in men with severe hypertension.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^116yEGXD]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

The influence of aging — testosterone dynamics and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis changes indicate that among healthy aging men, HPG function may be maintained, yet beginning at age 20 to 30 years, T levels decline by 0.3% to 1.4% per year. Declining T levels are linked to primary testis failure with Leydig cells becoming less responsive to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation and the number of Leydig cells declining, but most older men with low T levels do not have increased LH. Mechanistically, production of GnRH decreases with age and GnRH/LH pulse amplitude diminishes; androgen negative feedback suppression of LH secretion may be increased; sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) levels tend to rise in older men causing free T levels to decline; and T shows higher morning levels with dampening of this diurnal rhythm as men grow older. Adult-onset hypogonadism, unlike overall hypogonadism, may be less influenced by age, and in EMAS among men with low T and normal LH levels — men likely to have AOH — age was not a significant predictor.

### Performance of total testosterone measurement to predict free testosterone for the biochemical evaluation of male hypogonadism [^116p18DP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Guidelines recommend serum total testosterone measurement as the initial test to evaluate male hypogonadism, reserving free testosterone assessment for men with suspected sex hormone-binding globulin abnormalities or total testosterone near the lower limit of normal. We determined the performance of total testosterone measurement as a test to identify men with normal vs low free testosterone.

Materials and Methods

We examined the electronic medical records of all 3,672 men evaluated for hypogonadism by a serum testosterone panel, including total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin and calculated free testosterone, from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2007 in a network that serves veterans in Washington.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of low total testosterone (less than 280 ng/dl) to rule out and predict low calculated free testosterone was 91.0% and 73.7%, respectively. At thresholds of less than 350 and less than 400 ng/dl the sensitivity of total testosterone for low calculated free testosterone increased to 96.8% and 98.2%, and at thresholds of less than 150 and less than 200 ng/dl specificity increased to 98.9% and 92.6%, respectively.

Conclusions

Total testosterone between 280 and 350 ng/dl is not sensitive enough to reliably exclude hypogonadism. Total testosterone must exceed 350 to 400 ng/dl to reliably predict normal free testosterone. Except when levels are less than 150 ng/dl total testosterone measurement has low specificity for the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism.

### Low estradiol concentrations in men with subnormal testosterone concentrations and type 2 diabetes [^117Q9QdN]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

On univariate analyses, BMI was negatively related to free testosterone (r = −0.18, P = 0.02) but not to free estradiol concentrations (r = 0.06, P = 0.42). Free estradiol concentrations were directly related to free testosterone (r = 0.24, P = 0.001) (Fig. 1). Age was related negatively to free testosterone (r = −0.24, P = 0.001) but not to free estradiol (r = −0.14, P = 0.06). BMI was positively related to FE/FT ratio (r = 0.16, P = 0.03). In multiple regression analysis, free estradiol was independently and directly related to free testosterone (β = 0.24, P = 0.001) but not to BMI (β = 0.10, P = 0.17) or age (β = −0.07, P = 0.37).

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gaRmZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — laboratory assessment and related risk markers: Measurements of serum testosterone levels are useful to identify men who have androgen deficiency and who may be candidates for testosterone replacement. Low levels of both testosterone and estradiol are associated with bone loss and fractures in men, although the associations are weak, and low estradiol levels are more strongly associated with increased fracture risk and accelerated bone loss in older men. Measurement of estradiol levels in clinical situations in men is not recommended because of the lack of easily available, accurate assay methods and the absence of validated clinical algorithms that incorporate estradiol measurements into treatment decisions. High SHBG levels are associated with increased fracture incidence and bone loss in older men.

Sexual symptom thresholds — in the European Male Ageing Study, only sexual symptoms (poor morning erections, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction) had a syndromic association with total testosterone (TT) concentrations ≤ 320 ng/dL (11 nmol/L) and free T (FT) < 64 pg/mL (220 pmol/L) after adjusting for age.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^117SnUAd]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA Guideline — testosterone therapy dosing target — 22. Clinicians should adjust testosterone therapy dosing to achieve a total testosterone level in the middle tertile of the normal reference range. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The goal of testosterone therapy is the normalization of total testosterone levels combined with improvement in symptoms or signs, and the Panel recommends using the minimal dosing necessary to drive testosterone levels to the normal physiologic range of 450–600 ng/dL, which is the middle tertile of the normal range for most laboratories; the Panel notes that age-adjustments may be required, but from a practical standpoint, 450–600 ng/dL represents a viable range for all age-groups, and achieving testosterone levels in this window should ameliorate any symptoms that are genuinely associated with testosterone deficiency.

### Endogenous testosterone and serum lipids in middle-aged men [^116h5mgS]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The role of decreasing testosterone levels influencing lipid metabolism in aging men is not well established.

Methods

We studied 1619 40 to 69-year old men with andropausal symptoms, who underwent measurements of serum testosterone, triglycerides, total-, and HDL-cholesterol.

Results

Testosterone (mean 15.25 nmol/l ± 5.43 S.D., range 3.6–45.0 nmol/l) correlated directly with HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.24, p < 0.0001) and inversely with total cholesterol (r = -0.06, p < 0.03), triglycerides (r = -0.30, p < 0.0001) and body mass index (r = -0.34, p < 0.0001), but not with LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.05, p = 0.09). In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, the significant determinants for serum triglycerides were testosterone (beta = -0.03, p < 0.0001), age (beta = -0.01, p < 0.0001), body mass index (beta = 0.039, p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular diseases (beta = 0.09, p < 0.04). The multivariate correlates of HDL-cholesterol included testosterone (beta = 0.007, p < 0.0001), body mass index (beta = -0.02, p < 0.0001) and alcohol consumption (beta = 0.02, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

We conclude that in aging men low testosterone levels are associated with a potentially atherogenic lipid profile including high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol.
