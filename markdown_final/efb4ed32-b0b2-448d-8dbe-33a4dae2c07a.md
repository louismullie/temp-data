## Question

Does lymphedema come and go?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lymphedema "comes and goes" and under what circumstances swelling fluctuates versus when it becomes persistent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how lymphedema is staged and whether early stages behave differently than advanced disease. Then, I should verify evidence for spontaneous reversibility or intermittent swelling in early lymphedema. Next, I will examine when swelling becomes chronic and why. After that, I should consider disease modifiers and special contexts that make fluctuations more likely. Finally, I will synthesize a useful answer with caveats about management implications and surveillance strategies.

> Let me first confirm the staging framework because the answer hinges on stage-dependent behavior. The International Society of Lymphology consensus defines Stage 0 as subclinical disease with impaired lymphatic transport but no visible swelling, Stage 1 as spontaneously reversible edema that improves with elevation, Stage 2 as pitting edema that no longer fully resolves with elevation and transitions to fibrosis, and Stage 3 as lymphostatic elephantiasis with trophic skin changes; I need to ensure I am using these definitions consistently before proceeding [^112DswHr].

> Wait, let me verify the core claim about early disease behavior. In Stage 1 lymphedema, the edema is high-protein and often pitting, and crucially it improves with limb elevation. Some experts consider that with timely, aggressive conservative therapy, Stage 1 may be reversible, which implies a "comes and goes" quality when interventions are in place and a predisposing factor like gravity is removed. Similarly, filarial lymphedema descriptions note that in early stages swelling can disappear overnight with elevation, reinforcing that intermittent edema is expected early on [^112DswHr] [^1157fVxb] [^115WSkPD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all lymphedema behaving this way. As disease progresses to Stage 2, the tissue becomes more fibrotic and pitting diminishes. Elevation alone no longer meaningfully reduces swelling, and over time structural remodeling and fat deposition render the edema less responsive, marking a transition from fluctuating to persistent disease. Consensus and clinical reviews emphasize that advanced lymphedema is characterized by increasing girth, fibrosis, and cutaneous pathology that reflect a more fixed, progressive condition rather than an intermittent one [^112DswHr] [^116AcbVG].

> I should double-check the mechanism that explains the shift from intermittent to persistent. Lymphatic failure drives accumulation of protein-rich fluid that provokes chronic inflammation, adipose deposition, and dermal fibrosis; these tissue-level changes create a vicious cycle where the lymphatic system cannot restore normal drainage even if the initial trigger is controlled, explaining why later-stage swelling tends to persist rather than "come and go" [^115fa3ts].

> But wait, what if there are modifiers that allow fluctuations even beyond Stage 1. Let me consider practical modifiers: time-of-day changes, elevation, compression, temperature, activity, and intercurrent cellulitis can all transiently alter limb volume. Prospective surveillance programs detect small extracellular fluid shifts before overt swelling, which patients may perceive as fluctuating heaviness or tightness even when they do not meet volumetric diagnostic thresholds, underscoring that subclinical and early disease often waxes and wanes with environmental and behavioral factors [^115xeB21] [^111mPxzG].

> I need to check special contexts where "comes and goes" is particularly prominent. In filarial lymphedema, acute dermatolymphangioadenitis attacks cause episodic painful swelling that typically lasts 3–9 days and then partially subsides, though baseline edema often increases after each attack; this creates a pattern of intermittent flares superimposed on a background of chronic lymphedema, which is a classic example of "comes and goes" superimposed on a progressive substrate [^1138ZSpA] [^114UiTMb].

> Next, I should review cancer-related lymphedema data to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. Breast cancer–related lymphedema often emerges within the first 2–3 years after treatment, and while some patients with mild disease report fluctuations, progression to more fixed edema is common without ongoing management; early detection and intervention are emphasized precisely because Stages 0–1 are more reversible and responsive, whereas Stages 2–3 are less so, aligning with the stage-based behavior I outlined earlier [^116s5Lrh] [^1157fVxb].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not missing a nuance. Yes, lymphedema can "come and go", but this is primarily a feature of early-stage disease or of disease under active conservative management; with progression, tissue remodeling and fibrosis convert the swelling into a persistent, chronic state that no longer fluctuates meaningfully with elevation alone; therefore, the correct clinical framing is that intermittent swelling is typical of Stage 1 and subclinical states, whereas persistent swelling characterizes Stage 2 and beyond, especially without ongoing compression and decongestive therapy [^112DswHr] [^116AcbVG].

> I should confirm the management implications so the answer is actionable. Early identification via symptom surveillance and objective measures, prompt initiation of complete decongestive therapy with compression, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise, and skin care, and sustained maintenance strategies can preserve the reversible window and reduce the likelihood that swelling becomes fixed; conversely, untreated or undertreated disease tends to progress to fibrotic, nonfluctuating edema, reinforcing the importance of timely, continuous care rather than episodic treatment only when swelling is prominent [^1157fVxb] [^1139MuEy] [^114VYzKB].

Lymphedema can fluctuate early on, especially in **stage 1**, where swelling may come and go with elevation or rest [^112DswHr]. Over time, as fibrosis and tissue changes develop, the swelling becomes **persistent and progressive** [^116AcbVG], no longer resolving with elevation alone [^112DswHr]. Triggers such as infection, injury, heat, or prolonged standing can cause **temporary flares**, but with ongoing management — especially compression and skin care — symptoms can be controlled and recurrence minimized [^1139MuEy] [^114VYzKB]. Early, consistent treatment is key to preventing progression and reducing the frequency and severity of episodes [^1157fVxb].

---

## Clinical stages and progression

Lymphedema is classified into **clinical stages** by the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) [^112DswHr]:

| **Stage** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Stage 0 | Subclinical; no visible swelling, but impaired lymphatic transport |
| Stage 1 | Early edema; pitting, resolves with elevation |
| Stage 2 | Persistent swelling; fibrosis begins, less responsive to elevation |
| Stage 3 | Severe fibrosis, skin thickening, papillomas, elephantiasis |

---

Early-stage lymphedema (stage 1) may show **intermittent swelling** that comes and goes with elevation or rest [^112DswHr]. As the disease advances, fibrosis and tissue changes make swelling persistent and less responsive to elevation [^116Df2kY].

---

## Factors influencing fluctuations

Several factors can cause **temporary fluctuations** in lymphedema severity:

- **Infections**: Cellulitis or lymphangitis can cause acute swelling and redness [^notfound].
- **Injury or trauma**: Minor injuries, insect bites, or burns can trigger swelling [^117MXMKD].
- **Heat and humidity**: Warm weather can exacerbate swelling.
- **Prolonged standing or physical activity**: Increased lymphatic load can cause temporary swelling.
- **Hormonal changes**: Menstrual cycles or hormonal therapy can influence fluid retention.

---

## Management strategies

Effective management can **significantly reduce the frequency and severity** of lymphedema episodes:

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated compression garments or bandaging are foundational to prevent and control swelling [^111xYXvT].
- **Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)**: Therapeutic massage to stimulate lymphatic flow [^1119puNe].
- **Exercise**: Regular, supervised exercise improves lymphatic circulation and reduces swelling [^1119puNe].
- **Skin care**: Meticulous skin care prevents infections and complications [^112kLTkF].
- **Elevation**: Elevating the affected limb reduces swelling, especially in early stages [^112DswHr].

---

## Clinical evidence on fluctuations

Studies show that early-stage lymphedema can fluctuate, but with progression, swelling becomes persistent [^112DswHr]. Early detection and intervention can reverse or stabilize early disease, whereas advanced fibrosis is **irreversible** [^1157fVxb].

---

## Patient experiences

Patients often report **episodic swelling** triggered by infections, heat, or prolonged activity. With consistent management, many experience fewer and less severe episodes over time.

---

## Conclusion

Lymphedema can come and go, especially in **early stages** or with triggers such as infection, injury, or heat [^112DswHr]. As the disease progresses, swelling becomes persistent and less responsive to elevation [^112DswHr]. Early, consistent management — particularly compression and skin care — can control symptoms and minimize recurrence [^1119puNe] [^114VYzKB].

To restate, the actual number of clinical LF cases is hard to obtain and will not truly be known until all endemic countries complete their field inquiries and burden assessments; this figure is much needed as most of the existing lymphedema cases will require EPC to alleviate their suffering. Importantly, to best describe the success of GPELF in mitigating LF disease, especially for general advocacy and for collection and presentation of data, it is important to address 1) how many cases of infection and disease have been prevented, 2) how the disease's age distribution has changed, and 3) how the reduction in infection levels in the population has led to decreases in new LF clinical cases and disease prevalence across different regions and age groups.

The primary goals of oncologic therapy are the compassionate care of cancer patients, eradication of disease, and palliation of symptoms. Advances in various targeted therapies such as highly conformal and image-guided radiotherapy techniques, sentinel lymph node dissection, and molecularly targeted agents hold the promise of allowing those goals to be reached with fewer treatment-related complications. Unfortunately, certain side effects remain problematic due to the inability to completely avoid injuring normal tissues. Lymphedema, a chronic condition that occurs as a result of the body's inability to drain lymph fluid from the tissues, is a common treatment-related side effect experienced by cancer patients. In this review, many of the important aspects of lymphedema with which clinicians who treat cancer patients should be familiar are outlined, including the anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of this condition. The authors also identify some of the resources available both to cancer patients with lymphedema and to the clinicians who treat them. It is hoped that this review will convey the importance of the early identification and management of this incurable disorder because this is essential to minimizing its complications.

Statistical methods

The baseline characteristics were described for patients with and without BCRL with means ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and rounded frequencies (%) for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with and without BCRL with an unpaired t- test or chi-squared test depending on data type. Multivariate linear regression models were used to calculate HRQoL mean score differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) between patients with and without BCRL. The analyses were adjusted for (1) age at assessment, (2) body mass index at assessment, (3) relationship status: currently in a relationship or not, (4) weekly alcohol consumption: yes or no, (5) weekly smoking: yes or no, (6) breast cancer treatment on the dominant arm side: yes or no and (7) time since breast cancer treatment. Multivariate linear regression models were used to analyze factors associated with significant MDs in lymphedema-specific HRQoL and symptoms within the BCRL group. The variables included in the models were (1) age at assessment, (2) body mass index at assessment, (3) relationship status: currently in a relationship or not, (4) weekly alcohol consumption: yes or no, (5) weekly smoking: yes or no, (6) time since lymphedema diagnosis, (7) excess lymphedema volume, (8) lymphedema in dominant arm: yes or no, (9) previous arm infection: yes or no, (10) daily use of conservative lymphedema therapy: yes or no and (11) lymphedema affecting the hand: yes or no. Baseline variables (age, body mass index, relationship status, alcohol and smoking) were chosen for the models a priori. Treatment and lymphedema-specific variables (breast cancer laterality, time since breast cancer, time since lymphedema, excess lymphedema volume, lymphedema laterality, arm infection episodes, use of lymphedema treatments and lymphedema involving the hand) were chosen due to their perceived significant impact on HRQoL in breast cancer patients. As no established cutoff values were available to determine clinical significance, we considered MDs below 10 to be of minimal clinical significance, MDs of 10 to 20 points of moderate significance and 20 or more points to be of large clinical significance. Correlation and residuals between LYMPH-ICF, DASH, and SF-36 responses were calculated using simple linear regression. STATA 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) and GraphPad Prism (Version 8.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA) were used for the statistical analysis and conducted with a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 and reported with 95%CI when applicable.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^115xeB21]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

A prospective surveillance model aims to identify and then monitor patients at risk, applying preventive treatment if subclinical changes are detected. Monitoring is commonly carried out using self-reported symptoms confirmed by bio-impedance spectroscopy, which can detect small changes in the extracellular fluid load. If a low threshold of 3% is crossed, conservative therapy follows with the application of meticulous skin care, exercise, massage, and compression. Such a prospective surveillance model in LF-endemic regions could have a similar impact on reducing progression of at-risk cases to overt disease. Modifications of the present model would be needed to account for location-specific challenges in communities endemic for LF and podoconiosis, particularly the extension of existing case registration and monitoring tools to identify and include high-risk communities and at-risk members of the community. Because the increase in extracellular fluid load can often be felt as limb heaviness before apparent swelling, in the absence of objective measures anyone with a history of infection and subjective symptoms should be included in the education and support program. Early identification and intervention could also be implemented through schools in regions where transmission has not yet been broken or has only recently been stopped. Young people with latent disease have the best opportunity to reverse early changes and lead lives without lymphedema if they are educated in the necessary signs and intervention measures.

Cancer-related therapy (CRT) and lymphedema — The panel's support for a CRT–lymphedema association is drawn from the extensive breast cancer literature, and edema has been estimated to occur in 19% of people with advanced cancer. From a Western medical context, CRT remains the most prevalent cause of lymphedema, and when addressing an individual who will be treated for cancer, the subject of lymphedema risk should be addressed and, where appropriate, surveillance and risk-reduction measures should be undertaken.

### Progression of clinically stable lymphedema on lymphoscintigraphy [^116YfkKE]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is due to dysfunction in lymphatic transport, and is divided into primary and secondary subtypes. Primary lymphedema is a congenital lymphatic abnormality or dysfunction whereas secondary lymphedema is characterized by pathologic disruption or obstruction of a previously-normal lymphatic system. The stage of lymphedema is determined clinically. Lymphoscintigraphy, however, may be used to assess disease extent, for early detection of disease progression, and can be used to direct therapy. We report a case of a 56-year-old woman with clinically stable lymphedema of 5 years, yet with lymphoscintigraphy findings compatible with disease progression.

Among other possible causes, lymphedema can be caused by burn injury, penetrating traumatic injury, recurrent cellulitis, complication of lymph node dissection, lymph node metastasis, granulomatous disease, lymphedema tarda, congenital lymphedema, lymphatic filariasis, lymphangitis, lymphedema praecox, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, chronic venous insufficiency, lipedema, bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema, radiotherapy, cancer-related lymphedema, heart failure, renal failure, hypoproteinemia and obesity-induced lymphedema. In addition, lymphedema can be caused by medications such as sirolimus, anastrozole and atezolizumab.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^111fLXhy]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema evaluation — swelling quantification and AFTD-pitting test emphasize objective measurement at baseline and follow up and describe a consensus tool with a duration threshold. The page states that to evaluate treatment one "has to be able to quantify the amount of swelling at initial visit and during follow up", and because swelling is the presenting symptom it is "important to have an objective measure of initial swelling… and progressively evaluate whether the treatment reduces swelling". Practicality and standardization concerns are noted, yet a consensus "advocated the use of the AFTD-pitting test… using edema of > 3 months duration as a surrogate for lymphedema", although "low inter-observer reliability was reported in another cohort with milder lymphedema". For diagnostic confidence in early disease, "some of the experts consider additional assessment such as limb volume, physiologic changes, or lymphatic imaging necessary to make a confident diagnosis of Stage 0 and 1 lymphedema", and "Patients want to have confidence in their diagnosis… some are interested" in imaging to increase diagnostic confidence.

### Primary lymphedema: update on genetic basis and management [^112hmZRh]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Primary lymphedema is a chronic condition without a cure. The lower extremities are more commonly affected than the arms or genitalia. The disease can be syndromic. Morbidity includes decreased self-esteem, infections, and reduced function of the area. Recent Advances: Several mutations can cause lymphedema, and new variants continue to be elucidated. A critical determinant that predicts the natural history and morbidity of lymphedema is the patient's body mass index (BMI). Individuals who maintain an active lifestyle with a normal BMI generally have less severe disease compared to subjects who are obese. Because other causes of lower extremity enlargement can be confused with lymphedema, definitive diagnosis requires lymphoscintigraphy. Critical Issues: Most patients with primary lymphedema are satisfactorily managed with compression regimens, exercise, and maintenance of a normal body weight. Suction-assisted lipectomy is our preferred operative intervention for symptomatic patients who have failed conservative therapy. Suction-assisted lipectomy effectively removes excess subcutaneous fibro-adipose tissue and can improve underlying lymphatic function. Future Directions: Many patients with primary lymphedema do not have an identifiable mutation and thus novel variants will be identified. The mechanisms by which mutations cause lymphedema continue to be studied. In the future, drug therapy for the disease may be developed.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^111LxMc2]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite this great accuracy in detecting true negatives and positives, lymphoscintigraphy does have some drawbacks. First and foremost, lymphoscintigraphy has poor spatial resolution. This may not have a significant impact on its ability to detect the presence of lymphedema, but it does mean that lymphoscintigraphy cannot provide much anatomical information, placing limitations on how much information it can provide clinicians about the specific disease states of individual cases. Lymphoscintigraphy also lacks standardization, particularly regarding quantitative analysis of results. There are no "standardized" sets of drainage times or even acquisition time points by which clinicians can conclusively diagnose lymphedema. Instead, they largely rely on conducting bilateral lymphoscintigraphy, and compare drainage times and patterns between the suspected diseased and healthy limbs. This introduces another variable into the diagnosis process and can open the door to inconsistency in diagnosis from center to center and clinician to clinician. Lastly, although quantitative lymphoscintigraphy does allow for increased sensitivity relative to qualitative methods, lymphoscintigraphy images can still be "normal" for patients in very early stages of the disease process. This means that lymphoscintigraphy may be unable to detect lymphedema early enough, resulting in detection only when more extensive physiological abnormalities such as dermal backflow are manifested more thoroughly.

### Surgical intervention for lymphedema [^112DwGHq]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive disease with no curative treatment. Breast cancer therapy is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in the developed world. Treatment includes nonsurgical and surgical strategies. Conservative measures are reserved for subclinical lymphedema. Surgical options are divided into physiologic (to restore function) and reductive (to remove diseased tissue). Early stage disease is managed with physiologic procedures. Reductive treatment is reserved for moderate to severe staged disease owing to high morbidity. Surgical options effectively decrease edema and improve quality of life. However, further research is necessary to best establish management of lymphedema.

### Arm symptom pattern among breast cancer survivors with and without lymphedema: a contemporaneous network analysis [^113rKK6D]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to examine the patterns and interrelationships among arm symptoms in BCS using network analysis. Our results identified the most frequently reported and most severe arm symptoms in LE and non-LE group, and 3 symptom clusters including "Lymphatic Stasis", "Nerve Injury", and "Movement Limitation". Tightness was the core symptom for the total sample network, while firmness and tightness were identified as core symptoms for networks of non-LE and LE group, respectively. Types of axillary surgery, RT, and post-surgery duration were identified as covariates for overall symptom severity but did not significantly influence the network strength and structure. The network structure of LE group was significantly different from that of non-LE group. Exploring the intricate networks of arm symptoms in BCS has deepened our comprehension of symptomatology.

The study of arm symptom clusters in BCS has been relatively understudied in the field. Only one previous study was found, reporting 3 symptom clusters: impaired limb mobility, fluid accumulation and discomfort, in BCS at 4–8 weeks and 12 months post-surgery. The symptom clusters were similar to our findings, although they were named differently and encompassed different specific symptoms. The most notable differences were observed between the "discomfort" and "Nerve Injury" symptom clusters. The "discomfort" cluster, observed at 4–8 weeks post-surgery, comprised finger limitation and tenderness, and included tenderness, blistering, and pain at 12 months. In contrast, the "Nerve Injury" cluster in our study encompassed tenderness, pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness. The difference might be explained by the sample size and short post-surgery periods, which had been acknowledged as limitations by the authors. We can assume that the symptom clusters remain stable among different patient groups; however, further validation in diverse populations is still needed. It had been reported that BCS reported up to 35 upper limb symptoms or signs, which would be challenging for health care providers to consider so many symptoms. Symptom clusters streamline the understanding and assessment of arm symptoms by reducing and categorizing dimensions of interconnected symptoms.

### Topical tacrolimus for the treatment of secondary lymphedema [^11385TZw]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Secondary lymphedema (henceforth referred to as lymphedema) is a chronic debilitating disease that in the United States and Western countries occurs most frequently as a complication of cancer treatment. It is estimated that as many as one in three patients who undergo lymph node dissection will go on to develop lymphedema, and conservative estimates suggest that as many as 50,000 new patients are diagnosed annually. Because lymphedema is a life-long disease with no cure, the number of affected individuals is increasing annually with current estimates ranging between 5 and 6 million Americans. It is likely that this number will continue to increase in the future since the development of lymphedema is nearly linearly related with cancer survivorship, and because the prevalence of known risk factors for lymphedema, such as obesity and radiation, is rising.

Lymphedema is disfiguring and debilitating; patients have chronic swelling of the affected extremity, recurrent infections, limited mobility and decreased quality of life. In addition, once lymphedema develops it is usually progressive. Existing approaches for lymphedema management are palliative in nature, relying on compression garments and physical therapy to decrease fluid accumulation and progression of disease. Currently, there is no known pharmacologic therapy that can halt progression or promote resolution of lymphedema.

### Lymphatic function and anatomy in early stages of lipedema [^115ykoRN]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

First reported by Allen and Hines, lipedema, a disease marked by abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation from the buttocks to the ankles and occasionally the arms, primarily develops in women and is characterized by three progressive stages. Stage I lipedema presents with sometimes painful, pearl‐sized nodules in a hypertrophic subcutaneous adipose tissue layer; in Stage II, there are skin indentations with pearl‐ to apple‐sized masses in the skin and adipose tissue; and in Stage III, there are lobules of skin and fat on the arms, hips, and thighs and around the knees. During all stages, lipolymphedema, a condition similar to lymphedema, can occur. Awareness of lipedema in medical society has been limited, and the disease is often misdiagnosed as obesity, leg swelling with venous disease, or lymphedema.

In lymphedema, genetic or acquired, lymphatic vasculature abnormalities cause impaired clearance of capillary filtrate, subsequent irresolvable edema, and subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation. In a study of cancer‐acquired lymphedema (identifier NCT02949726), we used longitudinal near‐infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging (NIRF‐LI) to show that chronic lymphatic dysfunction precedes edema and volumetric tissue changes and that NIRF‐LI may provide early objective criteria for the future onset of clinical symptoms. However, in lipolymphedema, subcutaneous adipose deposition precedes clinical symptoms of edema. Because impaired lymphatic dysfunction has been reported to cause, as well as result from, adipose tissue expansion, lymphatic dysfunction may play a role in the etiology of lipedema. Whether subclinical lymphatic dysfunction can contribute to the inflammatory tissue environment responsible for adiposity in lipedema, can be predictive for lipolymphedema, and/or can provide an objective measure for lipedema remain open questions.

Lymphedema consensus methodology and evidence limitations state that results should be interpreted with several limitations, including that a systematic review was not conducted and the included studies' level of evidence was not graded using GRADE; a 6‑point Likert scale rather than a 5‑point Likert scale was used to increase precision; no specific pneumatic compression device was mentioned and evidence was based on clinical experience and judgement; the literature on all questions was weak and when agreement was very strong it was solely based on common sense and current clinical practice; no bias based on COI was identified, emphasizing the substantial need for further and more robust research and for well clinically and methodologically designed studies in lymphedema care.

American Venous Forum/American Vein and Lymphatic Society/Society for Vascular Medicine consensus — scope of agreement: The consensus process demonstrated that lymphedema experts agree on the majority of the statements related to risk factors for lymphedema and the diagnostic workup for lymphedema patients, with less agreement on statements related to treatment of lymphedema; this consensus suggests that variability in lymphedema care is high even among the experts, and developers of future practice guidelines for lymphedema should consider this information, especially in cases of low-level evidence that supports practice patterns with which the majority of experts disagree.

### Impact of lymphedema duration on lymphatic vessel quality and outcomes after super-microsurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis [^113b6pgQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema, characterized by the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the soft tissues, commonly develops in the limbs following lymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy used for oncologic interventions. The prevalence of secondary lymphedema is on the rise, and is expected to affect 20% to 40% of patients undergoing treatments for breast and cervical cancer. Although sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed commonly for breast cancers, the use of the same in pelvic cancers are not as widespread in all centers, leading to lower limb lymphedema. Chronic lymphedema has been defined as that which lasts more than 3 to 6 months, with some outcome-related comparison studies setting a threshold of 1 year. As the lymphedema persists, it evolves into a chronic condition that significantly diminishes quality of life. – Consequently, affected swollen limbs may experience lifelong functional impairment and recurrent cellulitis, with some cases escalating to severe conditions such as elephantiasis and lymphorrhea. –

Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) provides a minimally invasive, well-documented treatment that redirects the lymphatic flow into the venous system to alleviate lymphedema symptoms. – There is a consensus that progression of lymphedema over time degrades the quality of lymphatic vessels (LVs), which may compromise the effectiveness of LVA for these cases. Nonetheless, emerging data from the literature support the efficacy of LVA in managing severe lymphedema, – challenging prevailing assumptions about the relationship between duration of disease, LV quality, and LVA outcomes. This study seeks to investigate the impact of lymphedema duration (LD) on LV quality and the subsequent outcomes following LVA for secondary lower limb lymphedema, using propensity score matching (PMS) analysis to provide rigorous evaluation of these relationships.

As already described, acute attacks (ADL) are important both in terms of patients' resilience and in exacerbating the clinical condition. The duration of ADL attacks varies between 3 and 9 days, – during which the patient is usually unable to perform regular work, thereby causing economic strain for the patients and their families. The ADL attacks involve various degrees of discomfort, including pain in the affected leg, feeling feverish, feeling cold, having limb and lymph node inflammation, and having swelling. In addition, depending on the severity of the infection, some patients may have a headache, vomiting, altered sensorium, and urine incontinence. Peeling of the skin (exfoliation) in the affected area can occur as the acute attack subsides, but exfoliation is generally not seen in less severe attacks. Once ADL has been treated and is subsiding, an increase from the pre-attack edema will persist, usually with additional dermal changes; without care, repeated attacks eventually lead to gross, chronic lymphedema. In all cases of an ADL attack, the presence of "entry lesions" (see below) should be sought and treated to promote their healing and recovery after the attack.

### The grading of lymphedema in oncology clinical trials [^116HhYon]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a common late toxicity of cancer therapy. This article describes the rationale and process utilized by the Lymphedema Working Group for the revision and expansion of the Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 (CTC v2.0) lymphedema criteria to produce the CTC v3.0 lymphedema criteria. Established clinician-based rating scales and quantitative instruments are reviewed in this article. None of the extant rating scales have been formally validated, nor has their reliability been assessed. Drawbacks of current scales were considered in formulating CTC v3.0 criteria. Most rely exclusively on volume to diagnose and grade lymphedema. This imposes significant clinical limitations, particularly in the assessment of toxicity in oncology clinical trials. Volume-based rating scales are of little value in rating the severity of bilateral limb and nonlimb edema. Problems with nonvolumetric staging systems (eg, CTC v2.0) include insufficient detail to permit useful discrimination of severity among the majority of lymphedema patients. Technologies for objectively quantifying lymphedema have been developed and validated. Although these are briefly reviewed, it is recognized that cost and access issues limit their widespread clinical utility and, as such, were not considered in developing the CTC v3.0 criteria. The CTC v3.0 lymphedema criteria adopted several innovations. Principle among these was the decision to generate separate criteria for volumetric increase, dermal changes, and subcutaneous fibrosis. We anticipate the use of the new CTC v3.0 lymphedema criteria to begin in mid-2003 for grading the key clinical features of this disorder in oncology clinical trials. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the reader with (1) background on the clinical features of lymphedema, (2) information on established lymphedema rating systems, (3) the consensus process and rationale of the Lymphedema Working Group, (4) the new CTC v3.0, and (5) quantitative techniques for assessment of lymphedema.

### Lymphedema and breast cancer surgery-NCI… [^117MXMKD]. NCI (2013). Low credibility.

If you have breast cancer, no matter which type of surgery you have, you will likely have one or more lymph nodes removed from under your arm. This is not the case if you have DCIS, since cells in DCIS will not travel to other parts of the body. Lymph nodes are part of the immune system, which protects your body against infection and disease. Lymph nodes are small, round organs that are clustered in many areas of the body, such as the underarm. They are connected to one another by lymph vessels, which carry a clear fluid, called lymph. Cancer cells can spread to lymph nodes and other parts of the body through lymph vessels. Once lymph nodes are removed, they will be checked for cancer. Knowing whether cancer is in the underarm lymph nodes can help the doctor decide if you need any treatment in addition to surgery. And, if so, what type you might need. Lymphedema is swelling caused by a build-up of lymph.

You may have this type of swelling in the hand, arm, chest, or back on the side of your body where lymph nodes were removed by breast cancer surgery or damaged by radiation therapy. Some important facts to know about lymphedema are:

- Lymphedema can show up soon after surgery.
- Sometimes, lymphedema can last for years.
- Lymphedema can show up months or years after cancer treatment is over.
- Lymphedema might develop after an insect bite, minor injury, or burn on the arm where lymph nodes were removed or damaged.
- Lymphedema can cause pain and other problems. To help with these problems, some people find it helpful to work with a physical therapist or doctor who specializes in rehabilitation and has special lymphedema training. Then, he or she removes the node or nodes that contain the dye or radioactive tracer to see if they have cancer. If they do not contain cancer, it is not likely that the other nodes under the arm have cancer.

This means that the surgeon usually doesn't have to remove any other lymph nodes. Fewer lymph nodes are removed with sentinel lymph node biopsy than with standard lymph node surgery. Having fewer lymph nodes removed helps lower the chances that you will develop lymphedema and other problems caused by damage to lymph vessels and lymph nodes.

Lymphedema pathophysiology and the role of venous disease — Contemporary physiology indicates that "there was no steady state venous reabsorption of microvascular fluid but rather steady, dwindling filtration", and "the lymphatics, not the venules, are predominantly responsible for maintaining tissue fluid balance by absorbing interstitial fluid and ultimately returning it into the circulation". Expert statements note that "lymphatic failure is responsible for all forms of peripheral edema" and that "all chronic edema indicates an inadequacy or failure of lymph drainage", and the panel acknowledges "the significant contribution from CVI". Accordingly, "The edema associated with CVI (C3–C6) represents lymphatic failure or phlebolymphedema".

### Postural differences in the immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower limb lymphedema [^111CMsyu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Correlations between severity of pre-intervention skin symptoms and lower-limb volume decrements

Skin hardening indicates fibrosis, which is associated with the progression of lymphedema. In the early stage of lymphedema, the subcutaneous tissues can be compressed so that a mark remains, but in the late stage of lymphedema, the fluid content of the tissue decreases, and fibrous and adipose tissue contents increase, resulting in hardened skin that cannot be pitted by compression. Early in this process, the skin keeps its flexibility; however, protein accumulation leads to fibrous and adipose tissue proliferation, and in ISL stage III lymphedema, these symptoms progress to elephantiasis.

Although there were no significant changes in skin hardness and indentation after any of the interventions, the degree of indentation before the intervention was significantly positively correlated with the amount of lower-limb volume reduction after all three interventions. In contrast, the degree of skin hardness before the intervention was significantly positively correlated with the reduction in lower-limb volume only after supine AECT. This suggests that patients with severe lymphedema and advanced skin hardness may benefit more from AECT while recumbent to reduce lower-limb volume. In late ISL stage II, when skin hardening has become severe, the shape of the lymph ducts changes, and their lumens narrow. Once this occurs, the pumping action of muscle during exercise becomes less effective at improving lymphatic drainage. Therefore, using gravity to enhance the effects of exercise and compression by having the patient assume a supine position achieves a better result than exercise and compression while the patient is upright. The results of the present study are clinically important for designing treatment programs.

Implications for future research and limitations

A limitation of this study is that the scale used to evaluate skin hardness and indentation was a subjective clinical scale based on palpation. Quantitative evaluation of these parameters would be helpful, and we hope that, in the future, instruments capable of quantitatively measuring these factors will be developed. In addition, this study examined the immediate effects of exercise therapy on LLL, but future work should also investigate long-term intervention effects. Finally, other exercise modes, durations, frequencies, and intensities should be tested to determine the optimal treatment for LLL.

Lymphedema — compression sleeve usage notes that adherence to the compression sleeve is associated with the lowest risk for regaining edema and that regular use did not reduce swelling but prevented worsening; in intensive-phase studies edema volume reduction was limited to 50 mL, so a compression sleeve should be provided in the maintenance phase and should not be used in the intensive phase unless very early after onset of lymphedema.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^114UiTMb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Consequences to patients, their families, and other caregivers.

The health consequences of LF for affected individuals increase as their lymphedema worsens. The episodic swelling and transient multi-day attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL; also known as "acute attacks") are tolerated in the early stages, but as they increase in frequency, intensity, and duration with progression of the disease, they become very much more problematic for the patient. Indeed, these acute attacks are commonly the prime reason patients actively seek medical help. With more severe lymphedema, it is not uncommon for patients to concern themselves primarily with preventing and treating ADLs specifically — an indication that although they might have become accustomed to having a disfigured limb, the acute attacks are still the most intolerable part of their LF disease. Patients who are most severely affected can even have multiple ADLs in a month, with devastating effects on their lives and on the lives of their families, including a negative impact on their socioeconomic status through decreased ability to work. A common statement by patients is that the lymphedematous limb feels abnormally heavy; after implementation of the care package, however, patients perceive relief that often leads to their expressing, with great satisfaction, that the affected limbs just "do not weigh as much anymore", even without any externally apparent reduction in limb size.

Weight Loss and Exercise

Obesity has been shown to be a major risk factor in the development of lymphedema, with multiple studies showing that patients with a higher body mass index are more significantly more likely to develop lymphedema. – It reasons that weight loss should be a beneficial adjunct in helping to reduce limb volume; however, this has not been borne out in the literature with certainty. A 2007 randomized controlled trial examined the impact of weight reduction on breast-cancer related lymphedema, with results showing significant reduction in arm volume in the weight-reduction group after 12 weeks; however, this study was limited by a small sample size. Since then, larger, more recent studies have reported fewer promising results, indicating that weight loss does not improve lymphedema symptoms. Schmitz et al. found in a large-scale randomized clinical trial that weight loss and exercise did not significantly improve breast-cancer-related lymphedema outcomes compared to the control group. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that weight loss did not reduce severity of breast-cancer-related lymphedema. It may be the patient's weight at the time of surgery or lymphatic injury that determines their risk of lymphedema development, rather than their weight after the condition has already developed.

While the effectiveness of weight loss as a treatment for lymphedema is still debated, the role of exercise as a therapeutic approach is more supported. In general, exercise does not seem to worsen lymphedema symptoms, with literature suggesting that resistance training may be specifically beneficial. – Aquatic activities have also been recommended. Movement in a water-based environment eliminates a portion of gravitational load while supplying external compression, which together aids in the movement of fluid proximally and out of the extremity.

Surgical Management

Once a patient's medical therapy is optimized, they may be considered for surgical evaluation. Surgical options can be categorized into physiological and ablative procedures. Physiological procedures directly target the lymphatic system and include lymphovenous bypass and vascularized lymph node transfer. Ablative procedures focus on reducing limb size through debulking by means of liposuction or direct excision. Recent years have also seen a rise in interest in prophylactic procedures for lymphedema prevention.

### Impact of text reminders on pneumatic compression device (PCD) compliance in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema [^116qwQa1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lymphedema is a chronic debilitating disease marked by deficits in lymph drainage and accumulation of protein-rich fluid, leading to limb edema that can progress to cellulitis and fibrosis over time. People with lymphedema are susceptible to extremity impairment, recurrent soft tissue inflammation and infections, lymphorrhea, body disfigurement, and psychological and social issues. Breast cancer treatments can result in breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), with reported frequencies ranging from 6 to 65%.

Treatments for lymphedema focus on symptom management and improved patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Traditional interventions include manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression therapy and self-care (e.g. skin hygiene, limb elevation, exercise, compression garments). In very severe cases, lymphatic exchange may be performed. More recently, pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) have become an additional treatment option that clinicians can offer patients for the treatment of lymphedema. Clinical studies have demonstrated that regular use of PCDs, as an adjunct to standard self-care measures, is associated with significant patient-reported improvements in overall symptoms, decreased limb girth, decreased limb volume, increased elasticity of tissues, and fewer episodes of infection.

Adherence to prescribed at-home self-care is critical to the successful treatment of lymphedema. Research shows that compliance to some risk management behaviors diminishes over time while adherence to other behaviors remains high. Text messaging is a convenient method to send patients reminders to use home therapies, take prescribed medications, or follow postoperative instructions and can been used for a variety of disease states. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether cell phone text reminders impacted the rate of compliance with PCD therapy. Secondary outcomes were to examine the changes in arm girth, quality of life, and symptom severity in patients using PCD for BCRL.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^1127JN6P]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

When deciding on the long-term treatment strategies for individual patients, it is important both to consider the time it has taken for the development of the pathological changes and to resist the tendency to regard all patients of roughly the same physical presentation as being clinically identical. Knowing the duration of the condition can significantly affect the emphasis placed on a particular component of the lymphedema management strategy (e.g. when there is a greater need for more physiotherapy or when making a prognosis for how much improvement can be expected).

Implementation of the EPC's lymphedema management strategy should begin as soon as possible after the first signs and symptoms appear, especially in younger patients; healing and repair slow with aging in general, and this age-related slowing also likely applies to changes in older patients' lymphedema. Thus, an individual's age must always be considered when assessing the ongoing status or clinical progression of patients; an elderly person with long-standing lymphedematous and dermal changes is likely to respond less quickly to treatment than a younger individual with an equivalent lymphedema stage. Moreover, although the basis for treatment of most patients with lymphedema is the EPC, it should also be remembered that any comorbidities these patients have (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity) also require specific medical attention in addition to that provided by the EPC protocol.

### Arm symptom pattern among breast cancer survivors with and without lymphedema: a contemporaneous network analysis [^112wQYAx]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Arm symptoms commonly endure in post-breast cancer period and persist into long-term survivorship. However, a knowledge gap existed regarding the interactions among these symptoms. This study aimed to construct symptom networks and visualize the interrelationships among arm symptoms in breast cancer survivors (BCS) both with and without lymphedema (LE).

Patients and Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of 3 cross-sectional studies. All participants underwent arm circumference measurements and symptom assessment. We analyzed 17 symptoms with a prevalence > 15%, identifying clusters and covariates through exploratory factor and linear regression analysis. Contemporaneous networks were constructed with centrality indices calculated. Network comparison tests were performed.

Results

1116 cases without missing data were analyzed, revealing a 29.84% prevalence of LE. Axillary lymph node dissection [ALND] (vs sentinel lymph node biopsy [SLNB]), longer post-surgery duration, and radiotherapy significantly impacted overall symptom severity (P < .001). "Lymphatic Stasis", "Nerve Injury", and "Movement Limitation" symptom clusters were identified. Core symptoms varied: tightness for total sample network, firmness for non-LE network, and tightness for LE network. LE survivors reported more prevalent and severe arm symptoms with stronger network connections than non-LE group (P = 0.010). No significant differences were observed among different subgroups of covariates (P > .05). Network structures were significantly different between ALND and SLNB groups.

Conclusion

Our study revealed arm symptoms pattern and interrelationships in BCS. Targeting core symptoms in assessment and intervention might be efficient for arm symptoms management. Future research is warranted to construct dynamic symptom networks in longitudinal data and investigate causal relationships among symptoms.

### The Dutch lymphedema guidelines based on the international classification of functioning, disability, and health and the chronic care model [^113KJgy1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic and progressive condition due to an imbalance between lymphatic filtration and transport capacity. A relative overload of fluid is caused by lymphatic impairment (afterload impairment); an absolute overload is caused by increased filtration (preload raised). Lymphedema can result in considerable disability and loss of quality of life. The Dutch Society of Dermatology organized a task force to create guidelines using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. As lymphedema is a chronic condition, a new approach was chosen according to the chronic care model. In the development of the guidelines, the following topics of lymphedema care were proposed: (1) lymphedema detection; (2) clinimetric instruments; and (3) rational treatment modalities. A systematic review of the literature published up to June 2013 was conducted. Statements were based on scientific evidence and experience. The guidelines propose recommendations based on an interdisciplinary approach to lymphedema using a continuum of care from prevention to initial treatment phase, maintenance phase, and follow-up. An integrated treatment program can be conservative or surgical. A therapeutic program depends on stage and origin of lymphedema; International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health-based limitations; needs of the patient; ability to perform self-management; and ability to reduce patient-related risk factors, such as overweight and lack of exercise.

Providing and improving the care of patients suffering from lymphedema remains an essential goal for the clinical management of populations affected by lymphatic filariasis. Although the Essential Package of Care (EPC) recommended by the WHO leads to important positive benefits for many of these lymphedema patients, it is important to continue to address the challenges that remain both in quantifying these effects and in ensuring optimal care. This report, based on the authors' scientific and field experience, focuses on the impact and significance of lymphedema, its clinical presentation, current treatment approaches, and the importance of lymphedema care to the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. It emphasizes specific practical issues related to managing lymphedema, such as the importance of beginning treatment in the condition's early stages and the development of effective approaches to assess patients' progress toward improving both their clinical status and their overall quality of life. Priorities for research are also examined, particularly the need for tools to identify patients and to assess disease burden in endemic communities, the creation of EPC accessibility to as many patients as possible (i.e., targeting 100% "geographic coverage" of care), and the empowerment of patients to ensure the sustainability, and ultimately the provision of care from sectors of the national public health systems of endemic countries.

### Fatigue and sleep quality improvement through complete decongestive therapy in postmastectomy lymphedema: an investigative analysis [^114JqWQ8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. According to 2020 GLOBOCAN data, it accounts for 11.7% of all cancer cases in women, making it the most common cancer. This statistic highlights the fact that breast cancer is a significant health problem among women and is widespread throughout the world.

Postmastectomy lymphedema syndrome is a chronic and progressive complication that occurs in patients who have undergone lymph node dissection, surgery or radiotherapy for breast cancer. It involves the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial spaces and is caused by the disruption of lymphatic drainage. If left untreated, lymphedema can lead to chronic inflammation, cellulite, pain, fatigue, loss of productivity, cosmetic disfigurement and functional impairment of the affected limb, significantly affecting daily life. Incidence rates for postmastectomy lymphoedema can vary widely, but it is estimated that around 30% of women diagnosed with breast cancer will develop postmastectomy lymphoedema. This condition highlights the importance of understanding and managing the potential complications associated with breast cancer and its treatment, including the risk of lymphoedema. Early detection and appropriate management strategies are critical to improving the quality of life for people with postmastectomy lymphoedema.

### Risk factors and prediction model for persistent breast-cancer-related lymphedema: a 5-year cohort study [^1157L9ci]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lymphedema is considered a progressive disease without curative treatment; however, through proper intervention, stage I lymphedema can be reversed. It is unclear if and how patients with stage I lymphedema progress to more severe, chronic, or persistent conditions. Our data indicated that most patients with BCRL (78.9%) started to experience swelling within 3 years after surgery. One third of patients with BCRL did not progress further, or even resolve without any flare-up, whereas two thirds of patients with BCRL were diagnosed with PLE during follow-up. The goal of this study was to identify underlying risk factors of PLE that may lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

We revealed that the number of metastatic lymph nodes and body weight changes from presurgery to the onset of swelling, the maximal CD of both arms at the onset of swelling, and the largest CD during follow-up were strongly associated with PLE development. This study employed a cohort of 342 patients with BCRL and comprehensive records regarding the patients, treatments, and swelling characteristics, as well as potential confounding factors such as bilateral breast cancer, local recurrence, stage IV disease, and swelling after infection. The median 7- and 5-year follow-ups after surgery and after the onset of swelling, respectively, were longer than those in most related studies. The diagnosis of BCRL was reliably performed through patients' perceptions of arm swelling, observations by case managers and oncologists, and examination and repeated measurements by physiatrists.

### The treatment of lymphedema related to breast cancer: a systematic review and evidence summary [^117PkEax]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

To provide an evidence summary report on the question: What are the treatment options for women with lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer?

Methods

Cancer Care Ontario's Supportive Care Guidelines Group (SCGG) employed systematic review methodology to produce an evidence summary on this topic. Evidence-based opinions were formulated to guide clinical decision making, and a formal external review process was conducted to validate the relevance of these opinions for Ontario practitioners.

Results

The systematic review search strategy identified ten randomized controlled trials which form the basis of this evidence summary report. Four key opinions offered by the SCGG are outlined below. Responses from the practitioner feedback process supported the validity of these opinions in Ontario. (1) There is some evidence to suggest that compression therapy and manual lymphatic drainage may improve established lymphedema, but further studies are needed. Compression garments should be worn from morning to night and be removed at bedtime. Patients should be advised that lymphedema is a lifelong condition and that compression garments must be worn on a daily basis. Patients can expect stabilization and/or modest improvement of edema with the use of the garment in the prescribed fashion. (2) There is no current evidence to support the use of medical therapies, including diuretics. (3) Additional efforts to define relevant clinical outcomes for the assessment of patients with lymphedema would be valuable. (4) These opinions are appropriate for patients with more than mild lymphedema, where the signs and symptoms are considered significant from the patients' perspective.

### Current and future trends in lymphedema management: implications for women's health [^116eoyCg]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Breast cancer has served as a catalyst for improvements in lymphedema care and research for the last 20 years. Awareness must be extended to other instigating factors in light of shifting epidemiology. The aging population, obesity epidemic, and higher 5-year cancer survival rates are changing the face of lymphedema. Lymphedema patients are now older, heavier, and more medically complex. A higher proportion have nonbreast malignancies and advanced cancer. This article describes the current standard of care, as well as recent concessions for patient comfort, convenience, and economic reality. Primary prevention remains underemphasized. Patient education, timely diagnosis, and the early initiation of treatment represent important targets for improvement. Hopefully, new diagnostic tools for detecting subclinical lymphedema, identifying modifiable risk factors, and better understanding lymphedema pathogenesis will improve primary prevention and care.

Lymphedema diagnosis — clinical examination and imaging describe that clinical exam can be sufficient for characteristic presentations, with ultrasound broadly used for venous evaluation and selective confirmatory imaging in lower stages. It is stated that the diagnosis of Clinical Stage 2–3 lymphedema can be confidently made with clinical examination alone based on very characteristic findings. The page notes, "Ultrasound will be done in nearly all patients to evaluate the venous system", but also that evaluation for lower stage disease is "limited to centers of excellence". When invasive treatment or a research trial is planned, "an imaging or physiological test is required", and such information "is also valuable to help educate patients, encourage the use of compression, and to guide and assess treatment responses". For confirmatory testing, "Lymphoscintigraphy was the most commonly cited", though it "involves several hours of a patient's time" and intradermal radiotracer injection into the foot. Indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence lymphography "requires equipment that is currently only found in select lymphatic surgery centers", yet is "increasingly being used by lymphatic surgeons to refine assessment of the clinical stage, observe lymphatic function real-time, and localize lymphatic reflux and leak points".

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^116TJ2WF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, most commonly in the extremities, leading to swelling, limb heaviness, and susceptibility to infections, among other uncomfortable pathologies. This condition can develop in two main forms: primary lymphedema, which is typically caused by genetic factors, and secondary lymphedema, which often results from trauma, surgical procedures, or radiation therapy, especially related to cancer treatment.

The treatment of lymphedema can be separated into medical and surgical arms, which in the ideal setting, work synergistically to improve quality of life of patients with this debilitating condition. Medical therapies consist of a combination of weight management, physical therapy, compression garments, and avoidance of infection, while surgical options can include physiological and debulking procedures. With advancements in our understanding of lymphedema, we have enhanced our ability to provide a wider range of treatments and improve patient outcomes. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for lymphedema, highlighting recent therapeutic advances and clinical practices.

In the year preceding enrollment, 21 participants had a history of medical encounters for cellulitis. Seven events in six patients were recorded during the 52-week trial. This represented a reduction from 21.4% to 6.1% in cellulitis events (P < .0011).

Reduction in skin abnormalities

Although skin abnormalities in the lymphedematous limb will often be the focus for an individual patient, the number of patients with recorded skin assessments decreased substantially over time, resulting in wide 95% confidence intervals, and was not amenable to accurate statistical evaluation. Interesting observations are listed with the baseline and week 52 percentages. Hyperpigmentation/discoloration decreased from 75.4% to 40%. Ulceration/blisters decreased from 20.3% to 14.1%. Papilloma decreased from 5.8% to 2.4%. Finally, lymphorrhea decreased from 8% to 1.2%.

### Advances in lymphedema [^1166t8NC]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a common, complex, and inexplicably underappreciated human disease. Despite a history of relative neglect by health care providers and by governmental health care agencies, the last decade has seen an explosive growth of insights into, and approaches to, the problem of human lymphedema. The current review highlights the significant advances that have occurred in the investigative and clinical approaches to lymphedema, particularly over the last decade. This review summarizes the progress that has been attained in the realms of genetics, lymphatic imaging, and lymphatic surgery. Newer molecular insights are explored, along with their relationship to future molecular therapeutics. Growing insights into the relationships among lymphedema, obesity, and other comorbidities are important to consider in current and future responses to patients with lymphedema.

### Lymphedema surveillance and prevention [^111RTkhh]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphedema is a chronic condition, which can impact a person's quality of life and function. Identifying lymphedema at an early stage is key to preventing a person from developing chronic lymphedema. Physiatry can play an important role in education, identification of risk factors, performing prospective lymphedema surveillance programs, and prevention/treatment of lymphedema. Incorporating lymphedema surveillance programs into routine cancer care provides physiatry with the opportunity to assess additional rehabilitation and functional needs of a cancer patient.

The decision on whom to offer surgical interventions for lymphedema requires collaboration and input from all involved specialists and should address patients' expectations, invasiveness of procedures, and disease severity. There is no consensus on what constitutes success or failure of complex decongestive therapy and when to pursue surgical intervention. Surgery has the potential to fundamentally affect the pathophysiology of the disease state and can be a powerful tool when used correctly. The dogma of which surgery to offer for a given clinical situation has been undergoing revision and is an area of ongoing research.

### Arm symptom pattern among breast cancer survivors with and without lymphedema: a contemporaneous network analysis [^115nDoTj]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Identifying core symptoms and underlying mechanisms will guide efficient symptom management. Through network analysis, for the first time, we were able to examine core symptoms of arm symptoms in BCS, discovering tightness as core symptom for the LE group. Generally, we consider tightness, the sensation of increased skin tension due to lymphatic fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces, as a signal symptom for LEs. Hence, the results that tightness was the core symptom in LE network align with our expectation. To our surprise, tightness was also the most central symptom in the total sample network. We noticed that 23.4% of patients without LE reported tightness in our study. Supposing that this could be explained by the fact that patients with subclinical LE might have experienced the symptom of tightness even before exhibiting an increase in limb circumference. However, the current study could not distinguish patients with subclinical LE due to limited data from the parent studies, highlighting the need for further investigation. Stiffness categorized to the "Lymphatic Stasis" symptom cluster emerged as a core symptom with the highest predictability in non-LE symptom network. Previous evidence supported self-reported symptoms like tightness and stiffness as predictors for LE development, underscoring the importance of early detection and management. Core symptoms refer to the central symptoms that have the strongest connections with other symptoms in symptom networks. By understanding and targeting core symptoms, researchers and health care professionals can develop more effective interventions for managing and alleviating the overall arm symptomatology in BCS.

### Lymphedema: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations [^116gpPru]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited.

### Impact of secondary lymphedema after head and neck cancer treatment on symptoms, functional status, and quality of life [^114khYtW]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema may disrupt local function and affect quality of life (QOL) in patients with head and neck cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations among severity of internal and external lymphedema, symptoms, functional status, and QOL in patients with head and neck cancer.

Methods

The sample included 103 patients who were ≥ 3 months after head and neck cancer treatment. Variables assessed included severity of internal and external lymphedema, physical/psychological symptoms, functional status, and QOL.

Results

Severity of internal and external lymphedema was associated with physical symptoms and psychological symptoms. Patients with more severe external lymphedema were more likely to have a decrease in neck left/right rotation. The combined effects of external and internal lymphedema severity were associated with hearing impairment and decreased QOL.

Conclusions

Lymphedema severity correlates with symptom burden, functional status, and QOL in patients after head and neck cancer treatment.

### Arm symptom pattern among breast cancer survivors with and without lymphedema: a contemporaneous network analysis [^111RWjsh]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Radiotherapy was associated with severe arm symptoms, consistent with previous reports. Nevertheless, no significant differences were detected in network differences between groups (radiation vs nonradiation). RNI has been identified as a contributing factor for lymphedema. However, this study could not offer additional insights into the relationship between RNI and arm symptoms due to the limited data available. Future research should investigate the association of RNI with arm symptom networks. In addition, post-surgery duration was associated with the severity of arm symptoms, consistent with the findings of Nielsen et al. This result could be explained by the fact that BCRL is an uncured and progressive complication that most commonly occurs between 3 and 5 years post-surgery. Without timely treatment, the severity of symptoms increases and the number of lymphedema cases accumulates.

Post-surgery years showed a weak but positive correlation with arm-swelling in the symptom network (r = 0.18). Despite the weak correlation, this finding underscores the importance of long-term follow-up, continuous monitoring, and support for patients with breast cancer following surgery to prevent and manage arm-swelling and other potential arm symptoms. Clinicians should be aware that arm-swelling is an early sign and primary symptom of BCRL, which requires early detection and management. However, the weak correlation constrained the confidence in the findings, underscoring the need for future validation studies, particularly those with longitudinal designs.

Our results emphasize the importance for clinicians working with BCS to prioritize the long-term follow-up and continuous assessment and management of arm symptoms. It highlights the need for attention to arm symptoms even in survivors who may not fully meet the diagnostic criteria for LE. Special attention should be paid to survivors receiving ALND, RT, and a longer post-surgery duration who are more likely to suffer from arm symptoms. Based on the symptom clusters identified, a rapid assessment can be conducted to determine the primary symptom concerns in patients, facilitating targeted care. Additionally, the core symptoms should be prioritized when developing symptom management strategies, to increase the efficacy of interventions. Patient education on self-monitoring and reporting any changes in arm symptoms might help with early detection and management.

### GOG 244-the lymphEdema and gynecologic cancer (LEG) study: the association between the gynecologic cancer lymphedema questionnaire (GCLQ) and lymphedema of the lower extremity (LLE) [^111zdKBe]. Gynecologic Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore whether patient-reported lymphedema-related symptoms, as measured by the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire (GCLQ), are associated with a patient-reported diagnosis of lymphedema of the lower extremity (LLE) and limb volume change (LVC) in patients who have undergone radical surgery, including lymphadenectomy, for endometrial, cervical, or vulvar cancer on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study 244.

Methods

Patients completed the baseline and at least one post-surgery GCLQ and LVC assessment. The 20-item GCLQ measures seven symptom clusters-aching, heaviness, infection-related, numbness, physical functioning, general swelling, and limb swelling. LLE was defined as a patient self-reported LLE diagnosis on the GCLQ. LVC was measured by volume calculations based on circumferential measurements. A linear mixed model was fitted for change in symptom cluster scores and GCLQ total score and adjusted for disease sites and assessment time.

Results

Of 987 eligible patients, 894 were evaluable (endometrial, 719; cervical, 136; vulvar, 39). Of these, 14% reported an LLE diagnosis (endometrial, 11%; cervical, 18%; vulvar, 38%). Significantly more patients diagnosed versus not diagnosed with LLE reported ≥ 4-point increase from baseline on the GCLQ total score (p < 0.001). Changes from baseline were significantly larger on all GCLQ symptom cluster scores in patients with LLE compared to those without LLE. An LVC increment of > 10% was significantly associated with reported general swelling (p < 0.001), heaviness (p = 0.005), infection-related symptoms (p = 0.002), and physical function (p = 0.006).

Conclusions

Patient-reported symptoms, as measured by the GCLQ, discerned those with and without a patient-reported LLE diagnosis and demonstrated predictive value. The GCLQ combined with LVC may enhance our ability to identify LLE.

Nature of the disease.

Larval forms of Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori are transmitted to humans by different species of mosquitoes, depending on world region. Lymphatic vessels are damaged by the presence of adult worms, causing lymphedema that worsens with age. Lymphedema is generally considered an adult condition, but damage to lymph vessels from filarial infection can begin in childhood. The progressive worsening of lymphedema is not inevitable; rather it is accelerated by recurrent episodes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA), disabling bouts of fever and intense pain lasting several days that are caused by bacterial infections. These infections generally enter the lower limbs where the skin is damaged by wounds or interdigital fungal infections.

Each episode of ADLA further damages the lymph system and contributes to progression of chronic lymphedema, the severity of which has been classified into seven stages by Dreyer and others. In stage 1, lymphedema is generally relieved by limb elevation overnight. By stage 7, lymphedema is characterized by deep skin folds, knobs or protrusions, mossy lesions, interdigital lesions, and bad odor; the lymphedema usually extends above the knee and prevents activities of daily living. Worsening lymphedema increases vulnerability to entry lesions that lead to ADLA, which in turn worsens lymphedema. Several studies confirm the higher incidence of ADLA at higher stages of lymphedema,–but others do not.–Nevertheless, "[t]he epidemiologic association between ADLA frequency and stage, as well as extensive clinical experience from both filariasis-endemic and non-endemic areas, strongly suggest that ADLA episodes are a major — likely the most important — factor in lymphedema progression, particularly in filariasis-endemic areas".

### Cancer-associated secondary lymphoedema [^116AcbVG]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Lymphoedema is an oedematous condition with a specific and complex tissue biology. In the clinical context of cancer, the pathogenesis of lymphoedema ensues most typically from the modalities employed to stage and treat the cancer (in particular, surgery and radiotherapy). Despite advances in cancer treatment, lifelong lymphoedema (limb swelling and the accompanying chronic inflammatory processes) affects approximately one in seven individuals treated for cancer, although estimates of lymphoedema prevalence following cancer treatment vary widely depending upon the diagnostic criteria used and the duration of follow-up. The natural history of cancer-associated lymphoedema is defined by increasing limb girth, fibrosis, inflammation, abnormal fat deposition and eventual marked cutaneous pathology, which also increases the risk of recurrent skin infections. Lymphoedema can substantially affect the daily quality of life of patients, as, in addition to aesthetic concerns, it can cause discomfort and affect the ability to carry out daily tasks. Clinical diagnosis is dependent on comparison of the affected region with the equivalent region on the unaffected side and, if available, with pre-surgical measurements. Surveillance is indicated in this high-risk population to facilitate disease detection at the early stages, when therapeutic interventions are most effective. Treatment modalities include conservative physical strategies that feature complex decongestive therapy (including compression garments) and intermittent pneumatic compression, as well as an emerging spectrum of surgical interventions, including liposuction for late-stage disease. The future application of pharmacological and microsurgical therapeutics for cancer-associated lymphoedema holds great promise.

### Breast cancer: prevention of… [^111AsfkR]. NCI (2008). Low credibility.

Lymphedema –Health Professional Version Overview Lymphedema occurs when disruption of normal lymphatic drainage leads to accumulation of protein-rich lymph fluid in the interstitial space. Cancer survivors who experience lymphedema report poor physical functioning, impaired ability to engage in normal activities of daily living, and increased psychological distress. Gynecological Cancers A cohort study supports the evidence that a significant proportion of women experience lower-limb lymphedema after treatment of gynecological cancer or colorectal cancer. The highest prevalence among ovarian cancer survivors, followed by endometrial cancer survivors and colorectal cancer survivors. In another smaller, single-institution, retrospective study of 66 patients who underwent therapeutic nodal dissection, the rate of permanent lymphedema for inguinal node dissection was 38%, compared with 12% for axillary node dissection.

Another potentially relevant variable is the type of dissection. A 2017 systematic review did not find an appreciable difference between the rate of lymphedema after therapeutic lymphadenectomy and completion of lymph node sampling after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. In both instances, the rate was around 20%. In stage II patients, there was soft tissue fibrosis and adipose tissue hypertrophy. The lymphatics were tortuous and dilated, with areas of dermal backflow and regeneration. In stage III patients, the lymphatics were unrecognizable, and there was confluent dermal backflow. The soft tissue fibrosis was more advanced. MRL is safe, feasible, and provides high anatomical detail. However, its role in lymphedema diagnosis remains to be determined.
- **Stage 0**: This stage, referred to as subclinical lymphedema, is characterized by impaired lymph flow.
- **Stage I**: This stage is spontaneously reversible and typically marked by pitting edema, an increase in upper-extremity girth, and heaviness.
- **Stage II**: This moderate stage is characterized by a spongy consistency of the tissue without signs of pitting edema. Tissue fibrosis can then cause the limbs to harden and increase in size. The swelling at this stage is mostly fluid.
- **Stage III**: In the most advanced stage, swelling is mostly secondary to fat hypertrophy, so there is no pitting edema.

### Immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower-limb lymphedema [^111oAvek]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze pre- and post-intervention changes in lower-limb volume, general symptoms, and skin symptoms. Analysis of variance using linear mixed-effect modeling was used to compare the effects of three interventions (high-load AECT, low-load AECT, and CT) and time (periods 1, 2, and 3). Least square mean (LSM) changes in lower-limb volume and percentage changes in VAS scores for general symptoms (pain and heaviness) and skin symptoms (skin stiffness and pitting edema) were used to gauge effects of the intervention. Spearman's rank correlation was used to compare the severity of pre-intervention skin symptoms (skin stiffness and pitting edema) with decrements in lower-limb volume.

Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the Statistics version 19 software (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL).

Skin symptoms: skin stiffness and pitting edema

Although no significant improvement of skin stiffness (high-load AECT, P = 0.16; low-load AECT, P = 1.00; and CT, P = 1.00) was seen with any interventions from pre- to post-intervention, a significant difference in pitting edema (high-load AECT, P = 0.03; low-load AECT, P < 0.05; CT, P = 0.03) was observed with all interventions.

No significant differences in LSM percentage change in skin stiffness or pitting between the three interventions (P = 0.47 and P = 0.84) (Table 1) and periods (P = 0.47 and P = 0.42) were observed.

Figure 2 shows that the severity of pre-intervention skin stiffness correlated significantly with changes in lower-limb volume with high-load (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and low-load AECT (r = 0.53, P < 0.01), but not with CT (r = −0.04, P = 0.86), while severity of pre-intervention pitting correlated significantly with changes in lower-limb volume under high-load (r = 0.47, P = 0.02) and low-load AECT (r = 0.45, P = 0.03), but not under CT (r = −0.31, P = 0.15).

### Manual lymphatic drainage for lymphedema following breast cancer treatment [^1119puNe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

More than one in five patients who undergo treatment for breast cancer will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). BCRL can occur as a result of breast cancer surgery and/or radiation therapy. BCRL can negatively impact comfort, function, and quality of life (QoL). Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a type of hands-on therapy, is frequently used for BCRL and often as part of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT is a fourfold conservative treatment which includes MLD, compression therapy (consisting of compression bandages, compression sleeves, or other types of compression garments), skin care, and lymph-reducing exercises (LREs). Phase 1 of CDT is to reduce swelling; Phase 2 is to maintain the reduced swelling.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of MLD in treating BCRL.

Search Methods

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform), and Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register from root to 24 May 2013. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of women with BCRL. The intervention was MLD. The primary outcomes were (1) volumetric changes, (2) adverse events. Secondary outcomes were (1) function, (2) subjective sensations, (3) QoL, (4) cost of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on three volumetric outcomes. (1) LE (lymphedema) volume was defined as the amount of excess fluid left in the arm after treatment, calculated as volume in mL of affected arm post-treatment minus unaffected arm post-treatment. (2) Volume reduction was defined as the amount of fluid reduction in mL from before to after treatment calculated as the pretreatment LE volume of the affected arm minus the post-treatment LE volume of the affected arm. (3) Per cent reduction was defined as the proportion of fluid reduced relative to the baseline excess volume, calculated as volume reduction divided by baseline LE volume multiplied by 100. We entered trial data into Review Manger 5.2 (RevMan), pooled data using a fixed-effect model, and analyzed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also explored subgroups to determine whether mild BCRL compared to moderate or severe BCRL, and BCRL less than a year compared to more than a year was associated with a better response to MLD.

Main Results

Six trials were included. Based on similar designs, trials clustered in three categories.(1) MLD + standard physiotherapy versus standard physiotherapy (one trial) showed significant improvements in both groups from baseline but no significant between-groups differences for per cent reduction.(2) MLD + compression bandaging versus compression bandaging (two trials) showed significant per cent reductions of 30% to 38.6% for compression bandaging alone, and an additional 7.11% reduction for MLD (MD 7.11%, 95% CI 1.75% to 12.47%; two RCTs; 83 participants). Volume reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.06). LE volume was not significant. Subgroup analyses was significant showing that participants with mild-to-moderate BCRL were better responders to MLD than were moderate-to-severe participants.(3) MLD + compression therapy versus nonMLD treatment + compression therapy (three trials) were too varied to pool. One of the trials compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus pneumatic pump. Volume reduction was statistically significant favoring MLD (MD 47.00 mL, 95% CI 15.25 mL to 78.75 mL; 1 RCT; 24 participants), per cent reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.07), and LE volume was not significant. A second trial compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus self-administered simple lymphatic drainage (SLD), and was significant for MLD for LE volume (MD -230.00 mL, 95% CI -450.84 mL to -9.16 mL; 1 RCT; 31 participants) but not for volume reduction or per cent reduction. A third trial of MLD + compression bandaging versus SLD + compression bandaging was not significant (P = 0.10) for per cent reduction, the only outcome measured (MD 11.80%, 95% CI -2.47% to 26.07%, 28 participants).MLD was well tolerated and safe in all trials. Two trials measured function as range of motion with conflicting results. One trial reported significant within-groups gains for both groups, but no between-groups differences. The other trial reported there were no significant within-groups gains and did not report between-groups results. One trial measured strength and reported no significant changes in either group. Two trials measured QoL, but results were not usable because one trial did not report any results, and the other trial did not report between-groups results. Four trials measured sensations such as pain and heaviness. Overall, the sensations were significantly reduced in both groups over baseline, but with no between-groups differences. No trials reported cost of care. Trials were small ranging from 24 to 45 participants. Most trials appeared to randomize participants adequately. However, in four trials the person measuring the swelling knew what treatment the participants were receiving, and this could have biased results.

Authors' Conclusions

MLD is safe and may offer additional benefit to compression bandaging for swelling reduction. Compared to individuals with moderate-to-severe BCRL, those with mild-to-moderate BCRL may be the ones who benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by randomized data. In trials where MLD and sleeve were compared with a nonMLD treatment and sleeve, volumetric outcomes were inconsistent within the same trial. Research is needed to identify the most clinically meaningful volumetric measurement, to incorporate newer technologies in LE assessment, and to assess other clinically relevant outcomes such as fibrotic tissue formation. Findings were contradictory for function (range of motion), and inconclusive for quality of life. For symptoms such as pain and heaviness, 60% to 80% of participants reported feeling better regardless of which treatment they received. One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling had been reduced, participants were likely to keep their swelling down if they continued to use a custom-made sleeve.

### Longitudinal effects of a novel advanced pneumatic compression device on patient-reported outcomes in the management of cancer-related head and neck lymphedema: a preliminary report [^116tnUvV]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

After completing treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC), patients frequently report having difficulty swallowing, chewing, and breathing, as well as decreased range of motion. 1, 2 This constellation of symptoms has largely been attributed to the effects of surgery and radiation; however, these symptoms are also common in head and neck lymphedema (HNL). HNL develops most commonly as a secondary effect of cancer and its treatment. 3 Treatments for HNC, including surgery and radiation, disrupt lymphatic structures that are highly concentrated in treated areas and damage surrounding soft tissues thereby increasing the risk for development of lymphedema. 4, 5, 6 HNL may also arise as a result of disruption of lymphatic transport by the tumor itself. 3, 4, 5

Improved cancer treatments and shifts in disease epidemiology 7, 8, 9 have contributed to a recent escalation in the number of HNC survivors, with a corresponding need for additional resources focused on managing the long‐term and late effects of this disease and its treatments. 5, 10, 11 Two recent U.S.‐based studies have found that secondary lymphedema occurs in a majority of patients with HNC, with posttreatment prevalence rates of 75% and 90%, respectively 4, 5 Unlike prior reports, these studies used comprehensive lymphedema assessment measures to identify lymphedema occurring internally, externally, and as combined occurrence rates.

### Quality of life and a symptom cluster associated with breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema [^114yNSbZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare quality of life and symptoms between breast cancer survivors who have developed and undergone treatment for chronic lymphedema with those who have not developed lymphedema.

Patients and Methods

The cross-sectional, mixed-methods design included 64 breast cancer survivors with lymphedema and 64 breast cancer survivors without lymphedema. Variables assessed quantitatively included sociodemographic information, medical data, body mass index (BMI), arm extracellular fluid volume, quality of life (QOL), and physical and emotional symptoms. For the qualitative component, individuals with lymphedema responded in writing to the question: During the past week what other difficulties have you experienced because of your lymphedema?

Results

Compared with those without lymphedema, breast cancer survivors with lymphedema reported poorer QOL. A symptom cluster that included alteration in limb sensation, loss of confidence in body, decreased physical activity, fatigue, and psychological distress was identified. Perception of limb size influenced the cumulative symptom experience more than objective arm volume. Qualitative data revealed multiple QOL, physical health, and psychological concerns. BMI correlated with multiple outcomes.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that current lymphedema treatments, although beneficial, may not provide complete relief of symptoms associated with lymphedema and complementary interventions are needed. The poorer QOL in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema may relate to the presence of an untreated symptom cluster.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^116FGmZ3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness of treating individuals with LF lymphedema.

It is most important these days that both individuals with lymphedema and the health systems caring for them recognize that lymphedema is a condition that responds to good treatment. Indeed, although quantifying the effectiveness of implementing the EPC is an issue currently in need of improved long-term data, there is little doubt that implementing the EPC can be effective in preventing, or at least slowing, the worsening of lymphedematous changes, resulting in almost complete remission in low-stage cases. The EPC also has the important effect of reducing the number and severity of acute attacks and the severe consequences they can have. Although the continuing use of anthelminthic agents, at least in early infections, is also believed to be important, improvement associated with the EPC is most dramatic in those with shorter duration and lower stage conditions, though it can be seen even in patients with high-stage lymphedema.

Considering approaches used in treating non-LF associated lymphedemas.

It is valuable for those providing lymphedema care in LF-endemic countries to be aware of the approaches to lymphedema care in non–LF-endemic countries, particularly so that they might expand the range of care they currently provide if new strategies look to be safe, practical, and of benefit to the patients.

Because lymphedema is a disease caused by lymphatic functional insufficiency, the changes in affected tissues bear similarities across multiple causes. Use of treatments such as lymph node removal and radiation therapy for cancer is the greatest cause of lymphedema in affluent countries, and considerable research has been conducted on arm lymphedema among women who have undergone treatment of breast cancer. Although the incidence of breast malignancy continues to rise, the number of women experiencing arm lymphedema has significantly declined because of both an increase in the awareness of lymphedema among primary healthcare professionals (which has led to the use of lymph node–conserving surgery) and implementation of a prospective surveillance model for breast cancer patients, leading to the prevention of new lymphedema cases.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^114R134s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

AREAS WHERE RESEARCH IS NEEDED

Improving the overall strategy for care of those with lymphedema is particularly challenging when targeting patients with filarial lymphedema who often live in areas with minimal access to medical care. The need for new investigations falls principally into two categories: those targeting better individual treatment and evaluation for affected individuals and those focused on improving program management for the provision of care to affected populations.

Research aimed at improving lymphedema treatment in affected individuals.

Important questions related to individual patients are highlighted in Table 3, including the following:

Table 3
Priority needs for research aimed at improving treatment of lymphedema in affected individuals

Pathogenesis.

Because strategies for improving lymphedema therapy are likely to emerge from a better understanding of the disease itself, study of its pathogenesis and immunopathology in animal models and human patients is essential; it is, however, also important to study patients with lymphedema of nonparasite etiology to identify potential new targets or mechanisms that could improve treatment of lymphedema from any cause, especially in the early stages of the condition. Indeed, it is incumbent on those focused on lymphedema due to LF to also be aware of research and improvements being developed for nonfilarial lymphedema as well.

Improved clinical tools.

Importantly, increased understanding of both the pathogenesis of lymphedema and its clinical response to treatments requires development of better tools to assess and monitor changes in individual patients. For example, assessing a lymphedematous limb using new noninvasive imaging technologies (e.g. thermography and magnetic resonance imaging,) can help to relate observed changes to ongoing clinical signs and symptoms; indeed, repeated observations over time are likely to be particularly informative compared with assessments made just at single time points. Investigating the dermal changes using newer noninvasive techniques such as optical coherence tomography are likely to be informative, especially as standard dermal biopsies are ill-advised owing to the altered healing processes present in lymphedematous skin.

### Cancer related lymphedema [^111XiJBv]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lymphedema is a prevalent, incurable, and morbid condition with the potential to degrade the health and quality of life of patients living with cancer and beyond cancer. Effective long term control requires coordination by an interdisciplinary team to ensure that lymphedema progression, complications, and related disablement are detected and appropriately addressed. This review provides an overview of lymphatic function and lymphedema pathogenesis with focused discussion of the unique characteristics of cancer related lymphedema (CRL) including natural history, clinical presentation, and risk factors for onset and progression. Surgical practice changes and supportive evidence for lymph node sparing and lymphatic reconstruction for CRL prevention are described. The review outlines evaluations to diagnose, stage, and monitor CRL, and characterizes evidence for current CRL prevention and management practices, including surgeries to restore lymphatic function. Multimodal management with complete decongestive therapy remains first line treatment for CRL, though patient-specific customization might be required to optimize patients' clinical response and quality of life as outlined in the review.

### Longitudinal effects of a novel advanced pneumatic compression device on patient-reported outcomes in the management of cancer-related head and neck lymphedema: a preliminary report [^114RDTzq]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

HNL typically manifests as clinically evident soft‐tissue swelling in the region affected by HNC treatment. 12 In contrast to other forms of lymphedema, HNL often occurs directly within treated tissue as well as distally. 12 Localized accumulation of high‐protein fluid triggers a progressive inflammatory process that often leads to tissue fibrosis, discomfort, disfigurement, functional impairments, and recurrent infections. 10, 13 However, whereas fibrosis is commonly associated with advanced lymphedema in the extremities, 14 fibrosis often manifests in patients with HNC early in cancer therapy independent of or in conjunction with tissue swelling. 12 Although acute swelling in patients with HNC may resolve, 6 lymphedema and/or fibrosis are both present in the vast majority of HNC patients 3‐6 months posttreatment. 5, 12 Over time, their combined effects cause significant tissue changes that make treatment more difficult. 5, 12 HNL may develop internally, in structures such as the larynx and pharynx, and/or externally in the skin and soft tissues of the face and neck. 4, 5, 6 Given its distinct characteristics and challenges, HNL requires careful documentation of site‐specific tissue changes and patient‐reported symptoms, as well as modifications to traditional lymphedema management practices. 12, 15

### Heavy-load lifting: acute response in breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema [^111dTtdx]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Equivalence was also established for all assessed BCRL symptoms at all time points, and although fluctuations beyond the predetermined thresholds were observed, it should be highlighted that the majority (82%) of these deviations indicated reductions in severity after resistance exercise with both intensities. This is relevant because symptoms can be the earliest indicator of an ensuing BCRL.

When interpreting the findings, several limitations should be considered. In this study, participants were excluded if they presented with evidence of BCRL according to standardized protocols for BIS (L-Dex > 10) or visual inspection. It is, however, possible that these women were experiencing transient increases in extracellular fluid, either as a consequence of surgery or in response to chemotherapy, and/or may have been at greatest risk for developing BCRL. As such, these women may have been more likely than those included in the study to demonstrate changes in extracellular fluid, and by excluding them, it may have been easier to find equivalence between loads. Moreover, activities undertaken by participants within the 3 d after the bout of low- or high-load resistance may have influenced data collected at 24 or 72 h post–exercise session. However, participants were advised to maintain normal activities throughout the study period, and efforts were made to standardize treatment burden by placing exercise bouts and consecutive data collections between chemotherapy cycles.

### Breast cancer survivors' experiences of lymphedema-related symptoms [^113Mop9R]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Context

As a serious chronic condition from breast cancer treatment, lymphedema or a syndrome of persistent swelling and symptoms is caused by chronic accumulation of lymph fluid in the interstitial spaces of the affected limb or surrounding areas. Although significant prevalence of ongoing multiple symptoms has been reported, little is known about how survivors with lymphedema perceive and respond to lymphedema-related symptoms in their daily lives.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to explore and describe breast cancer survivors' lymphedema-related symptom experiences.

Methods

This study used a descriptive phenomenological method. Thirty-four participants were recruited in the United States. Three in-depth interviews were conducted with each participant; a total of 102 interviews were completed, audio taped, and transcribed. Interview transcripts and field notes were the data sources for this analysis, which was part of three larger studies. Data were analyzed to identify the essential themes within and across cases.

Results

Four essential themes were revealed: living with perpetual discomfort, confronting the unexpected, losing pre-lymphedema being, and feeling handicapped. Participants experienced multiple symptoms on a daily basis. Distress was heightened when women expected symptoms to disappear, but instead, they remained as a "perpetual discomfort". Moreover, distress was intensified when symptoms evoked unexpected situations or when symptoms elicited emotional responses powerful enough to change perceived personal identity.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that symptom distress may encompass temporal, situational, and attributive dimensions. Prospective studies are needed to examine lymphedema-related symptom distress in terms of these dimensions so that more specific interventions can be developed to target distress occurring in each dimension.

### Are we underestimating breast cancer-related lymphedema? The impact of diagnostic thresholds and compression therapy [^111mPxzG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is commonly diagnosed using limb volume criteria; however, diagnostic thresholds vary and lack empirical validation. This variability may lead to underdiagnosis, particularly in patients using compression garments that can reduce limb size.

Objective

This study evaluated how different diagnostic criteria and compression therapy influence the reported incidence of BCRL.

Methods

A single-institution analysis was conducted on 165 female patients with breast cancer originally enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing axillary lymph node dissection with and without immediate lymphatic reconstruction from 2020 to 2025. Limb volumes were measured preoperatively and at 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. BCRL incidence was assessed using 5%, 10%, and 15% thresholds for relative volume change (RVC) and interlimb volume difference. The Upper Limb Lymphedema-27 (ULL-27) questionnaire evaluated symptoms. Compression use was evaluated to determine the effect on BCRL incidence.

Results

BCRL incidence varied by threshold, from 55.8% at 5% RVC to 12.1% at 15% RVC. ULL-27 scores indicated comparable symptom burdens between patients meeting volume-based diagnostic criteria and those wearing compression garments but not meeting volume criteria. Both groups had significantly worse physical domain scores than patients without volume changes or compression use (P < 0.001). Including compression users who did not meet volume criteria increased the incidence of BCRL across all thresholds (e.g., 23.6% to 41.8% at 10% RVC).

Conclusions

BCRL incidence varied markedly by volume-based diagnostic thresholds, and inclusion of compression users significantly increased reported rates. Relying solely on volume thresholds may miss symptomatic patients. Integrating compression use and patient-reported outcomes can better identify clinically meaningful BCRL.

### Lymphedema: a comprehensive review [^111xYXvT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema is a chronic, debilitating condition that has traditionally been seen as refractory or incurable. Recent years have brought new advances in the study of lymphedema pathophysiology, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic tools that are changing this perspective.

Objective

To provide a systematic approach to evaluating and managing patients with lymphedema.

Methods

We performed MEDLINE searches of the English-language literature (1966 to March 2006) using the terms lymphedema, breast cancer-associated lymphedema, lymphatic complications, lymphatic imaging, decongestive therapy, and surgical treatment of lymphedema. Relevant bibliographies and International Society of Lymphology guidelines were also reviewed.

Results

In the United States, the populations primarily affected by lymphedema are patients undergoing treatment of malignancy, particularly women treated for breast cancer. A thorough evaluation of patients presenting with extremity swelling should include identification of prior surgical or radiation therapy for malignancy, as well as documentation of other risk factors for lymphedema, such as prior trauma to or infection of the affected limb. Physical examination should focus on differentiating signs of lymphedema from other causes of systemic or localized swelling. Lymphatic dysfunction can be visualized through lymphoscintigraphy; the diagnosis of lymphedema can also be confirmed through other imaging modalities, including CT or MRI. The mainstay of therapy in diagnosed cases of lymphedema involves compression garment use, as well as intensive bandaging and lymphatic massage. For patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy, several surgical options with varied proven efficacies have been used in appropriate candidates, including excisional approaches, microsurgical lymphatic anastomoses, and circumferential suction-assisted lipectomy, an approach that has shown promise for long-term relief of symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of lymphedema requires careful attention to patient risk factors and specific findings on physical examination. Noninvasive diagnostic tools and lymphatic imaging can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of lymphedema or to address a challenging clinical presentation. Initial treatment with decongestive lymphatic therapy can provide significant improvement in patient symptoms and volume reduction of edematous extremities. Selected patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy can achieve similar outcomes with surgical intervention, most promisingly suction-assisted lipectomy.

### Current understanding of pathological mechanisms of lymphedema [^115fa3ts]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Lymphedema is a common disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide with significant financial and social burdens. Despite increasing prevalence and associated morbidities, the mainstay treatment of lymphedema is largely palliative without an effective cure due to incomplete understanding of the disease. Recent Advances: Recent studies have described key histological and pathological processes that contribute to the progression of lymphedema, including lymphatic stasis, inflammation, adipose tissue deposition, and fibrosis. This review aims to highlight cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in each of these pathological processes. Critical Issues: Despite recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of lymphedema, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the disease remains elusive due to its complex nature. Future Directions: Additional research is needed to gain a better insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of lymphedema, which will guide the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific pathology of the disease.

Quality of life.

Because there is as yet no LF-specific disability assessment tool to capture the unique challenges faced by these patients, we opted to use the WHODAS 2.0 assessment to measure QoL at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months, because it has been shown to be a generally valid and sensitive tool for assessing LF-related disability. Although some studies have reported that severity of disease, occurrence of acute episodes, and extent of lower limb involvement appear to have an appreciable impact on the overall well-being of patients with LE, we did not find significant reductions or changes in the QoL of our participants over the observation period of this study. Rather, we found mean QoL scores that remained relatively constant throughout the study duration (Figure 6A) and with no discernible differences when analyzed by gender, age, or LE stage, as previously reported. However, in line with other groups' findings, there was a positive correlation between QoL and body weight, indicating that with an increase in weight there is a decrease in the lived QoL (estimate: 0.06; P = 0.0232). Even more importantly, it could be seen here also that an ADL episode during the previous 6 months had a negative impact on QoL (estimate: 17.16; P < 0.0001), as was the case if both legs were affected at baseline (estimate: 2.61, P = 0.004). The reasons for the lack of significant differences in QoL across various demographic features of our study population could relate to the population's specific cultural and social factors or to the technical tools used to investigate the issues. In either case, the burden of lymphatic disease on affected people and populations is so significant that it remains incumbent on research investigators to create the tools and strategies for care that are necessary to address such challenges more successfully in the future.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^112kLTkF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitoring impact and progress of MMDP programs.

Successful MMDP programs have been established in many countries (e.g. Brazil, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam), and these are documented through their formal achievement of the WHO's criteria for verification of "elimination of LF as a public health problem". However, the tools currently available for monitoring the progress of MMDP programs remain relatively crude (i.e. recording the number of lymphedema patients identified, the number of local healthcare facilities enlisted and trained for service delivery, the quality of the services assessed, and for hydroceles, the number of surgeries performed). Unfortunately, there is no simple indicator of the impact that these activities might be having. Although research has shown that hygiene protocols do reduce the likelihood of lymphedema progression in most patients and in many cases improve the lymphedema and reduce both the frequency and intensity of acute attacks, charting the changes in individuals over time would, if available, be critical new information of value not only to the patient but also for demonstrating both programmatic impact and, importantly, the reduction or complete absence of new cases after successful implementation of the MDA. The ideal approaches and indicators to follow have yet to be defined, but determining the optimal indicators for use in an endemic setting is an important research goal for the program. As described previously (ref.), these might include the number of new cases that have developed after successful reduction in transmission in an area and measures of patient mobility and capability to carry out physical activities (often those related to earning an income), along with the more commonly measured changes in lymphedema stage and ADL frequency and severity. An increase in the ability of wounds in the skin of the affected limb to heal may also be an important indicator of improvement based on the observations of a reduction in dermal healing that has occurred in untreated cases (C. D. Mackenzie, unpublished data). Further investigation into this issue is needed to determine the usefulness of this parameter as an indicator of improvement.

### Lymphedema: diagnostic workup and management [^115XEHwz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. It is caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is a chronic progressive disease with serious physical and psychosocial implications. It can be challenging to diagnose, especially in obese patients and in those with coexisting venous disease. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, lymphedema management, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. There are currently no standard guidelines for the diagnosis of lymphedema. There is no cure yet for lymphedema, and the objective for management is to limit disease progression and prevent complications.

### Current views on diagnostic approach and treatment of lymphedema [^112EEUW6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition. Primary lymphedema is a lymphatic malformation developing during the later stage of lymphangiogenesis. Secondary lymphedema is the result of obstruction or disruption of the lymphatic system, which can occur as a consequence of tumors, surgery, trauma, infection, inflammation, and radiation therapy. In this review, we report an update upon the diagnostic approach and the medical and surgical therapy for both primary and secondary lymphedema.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^116Df2kY]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to these primary types, lymphedema can be further sub-categorized into different stages. The International Society of Lymphology categorizes these stages as follows. In Stage 0 lymphedema, there are no signs readily apparent in a clinical examination, although there is still abnormal lymphatic flow and drainage. Stage 1 is characterized by mild swelling which can be mitigated by limb elevation; pitting may also be present at this stage. Stage 2 lymphedema can no longer be alleviated by limb elevation. Early phases of Stage 2 are also characterized by pitting edema, while late phases of Stage 2 may or may not involve pitting but do result in fibrosis and irreversible damage to the tissue. Stage 3 consists of lymphostatic elephantiasis, the most severe form of lymphedema. At this point, swelling is extreme, resulting in large limbs and trophic skin changes, such as leathery, and potentially warty, skin.

Although, in many instances, lymphedema can be diagnosed through physical examination, its manifestation cannot be confirmed without the use of a more specific diagnostic test, typically one that is imaging-based. This confirmation can be especially important in improving patient outcomes because lymphedema is often misdiagnosed in initial screenings. In fact, a 2011 study by Schook et al. found that approximately one-fourth of all pediatric patients referred to their clinic with "lymphedema" were suffering from a different condition. A 2015 study by Maclellan et al. noted a similar prevalence of initial misdiagnosis in a pediatric and adult patient population. The use of diagnostic tests can also help illustrate the pathophysiology of each patient's lymphedema, helping stage the disease and affecting treatment choice.

The current "gold-standard" for diagnosis confirmation is lymphoscintigraphy. If the lymphatics are functioning normally, then the colloid will be taken up by lymphatic vessels and drain to downstream nodes. Lymphoscintigraphy can be used qualitatively or quantitatively to assess lymphatic function. Qualitative approaches rely on making a diagnosis based on visual assessment of lymphatic vasculature and nodes, and their ability to uptake the radiotracer. In contrast, quantitative approaches utilize the use of more defined metrics such as time of uptake and clearance of the radiotracer from the limb of interest or from the injection site.

### Lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: incidence, degree, time course, treatment, and symptoms [^116s5Lrh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the incidence, degree, time course, treatment, and symptoms of lymphedema in breast cancer survivors.

Methods

We conducted a 5-year, population-based prospective study of 631 randomly selected Philadelphia and Delaware County, Pennsylvania female residents with incident breast cancer who were diagnosed from 1999 to 2001. Using a questionnaire previously validated against physical therapists' measurement-based clinical criteria, we assigned a score indicating the degree of lymphedema (none, mild, or moderate/severe) to each month of follow-up based on the respondent's perceived differences in hand/arm size. Standard survival analysis methods permitted maximum use of follow-up.

Results

Five-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 42 (42%) per 100 women. Among the 238 affected women, lymphedema first occurred within 2 years of diagnosis in 80% and within 3 years in 89%. Among 433 women observed for 3 years, 23% reported no more than mild lymphedema, 12% reported moderate/severe lymphedema, and 2% reported chronically moderate/severe lymphedema. Women with mild lymphedema were more than three times more likely to develop moderate/severe lymphedema than women with no lymphedema. Thirty-seven percent of women with mild lymphedema and 68% with moderate/severe lymphedema received treatment. Increasing proportions of women with increasing degree of lymphedema reported symptoms (eg, jewelry too tight, tired/thick/heavy arm). Symptoms present before the first occurrence of lymphedema were associated with a higher probability of later lymphedema (eg, hazard ratio for jewelry too tight = 7.37; 95% CI, 4.26 to 12.76).

Conclusion

Lymphedema after breast cancer is common but mostly mild. Subtle differences in self-reported hand/arm size and symptoms can be early signs of progressing lymphedema.

### Learning from a lymphedema clinic: an algorithm for the management of localized swelling [^116j7LMQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema is a chronic disease causing significant morbidity for affected patients. It can be difficult to diagnose, and patients are often frustrated by multiple referrals and inadequate therapies. Centralized, comprehensive care for the patient presenting with lymphedema or other causes of localized swelling allows for appropriate evaluation and provides improved management and treatment.

Methods

A 4-year review of the first 100 patients seen at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Lymphedema Clinic was performed. On the basis of the clinical experience from these patients, an algorithm for diagnosing and managing patients with localized swelling was developed.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 50 years, and 81 percent of the patients were women. On average, patients had experienced their symptoms for 11.6 years (range, 3 months to 60 years). Lymphoscintigraphy was performed on 43 patients, 81 percent of whom showed lymphatic obstruction or dysfunction. In total, 75 percent of patients were diagnosed with lymphedema based on clinical presentation or additional testing. Fourteen of these patients underwent subsequent excisional procedures, whereas the rest were managed conservatively with compression garments.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with swollen extremities can frequently be diagnosed through history and physical examination alone, but many patients require more extensive diagnostic workup. An algorithm for the management of these patients can facilitate evaluation and treatment.

Therefore, survivors at risk for lymphedema should be regularly screened for lymphedema by symptom assessment, clinical examination, and, if available, BIS".

Clinical presentation.

The clinical presentation of filarial lymphedema has been well described, along with several different staging systems for judging a patient's status. From both clinical and patient perspectives, it is recognized as swelling of a limb with or without the occurrence of intermittent pain and enlargement of the draining lymph nodes (especially during an acute attack). In the early stages of lymphedema, the swelling often disappears overnight, especially if the limb is elevated during sleep.

As time passes, the swelling of the limb remains throughout the day and night, and the persistent accumulation of fluid in the subcutaneous and deeper tissues induces a decrease in the ability of the skin to maintain homeostasis. As a result, visibly worsening dermal changes occur, including hyperkeratosis, subdermal fibrosis, deep skinfolds, and deterioration of the skin initially in the heels and toenails — areas that are often in contact with the ground surfaces and where cracks and grossly altered nail beds commonly appear. In later stages, changes in the skinfolds occur, followed by severe characteristic dermal alterations known as "mossy foot" and dermal nodules. Neurological changes can develop, including both sensory numbing, with loss of sensation that can lead to patients' accidentally burning themselves in fires, and pain that is commonly localized to the foot of an affected leg. A discomforting pain described by patients as "deep scratching in their bones", has also been reported in Tanzania (C. D. Mackenzie, unpublished data).

Sequence of tissue-level changes.

For optimizing treatment, it is important to understand the progressive changes of filarial lymphedema over time, from when the adult worm first takes up residence in the afferent lymphatic vessels of the lymph nodes, to the enlargement of the involved lymphatics, to the inflammatory changes associated with the presence of the adult worms and their secretions, and to the subsequent accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the associated interstitial connective tissues (Figure 2). These events are associated with progressive degeneration in the skin's normal homeostatic and protective function, opening opportunities for the establishment of secondary bacterial and fungal infections with additional associated gross pathological changes. Indeed, it is these secondary infections, along with a compromised lymphatic system, that drive progression of lymphedema even in the absence of persistent filarial infection; this is particularly important because most lymphedema patients do become free of active filarial infection over time. Presumably, such individuals have built up a higher level of inflammatory immune responsiveness, which is effective at warding off new incoming filarial infectious larvae (the L3s), but at the cost of local inflammation that ultimately drives further vessel enlargement and worsening lymphatic function. Many studies have characterized the different immune profiles between lymphedema patients and those who have ongoing infection (microfilaremia) but without overt disease; these observations suggest a significantly elevated pro-inflammatory immune response in patients with lymphedema compared with those without. Such a view of the pathogenesis of filarial lymphedemais useful both for providing appropriate care, independent of filarial infection status, and for understanding the pathological elements that might be targeted in investigations aimed at improving care, both before and after filariasis transmission has stopped in affected communities.
