## Question

What are the differential diagnosis in an adolescent male with sudden onset of left pinky swelling? There are no injuries, fever, redness.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a teenage boy with sudden left pinky swelling, no fever, and no redness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "swelling" reflects soft tissue versus bone or joint disease. Then, I should verify what the absence of fever and erythema truly rules in or out. Next, I will generate a prioritized differential that fits the age and features, including dactylitis mimics, tenosynovitis, and bony entities. After that, I need to check the targeted history, examination, and first-line tests that separate inflammatory from infectious causes. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic imaging algorithm and when to escalate to biopsy or surgical evaluation, while double-checking that I'm not overcalling Lyme arthritis in a small-joint presentation and that I'm not missing an indolent infection or a tumor.

> Let me first confirm the problem framing: sudden unilateral digital swelling without fever or redness shifts my initial attention toward tenosynovitis, early septic arthritis, dactylitis, or focal bony lesions, while I must remain cautious because absence of systemic signs does not exclude early infection or inflammatory dactylitis; in fact, some pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis cases present subtly, and atypical hand infections can be indolent and minimally inflammatory at onset, so I should not anchor prematurely on "noninfectious" causes just yet [^notfound] [^1147NgKn] [^1117whbe].

> Wait, let me verify my knee-jerk about "swelling equals dactylitis". That's too simplistic; dactylitis in adolescents commonly reflects psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related disease, but I need to check for trauma or overuse that can produce aseptic synovitis or a "sausage digit" from flexor tenosynovitis, and I should remember that dactylitis is also a recognized, albeit rare, manifestation of Lyme disease in some regions, so I must not close the loop too early on psoriatic etiologies without supporting features or targeted testing [^111yX1e3] [^1117whbe] [^1139vKcY] [^116nCibz].

> I will now examine the soft-tissue infection possibilities. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis can be subtle early, presenting with fusiform swelling and pain out of proportion, sometimes with Kanavel signs of tenderness along the sheath, finger flexed at rest, and pain with passive extension; hold on, I should verify that absence of Kanavel signs does not exclude the diagnosis, as partial or early presentations occur, and atypical pathogens or immunocompromise can blunt erythema and fever, so I need a low threshold for urgent hand referral if suspicion persists [^116DJagE] [^1117whbe] [^1147NgKn].

> Let me consider dactylitis as a manifestation of juvenile psoriatic arthritis or related enthesitis. In an adolescent, I should confirm the presence of psoriasis, nail pitting or onycholysis, family history, or other inflammatory features, and I need to check inflammatory markers and perform a careful joint exam for enthesitis; radiographs can show periostitis and erosions, but MRI may better demonstrate flexor tenosynovitis and bone marrow edema consistent with psoriatic dactylitis, which helps distinguish it from septic processes and early CNO when the clinical picture is equivocal [^111yX1e3].

> But wait, what if this is Lyme disease masquerading as dactylitis? I should double-check exposure risk and seasonality, because small-joint hand involvement is uncommon in Lyme arthritis, which classically targets large monoarthritis, particularly the knee; still, case reports document dactylitis in Lyme borreliosis, so in endemic regions or with compatible exposure, I should obtain serology and consider PCR of synovial fluid or tissue if aspirated, recognizing that PCR on formalin-fixed skin can be falsely negative and that a history of tick bite is not required for diagnosis [^1139vKcY] [^116nCibz] [^114GHwoR].

> Next, I should review noninfectious inflammatory mimics. Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis can present with focal bony pain and swelling in adolescents, but the tempo is typically subacute rather than sudden, so I need to ensure the timeline fits; if CNO is suspected, whole-body MRI is useful to detect multifocal lesions, and biopsy is reserved for atypical features or when malignancy remains a concern after imaging, so I should avoid over-ordering invasive tests up front in a patient with a very acute presentation [^114i89ko] [^113173sW].

> I need to ensure I don't overlook neoplastic and developmental bony causes. Osteoid osteoma can present in the phalanges with focal pain and swelling, and the classic night pain relieved by NSAIDs should be elicited; plain films may show a nidus, and CT can characterize it, so I should ask about nocturnal symptoms and obtain radiographs early if bony tenderness predominates, particularly if soft-tissue findings are minimal [^114Ue1CK].

> Hold on, I should verify that subtle trauma is truly absent, because a missed puncture or splinter can drive foreign-body synovitis with fusiform swelling and minimal systemic signs; ultrasound is highly useful to detect radiolucent foreign material and guide targeted management, so I must re-examine for a puncture wound, however small, and consider ultrasound if the story or exam raises suspicion, even when plain radiographs are unrevealing [^112VbnKL].

> Let me think about the first 48-hour priorities. I should obtain CBC, ESR/CRP, and ASO if streptococcal post-infectious arthritis is a concern, and add Lyme serology in endemic areas; plain radiographs of the involved digit can reveal fractures, bony lesions, or periostitis, and ultrasound can identify flexor sheath effusion, synovitis, or foreign body; if there is exquisite tenderness along the sheath with pain on passive extension, I should not delay urgent hand surgery consultation, because delayed tenosynovitis care risks adhesions and loss of function [^117MRAJN] [^1139vKcY] [^111K5b42] [^116DJagE].

> I should double-check my imaging sequence. Start with plain radiographs to exclude fracture and to screen for bony pathology, then use ultrasound for soft-tissue assessment and foreign-body detection, and escalate to MRI if dactylitis, CNO, or osteoid osteoma are suspected and plain films are nondiagnostic; MRI delineates tenosynovitis, bone marrow edema, and periostitis, helping differentiate psoriatic dactylitis from septic arthritis and guiding the need for aspiration or biopsy if the diagnosis remains uncertain [^111K5b42] [^114i89ko].

> Let me reconsider infectious mimics that are easy to miss. Atypical mycobacterial tenosynovitis can be indolent with minimal systemic signs and may require targeted cultures or molecular testing; likewise, tuberculous dactylitis, while rare in adolescents, can present with bony destruction and soft-tissue swelling, so I should ask about BCG, TB exposure, and travel, and keep a low threshold for tissue sampling when imaging suggests granulomatous infection or when first-line antibiotics fail [^1147NgKn] [^113Xtz43] [^116dEdrp].

> I need to ensure my treatment branches are aligned with likely diagnoses. If psoriatic dactylitis is most likely, NSAIDs and disease-modifying therapy guided by pediatric rheumatology are appropriate; if pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is suspected, urgent irrigation and debridement with organism-directed antibiotics is indicated; if Lyme dactylitis is confirmed, a 14–28 day course of doxycycline or amoxicillin is reasonable per guidelines, with adjustment if arthritis persists; if CNO is identified, anti-inflammatory therapy and whole-body imaging inform management; and if osteoid osteoma is confirmed, referral for image-guided ablation or surgical excision is standard [^1139vKcY] [^116DJagE] [^114i89ko].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up plan and red flags. Re-evaluation at 24–48 hours is prudent to ensure no progression toward erythema, fever, or worsening pain, which would recalibrate the differential toward infection or necrotizing entities; any evolving Kanavel signs, neurovascular compromise, or failure to improve on initial therapy should prompt expedited hand surgery consultation and reconsideration of the working diagnosis to avoid delays in definitive care [^112N4H8u] [^116DJagE].

In an adolescent male with sudden left pinky swelling, no trauma, fever, or redness, the most likely causes are **tenosynovitis** (trigger finger or De Quervain's) [^116DJagE], **ganglion cyst**, or **early inflammatory arthritis** (juvenile idiopathic arthritis or psoriatic arthritis) [^116jJwJt] [^111yX1e3]. Other considerations include **atypical infections** (Lyme disease [^116nCibz], tuberculosis [^113Xtz43]) [^1147NgKn], vascular anomalies [^114p6TgY], and benign tumors (osteoid osteoma) [^114Ue1CK]. Key next steps are a **focused exam** for dactylitis, joint effusion, or focal masses; obtain CBC, ESR/CRP, and Lyme serology if endemic [^1139vKcY]; and use ultrasound or MRI if the diagnosis is unclear [^111K5b42] [^114i89ko].

---

## Trauma-related conditions

Although the patient reports no trauma, **occult microtrauma or repetitive strain** may still contribute to swelling.

- **Occult fracture**: A subtle or stress fracture of the distal phalanx or interphalangeal joint may present with swelling and minimal pain, especially in adolescents engaged in sports or repetitive activities [^notfound].

- **Ligamentous injury**: Partial tears or sprains of the collateral ligaments or volar plate can cause localized swelling without significant erythema or systemic symptoms.

- **Flexor tendon injury**: Partial tears or tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons can cause localized swelling and stiffness without overt trauma [^1117whbe].

---

## Infectious etiologies

Despite the absence of fever or erythema, **infectious causes** should still be considered, particularly if there is a history of recent travel, animal exposure, or immunocompromise.

- **Lyme disease**: In endemic areas, Lyme arthritis can present with isolated joint swelling, often involving the knee, but occasionally smaller joints may be affected. The absence of fever or erythema does not exclude Lyme disease [^1139vKcY] [^116nCibz].

- **Tuberculous dactylitis**: A rare but important consideration, particularly in patients with a history of travel to endemic areas or immunocompromise. Tuberculous dactylitis presents with painless swelling of the phalanges, often without systemic symptoms [^111RJ7S7].

- **Atypical mycobacterial infection**: Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections can cause chronic, indolent swelling of the digits, often associated with minor trauma or exposure to contaminated water [^1147NgKn] [^113Mo8CP].

---

## Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions

Inflammatory conditions are a significant cause of **sudden digital swelling** in adolescents, even in the absence of systemic symptoms.

- **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)**: JIA can present with isolated joint swelling, often involving the small joints of the hands. The absence of fever or erythema does not exclude JIA, particularly in oligoarticular forms [^notfound].

- **Psoriatic arthritis**: Dactylitis, or "sausage digit", is a hallmark of psoriatic arthritis and can present with isolated finger swelling without systemic symptoms [^111yX1e3].

- **Reactive arthritis**: Following a recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, reactive arthritis can cause isolated joint swelling, often in the lower extremities, but occasionally involving the hands [^notfound].

---

## Vascular and lymphatic disorders

Vascular or lymphatic abnormalities can cause **localized swelling** without systemic signs.

- **Lymphatic obstruction**: Primary or secondary lymphatic obstruction can cause localized swelling of the digit, often painless and non-inflammatory.

- **Vascular malformations**: Arteriovenous malformations or hemangiomas can present with localized swelling, often with subtle skin discoloration or pulsatility [^117Ccgiy].

---

## Benign tumors and cystic lesions

Benign tumors and cysts are common in adolescents and can cause **sudden swelling** of the digits.

- **Ganglion cyst**: Ganglion cysts commonly occur along the dorsal aspect of the digits, causing localized swelling without pain or systemic symptoms.

- **Osteoid osteoma**: A benign bone tumor that can present with localized swelling and pain, often worse at night, and relieved by NSAIDs [^notfound].

- **Epidermal inclusion cyst**: Resulting from minor trauma or surgery, these cysts can cause localized swelling of the digit [^notfound].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine disorders

Metabolic conditions are less common but should be considered, particularly if there is a history of **recent growth spurts** or dietary changes.

- **Gout**: Although rare in adolescents, gout can present with acute joint swelling, particularly in the setting of obesity or metabolic syndrome [^notfound].

- **Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD)**: CPPD can cause acute joint swelling, often mimicking gout or septic arthritis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to narrow the differential diagnosis:

- **Detailed history**: Recent trauma, travel, animal exposure, infections, dietary changes, and family history of autoimmune diseases.

- **Physical examination**: Inspection for erythema, warmth, deformity, dactylitis, joint effusion, and range of motion assessment [^112VbnKL].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibodies, Lyme serology, and uric acid levels [^117MRAJN].

- **Imaging**: Plain radiographs for fractures or bony lesions, ultrasound for soft tissue masses or joint effusions, and MRI for suspected inflammatory arthritis, osteomyelitis, or benign tumors [^114kzyN7] [^114i89ko].

---

## Conclusion

In an adolescent male with sudden left pinky swelling, no trauma, fever, or redness, the **differential diagnosis** includes trauma-related injuries, infectious etiologies such as Lyme disease or tuberculosis, inflammatory conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, vascular or lymphatic disorders, benign tumors or cysts, and metabolic conditions. A **focused history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic testing** are essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management.

Case presentation

A 12-year-old boy with anorexia nervosa presented with subacute multifocal digital swelling. He had been diagnosed with an eating disorder about 4 months prior to symptom onset, requiring admission to the Adolescent Medicine service for malnutrition, orthostasis and bradycardia, which resolved with monitored feeding. Despite ongoing behavioral therapy following discharge, however, adequate intake with continued weight gain remained a challenge. Over the course of 6 weeks, he developed additive and persistent swelling of the right hand first and fourth digits, followed by the left fifth digit (Fig. 1). The swelling was painful and unresponsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, there was no fever, and he identified no preceding trauma or illness. Physical exam was notable for fusiform swelling limited to the phalanges, as the joints themselves did not exhibit any discrete effusions. Furthermore, the overlying skin was normal in appearance and texture, without petechiae or ecchymoses, and no other mucocutaneous changes were present elsewhere. Complete musculoskeletal exam was otherwise normal, without other areas of swelling or pain. The patient appeared generally cachectic and review of the growth curve revealed significant weight loss with concomitant stunted vertical growth over the previous 2 years, with a sustained body mass index below the first percentile for age. He had previously exhibited a normal fecal calprotectin and at the time of this presentation did not report any gastrointestinal abnormalities concerning for enterocolonic inflammation or malabsorption. He denied practicing restrictive eating behaviors, but his diet included few fruits and vegetables. He was then admitted for a comprehensive medical work up of this constellation of symptoms.

Hand radiographs showed marrow and cortical erosive change with periosteal reaction and overlying soft tissue swelling of the involved phalanges (Fig. 2). MRI of the right hand revealed signal abnormalities with surrounding soft tissue edema, but without arthritis, in these areas (Fig. 3). These findings prompted concern for chronic noninfectious osteomyelitis (CNO) or an alternate noninfectious inflammatory entity, such as Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH). Subsequent whole body imaging did not identify any other areas of involvement. The isolation of the lesions to the hands was felt to be atypical for CNO and LCH, particularly without evidence of systemic inflammation to further suggest such diagnoses. Therefore, further evaluations for other etiologies of finger swelling with bony changes were pursued.

The cause of a fever of unknown origin (FUO, fever of > 21 days without an identified etiology) may be a common illness, an atypical presentation of a common illness, or an unusual illness. A patient with an FUO occasionally presents to the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis of an FUO is extensive. A primary goal for the ED physician is to determine if the patient with an FUO has a disorder that needs immediate recognition and treatment. We describe a case of a teenage boy who presented to our ED with 2 weeks of high fever and back pain. We describe this teenage boy with FUO and a surprising diagnosis.

Aquagenic urticaria, a rare variant of chronic-inducible urticaria, is triggered by direct contact with water. It is distinguished by its characteristic small wheals accompanied by a halo of erythema from other forms of urticaria. It typically manifests with a delayed diagnosis due to the atypical trigger and the potential for diverse clinical presentations. We present a case of aquagenic urticaria in an adolescent male that demonstrates the need for accurate differential diagnosis and appropriate management.

Case Presentation

A 72-year-old man presented to our ED less than 24 hours following the acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Within 12 hours of symptom onset, he noted bilateral lower extremity pain and swelling. His pain was associated with a new violaceous irregular rash on the anterior aspect of both feet and legs. There was no history of inciting trauma or recent wounds. In addition, there was no history of consumption of raw or undercooked food (including seafood) or recent change in food source. There was accompanying fever and chills for the same duration and painful swelling of his left thumb. His comorbidities included stage IIIb classical Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed 4 months prior. His last dose of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy was 4 days before presentation. He had previously failed anti-CD30 monoclonal therapy resulting from attributed pancolitis.

### A 13-year-old male with left eye swelling [^1177NfVi]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old male presented with a 10-day history of left eye swelling and pain. These symptoms prompted presentation to the emergency department. He had no significant past medical history and no preceding fevers or chills. He was found on examination of the eyes and the orbit to have left supraorbital erythema, edema, and pain with upward and medial gaze. Examination of the globe, fundus, and visual fields were normal. His white blood cell count was 6.2 (×10³/mm³) with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 4 (mm/hr). Diagnostic endoscopic biopsy was performed. Here we present this case alongside clinical reasoning and diagnostic evaluation with relevant input from respective experts. This case discussion reviews the final diagnosis, as well as the corresponding evaluation and management. Diagnostic algorithms based on literature review and clinical experience are also included.

### Rare case of Lyme borreliosis in a patient presenting with dactylitis and skin rash [^116nCibz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Depending on geographical variations and the clinical manifestations, different treatments regimens for LB are recommended. In Denmark, PcV for 21 days is recommended as first-line antibiotic treatment for Lyme arthritis and ACA, whereas doxycycline and ceftriaxone are alternatives to PcV. However, recommendations for treatment of LB are based on small case series, but there are no randomised controlled trials. European treatment guidelines for LB with arthritis or ACA often recommend doxycycline for 14–28 days as first-line treatment or alternatively amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. In this case, treatment with PcV for only 10 days was used with success. If treatment with PcV had not been sufficient, extension of treatment for a total of 21 days or change in treatment to doxycycline or ceftriaxone would have been considered.

In conclusion, dactylitis is a common feature of PsA. However, dactylitis may also be seen as a clinical feature in several other diseases such as LB and should be considered both initially and if treatment response is lacking.

Patient's perspective

The worst part of the disease was the uncertainty regarding the diagnosis. I often wondered, 'Why can the doctors not figure out what is wrong with my fingers'. At the same time, I thought, 'Well, I am not 25 years old anymore, but an elderly man, and I am not as vain as I used to be'. I was really happy when I was sent to the dermatologist and the skin biopsy helped to set the diagnosis, borreliosis. Already after 1 week of penicillin treatment, the swelling of my 'sausage fingers' improved. I have to live with a pair of semi-stiff fingers, but I think I will manage it well, even though I have to say good morning to those distorted 'bandits' every day.

Learning points

Dactylitis is a common feature of PsA. However, dactylitis may also be seen as a clinical feature in several other diseases such as Lyme borreliosis (LB).
LB may occur although a tick bite or a history thereof or an initial erythematous rash is not recalled by the patient.
When suspecting an infection, attention to the correct procedure for culture and PCR analysis is important.
Other differential diagnoses must be considered when expected treatment response is lacking. It is crucial to re-evaluate the medical history, objective examinations and laboratory tests. In this case, the conclusive clue was hidden in the skin biopsy.

Introduction: Joint pain or swelling with limitation of movement is one of the most common presenting complaints in paediatric A&E departments. The wide range of differential diagnoses make it challenging to narrow down a particular cause, which can lead to delays in the initiation of appropriate management.

Arthritis is characterized by joint pain, swelling, limitation of movement and sometimes periarticular erythema. These symptoms may be the initial presentation of a number of diseases, the differential diagnosis in children including septic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, foreign body synovitis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, hemarthrosis, avascular necrosis, malignancy, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rarely crystalline arthritis among others.

An accurate history, physical examination and initial investigations are invaluable in differentiating a chronic inflammatory arthritis like JIA, from the other causes. A previous history of trauma may be helpful in acute cases but may also detract from the underlying diagnosis. Skill and care is therefore required in identifying the most pertinent information in each case.

Objectives: Here we focud on synovitis in a young child caused by a missed foreign body.

Methods: We present a case to highlight the importance of a thorough history, including that of previous trauma, and the utility of ultrasound as a go to investigation when there are inconclusive findings on traditional tests like plain radiograph

Results: n/a

Conclusion: With a clear history of trauma or penetrating injury, every effort should be made to rule out a foreign body, particularly when there is no improvement after treatment. While plain radiographs are not very sensitive at picking up radiolucentforeign bodies, ultrasound may be a helpful tool to narrow down the diagnosis and also to localize the exact position of a foreign body. Although MRI has been shown to be sensitive and the investigation of choice, it might not always be easily available or accessible in many settings

### Unusual presentation of acute compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand [^114Lybyn]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 49-year-old man was referred to orthopaedics with an acute onset of left forearm and hand swelling, widespread blisters and erythema after lying face down on the floor for an unknown period of time. He also presented with left wrist stiffness due to pain and clawing of the fingers and glove-type loss of sensation in the whole hand. Any attempt to straighten the fingers or extend the wrist exacerbated the pain. Symptoms deteriorated rapidly. Compartment syndrome was diagnosed and surgical fasciotomies of his left forearm and left hand were performed following multidisciplinary urgent discussions between plastic surgeons, microbiologists, anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons. The left forearm and left hand underwent extensive decompression and subsequent skin grafting and had good healing despite the initial skin presentation. The patient has made a satisfactory recovery and has required extensive hand physiotherapy and social care.

### Acute blue finger: a diagnostic challenge [^114p6TgY]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The management of the acute blue finger is controversial with many regarding it as a benign condition. However, we would argue that it should always be considered as an emergency. We present a challenging case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with a 1-week history of sudden onset blue discolouration of the left fifth digit, and a 6-week history of episodic joint problems. Examination showed bilateral normal radial and ulnar pulses. Following blood investigations, an initial working diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis with associated Raynaud's phenomenon was made. Also, infective endocarditis was considered due to temporary misleading physical signs. Later, CT angiography of the left upper limb arteries showed a significant proximal left subclavian stenosis. Subsequently, a diagnosis of the left subclavian arteritis associated with digit ischaemia from embolic debris was made and the patient underwent a left subclavian angioplasty. However, delayed management resulted in a necrotic digit, which was left to autoamputate.

### Unremitting pain and fever in a 15-year-old boy with osteomyelitis [^111we4gP]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy from a rural county in the southeastern United States was evaluated in the emergency department with fever and worsening toe pain in the absence of trauma. He initially presented to his primary care physician 4 weeks before with upper respiratory symptoms and was treated with corticosteroids for presumed reactive airway disease. His respiratory symptoms resolved. One week after this presentation, he developed fever and right great toe pain and presented to an outside hospital. Inflammatory markers were elevated. MRI confirmed a diagnosis of osteomyelitis with associated periosteal abscess. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage of the abscess. Ten days after his discharge from the outside hospital, he developed fever and had increasing drainage of the toe and pain refractory to oral pain medications. He presented to our facility for further evaluation. Repeat MRI and inflammatory markers corroborated his worsening disease, and he was admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics and underwent serial surgical debridement. He developed painful subcutaneous nodules on his lower extremities and was found to have lung abnormalities on chest radiograph. A multispecialty team collaborated in the management of this patient and unveiled a surprising diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^1139vKcY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme arthritis — epidemiology and clinical features: Although historically arthritis was reported to occur in 60% of patients with untreated erythema migrans, more recent surveillance data document a 30% annual incidence of arthritis as a presenting manifestation. Lyme arthritis typically presents with marked swelling of 1 or a few large joints, most often the knee, with less pain than expected based on the degree of swelling, and in untreated disease overall, < 5 joints are typically affected and most often only a single joint is involved; small joint involvement of the hands and feet is very unusual and should prompt consideration of other diagnoses. In Lyme disease-endemic areas, there is a greater likelihood that acute infectious monarthritis is the result of Lyme disease rather than septic arthritis, and predictors of Lyme arthritis include history of a tick bite, isolated knee involvement, and lack of fever; absence of a history of a tick bite should not preclude consideration of Lyme arthritis in patients with acute inflammatory monoarthritis. There is considerable overlap between Lyme arthritis and septic arthritis in children in the following instances: presence of fever, elevated acute phase reactants, and the inability to bear weight (especially when the hip is involved), and previously published Kocher criteria should not be employed in distinguishing septic arthritis from Lyme arthritis; when there is any doubt, joint fluid should be obtained for culture for other bacterial causes of septic arthritis.

### TB or not TB: an unusual sore finger [^113Xtz43]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

A 25 year old Afro-Carribean presented to the accident and emergency department with a painful swelling of the little finger. Radiology revealed periosteal elevation and a bone scan showed a hot spot in the proximal phalanx, suggestive of a tumour or an infection. He gave a history of recurrent chest infections in the past, the chest radiograph revealed apical lesions and loculated pleural effusion. Bronchoscopy washings were positive for acid fast bacillus suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis with tuberculous dactylitis. A detailed history and high index of suspicion is important as delay in diagnosis can have serious consequences for the patient.

### Atypical hand infections [^1147NgKn]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Atypical infections of the hand are caused by organisms such as Mycobacterium, fungi, and viruses, and often do not respond to conventional management. They exist within a wide spectrum of presentations, ranging from cutaneous lesions to deep infections such as tenosynovitis and osteomyelitis. Having a high clinical suspicion for atypical hand infections is vital because diagnosis often requires special tests and/or cultures. Obtaining a detailed medical, work, and travel history is extremely important. An indolent clinical course, late diagnosis, and delayed treatment are common. In addition to medical therapies, surgical debridement is often required to effectively treat these infections.

### Prevention and treatment of nonfreezing cold injuries and warm water immersion tissue injuries: a supplement to the Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines [^113TjQ3o]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of warm water immersion injuries — distinguishing conditions: Differential diagnosis includes NFCI and frostbite, which can be distinguished from WWIF or TIF by a history of exposure to cold temperatures or cold water rather than warm water. Pressure necrosis can mimic or coexist with warm water injury, and tropical immersion foot can cause ulcerations in areas of swollen tissue. Like TIF, soft-tissue infections can cause erythema and edema, sometimes with fever and lymphadenopathy; infections are usually unilateral and well demarcated, unlike TIF, which is usually symmetrical and diffuse. Wet-sock erosions are superficial skin erosions that occur only in areas that experience friction or pressure, especially under bootlaces, unlike the lesions in TIF that cover the dorsum and ankle.

Differential diagnosis

In this case, LB was initially misdiagnosed as PsA. Other diagnostic considerations for the causes of dactylitis were malignancy including progression in known haematological disease, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, lymphocytoma cutis and slow-growing infection. Idiopathic lymphoedema and discolouration of the fingers due to microthromboembolic disease were also taken into diagnostic consideration.

### Case report: multifocal tubercular osteomyelitis of the spine and bilateral dactylitis [^116dEdrp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a 13-year-old immunocompetent male with multifocal tubercular osteomyelitis involving several spinal segments, small bones of the hands, and the scalp, who started with progressively back pain and enlarging painful swelling on the palms of hands, fatigue, and irregular fever. All the hand lesions were firm, mildly tender, and covered by ulcerated skin with serous discharge from the site. Magnetic resonance showed lesions of the right fifth metacarpal, of the right intermediate phalanx of the fourth finger, of the left second metacarpal, and of most vertebral bodies of the cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral spine. The nucleic acid amplification test and the final culture from the drainage of the hands' lesion were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient received a standard antitubercular treatment for 12 months with clinical improvement.

### Osteoid osteoma in the thumb of an adolescent patient [^114Ue1CK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteoid osteoma is a relatively common benign tumor of bone, typically presenting in the diaphysis of long bones during the second or third decades of life. This tumor is rarely reported in the hand and wrist, making up only approximately 10% of cases. When reported in the hand, osteoid osteoma tends to occur more frequently in the proximal phalanx of the index and middle fingers. We present the case of an osteoid osteoma in an adolescent male in the distal phalanx of the thumb. The presentation of this osteoid osteoma was atypical owing to its location and lack of characteristic clinical features, making the initial work-up and final diagnosis challenging and pointing to the importance of considering this diagnosis on a differential for painful bony tumors in the hand.

The BCG vaccine is considered a safe and efficacious vaccine in the prevention of severe forms of tuberculosis. BCG osteomyelitis is a rare complication of the BCG vaccine that occurs in vaccinated young children. We report a case of BCG osteomyelitis in a male toddler, presenting with painful left wrist swelling without preceding fever or systemic symptoms. Radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis in the left wrist was observed. Initial treatment with conventional antibiotics for acute haematogenous osteomyelitis showed no improvement. The diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis BCG osteomyelitis was confirmed via tissue samples for histopathological examination and mycobacterial cultures. The patient responded well to treatment with oral antituberculous therapy. This case highlights the importance of considering BCG osteomyelitis in the differential diagnosis of unexplained joint swelling in BCG-vaccinated young children.

### In brief: kanavel's signs and pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis [^116DJagE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

History

Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an infection of the flexor tendon sheath of the finger that can result in tendon necrosis and adhesions leading to marked loss of motion, deformity, and loss of limb, particularly if treatment is delayed. In one large series, pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis was reported to represent 9.4% (13/138) of hand infections. The advent of antibiotics and appropriate surgical treatment has decreased the risk of serious sequelae secondary to pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis. However, early recognition and clinical suspicion remain paramount to minimizing potentially devastating consequences from delayed treatment of these infections.

Dr Allen B. Kanavel (1874–1938) initially described three cardinal signs of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis in his seminal work in 1912 as "1. Exquisite tenderness over the course of the sheath, limited to the sheath. 2. Flexion of the finger. 3. Exquisite pain on extending the finger, most marked at the proximal end". Although not noted in his initial description as a cardinal sign, he explained "the whole of the involved finger is uniformally swollen", and fusiform swelling later became the fourth cardinal sign. The constellation of the four signs, commonly known as "Kanavel's signs", is frequently used as the primary clinical tool for diagnosing pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, because advanced imaging and laboratory studies often are nonspecific.

Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist are important clinical entities because of their rapidly progressive and potentially lethal nature. These infections encompass a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms, which can be subtle and nonspecific. If the brief prodromal period of these infections goes unrecognized, a local area of devitalized tissue can evolve into fulminant infection, multiorgan failure, and potentially death. Early recognition and treatment including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical débridement are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis leading to an amputation [^111zc9LN]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Flexor tenosynovitis is an aggressive closed-space infection of the digital flexor tendon sheaths of the hand. We present a case of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis in an immunocompromised patient and discuss the importance of early diagnosis and referral to a specialist hand surgery unit. A 61-year-old man visited his general practitioner because of swelling and tenderness of his left index finger. The patient was discharged on oral antibiotics but returned 4 days after because of deterioration of his symptoms and was referred to a plastic surgery unit. A diagnosis of flexor tenosynovitis was made and the patient required multiple debridements in theatre, resulting in the amputation of the infected finger. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is a relatively common but often misdiagnosed hand infection. Patients with suspected flexor tenosynovitis should be referred and treated early to avoid significant morbidity, especially when risk factors for poor prognosis are present.

A33 Severe Kawasaki disease caused by parvovirus B19 infection?

Merle Claßen, Tobias Krickau

Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany

Pediatric Rheumatology 2025, 23(1): A33

Introduction: Parvovirus B19 infection and Kawasaki disease may overlap. Parvovirus can cause severe (atypical) Kawasaki disease (1). Two thirds of patients with Kawasaki disease have a concomitant parvovirus infection (2). Other authors describe that parvovirus infection itself can mimic atypical Kawasaki disease with persistent fever and rash (3).

Methods: A case report of a four-year-old boy with atypical Kawasaki disease is presented. The clinical disease course and challenges are described.

Results: The four-year-old boy presented with five-week history of fever without focus, refractory to antibiotics, cervical lymphadenopathy and coronary aneurysms. Three months prior to the onset of Kawasaki's disease, the boy had a parvovirus infection, resulting in a low haemoglobin level (8.8 g/dl) at first presentation. No active infection was detected at that time. He received two courses of IVIG (2g/kg KG), which resulted in clinical and biochemical improvement. However, three weeks later, he had a relapse of fever and new erythema nodosum, haemoglobin dropped to a low of 7.7 g/dl, and haemolysis parameters increased. Leukocytes increased to 45 × 10³/µL. Parvovirus DNA was again found in the blood. Treatment with prednisolone was started. Reduction of prednisolone was tried twice, resulting in flares of erythema nodosum, decrease in haemoglobin and increase in leukocytes. Differential diagnoses for hyperleucocytosis were excluded. A very slow tapering of prednisolone two months after the onset of Kawasaki disease was tolerated. The erythema nodosum resolved slowly after a total of 8 weeks.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: the role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, because of some similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. The latter may lead to elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand, and emphasizes the key points that assist in the differentiation of the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.

### In brief: kanavel's signs and pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis [^1117whbe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Description

Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis usually is caused by penetrating trauma to the finger, although patients who are immunocompromised may have a more indolent and chronic presentation, and a history of trauma in these patients may be remote or absent. The site of penetrating trauma often can be identified and may appear relatively mild, even appearing like nothing more than a superficial scratch (Fig. 1). Multiple series have shown Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogen in pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis cultures, although polymicrobial infections, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus species also are commonly encountered pathogens, and rare organisms have been isolated from pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis cultures, including Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, Kingella kingae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Clostridium difficile, and Mycobacterium species. Initial treatment of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis includes timely administration of intravenous antibiotics and surgical irrigation and drainage. Although open irrigation and débridement, closed tendon sheath irrigation, local antibiotic delivery systems, and continuous closed irrigation strategies using external pump local anesthesia have been described, no single approach is clearly superior to others regarding long-term function, need for repeat surgery, amputation risk, and infection eradication.

Fig. 1
The right middle finger of this patient with pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis shows fusiform swelling and the digit was held in flexion with tenderness to palpation along the flexor tendon sheath and exquisite pain with passive digit extension. There is an identifiable entry site of previous trauma overlying the middle phalanx. (Published with permission from Alexander Lauder MD, Department of Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.)

Although the absence of one or more Kanavel's signs does not exclude a diagnosis of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, the classic description of exquisite tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath, the digit held in flexion at rest, fusiform swelling of the digit (often described as a "sausage digit"), and pain with passive extension of the digit should raise concern for the presence of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis (Fig. 2).

### A clinico-radiological review of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis in paediatrics, adolescents, and adults: demystifying a forgotten differential [^114i89ko]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as non-bacterial osteitis, is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown aetiology that primarily occurs in the paediatric population, although rare cases of adult-onset disease also exist. CNO has non-specific clinical and radiological presentations, and the affected population often present with bone pain of insidious onset secondary to sterile bony inflammation that can be associated with swelling, focal tenderness, and warmth at the affected sites. The pattern of bony involvement appears to be dependent on the age of onset, with adults frequently having axial skeletal lesions and children and adolescents often being affected in the appendicular skeletal sites. CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion, and imaging is heavily relied on to identify and characterise the bony lesions in addition to exclude diseases that can mimic CNO. Magnetic resonance imaging is often the reference standard with biochemical and histopathological findings being complementary. Although combining imaging methods can be used to facilitate the diagnosis, a single technique could be adequate depending on the clinical picture. Given the relatively rare incidence of CNO, limited awareness of the disease among care providers, and its similarity in clinical and radiological presentation to various bony diseases, there are often long delays in diagnosis, with adults being unfavourably affected compared to paediatrics and adolescents. This review of CNO will describe the condition, overview its clinical presentation, highlight the radiological features, and emphasise clinical pearls that can aid in diagnosis and ruling out the mimics.

Case presentation

Clinical history

A 41-year-old Chinese male was admitted to our hospital because of a 3-year history of recurrent productive cough and new onset of recurrent hemoptysis and fever for 6 months. Three years ago, the patient had been admitted to the local hospital because of cough and expectoration, and the chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral lower lung infection. Not much improvement of respiratory symptoms had been observed, although treatments of anti-infection and anti-tuberculosis had been administrated in turn. Besides, the patient suffered a new onset of intermittent symmetric pain of limb joints, swelling of the upper eyelid, and erythematous maculopapular rash on the dorsal surfaces of the metacarpophalangeal joint, bilateral elbow joint, and proximal interphalangeal joint. Both lower limbs developed a livedo reticularis appearance after standing for approximate 5 min. Six months before admission, the patient experienced hemoptysis and developed a fever with maximum temperature of 38.5 °C. The frequency of redness and swelling of upper eyelids increased with and left and right eyelids alternated once a week. The new soybean-sized subcutaneous nodules with tenderness were found on the bilateral finger pulp. High potency anti-infection, anti-tuberculosis and anti-fungus treatment were given but demonstrated ineffectiveness with accelerated cough and expectoration. The patient had a 3-year history of sinusitis and family history of asthma. And he had no previous history of smoking and drinking.

Outcome and follow-up

During follow-up, inflammatory parameters remained within the normal range including CRP repeated monthly. The circumference of the digits was measured using a finger circumference gauge. Before treatment with PcV, after 2 weeks and after 6 months, the circumferences of the second digit were 11.5, 10,0 and 9.5 cm, respectively. After 6 months, tenosynovitis, arthritis, soft tissue swelling and skin rash had resolved, assessed clinically and by ultrasound. The patient was considered cured of the infection. However, he suffered from sequelae in terms of impaired flexion of the left hand's second and third digits in the distal and proximal interphalangeal joint despite occupational therapy.

Triggering in young children is rare. In this report, we describe spontaneous bilateral ring finger triggering in a 7-year-old boy after a viral infection. The pathology completely resolved without intervention. We propose that the triggering resulted from a viral synovitis. Such a case highlights the importance of eliciting evidence of recent infections in children presenting to hand clinics with finger triggering. It also implies that the transient synovitis often described in children may actually occur symptomatically in tenosynovium as well as articular synovium.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 40-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain and pain in the joints of her hands and feet. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

An otherwise healthy young man was referred to the rheumatologist because of bilateral proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint enlargements. The main concern was excluding the presence of inflammatory arthritis. Physical examination revealed bilateral PIP finger joints (II-IV) swellings and cutaneous thickenings in adjacent areas. The specificity of this case was the patient who appeared in the physician's room with his violin suitcase pointing to his profession even from the first site. Complete blood count with leucocyte differentials appeared without changes. Radiographics failed to show joint fluid or bony changes. All immunological markers (RF, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) and laboratory data (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, etc) were within the reference ranges or negative. After exclusion of rheumatoid and other inflammatory arthritis, and considering the occupation of the patient and demographics the diagnosis of a rare condition-pachydermodactyly was made.

### Flexor tenosynovitis of the hand caused by… [^114RGBpw]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Case Report

The patient is a 42-year-old Filipino woman with SLE. Chronic symptoms include discoid and malar rash, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, and polyarthritis. She has no history of renal or central nervous symptoms but has a history of pericarditis. She also has Raynaud disease, but no other notable medical problems. She denies an exposure to tuberculosis. Her medications include hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, azathioprine, methylprednisolone, folate, pregabalin, and nifedipine.

At initial presentation to an outside provider, she noted new swelling and pain in her left fifth finger and the ulnar aspect of her left hand. She had a similar episode in the right hand 1 year prior, which was associated with a lupus flare and resolved with steroid treatment. Her left hand pain and swelling were also attributed to a lupus flare at the time of presentation, and methylprednisolone dosage was increased. When her symptoms did not improve 1 month later, she presented to our orthopaedic clinic. Her examination was notable for diffuse erythema and swelling in the fifth finger, extending into the palm, as well as a small cyst on the ulnar side of her dorsal hand (Figure 1). She had a fusiform digit and pain over the flexor sheath but did not have pain with passive extension or a flexed digit at rest. A magnetic resonance image was obtained, and the results were consistent with tenosynovitis (Figure 2). She received a cortisone injection in the fifth finger, which resulted in only a mild decrease in swelling. One month later, she elected to proceed with synovectomy.

Figure 1

Figure 2
Axial magnetic resonance image just distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint showing synovitis within the fifth finger flexor tendon sheath.

In the operating room, a Brunner-type incision was made over the fifth finger, and purulence was immediately expressed. The incision was extended to the distal finger and palm to thoroughly evaluate the extent of infection, and synovectomy, irrigation, and débridement were performed after cultures were obtained. No "rice bodies" were noted, and no purulence was found distally in the carpal tunnel. After the volar procedure was completed, a small dorsal incision was made over the cyst, and purulence was also expressed. The area was not contiguous with volar infection. The skin was loosely closed with nylon sutures, and a soft dressing was placed.

Introduction: CNO-an acquired auto inflammatory bone disease affects children / young adults

Objectives: Our experience with CNO between Nov 2016-Feb 2023

Methods: Retrospective demographic and clinical /radiologic analysis

Results: Eighteen were males and 12 females. The mean age at presentation was 9 years (Range 4–14 years). Median time from onset of complaints to referral was 8 months (Range1m- 132m). Pediatricians referred 16(53%), pediatric orthopedicians 9(30%), radiologists 3(10%) and one each by a pediatric oncologist and adult rheumatologist. Time to diagnosis from referral ranged from 0–40 months. At presentation 22(73%) patients were suspected. Delay occurred in our first case with ulcerating skin and those with atypical features. Presenting features were painful gait (93%), local bone pains (77%) and symptomatic arthritis (10%). Palmoplantar psoriasis preceded skeletal complaints in 2 while 5 had associated psoriasis at presentation. Two had acne and evolved into SAPHO and one evolved from trigger thumb in infancy to twenty nail dystrophy at 4 years and CNO at 6 years. Fever was seen in 2 and erythema nodosum, urticaria, lymphadenopathy and proximal myopathy in 1 each. Family history of psoriasis was present in 5, and HLA B27 associated arthritis in 3. Median laboratory values were (Range in brackets) Hemoglobin 12.1g/dL (10.8–13.6 gm/dL), Leukocyte count 8700 × 10⁹/L (5450–16530 × 10⁹/L), Platelet count 3.65 × 10⁹/L (2.1–6.04 × 10⁹/L), ESR 30 mm/hr(2–72 mm/hr), and CRP 6mg/dL (0.1–46 mg/dL). Whole- body MRI was performed in 28 and a bone scan in 2. Eleven out of 13 bone biopsies performed prior to referral could have been avoided applying Bristol criteria. We biopsied 2 patients,1 with a raised ESR/CRP and the other with a monostotic lesion in the tibial diaphysis to rule out malignancy. The mean count of bony lesions / patient on MRI was 6 (Range:1–15) with 2 having single lesions in sacrum and tibia. The most common site was tibia (44/173), followed by femur (33/173). Axial and appendicular lesions were seen in 18 (60%), appendicular in 7(23%), axial in 5(17%) and 1 had a mandibular lesion. Cranial bones were spared. Meta-diaphyseal involvement was seen in 3 Fifteen (50%) patients had associated arthritis on MRI (monoarticular -7, polyarticular-8) of which 6 had an ESR > 30 mm/hr.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for adult-onset Still's disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, EULAR/PReS 2024 guidelines recommend to use the following definitions to facilitate the rapid diagnosis of Still's disease and the initiation of early treatment:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Fever|- Typically spiking with temperature ≥ 39 °C for at least 7 days|
|Rash|- Transient and often coincides with fever spikes, preferentially involving trunk <br/> - Typically erythematous (salmon pink), but other rashes (such as urticarial) may be consistent with the diagnosis|
|Musculoskeletal involvement|- Usually presents with arthralgia/myalgia <br/> - Overt arthritis is supportive but not necessary for diagnosis and may appear later|
|Inflammation markers|- Typically identified by neutrophilic leucocytosis, increased serum CRP and ferritin.|

Introduction: Pachydermodactily (PDD) is a rare digital fibromatosis of unknown origine mostly found in adolescent boys. It is manifested by simetrical, painless swelling of the periarticular soft tissues of the fingers without joint involvement. It is thought to be related to repetitive mechanical trauma where patients also can have different cutaneous responses to the attrition of the skin (for example neurodermitis). Treatment is often not indicated given its benign prognosis.

Objectives: These reports aim to define characteristics and increase awareness of the disease that would differentiate it from other disorders that may produce PIP joint swelling, particularly juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Methods: We present clinical, laboratorial and radiological characteristics of 3 male adolescents (aged 17 to 18 years) with simetrical periarticular soft tissue thickening of the fingers.

### Rat-bite fever: an uncommon cause of fever and rash in a 9-year-old patient [^113hKKst]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of fever, acral papulopustular rash, and arthralgias in an immunocompetent child include both systemic infections and inflammatory conditions. Lesions of chronic meningococcemia may be pustular and purpuric and are accompanied by fever and arthralgias. If there is concern for sexual abuse, disseminated gonorrhea and secondary syphilis should also be considered. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is characterized by fever, headache, and malaise followed by erythematous macules on the hands and feet, which may become purpuric or pustular.

Coxsackievirus infection may also present with fever, oral erosions, widespread edematous papules, and vesicopustules involving the hands, feet, perioral skin, and buttocks. Persistence of rash after 10 days argues against coxsackievirus in this case, as does the pustular (rather than vesicular) quality and location of the lesions. Varicella zoster virus lesions are vesicular rather than pustular and heal within 1 to 2 days with scarring. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions that should be considered include acute generalized pustular psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and bowel-associated dermatosis/arthritis syndrome.

The fingertip is the interface between humans and the world, including the various thorns, dirty needles, and other hazards to be found there. It is unsurprising that this is the site where hand infections most frequently occur. Although commonly encountered by hand surgeons and other physicians, fingertip infections have several mimics, and diagnosis and management is not always straightforward. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to success. As with all infections, they are more common and are more aggressive in immunosuppressed patients. This article reviews fingertip anatomy, common and uncommon fingertip infections and their mimics, and recommendations for management.

### Rare case of Lyme borreliosis in a patient presenting with dactylitis and skin rash [^114GHwoR]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Clinical symptoms in LB are not always specific, and LB can look like several diseases. It can cause multisystem disease, particularly affecting the skin, musculoskeletal system, nervous system and heart. Lyme arthritis is usually not painful and is not accompanied by fever. It has been shown that 84% of patients have monarthritis and that the knees are affected in up to 98%. ACA is reported in 1%–3% of LB cases in Europe. ACA and arthritis are late manifestations of LB and may present months to years after the infectious tick bite.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of LB describing asymmetrical dactylitis in a hand. Previously, a case report of LB dactylitis in a toe has been published by Levy et al. Also, diffuse hand and finger swelling has been reported as a striking feature of Lyme arthritis. Borrelia lymphocytoma cutis is a non-tender bluish-red nodule that may mimic dactylitis if it is located in one digit. However, it is typically found on the ear lobe, areola mammae or scrotum.

The diagnosis of LB may be challenging and the diagnosis of disseminated infection is often delayed several years because of the similarity of this entity to other diseases. One of the reasons is that the patients do not always recall a preceding tick bite and dermatological manifestations are not obligatory. Furthermore, once a patient has developed anti- B.b.s.l. antibodies, these can persist for years. B.b.s.l. -specific PCR has a reasonable sensitivity in Lyme arthritis, but with a higher sensitivity in synovial samples than on synovitis fluid (range 40%–96%) but a high specificity (100%). In our case, it was not possible to confirm the diagnosis from PCR of the skin biopsy as the biopsy had been fixated using formaldehyde, but this could have supported the diagnosis. Culture in skin and synovial tissue/fluid is time-consuming and costly and is not recommended in routine diagnostic testing. The diagnosis may further be validated by the histopathological pattern in LB, including varying degrees of superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates mixed with plasma cells and eosinophile. Epidermal changes such as spongiosis are seen in some cases. However, the histological features of EM and ACA are not specific.

### Staphylococcus aureus-associated glomerulonephritis and chronic granulomatous disease in an adolescent male [^116xnNLw]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis (GN) is an uncommon diagnosis in pediatric patients. Empiric therapy with steroids alone could potentially worsen the underlying infectious process in these patients, leading to worse clinical outcomes. An adolescent male diagnosed with GN was subsequently found to have chronic granulomatous disease with a Staphylococcus aureus liver abscess. His GN improved with antibiotics alone. This case illustrates the need to consider chronic infection, and primary immunodeficiency, in the differential diagnosis for new-onset GN.

Clinical Progress

The patient was commenced empirically on cefotaxime 1 g intravenous (IV) 6 hourly and doxycycline 100 mg 12 hourly to cover a potential pulmonary infective source. As noted, she had abnormal liver function tests with a cholestatic predominance. An abdominal ultrasound, performed on Day 4 following symptom onset, demonstrated that her liver measured 15.1 cm in length and had a mildly hyperechoic echotexture. The Gallbladder was reportedly normal with no calculi present. Prominent abdominal lymphadenopathy up to 6 mm was noted.

An infective cause for the fevers was not found despite extensive testing. This included serial blood cultures, serology for Hepatitis A/B/C/E, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Q Fever, Mycoplasma Pneumonia, Leptospirosis, Brucellosis, Anti Streptolysin, Rickettsia, Human Immunodeficiency Virus -1 (HIV-1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), Legionella pneumophila and Dengue.

Autoimmune studies were negative including Antinuclear Antibodies, antibodies to Extractable Nuclear Antigens, anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), anti–liver-kidney microsomal antibody-1 (anti-LKM1) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).

Subsequently, on day 5 following symptom onset, she developed a diffuse swelling of her hands and feet with an associated progression of her rash that resulted in desquamation of her digits. Her tongue took on a strawberry red appearance, prominent cervical lymphadenopathy developed, her sclera became injected and she became visibly jaundiced.

By day 6 of symptom onset, her serum bilirubin reached its peak of 163umol/L (< 20). The patient then developed an oxygen requirement. Chest x-ray demonstrated mild prominence of pulmonary interstitium suggesting a potential atypical infection. Despite antibiotics she continued to have recurrent febrile episodes with chest imaging, on Day 7 post symptom onset, demonstrating the development of left lower lobe consolidation.

She was given a provisional diagnosis of Kawasaki disease with the differential including an undetected infective aetiology. Assessment for cardiac involvement demonstrated no ECG changes, Troponin I was initially normal on presentation and an echocardiogram was normal for age.

Results: An eight years old girl presented with three days of fever associated with left neck swelling, tenderness and torticollis, CT scan demonstrated left retropharyngeal swelling with a hypodense lesion of 45mm with a suspected abscess. No improvement after five days of different antibiotics regimens and surgical intervention. On the 8 th day of fever, symmetrical arthritis of the PIPs, MCPs and MTPs appeared and a non-purulent conjunctivitis as well as a strawberry tongue with swollen dry lips were noted at her examination. A single dose of IVIG led to a rapid clinical improvement and resolution of fever and other signs and symptoms.

Seventeen case reports including our case describing pediatric patients presenting with retropharyngeal abscess, later diagnosed with KD. The patients were predominantly males (82%), age range from 10 months to 9 years with mean age of 5 years, which considered higher than the average of patients with KD. The majority of the cases (94%) initially presented with fever and neck swelling, without additional clinical criteria, leukocytosis was in all patients with average of 18500 WBC/μL. All the cases were initially concerning for possible deep neck bacterial infection, prompting antibiotic therapy and imaging studies. CT\MRI imaging were performed in all the cases, with findings suspicious for retropharyngeal disease, but in the majority without enhancement.

Intravenous antibiotics were administered in 16 patients (94%), surgical drainage was attempted in 7 patients (41%), with two 2 cases (11%) of purulent fluid, only one of them being culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis was delayed beyond 9 febrile days in 5 patients (30%). 41% of the patients had a cardiac manifestation compared to less than 20% in the general pediatrics population who are diagnosed with KD. All the patients had a dramatic and fast clinical improvement with resolution of fever within 24–48 hours after IVIG administration.

Conclusion: KD requires high index of suspicion and awareness of unusual presentations. In our case and literature review Kawasaki disease mimicked a retropharyngeal abscess that was refractory to antibiotics and surgical intervention.

Thus, It should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnosis of patients with febrile lymphadenitis and/or retropharyngeal abscess who do not respond to antibiotic treatment in the relevant clinical context. This can prevent delay in diagnosis and the detrimental sequelae especially cardiac complications.

### Lost bones: differential diagnosis of acro-osteolysis seen by the pediatric rheumatologist [^111yX1e3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis

In the pediatric population, psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jPsA) constitutes one of the subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Musculoskeletal involvement in jPsA may include arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis and axial disease. Involvement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints is more commonly associated with jPsA, and is rarely seen in other subtypes of JIA. jPsA can lead to severe joint damage and deformity. Radiographic features of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) include joint space narrowing and erosions, periostitis, spur formation, ankylosis, and osteolysis including acro-osteolysis. Both patterns of acro-osteolysis can be seen – that of terminal tuft resorption and destruction of the proximal end of the distal phalanx, the latter being rather unique to PsA. Several case reports have described acro-osteolysis in association with PsA, including a case of a middle-aged male with severe psoriatic onychodystrophy and arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints.

We currently care for a 14 year old female patient with jPsA and acro-osteolysis of one toe (Fig. 2). She presented with a history of psoriasis and subacute onset of pain in the affected toe limiting ambulation.

Fig. 2
Frontal radiograph of the toes in a 14 year old female patient with juvenile psoriatic arthritis demonstrates focal soft tissue swelling of the fourth digit, with tapering of the distal phalanx and resorption of the distal tuft cortex

It is worth noting that acro-osteolysis has been reported in association with psoriasis alone, in the absence of arthropathy. Review of the literature revealed a case of a middle-aged woman with psoriasis vulgaris and onycholysis, with severe osteolysis of the distal phalanx of 3 digits, and a case of an elderly man with palmoplantar psoriasis and symmetrical shortening of the distal phalanges, loss of the nails on most digits, and terminal tuft resorption in all finger digits on radiographic imaging.

### Bruising, hives, and joint pain in a 3-year-old boy [^116dYdoi]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the MOST likely diagnosis?
A. Child abuse
B. Serum sickness
C. Serum-sickness like reaction (SSLR)
D. Urticarial vasculitis (UV)
E. Urticaria multiforme

Answers:

A. Child abuse – Incorrect. Child abuse is unlikely given the child's playful nature and symmetric, generalized arthralgias. Polymorphous shaped lesions are not typical of external trauma.
B. Serum sickness – Incorrect. Serum sickness is an immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction triggered by foreign protein; β-lactam antibiotics are not reported triggers. In addition to classic fever, polyarthritis, and diffuse rash, deposition of immune complexes causes multiorgan involvement and low levels of complement.
C. Serum-sickness like reaction (SSLR) – Correct. SSLR is a hypersensitivity reaction which typically occurs in young children treated with antibiotics. Fever and arthralgias accompany blanchable urticaria-like papules and plaques which persist longer than 24–36 hours. Plaques are often annular or arcuate, becoming polymorphous in appearance as lesions coalesce. Pink plaques may become violaceous but remain blanchable and are not reticulated as seen with vascular injury. The overall reaction lasts days to weeks following withdrawal of the offending medication. Resolving lesions classically develop an ecchymotic-appearance and heal with hyperpigmentation. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are frequently elevated.
D. Urticarial vasculitis (UV) – Incorrect. UV is a rare form of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, typically seen in adults. Urticaria-like lesions last > 24 hours and heal with ecchymotic hyperpigmentation. The process is typically chronic with recurrent episodes. Biopsy is required for diagnosis. Hypocomplementemic and normocomplementemic variants exist. The scenario of a single acute episode in a young child argues against UV as the best answer.
E. Urticaria multiforme – Incorrect. Urticaria multiforme is a unique variant of acute urticaria which typically affects young children. Annular and polycyclic wheals with dusky centers last less than 24 hours and heal without hyperpigmentation. Arthralgias are not typical.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^113vpQNh]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

Case presentation

A 14-year old white male, was transferred to our hospital in June 2012 from the Paediatric department of a district hospital because of arthralgias, myalgias and chest pain. The patient was well until 48 hours prior to admission when he started to complain of pain mainly in the upper limbs and chest. The next day he developed fever, rash, malaise and worsening chest pain. A few hours before his visit to the Accident and Emergency department of the district hospital he had a short syncope episode. On the same day he started to feel weakness in both upper and lower limbs, he was unable to walk and was admitted to the district hospital.

The child's medical history was significant for oral antibiotic therapy for an infected epidydymal cyst. Initially he was prescribed ciprofloxacin for 10 days, then cefuroxime for 7 days and co-trimoxazole for another 7 days. The antibiotic therapy was completed one week before the described health problem. In the two years preceding the episode he had reported two episodes of non-specific allergic rashes.

The laboratory work-up performed on admission at the tertiary referral hospital revealed elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) 7,643 U/L and CK-MB isoenzyme 75.8 U/L. Troponin levels were < 50 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 180 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 253 U/L, γ-GT 72 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 146 U/L, total bilirubin 3.14 mg/dl with direct component 1.04 mg/dl. International normalised ratio (INR) was 1.34, and lactate dehydrogenase 760 U/L.

On the third day of hospitalization the child was transferred to our hospital as a referral and on admission he was relatively well with normal vital signs and temperature 37.6°C. On examination, he had an erythematous rash over the face with relative circumoral pallor. An erythematous maculopapular rash was also present over the entire trunk and the extremities. His muscle strength on the upper and lower limbs was decreased (2/5), and the muscles, especially the calves, were slightly painful on palpation, but there was no swelling. The child was unable to walk even after 6 days of hospitalization. In addition, he was complaining of arthralgias especially of the elbow joints but no findings suggestive of arthritis were detected. No abnormal findings were detected from cardiac, respiratory and abdominal examination.

### Rheumatologic conditions in children who may present to the orthopaedic surgeon [^116jJwJt]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by onset of chronic arthritis in childhood. Diagnosis requires onset of disease by age 16 years, persistent arthritis in any joint for ≥ 6 weeks, and exclusion of other conditions that cause arthritis (eg, infection, malignancy, acute rheumatic fever, inflammatory bowel disease). Most patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis present with subacute arthritis with minimal pain and few constitutional symptoms. Laboratory evaluation and imaging are useful to exclude other diagnoses and establish the presence of systemic inflammation. However, these modalities are of limited value in screening for rheumatic diseases, and they may be misleading because of the high rate of false-positive results. Most rheumatologic conditions are diagnosed based on pattern recognition, which is established with a thorough history and physical examination.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^11742Eep]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Joint pain is a common complaint in pediatrics and is most often attributed to overuse or injury. In the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, the differential typically expands to include bony or structural causes versus rheumatologic conditions. Rarely, a child has two distinct causes for joint pain. In this case, an obese 15-year-old male was diagnosed with gout, a disease common in adults but virtually ignored in the field of pediatrics. The presence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) complicated and delayed the consideration of this second diagnosis. Indeed, the absence of gout from this patient's differential diagnosis resulted in a greater than two-year delay in receiving treatment. The patients' BMI was 47.4, and he was also mis-diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans and underwent medical treatment for JIA, assorted imaging studies, and multiple surgical procedures before the key history of increased pain with red meat ingestion, noticed by the patient, and a subsequent elevated uric acid confirmed his ultimate diagnosis. With the increased prevalence of obesity in the adolescent population, the diagnosis of gout should be an important consideration in the differential diagnosis for an arthritic joint in an overweight patient, regardless of age.

Jersey finger — imaging and initial management: Imaging studies, such as radiography and ultrasonography, are used to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for the presence of any associated fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used for a more detailed view of the soft tissue structures and improve preoperative localization of the tendon. Once jersey finger is diagnosed, the finger should be splinted, and expedited referral to a hand surgeon should be pursued. Prompt surgical management is necessary to avoid tendon retraction and decreased blood supply that could affect surgical outcomes.

Atopic dermatitis features a personal or family history of atopy with flexural areas in adolescence and adults. Seborrheic dermatitis involves distribution in areas with sebaceous glands and a distinctive morphology of dull, yellowish-red, sharply demarcated lesions covered with greasy-looking scales. Dyshidrotic eczema presents with small (1–2 mm) vesicles on a nonerythematous base affecting palms/soles/fingers, and it persists for 2–3 weeks before resolving.

Laboratory testing "might include a CBC with or without differential, blood cultures, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, sedimentation rate, and urinalysis". The history and exam should include onset, duration, and pre-infection appearance, evaluate "Depth or size of the ulcer, amount of drainage, swelling, color, odor, and extent of infection", and the ulcer "should be probed to determine the presence of bone or joint involvement, sinus tracts, or extension into tendon sheaths".

Case presentation

A 31-year-old Caucasian female smoker was admitted to the hospital with a 7-week history of fever associated with night sweats, joint pains, myalgia and nasal congestion.

She had already been hospitalised 3 weeks prior to this admission, at which time she was treated with empirical antibiotics for a presumed community-acquired pneumonia as CT scan of the thorax/abdomen/pelvis had revealed subsegmental patchy consolidation of the left lower lobe of the lung.

The patient was readmitted as she continued to have fever despite completing the course of antibiotics prescribed. The history was reviewed in detail with special attention being given to social, sexual and travel history. She had been working in a glass factory for a number of years and had not left the country in recent months. There was no family or sexual history of note and she had no contact with animals apart from her healthy pet dog. The fever had been going on for a total of 7 weeks, and she had also been experiencing drenching night sweats, joint pains and myalgias, with recent development of dizziness and hearing impairment. She denied any gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination she was noted to have conjunctival injection secondary to episcleritis and a non-pruritic maculopapular rash over the upper limbs (figure 1), as well as nodular, tender lesions over her lower limbs. There were no orogenital ulcerations or joint swellings and she was neurologically intact.

On evaluation, he was found to have a femoral arteriolymphatic fistula. He was managed conservatively with ultrasound-guided compression with complete resolution of symptoms at follow-up. This case describes a hitherto unknown complication of percutaneous vascular cannulation presenting in an unusual manner, diagnosed with Doppler Ultrasonography and CT angiography and managed effectively with a non-invasive therapeutic image-guided manoeuvre.

### Acute tear of the fascia cruris at the attachment to the achilles tendon: a new diagnosis [^116D6fKY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The literature describing the fascia cruris is limited to its functional anatomy and its surgical release in the treatment of chronic paratenonitis. Injury to this structure has not been considered previously. Tears of the fascia cruris have been observed on ultrasound and are clinically relevant to diagnosing Achilles pain accurately. Whether it has implications for the development of other Achilles tendon pathology is as yet unknown but warrants further investigation, as are prospective studies to clarify the incidence and confirm the aetiology and the optimum treatment regime. Acute tears of the fascia cruris need to be considered as a cause of Achillodynia with a sudden onset of pain in the active individual. The condition provides a differential diagnosis to paratenonitis.

What are the new findings?

Tears of the fascia cruris can occur at the attachment to the Achilles tendon and the paratenon.
The history is usually of acute onset Achillodynia with pain, swelling and tenderness along the medial or lateral border of the tendon in the mid-portion.
Diagnosis is made using diagnostic ultrasound. Tilting the probe may be required to visualise the fascia cruris attachment to the paratenon.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Recognition of a new pathological diagnosis in acute onset Achillodynia.
Differential diagnosis to paratenonitis but different mechanism and imaging appearances.

### Purpuric eruption in a child [^115SZFvg]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)
B. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)
C. Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD)
D. Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS)
E. Exanthematous drug eruption

Answers:

A. HSP – Incorrect. HSP is a type of small-vessel vasculitis seen mostly in children, commonly after an upper respiratory tract infection. It presents with palpable purpura and is often associated with extracutaneous manifestations such as arthralgias, abdominal pain, and nephritis. Pathology in HSP shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels.
B. RMSF – Incorrect. The patient had no relevant travel history to endemic regions. Additionally, RMSF is commonly preceded by systemic symptoms such as fever, severe headache, and myalgias. Pathology in RMSF shows early perivascular edema, erythrocyte extravasation, thrombosis, and vasculitis in later lesions.
C. HFMD – Incorrect. HFMD presents with oval-shaped vesicles on the hands and feet and oral lesions which were not present in this patient.
D. PPGSS – Correct. The clinical presentation of erythematous and purpuric patches on the hands and feet were consistent with this condition. Serum testing showed Coxsackie B6 as the culprit, a previously reported cause of PPGSS. Pathology showed a superficial perivascular mixed infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and dermal hemorrhage. Because histopathologic findings in PPGSS are nonspecific and common to viral exanthems, biopsy is not needed as part of the evaluation. In this case, it was performed to exclude vasculitis.
E. Exanthematous drug eruption – Incorrect. This condition presents with confluent macules and papules and not exclusively on hands and feet. The patient's parents did not recall any recent medications.

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^116TtaSf]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old, previously healthy girl presented with new-onset, persistent, red, burning hives covering large segments of her body. Associated symptoms included angioedema, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The lesions resolved after 24 hours, leaving behind areas of bruising. On physical examination, the patient appeared well, with scattered, variably sized, purpuric patches and urticarial plaques on the torso and extremities (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal C1q antibody levels, and decreased C4 levels. Two weeks after the initial presentation, she developed the same purpuric eruption accompanied by acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Urticaria multiforme
B. Urticarial vasculitis (UV)
C. Erythema multiforme
D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) (IgA-mediated vasculitis)
E. Hereditary angioedema

### One-year safety evaluation of new hyaluronic acid fillers (YYS series): a prospective, multicenter, observational study [^113fpmc8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, 1 patient developed facial swelling on the left cheek that was associated with redness and pain without any palpable nodule 22 days after the injection. The patient had been treated with a total of 2-mL YYS 720. The severity was mild, and the patient recovered by the 12th day after the adverse event had occurred (the 33rd day from the first injection) after receiving glucocorticoids and piperazine derivatives. The delayed hypersensitivity reaction completely resolved without sequelae.

Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are characterized by induration, erythema, and edema without a palpable nodule and are mediated by T lymphocytes. The differential diagnosis includes erysipelas, which also causes erythema; however, there is usually a fever with the latter. Delayed hypersensitivity and delayed-onset nodules have a shared causation. Similar to delayed-onset nodule formation, cross-linked hyaluronic acid induces delayed hypersensitivities in vivo, with increased production of immunoglobulin G. Moreover, it is considered to be type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity mediated by T cells. The raw materials of hyaluronic acid–based fillers are mainly obtained by culturing and purifying Streptococcus, and an immune response may occur due to impurities, such as any remaining bacterial proteins or endotoxins, after the manufacturing process. There was 1 case (0.10%, 1/1,022) of delayed-onset hypersensitivity reported during the one-year follow-up of this study, which was slightly lower than the incidence rate of delayed-onset reactions (0.0%–4.25%), including delayed-onset hypersensitivity, reported in the related literature (Table 3).

Introduction: Multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel medical condition firstly reported in COVID-19 pandemic which was difficult to diagnose because of mimicking many other diseases. Various mucocutaneous manifestations in MIS-C are common, mostly Kawasaki-like features including maculopapular eruption, conjunctivitis and cheilitis but rarely seen angioedema in literature review.

Objectives: To describe the rare manifestation in a case of MIS-C who presented with angioedema that was successfully treated by corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) without further complications.

Methods: A case report

Results: A previously healthy 10-year-old boy presented with high grade fever and angioedema-like face for 3 days prior to admission. He was diagnosed as angioedema at previous hospital and treated by anti-histamine and empirical antibiotics but the clinical was not improved. He has got 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since last 2 months and recently had history of COVID-19 infection in the past 2 weeks which was asymptomatic. He was referred to our hospital on the third day of illness with ongoing fever and facial puffiness. His temperature was 38.8 0 C on admission, pulse rate was 110 bpm and blood pressure was 127/66 mmHg. He had no specific source of infection on physical examination. He also had palmoplantar erythema and swollen dorsum of both hands and feet, non-purulent bilateral conjunctival injection and generalized urticarial rash. The investigation showed high white cell count, 27.5 × 10³ u/L (normal 4.5–11) with neutrophils 94%, lymphocytes 4.1%, eosinophils 0.1%; ESR, 21 mm/hr (normal 0–15); CRP, 170.1 mg/L (normal 0–5); LDH, 655 U/L (normal 0–250); serum ferritin, 408 ng/mL (normal 25–350); D-dimer, > 10000 ng/mL (normal < 500), and interleukin-6 level, 252.2 pg/mL (normal 0–7) which were highly suggestive of hyper-inflammatory process. There was perivascular echogenic brightness of right coronary artery on echocardiography without any aneurysm and pericardial effusion and the left ventricular function was still good. Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) and IVIG were considered as combination therapy in this case. He was also given aspirin and enoxaparin for thrombotic prophylaxis. The clinical was rapidly improved and the echocardiography returned to normal in the second week after treatment. The oral corticosteroid was tapered off within 6 weeks.

### Tuberculous dactylitis in the setting of low serum vitamin D: a case report [^112sQKG8]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

We present the case of a previously well patient who presented to the Emergency Department of a Dublin hospital with a tuberculous infection of his dominant index finger and a very low serum vitamin D level — this has been implicated in both primary and reactivation infections with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. This case highlights and reviews both the importance of considering non-endemic pathologies in the setting of a patient base of diverse ethnicity, and the emerging importance of vitamin D in the immune response to M. tuberculosis infection. We discuss the relevant literature to highlight the background of this disease process, and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to these patients.

### The challenges in diagnosing isolated epididymal tuberculosis (TB) in an adolescent male: a case report [^112Z4jxK]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old male complained of painful swelling on the left scrotal for the last 3 months before visiting respirology clinic in April 2023. This lump had first appeared on the left scrotum approximately a year before admission (February 2022). However, the pain persisted even after receiving paracetamol 500 mg q.i.d orally from the community health center for 1 week. The complaint was accompanied by a persistent cough for 2 months and no weight gain in the last year. There were no complaints of fever, urinary problems, or history of trauma to the genital area. In February 2023, the patient was taken to the regional hospital and treated for 4 days, receiving ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg/day intravenously, and the genital US showed left epididymitis. There were no TB contacts identified, and no history of drug abuse, smoking, or active sexual intercourse. The patient was well-nourished, had not been given the BCG vaccine, and lived in a district 13.2 km from the capital city, with low-income family.

### An 11-year-old male with periorbital edema and painful subcutaneous nodules [^111y3jbG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Case Presentation

An 11‐year‐old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the 6 weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low‐grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for 3 weeks, 1 year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. The patient was normotensive and intermittently febrile without consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C). On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet (Figure 1), with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema (Figure 2). An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] > 130 mm/h; C‐reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL). He had an elevated anti‐streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken (Figures 3 and 4).

### Dermatologic emergencies… [^113xMK7F]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGY Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most common rickettsial disease in the United States. It has an overall mortality rate of 5 to 10 percent. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. The diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is primarily clinical. The classic triad of symptoms associated with the disease includes fever, headache, and rash in a person with a history of tick bite or exposure to ticks. 8 Patients also may present with nausea, vomiting, myalgia, anorexia, and severe abdominal pain. 1–12 It begins around the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles, eventually covering the extremities and trunk. The face is usually spared. A rash on the palms and soles is a distinct distribution that occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 9, 17 However, other exanthems can present with fever and rash on the palms and soles.

16 In patients with severe disease in whom treatment is delayed, complications can include cardiac and renal failure, meningitis, and pneumonitis. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis often have a history of a wound or trauma. Common symptoms include fever and chills, with heat, erythema, edema, and pain over a focal area of skin. 19 The pain is typically out of proportion to the physical findings, which can help distinguish this condition from cellulitis. The erythematous skin develops a dusky blue discoloration. Yellow vesicular and bullous lesions form over the erythematous skin, with some serosanguineous drainage. Impetigo, cellulitis, and toxic shock syndrome can mimic these lesions. After four to five days, the bullae become violaceous, and the skin becomes gangrenous. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings.

After one to three weeks of exposure to the causative agent, a prodrome of fever, malaise, headache, cough, and conjunctivitis develops. 3 The skin lesions appear one to three days after the prodrome 23. 3 The lesions initially appear as erythematous macules with dark purpuric centers, then form atypical target lesions with central dusky purpura or a central bulla, with surrounding macular erythema.

### Diffuse erythema with… [^117WjRbe]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physician should identify the primary lesion but also note the presence of secondary lesions. Important features include the distribution, configuration and arrangement of the lesions. 2 In addition to evaluating the patient's vital signs and general appearance, the physician should look for the following: signs of toxicity, adenopathy, oral, genital or conjunctival lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, evidence of excoriations or tenderness, and signs of nuchal rigidity or neurologic dysfunction. ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER The prodrome may include malaise, chills, a feverish feeling, anorexia and irritability. The onset of symptoms may be abrupt, with the predominant features being fever, severe headache, generalized myalgia, shaking rigor, photophobia, prostration and nausea.

The diagnosis can be difficult when the onset is gradual and no rash is present, as is the case in up to 20 percent of adults and 5 percent of children with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 16 When rash is present, it develops on approximately the fourth day of illness. Its appearance, combined with the temporal evolution, is characteristic of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The rash typically begins as pink macules, 2 to 6 mm in diameter, located on the wrists, forearms, ankles, palms and soles. Within six to 18 hours, the rash spreads centrally to involve the arms, thighs, trunk and face. In the ensuing one to three days, the lesions evolve into deep-red papules. Within two to four days after onset of the rash, the lesions become petechiae. 4 Included in the differential diagnosis of petechial rash are disseminated gonococcal infections, bacteremia, staphylococcemia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Diffuse Erythema with Desquamation SCARLET FEVER Scarlet fever provides the classic example of an erythematous rash with subsequent desquamation. Most common between one and 10 years of age, 18 scarlet fever usually follows an acute infection of the tonsils or skin by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci that produce an erythrogenic exotoxin. 2 Patients may appear acutely ill and have fever, sore throat, headache, chills, nausea and vomiting. 1, 18.

### Clinical signs and symptoms of chikungunya virus disease… [^114DqwGQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Chikungunya virus disease should be suspected in patients with acute fever and polyarthralgia and recent travel to an area with chikungunya virus.
- Several other viruses, including dengue, should be considered in the differential diagnosis depending on travel history and exposures.
- Rare and serious complications of chikungunya virus disease can occur, particularly among certain risk groups.
- Disease is usually self-limited, but some patients experience persistent arthralgia for months to years. The differential diagnosis varies based on place of residence, travel history, and exposures. Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the same mosquitoes and have similar clinical features. These viruses can circulate in the same area and can cause occasional co-infections in the same patient.

Chikungunya virus infection is more likely to cause high fever, severe arthralgia, arthritis, rash, and lymphopenia, while dengue virus infection is more likely to cause neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, shock, and death. In addition to dengue and Zika, other diagnostic considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, parvovirus, enteroviruses, adenovirus, other alphavirus infections, post-infectious arthritis, and rheumatologic conditions. The disease is most often characterized by acute onset of fever and polyarthralgia. Joint symptoms are usually bilateral and symmetric and can be severe and debilitating. Other symptoms can include headache, myalgia, arthritis, conjunctivitis, nausea/vomiting, or maculopapular rash.

Rare complications include uveitis, retinitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, bullous skin lesions, hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cranial nerve palsies. Persons at risk for severe disease include neonates exposed intrapartum or shortly after birth, older adults, and persons with underlying medical conditions. Clinical assessment Clinical laboratory findings can include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine. Elevated hepatic transaminases can be seen with acute infection but are not specific and do not occur frequently enough to be diagnostic.
