## Question

carotenemia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about carotenemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining carotenemia and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and how to distinguish it from jaundice. Next, I will review etiologies, including dietary, supplemental, and disease-associated causes. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach and when to order labs. Then, I will outline management principles and prognosis. Finally, I should consider special populations, potential harms of supplementation, and synthesize a practical clinical takeaway with citations integrated throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism. Carotenemia, also called carotenoderma, is a benign yellow-orange discoloration of the skin due to elevated serum carotenoids, most often β-carotene, with deposition in the stratum corneum and sweat glands rather than true systemic toxicity, and it spares the sclerae, which helps distinguish it from jaundice [^113HgyKs] [^1118wJBy] [^114Lobrp].

> Wait, let me verify the classic distribution. The yellow-orange hue is most prominent on the palms, soles, and nasolabial folds, and in more pronounced cases can generalize, but the sclerae remain white, which is a key bedside differentiator from bilirubin-related jaundice that typically involves the sclerae early [^113HgyKs] [^116Sxs6N].

> I need to check the primary etiologies. The most common cause is excessive intake of carotene-rich foods such as carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, and other yellow-orange vegetables, with case reports even documenting carotenemia from green beans and lycopene-rich foods, underscoring that the pigment source can vary beyond classic β-carotene sources [^116nxJeh] [^1118wJBy] [^113HgyKs].

> Hold on, I should verify supplemental sources as well. β-carotene pills and multivitamin or antioxidant supplements containing β-carotene can raise serum carotenoids and cause skin discoloration, and this is particularly relevant in patients who self-prescribe high-dose antioxidants or are following eye-health regimens that historically included β-carotene [^112JHpzA] [^112FXXVu].

> Let me consider disease-associated causes. Metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, and liver or kidney disease have been linked to carotenemia, likely via altered lipid transport or impaired conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A, and case series document hypercarotenemia in anorexia nervosa, reinforcing the metabolic component [^112JHpzA] [^116ggRhR].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic distribution of yellow-orange skin sparing the sclerae and a dietary or supplemental history of high carotenoid intake; if uncertainty remains, serum β-carotene can be measured, recognizing that normal ranges vary by lab and that values are typically elevated in carotenemia, while liver enzymes and bilirubin remain normal, helping exclude hepatic disease [^113HgyKs] [^116nxJeh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to routinely order liver function tests for everyone, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in straightforward cases with clear dietary history and no systemic signs, LFTs are unnecessary, whereas they are reasonable if there are concerning features or suspected liver disease, so I should tailor testing rather than apply a blanket approach [^116nxJeh].

> Next, I should review management. The cornerstone is dietary modification to reduce carotene intake over weeks to months, with reassurance that the condition is benign and self-limited; in infants, carotenemia resolves spontaneously as complementary feeding diversifies, and in adults, eliminating excessive β-carotene supplements and moderating intake of intensely pigmented vegetables typically leads to gradual clearing as the stratum corneum turns over [^113HgyKs] [^112JHpzA].

> I will now examine prognosis. Carotenemia carries an excellent prognosis with no known permanent sequelae once the excess carotenoid source is removed, and the skin discoloration fades over weeks to months depending on the rate of epidermal turnover and adherence to dietary change [^113HgyKs] [^1118wJBy].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population. In infants and young children, carotenemia is common and benign, often related to pureed vegetables and early feeding patterns, and resolves with dietary diversification; in patients with anorexia nervosa, hypercarotenemia may persist until nutritional rehabilitation improves lipid metabolism; in smokers or those with asbestos exposure, I should counsel against β-carotene supplements due to increased lung cancer risk, even though carotenemia itself is cosmetic rather than carcinogenic [^113HgyKs] [^116ggRhR] [^1146Dsqg] [^115CoT46].

> I should double-check the safety context of supplementation. High-dose β-carotene supplements have been associated with increased lung cancer incidence in smokers and former asbestos workers, and major guidelines recommend against β-carotene for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer; in AMD care, AREDS2 replaced β-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin to mitigate this risk, so patients using eye supplements should be steered toward β-carotene–free formulations when appropriate [^1146Dsqg] [^1153F2fW] [^117QvE7f] [^112HgqgB].

> Let me reconsider the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Carotenoids are lipophilic and accumulate in the stratum corneum and sweat, which explains the predilection for palms, soles, and nasolabial folds, and recent imaging work supports deposition in the stratum corneum and sweat glands, aligning with the clinical observation that sweating can accentuate the hue [^1118wJBy].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical clinical takeaway. Carotenemia is a benign, diet-related skin discoloration with a classic distribution sparing the sclerae; confirm with history, reserve labs for atypical cases, manage with dietary moderation and removal of excess β-carotene sources, and provide reassurance; in smokers, avoid β-carotene supplements due to lung cancer risk, and in infants, anticipate spontaneous resolution as the diet diversifies [^116Sxs6N] [^113HgyKs] [^1146Dsqg].

Carotenemia is a **benign, reversible yellow-orange skin discoloration** caused by excess dietary β-carotene, most often from carrots, sweet potatoes, or squash [^113HgyKs]. It is most prominent on the palms, soles, and nasolabial folds, with **sclerae spared**, distinguishing it from jaundice [^114Lobrp]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by dietary history and normal bilirubin; serum carotene may be elevated but is not routinely needed [^116nxJeh]. Management is dietary modification — reducing carotene intake — with resolution in weeks to months; no treatment is otherwise required [^112JWUf6]. Carotenemia is common in infants and vegetarians, and is not harmful [^113HgyKs].

---

## Clinical features

- **Skin discoloration**: Yellow-orange hue, most pronounced on palms, soles, and nasolabial folds; sclerae are not involved, helping distinguish from jaundice [^113HgyKs] [^114Lobrp].
- **Absence of systemic symptoms**: No pruritus, fatigue, or other systemic signs.
- **Associated conditions**: May occur with diabetes, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, or liver/kidney disease [^112JHpzA] [^116ggRhR].

---

## Pathophysiology

Carotenemia reflects **excess β-carotene intake** from yellow/orange vegetables and fruits; β-carotene is converted to vitamin A as needed, and excess is stored in skin and adipose tissue [^116nxJeh] [^111Ub8TY]. Impaired conversion or transport (e.g. diabetes, hypothyroidism, liver disease) can increase risk [^116nxJeh].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical evaluation**: Characteristic distribution and dietary history are key [^113HgyKs].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serum carotene may be elevated; bilirubin is normal, helping exclude jaundice [^116nxJeh].
- **Differential diagnosis**: Jaundice, lycopenemia, and other pigmentary disorders [^113HgyKs] [^1118wJBy].

---

## Management

Management centers on **dietary modification** — reducing carotene-rich foods — with resolution in weeks to months [^113HgyKs] [^112JWUf6]. No pharmacologic therapy is needed, and prognosis is excellent [^113HgyKs].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent**; carotenemia is benign and resolves with dietary change [^113HgyKs]. No complications are reported, and the condition is not harmful [^113HgyKs].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **moderating intake** of carotene-rich foods and avoiding excessive supplementation [^116nxJeh] [^112FXXVu].

---

Carotenemia is a **harmless, diet-related skin discoloration** that resolves with dietary change; recognition prevents unnecessary testing and reassures patients [^113HgyKs] [^116nxJeh].

### Carotenemia in infancy and its association with prevalent feeding practices [^113HgyKs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Carotenemia in infancy is a relatively rare but benign condition, invariably of dietary origin, that can be confused with jaundice. It is characterized by an abnormal yellowish orange pigmentation of the skin, most prominently seen in the palms, soles, and naso-labial folds. Infant feeding patterns have shown an increasing trend toward the usage of homogenized and pureed vegetables as well as meat-based commercial preparations. Whether this is reflected in an increased incidence of carotenemia in this age group still remains unclear. We report a series of infants identified by a retrospective review of records, observed over a 3-year period (1999–2002) in a tertiary children's hospital, who developed the condition that resolved spontaneously without intervention, as they grew older, on a changing diet.

### A case of carotenemia associated with ingestion of nutrient supplements [^112JHpzA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Carotenemia is characterized by an abnormal yellowish orange pigmentation of the skin, most prominently seen on the palms and soles. Although it is associated with several disease such as diabetes, hypothyroidism and anorexia nervosa, it is caused by excessive intake of carotene-rich food such as oranges and carrots in most cases. Herein, we describe an interesting case of carotenemia in a 66-year-old female secondary to increased ingestion of oral supplements of carotene in order to improve hemorrhage in the eyeground. There could be an increasing trend of intake of commercial nutrient supplements in which case it is necessary to remind ourselves that commercial nutrient supplements could cause various skin disorders as side-effects.

### Carotenemia associated with green bean ingestion [^116nxJeh]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Carotenemia is a condition characterized by yellow discoloration of the skin and elevated blood carotene levels. Excessive and prolonged ingestion of carotene-rich, yellow- or orange-colored foods such as carrots and winter squash is the most common cause, but more rarely it may be associated with consumption of other foods as well as with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, anorexia nervosa, liver disease, or kidney disease. Though not uncommon in children, there are few reports in the pediatric literature since its early descriptions in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Awareness of carotenemia can help the provider resolve confusion with jaundice and avoid unnecessary worry and costly tests. Herein we describe carotenemia in an 8-month-old Caucasian girl secondary to increased consumption of commercial infant food green beans.

### Antioxidant supplements to prevent mortality [^112DsmfK]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antioxidant supplements associated with higher or lower all-cause mortality?

Bottom Line

Antioxidant supplements are not associated with lower all-cause mortality. Beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A may be associated with higher all-cause mortality.

### Carotenoderma due to lycopenemia: a case report and evaluation of lycopene deposition in the skin [^1118wJBy]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Carotenoderma is a yellow-orange coloration of the skin caused by high levels of serum carotenoids, mostly due to the excessive intake of carotenoid-rich foods. The yellowish coloration is typically observed on the palms, soles, and nasolabial folds. Although the physical appearance is prominent, the condition itself is benign and harmless. Diagnosing carotenoderma is not difficult because of its unique manifestations, but its pathophysiology remains unclear. We report a relatively rare case of carotenoderma due to lycopenemia caused by the excessive intake of lycopene-rich vegetables and fruits. Lycopene is a carotenoid component that is distinguished by the high absorption of light around 488nm. Given these characteristics, we examined a hematoxylin-eosin-stained specimen from the patient and tape-stripped samples by fluorescent microscopy with 488nm wavelength emission and compared them with normal skin samples. Notably, the patient's samples showed a weaker autofluorescence in the stratum corneum and sweat glands. Furthermore, we measured carotenoid concentrations in the patient's skin noninvasively with Vegecheck® and found a higher score than the average of 24 healthy volunteers. These results support the long-held hypothesis that carotenoids are secreted in sweat and are deposited in the stratum corneum. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have measured skin carotenoid levels nor detailed the pathological findings of carotenoderma patients. This case further highlights that the excessive intake of lycopene causes carotenoderma and demonstrates that carotenoid deposition is particularly pronounced in the stratum corneum of the skin.

### Provitamin A metabolism and functions in mammalian biology [^111Ub8TY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in developing countries. Some studies also implicate a suboptimal vitamin A intake in certain parts of the population of the industrialized world. Provitamin A carotenoids such as β-carotene are the major source for retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) in the human diet. However, it is still controversial how much β-carotene intake is required and safe. An important contributor to this uncertainty is the lack of knowledge about the biochemical and molecular basis of β-carotene metabolism. Recently, key players of provitamin A metabolism have been molecularly identified and biochemically characterized. Studies in knockout mouse models showed that intestinal β-carotene absorption and conversion to retinoids is under negative feedback regulation that adapts this process to the actual requirement of vitamin A of the body. These studies also showed that in peripheral tissues a conversion of β-carotene occurs and affects retinoid-dependent physiologic processes. Moreover, these analyses provided a possible explanation for the adverse health effects of carotenoids by showing that a pathologic accumulation of these compounds can induce oxidative stress in mitochondria and cell signaling pathways related to disease. Genetic polymorphisms in identified genes exist in humans and also alter carotenoid homeostasis. Here, the advanced knowledge of β-carotene metabolism is reviewed, which provides a molecular framework for understanding the role of this important micronutrient in health and disease.

### A global clinical view on vitamin A and carotenoids [^114rFxuB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical importance of vitamin A as an essential nutrient has become increasingly clear. Adequate vitamin A is required for normal organogenesis, immune competence, tissue differentiation, and the visual cycle. Deficiency, which is widespread throughout the developing world, is responsible for a million or more instances of unnecessary death and blindness each year. β-Carotene is an important, but insufficient, source of vitamin A among poor populations, which accounts for the widespread nature of vitamin A deficiency. It has only recently become apparent that the bioconversion of traditional dietary sources of β-carotene to vitamin A is much less efficient than previously supposed. The other major carotenoids, particularly lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, have been found to have important biological properties, including antioxidant and photoprotective activity, and high intake has been linked in observational studies with reduced risk of a number of chronic diseases. But, to date, no clinical trials have proven the clinical value of ingested carotenoids individually or in combination, in either physiologic or pharmacologic doses, with the excepton of the provitamin A activity of carotene. Indeed, several trials have suggested an increased risk of lung cancer among high-risk individuals (smokers and asbestos workers) who were given high doses of β-carotene alone or in combination with other antioxidants. Much more evidence is needed before commonly encountered claims of the value of ingesting high doses of non-provitamin A carotenoids are validated.

### Randomised β-carotene supplementation and incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease in women: is the association modified by baseline plasma level? [^112X2dLu]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

In a nested case-control study of 513 women with cancer; 130 with cardiovascular disease and equal numbers of controls, we found no effect of randomised beta-carotene on risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease within any quartile of baseline plasma beta-carotene, nor was there a trend across quartiles (P for trend 0.15 and 0.62, respectively).

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1146Dsqg]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Beta carotene with or without vitamin A — benefits and harms from randomized clinical trials (RCTs): A pooled analysis found an increased risk that was not statistically significant for all-cause mortality over 4 to 12 years of follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.00–1.12]; 6 RCTs; n = 112 820), while a pooled analysis of 5 studies showed a statistically significant increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality at 4 to 12 years (Peto OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02–1.19]; 5 RCTs; n = 54 506); among persons who smoke or were exposed to asbestos, beta carotene increased lung cancer risk (risk ratio [RR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03–1.36]) and beta carotene plus vitamin A also increased risk (adjusted RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.04–1.57]).

### Randomised β-carotene supplementation and incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease in women: is the association modified by baseline plasma level? [^115SBnbm]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Strengths of the present study include good compliance with randomised treatment assignment and careful documentation of endpoints. A major limitation, however, is that randomised treatment with β-carotene lasted only 2.1 years before early termination, so we could not evaluate long-term treatment. Follow-up duration was also limited; the relatively few cases of cardiovascular disease led to findings with wide confidence intervals. Another concern is that only 71% of WHS women provided blood samples at baseline and analyses were limited to women with a baseline blood sample. However, adjustment for multiple risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular disease, which might be related to baseline blood contribution, did not change the results.

In conclusion, these data do not suggest that β-carotene supplementation is beneficial to individuals with the lowest plasma levels of β-carotene as found within this study. However, because subjects were adequately nourished, we could not examine this question among those with levels of β-carotene that might be seen in a malnourished population. Further, treatment duration was short, precluding the evaluation of long-term supplementation.

### Retinoid and carotenoid status in serum and liver among patients at high-risk for liver cancer [^112BPMBh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a decrease in serum retinol, β-carotene, and RBP4 is associated with early stage HCV. Retinoid and carotenoid levels decline as disease progresses, and our data suggest that this decline occurs early in the disease process, even before fibrosis is apparent. Measures of oxidative stress are associated with fibrosis stage and concurrent antioxidant depletion. Vitamin A loss is accompanied by stellate cell activation in hepatic tissue. Our data highlight the potential importance of dietary retinoids and carotenoids as determinants of progression in early chronic liver disease and support the need for mechanistic studies leading to well-designed intervention studies.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1174k8vJ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations — community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults: The USPSTF recommends against the use of beta carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the use of multivitamin supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the use of single- or paired-nutrient supplements (other than beta carotene and vitamin E) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114xnacV]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF recommendation — vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer in adults: The USPSTF again concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of multivitamins and single- or paired-nutrient supplements (except beta carotene and vitamin E) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer, and it again recommends against the use of beta carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer; an important harm noted is increased lung cancer incidence with beta carotene in persons who smoke tobacco or have occupational exposure to asbestos, and the scope focuses on community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults 18 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or chronic disease (other than hypertension, overweight, or obesity) or nutritional deficiencies.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111VSLDD]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evidence assessment — benefits and harms: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of beta carotene supplementation outweigh the benefits for prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer and concludes with moderate certainty that there is no net benefit of vitamin E supplementation. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of multivitamins, and is insufficient for single or paired nutrients other than beta carotene and vitamin E, for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1173qShP]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF assessment of magnitude of net benefit — vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplements for prevention: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of beta carotene supplementation outweigh the benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer, and also concludes with moderate certainty that there is no net benefit of supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. For multivitamins and for single or paired nutrients (other than beta carotene and vitamin E), the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

### Association of serum α-tocopherol, β-carotene, and retinol with liver cancer incidence and chronic liver disease mortality [^112HFBjF]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Although such observations may appear to conflict with what has been observed in the epidemiologic literature, as well in our study, observational cohorts that evaluate the relationship between serum micronutrients and liver cancer or liver disease address different hypotheses than randomised controlled trials. Oftentimes, randomised controlled trials, such as ATBC, are conducted in the context of assessing the efficacy of supplementation among older individuals who may have already aged past the critical aetiological window where supplementation may have been helpful. In contrast, observational studies utilise markers that may reflect long-term dietary intake and metabolism, perhaps reflecting micronutrient status during the critical window of disease pathogenesis. It is also possible that the serum micronutrients act as proxies for other aspects of diet and lifestyle such that observed associations in our study reflect confounding. For example, eating foods rich in β -carotene may substantially provide many different nutrients, whereas supplementation with β -carotene provides just one. Although we adjusted for known risk factors in the current analysis, other unmeasured or poorly measured confounders are possible.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115XLh8X]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin supplement harms and uncertainties — key considerations: For many vitamins and nutrients, there was little evidence of serious harms; however, an important harm of increased lung cancer incidence was reported with the use of beta carotene by persons who smoke tobacco or have occupational exposure to asbestos, and excessive doses of vitamin supplements can cause adverse effects; it is uncertain whether there might be heterogeneity across populations or by baseline nutrient level, or by socioeconomic factors such as food insecurity, in the effects of vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation on cardiovascular disease and cancer outcomes.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111pjcrL]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — benefits and harms evidence: Adequate evidence that supplementation with beta carotene provides no benefit in preventing cardiovascular disease or cancer and adequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin E provides no benefit in preventing cardiovascular disease or cancer are reported, while there is inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with multivitamins and inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with single or paired nutrients (other than beta carotene and vitamin E) in preventing cardiovascular disease or cancer. Regarding harms, there is adequate evidence that beta carotene causes small harms in increasing the risk for lung cancer in persons at increased risk, adequate evidence that vitamin E causes at most small harms, adequate evidence that multivitamins cause at most small harms, and inadequate evidence on the harms of supplementation with single or paired nutrients (other than beta carotene or vitamin E).

### Genetic loci controlling carotenoid biosynthesis in diverse tropical maize lines [^115NWJ2h]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Carotenoids are diverse organic pigments that are naturally found in plants and other organisms. The β-ionone ring(s) containing carotenoids, known as provitamin A carotenoids (e.g. β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and α-carotene), are precursors of the essential micronutrient vitamin A in humans. However, humans cannot synthesize vitamin A de novo, and therefore need to obtain the nutrient from dietary sources either as preformed vitamin A (retinol) from animal-based foods (e.g. liver, whole milk, and egg), and/or as precursors of vitamin A from colored vegetables and fruits (e.g. carrots, dark green leaves and papaya) in the form of provitamin A carotenoids.

Vitamin A deficiency is a global public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 190 million pre-school children and 19 million pregnant women worldwide were vitamin A deficient (in the period 1995–2005) with a prevalence rate of 33 and 15%, respectively, based on low serum retinol content (< 0.7 μmol/liter). Almost half a million children lose their sight every year due to xerophtalmia caused by vitamin A deficiency, the leading cause of preventable blindness. Millions of child deaths annually are attributed to vitamin A deficiency coupled with other undernutrition problems.

Genetic improvement of staple crops for improved nutritional quality (e.g. enhanced level of micronutrients) has been termed biofortification and is a promising approach for reducing vitamin A and other micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. Maize represents a significant proportion of the total calorie intake of people in many African countries, accounting for ∼30% of the per-capita calorie consumption in Eastern and Southern Africa, even reaching as high as 56% in some of the southern African countries (FAO, 2011). The biofortification of maize with higher levels of provitamin A carotenoids could play a significant role in reducing vitamin A deficiency in regions where maize is a major staple crop. While breeding lines of maize that can accumulate up to 26 μg/g β-carotene (and 30 μg/g of provitamin A carotenoids) in the endosperm have been reported, commonly cultivated maize varieties contain low levels of provitamin A carotenoids ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 μg/g.

### Association of serum α-tocopherol, β-carotene, and retinol with liver cancer incidence and chronic liver disease mortality [^112UkmhM]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

One particular concern is underlying liver disease, as the liver plays a critical role in micronutrient metabolism. For example, the liver is the primary storage site for retinol. Serum levels of retinol and its primary precursor, β -carotene, may represent hepatic levels of retinol and possibly reflect health status of the liver, although this has been debated. Low baseline levels of β -carotene and retinol that are a consequence of any underlying liver cancer or CLD could contribute to the associations that we observed in this study.

In addition, local inflammation is thought to play a critical role in the progression of CLD and development of liver cancer. A growing literature has inversely linked systemic levels of inflammation with micronutrient status, possibly by effects on micronutrient metabolism in the liver. Whether these data are relevant to our current findings is unclear, especially as the typically measured marker of systemic inflammation, C-reactive protein, is itself metabolised in the liver and may also be affected by underlying liver disease. It would also be important to measure local inflammation in liver tissue. Yet, this cannot be done in large-scale cohort studies of healthy volunteers, such as the current study. In lag analyses, we observe similar associations even in cases occurring even more than 10 years after our micronutrient measurements, and this offers some evidence that our results are not simply reflective of participants with late-stage underlying liver disease having lower micronutrient levels. Nevertheless, we cannot specifically exclude this possibility and future complementary analyses in clinical populations with extensive data on underlying liver disease are needed.

### Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and carotenaemia [^112V5LBX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a congenital ectodermal disorder that causes erythrokeratoderma, vascularizing keratitis, and neurosensory deafness. We report a form of this syndrome in a patient with no evidence of keratitis. In addition this individual had clinical and biochemical evidence of carotenaemia. Carotenaemia occurring in association with KID syndrome has not been reported previously.

### The rationale and evidence base for a protective role of macular pigment in age-related maculopathy [^115msCo2]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Age-related maculopathy (ARM) remains the most common cause of blind registration in people aged 50 years or over in the developed world, and its prevalence continues to rise. Although effective new treatments have become available in the recent past, these are expensive and cumbersome to the healthcare provider and to the patient, and many cases remain resistant to such therapy. There is a biologically plausible rationale whereby macular pigment, which is entirely of dietary origin, may prevent or delay the onset, or ameliorate the clinical course, of ARM. In this article, we review this rationale, and critically appraise the current evidence base germane to the use of supplements containing the macular carotenoids in patients with, or at risk of developing, ARM.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^1179hpGi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Circulating plant sterols/stanols (PS), cardiovascular disease risk, and fat‑soluble vitamins: Despite interest in PS and coronary heart disease (CHD), findings have not supported a clear link between circulating PS concentrations in the normal range and cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. A meta-analysis included 17 studies involving 11,182 participants — 8 studies reporting risk ratios for CVD in relation to PS concentrations and 15 studies reporting standardized mean differences — and concluded there is no relationship between serum PS concentrations and CVD risk over a 3- to 4-fold difference in serum plant sterol concentrations. Randomized trials show PS consumption lowers blood β‑carotene by about 25%, α‑carotene by 10%, and vitamin E by 8%.

### Carrot man: a case of excessive β-carotene ingestion [^113koVrd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

In this case report, the authors describe a 48-year-old male who complained to his primary care physician of abdominal discomfort and yellow/orange skin discoloration. Physical examination was normal except for some mild mid-abdominal discomfort (no observed skin color changes). An abdominal CT scan indicated a colon that was full of stool. Laboratory studies indicated elevated liver enzymes. Upon further questioning, the patient reported ingesting 6–7 pounds of carrots per week to facilitate his dieting effort. The patient was diagnosed with constipation, hypercarotinemia, and possible vitamin A toxicity. Following the cessation of excessive carrot ingestion, his liver enzymes normalized within 1 month.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112FXXVu]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Harms of vitamin and mineral supplementation — serious harms were uncommon overall, with notable risks for beta carotene at specific doses. For many supplements there was little to no evidence of serious harms. The most serious harm identified was increased cardiovascular disease mortality and increased risk of lung cancer in persons who smoke and workplace asbestos exposure, associated with beta carotene supplementation at doses of 30 and 20 mg/d. One of these trials also co-administered vitamin A at a dose of 25 000 IU/d, which exceeds the current tolerable upper intake level for vitamin A in adults. A minor harm of beta carotene was orange discoloration.

### Vitamin A and beta (β)-carotene supplementation for cystic fibrosis [^115G6F9n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency are at risk of a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency predominantly causes eye and skin problems, while excessive levels of vitamin A can harm the respiratory and skeletal systems in children and interfere with the metabolism of other fat-soluble vitamins. Most CF centres administer vitamin A as supplements to reduce the frequency of vitamin A deficiency in people with CF and to improve clinical outcomes such as growth, although the recommended dose varies between different guidelines. Thus, a systematic review on vitamin A and vitamin A-like supplementation (carotenes or other retinoids) in people with CF would help guide clinical practice. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To determine if supplementation with vitamin A, carotenes or other retinoid supplements in children and adults with CF reduces the frequency of vitamin A deficiency disorders, improves general and respiratory health and affects the frequency of vitamin A toxicity.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Additionally we searched several ongoing trials registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry. Most recent database searches: 01 June 2018.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled studies comparing all preparations of oral vitamin A, carotenes or retinoids (or in combination), used as a supplement compared to placebo at any dose, for at least three months, in people with CF (diagnosed by sweat tests or genetic testing) with and without pancreatic insufficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors individually assessed study quality and extracted data on outcome measures. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Investigators were contacted to retrieve missing quantitative data.

Main Results

No studies of vitamin A or other retinoid supplementation were eligible for inclusion. However, one randomised study of beta (β)-carotene supplementation involving 24 people with CF who were receiving pancreatic enzyme substitution was included. The study compared successive β-carotene supplementation periods (high dose followed by low dose) compared to placebo. The results for the low-dose supplementation period should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of a wash-out period after the high-dose supplementation. The included study did not report on two of the review's primary outcomes (vitamin A deficiency disorders and mortality); results for our third primary outcome of growth and nutritional status (reported as z score for height) showed no difference between supplementation and placebo, mean difference (MD) -0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.89 to 0.43) (low-quality evidence). With regards to secondary outcomes, supplementation with high-dose β-carotene for three months led to significantly fewer days of systemic antibiotics required to treat pulmonary exacerbations, compared to controls, MD -15 days (95% CI -27.60 to -2.40); however, this was not maintained in the second three-month section of the study when the level of β-carotene supplementation was reduced, MD -8 days (95% CI -18.80 to 2.80) (low-quality evidence). There were no statistically significant effects between groups in lung function (low-quality evidence) and no adverse events were observed (low-quality evidence). Supplementation affected levels of β-carotene in plasma, but not vitamin A levels. The study did not report on quality of life or toxicity.

Authors' Conclusions

Since no randomised or quasi-randomised controlled studies on retinoid supplementation were identified, no conclusion on the supplementation of vitamin A in people with CF can be drawn. Additionally, due to methodological limitations in the included study, also reflected in the low-quality evidence judged following the specific evidence grading system (GRADE), no clear conclusions on β-carotene supplementation can be drawn. Until further data are available, country- or region-specific guidelines regarding these practices should be followed.

### Techniques for measuring vitamin A activity from β-carotene [^114TMdoE]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Dietary β-carotene is the most important precursor of vitamin A. However, the determination of the efficiency of in vivo conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A requires sensitive and safe techniques. It presents the following challenges: 1) circulating β-carotene concentration cannot be altered by eating a meal containing ≤ 6 mg β-carotene; 2) because retinol concentrations are homeostatically controlled, the conversion of β-carotene into vitamin A cannot be estimated accurately in well-nourished humans by assessing changes in serum retinol after supplementation with β-carotene. In the past half-century, techniques using radioisotopes of β-carotene and vitamin A, depletion-repletion with vitamin A and β-carotene supplements, measurement of postprandial chylomicron fractions after consumption of a β-carotene dose, and finally, stable isotopes as tracers to follow the absorption and conversion of β-carotene in humans have been developed. The reported values for β-carotene to vitamin A conversion showed a wide variation from 2 μg β-carotene to 1 μg retinol (for synthetic pure β-carotene in oil) and 28 μg β-carotene to 1 μg retinol (for β-carotene from vegetables). In recent years, a stable isotope reference method (IRM) was developed that used labeled synthetic β-carotene. The IRM method provided evidence that the conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A is likely dose dependent. With the development of intrinsically labeled plant foods harvested from a hydroponic system with heavy water, vitamin A activity of stable isotope-labeled biosynthetic β-carotene from various foods consumed by humans was studied. The efficacy of plant foods rich in β-carotene, such as natural (spinach, carrots, spirulina), hybrid (high-β-carotene yellow maize), and bioengineered (Golden Rice) foods, to provide vitamin A has shown promising results. The results from these studies will be of practical importance in recommendations for the use of pure β-carotene and foods rich in β-carotene in providing vitamin A and ultimately in preventing either overconsumption or poor intake of vitamin A by humans.

### Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for preventing age-related macular degeneration [^115k2VUp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is inconclusive evidence from observational studies to suggest that people who eat a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins (carotenoids, vitamins C, and E) or minerals (selenium and zinc) may be less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Objectives

To determine whether or not taking antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements, or both, prevent the development of AMD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 29 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 29 March 2017), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) (1985 to 29 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 29 March 2017, the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 29 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 29 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 29 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. One author entered data into RevMan 5; the other author checked the data entry. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included a total of five RCTs in this review with data available for 76,756 people. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland, and the United States, and investigated vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and multivitamin supplements. All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias. Four studies reported the comparison of vitamin E with placebo. Average treatment and follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 10 years. Data were available for a total of 55,614 participants. There was evidence that vitamin E supplements do not prevent the development of any AMD (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence), and may slightly increase the risk of late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 3.62, 95% CI 0.77 to 16.95; very low-certainty evidence), and four cases of geographic atrophy (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 26.0; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported similar numbers of adverse events in the vitamin E and placebo groups. Another trial reported excess of haemorrhagic strokes in the vitamin E group (39 versus 23 events, hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91, low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported the comparison of beta-carotene with placebo. These studies took place in Finland and the United States. Both trials enrolled men only. Average treatment and follow-up duration was 6 years and 12 years. Data were available for a total of 22,083 participants. There was evidence that beta-carotene supplements did not prevent any AMD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence) nor have an important effect on late AMD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.15; very low-certainty evidence) and 4 cases of geographic atrophy (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.03 to 2.93; very low-certainty evidence). Beta-carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoked. One study reported the comparison of vitamin C with placebo, and multivitamin (Centrum Silver) versus placebo. This was a study in men in the United States with average treatment duration and follow-up of 8 years for vitamin C and 11 years for multivitamin. Data were available for a total of 14,236 participants. AMD was assessed by self-report followed by medical record review. There was evidence that vitamin C supplementation did not prevent any AMD (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (RR 0.94, 0.61 to 1.46; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a slight increased risk of any AMD (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43; moderate-certainty evidence) and late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69; moderate-certainty evidence) in the multivitamin group. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy were not reported separately. Adverse effects were not reported but there was possible increased risk of skin rashes in the multivitamin group. Adverse effects were not consistently reported in these eye studies, but there is evidence from other large studies that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke or who have been exposed to asbestos. None of the studies reported quality of life or resource use and costs.

Authors' Conclusions

Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects, and clear evidence of benefit is needed before they can be recommended. People with AMD should see the related Cochrane Review on antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of AMD, written by the same review team.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^114vKoK4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to complications of treatment (antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that possible complications of high-dose β-carotene are as follows:

- self-reported yellowing of the skin (8.3% in the antioxidant arm compared with 6.0% in the no antioxidant arm; P = 0.008)

- increased risk of developing lung cancer in current smokers: an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18% difference in incidence by the end of the study (95% CI, 3%-36%; P = 0.01) between the patients who received β-carotene and those who did not. The active treatment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.04–1.57; P = 0.02) compared with the placebo group.

### Inverse relationship between serum carotenoid levels and obesity prevalence in children and adolescents: a nationwide cross-sectional analysis [^116yDEBW]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as conditions where there is an abnormal or excessive accumulation of adipose tissue that presents a risk to health. In the United States, the prevalence of childhood obesity has continued to rise, increasing from 20.3% during 2011–March 2020 to 22.0% in August 2021–August 2023. Excess body fat in childhood significantly increases the risk of metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Research indicates that around 70% of youths with elevated adiposity are likely to become adults with persistent weight-related health problems. Given its modifiable nature, childhood obesity is widely recognized as a preventable condition. Early intervention is critical, as excessive weight gain in youth not only persists into adulthood but also increases the lifelong risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Therefore, investing in obesity prevention during childhood is essential for establishing a foundation for long-term health.

Carotenoids are pigments found in many fruits and vegetables. In addition to serving as precursors to vitamin A (for some types), they exhibit potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which may play a role in modulating obesity-related metabolic pathways. Since humans cannot synthesize carotenoids, it is crucial to obtain them through a diverse and balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables. However, according to recent national data, nearly 40% of U.S. children aged 1 to 18 years do not consume the recommended daily amount of fruit, and over 90% do not meet the recommended vegetable intake levels as outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting potential insufficiency in carotenoid exposure at the population level.

Among the more than 700 distinct carotenoids identified, six of them — α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene — comprise over 95% of all carotenoids present in human plasma or serum. α-Carotene, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin are crucial provitamin A carotenoids that contribute significantly to the body's vitamin A needs. They could convert into retinol and related compounds to maintain adequate vitamin A levels in the body. Lutein and zeaxanthin are significant for maintaining eye health and protecting against vision impairment. Lycopene, another important carotenoid, is renowned for its potent antioxidant properties and exert its potential role in cancer prevention. Various carotenoids can provide various health benefits by modulating inflammatory processes and regulating oxidative stress in the body. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the function of carotenoids and specific mechanisms in human body.

### Association of serum α-tocopherol, β-carotene, and retinol with liver cancer incidence and chronic liver disease mortality [^115SJaRi]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

We evaluated possible effect modification by subgroups of intervention group, median age, median BMI, median duration and intensity of smoking, alcohol intake, diabetes, and median serum cholesterol. Effect modification was formally tested by using likelihood ratio tests that compared regression models that did and did not include the cross-product term for each respective biomarker (as a continuous variable to conserve power) and the above categories.

Participants also had their serum micronutrients measured at their third-year follow-up visit. As concentrations of α -tocopherol and β -carotene were substantially higher at the follow-up visit among participants receiving supplementation, we examined repeat measures in those who did not receive supplementation (Figure 1). Thus, when evaluating the association of joint categories of α -tocopherol, both baseline and follow-up, we evaluated the association only in men randomised to the β -carotene and placebo intervention arms, and not the α -tocopherol or the α -tocopherol+ β -carotene intervention arm. Similarly, for β -carotene, we evaluated the association in those randomised only to the α -tocopherol and placebo arms. For retinol, we evaluated all men who provided blood at the 3-year follow-up. We classified participants to be low or high at baseline and follow-up based on the median level at each time point. For the follow-up measurement, we selected the median among those participants not receiving supplementation.

All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and all P -values were two sided.

### Insulin resistance and adiposity in relation to serum β-carotene levels [^1159y4Vg]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of placebo vs an encapsulated supplement of fruit and vegetable juice concentrate (FVJC) on serum β-carotene levels, insulin resistance, adiposity, and subclinical inflammation in boys.

Study Design

Thirty age-matched prepubertal boys (9 lean and 21 overweight (OW); age range, 6–10 years) were studied. All participants received nutrition counseling and were randomized to receive FVJC or placebo capsules for 6 months. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid corrected β-carotene, serum retinol, glucose, insulin, retinol binding protein-4, leptin, adiponectin, leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were measured before and after the 6-month intervention. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), acute insulin response to intravenous glucose, along with abdominal fat mass (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) were also determined.

Results

Baseline β-carotene concentrations correlated inversely with HOMA-IR, leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, and abdominal fat mass (P ≤ .01). FVJC intake increased β-carotene concentrations (P ≤ .001) but did not influence retinol or retinol binding protein-4. Retinol insufficiency < 1.047 μM was present in 18% of the entire cohort at baseline and in 37% at 6 months. HOMA-IR decreased after supplementation in the OW cohort, when adjusted for percent weight change (P = .014). The percent change in abdominal fat mass increased in the placebo group and decreased in the FVJC group (P = .029).

Conclusions

A 6-month supplementation with FVJC in the presence of nutritional counseling was associated with an increase in serum β-carotene concentrations and a reduction in adiposity in conjunction with an improvement in insulin resistance in OW boys.

### Vitamin a palmitate (Aquasol a) [^115d1pCz]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Beta-carotene, retinol, and retinal have effective and reliable vitamin A activity. Retinal and retinol are in chemical equilibrium in the body and have equivalent antixerophthalmic activity. Retinal combines with the rod pigment, opsin, in the retina to form rhodopsin, necessary for visual dark adaptation. Vitamin A prevents retardation of growth and preserves the epithelial cells' integrity. Normal adult liver storage is sufficient to satisfy two years' requirements of vitamin A.

Vitamin A is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where the biosynthesis of vitamin A from beta-carotene takes place. Vitamin A absorption requires bile salts, pancreatic lipase, and dietary fat. It is transported in the blood to the liver by the chylomicron fraction of the lymph. Vitamin A is stored in Kupffer cells of the liver mainly as the palmitate. Normal serum vitamin A is 80–300 Units per 100 mL (plasma range is 30–70 mcg per dl) and for carotenoids 270–753 Units per 100 mL. The normal adult liver contains approximately 100 to 300 micrograms per gram, mostly as retinol palmitate.

Nutritional status and blood micronutrient concentrations

Three trials reported changes in blood retinol concentrations (data not pooled, see Table 19). In the only trial with a significant proportion of participants with vitamin A deficiency at baseline (59% < 1.05 µmol/L), median serum concentrations were higher after six weeks of supplementation compared to placebo (P = 0.03) (Baeten 2002 KEN). In the other two trials, in which most participants were not deficient, average blood retinol concentrations remained unchanged after follow‐up periods of four and eight weeks, respectively (Humphrey 1999 USA; Semba 1998 USA).

Change in nutritional status parameters: vitamin A versus placebo

Note: one further trial from the United States evaluated supplementation with a vitamin A precursor, β‐carotene (60 mg) three times daily (Coodley 1996 USA). This trial reported an increase in blood concentrations of β‐carotene at three months but no statistically significant effects on CD4+ cell count.

Adverse events associated with supplementation

Signs or symptoms of toxicity (headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever) were similar in the intervention and control groups at 24 hours and one week after administration in one trial (Humphrey 1999 USA). No adverse events were reported in the other two trials of vitamin A supplementation (Baeten 2002 KEN; Semba 2007 USA). Slight skin discolouration was reported by the participants in the intervention group of a one small trial of β‐carotene supplementation (Coodley 1993 USA).

### A systematic review of the role of vitamin insufficiencies and supplementation in COPD [^111pgSX3]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin A and B

Vitamin A (retinol and carotens) plays an important role in several functions of the human body including vision, bone and skin health, and further has an innate antioxidant activity. Vitamin B is involved in various steps of metabolism and enhances immunity. High levels of vitamin A, b-carotene and/or alpha-carotene were associated with increase in FEV1 and FVC in most of the studies although there are some exceptions. More details are presented in Table 2. High serum beta carotene levels in a general population sample of 523 subjects were associated with the expression of a gene polymorphism that connected with a slower FEV1 decline.

Hirayama et al reported that the highest level of intake of vitamin A resulted in a 52% (p = 0.008) reduction in COPD risk while in another study the risk for COPD was associated with lower levels of plasma vitamin A (p < 0.01).

Fimognari et al reported lower levels of folate and vitamin B12 in COPD patients, resulted in an increased plasma level of total homocysteine, a known cardiovascular risk factor.

Regarding the role of b-carotene in respiratory symptoms, two studies showed a beneficial association with cough and one study showed no correlation with symptoms, except for wheezing.

### Vitamin A supplementation for preventing morbidity and mortality in children from six months to five years of age [^115k8N3g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 190 million children under five years of age and leading to many adverse health consequences, including death. Based on prior evidence and a previous version of this review, the World Health Organization has continued to recommend vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6 to 59 months. There are new data available from recently published randomised trials since the previous publication of this review in 2010, and this update incorporates this information and reviews the evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for preventing morbidity and mortality in children aged six months to five years.

Search Methods

In March 2016 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted relevant organisations and researchers to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of synthetic VAS in children aged six months to five years living in the community. We excluded studies involving children in hospital and children with disease or infection. We also excluded studies evaluating the effects of food fortification, consumption of vitamin A rich foods, or beta-carotene supplementation.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and abstracted data, resolving discrepancies by discussion. We performed meta-analyses for outcomes, including all-cause and cause-specific mortality, disease, vision, and side effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified 47 studies (4 of which are new to this review), involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies took place in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most of the studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about a year. The included studies were at variable overall risk of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias. A meta-analysis for all-cause mortality included 19 trials (1,202,382 children). At longest follow-up, there was a 12% observed reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for vitamin A compared with control using a fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.93; high-quality evidence). This result was sensitive to choice of model, and a random-effects meta-analysis showed a different summary estimate (24% reduction: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88); however, the confidence intervals overlapped with that of the fixed-effect model. Nine trials reported mortality due to diarrhoea and showed a 12% overall reduction for VAS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 participants; high-quality evidence). There was no significant effect for VAS on mortality due to measles, respiratory disease, and meningitis. VAS reduced incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 15 studies; 77,946 participants; low-quality evidence) and measles (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.67; 6 studies; 19,566 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, there was no significant effect on incidence of respiratory disease or hospitalisations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was an increased risk of vomiting within the first 48 hours of VAS (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 4 studies; 10,541 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Vitamin A supplementation is associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children. Therefore, we suggest maintaining the policy of universal supplementation for children under five years of age in populations at risk of VAD. Further placebo-controlled trials of VAS in children between six months and five years of age would not change the conclusions of this review, although studies that compare different doses and delivery mechanisms are needed. In populations with documented vitamin A deficiency, it would be unethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials.

### Antioxidant bilirubin works in multiple ways to reduce risk for obesity and its health complications [^116C2Hx9]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

While there currently is a common perception among medical scientists, rooted in the disappointing results of clinical trials with nutritional scavenging antioxidants such as ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, that antioxidants have limited potential for conferring health protection, this perception fails to grasp the crucial difference between scavenging antioxidants and 'source antioxidants', of which bilirubin is a key example. Source antioxidants, by definition, prevent oxidant production by suppressing superoxide generation at its source; they therefore oppose the often proinflammatory effects of hydrogen peroxide on cellular signalling, and prevent conversion of (often protective) nitric oxide to the potent oxidant peroxynitrite — effects which scavenging antioxidants cannot achieve. Statins and angiotensin II antagonist drugs likewise can function as source antioxidants in vascular tissues by inhibiting the activation of certain NADPH oxidase complexes.

### Cancer chemoprevention: a rapidly evolving field [^117Frdqq]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

An explanation for the detrimental effects seen in the prostate and lung prevention trials may thus be the dose of experimental agent chosen. Selenium and β -carotene are naturally occurring dietary constituents, which are important in normal human physiology. It is plausible that a U-shaped dose–response curve exists where either deficiency or supraphysiological doses may cause harm. The negative results from these large expensive trials have led many to reassess the design of clinical chemoprevention studies and to move towards smaller studies focussing on higher-risk individuals, and to rely on more detailed prior preclinical mechanistic evaluation to provide information that may better guide dose selection.

### Cancer chemoprevention: a rapidly evolving field [^112eYKV6]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Important negative trials

Two of the earliest chemoprevention trials were based on data linking cancer risk reduction and intake of carotenoids. These included smokers, with lung cancer incidence as the end point. The α -tocopherol (vitamin E), β -carotene (ATBC) prevention study enrolled 29 133 men with a randomisation to α -tocopherol, β -carotene, a combination of both or a placebo. The first results were alarming, showing an 18% increased incidence of lung cancers, increased cardiovascular disease and an 8% increased overall mortality for those on β -carotene. Subsequent analysis revealed the adverse effect to be stronger in men with a modest alcohol intake and smokers of > 20 cigarettes daily (Albanes et al, 1996). Interestingly, prostate cancer incidence and death were reduced in the vitamin E arms (by 32% and 41%, respectively). The β -Carotene And Retinol Efficacy Trial included men with occupational asbestos exposure or men and women who were current or former cigarette smokers (18 314 participants) randomised to β -carotene plus retinyl palmitate or placebo. This was closed early because those in the intervention arm had higher lung cancer death rates (17% and 28%, respectively) and higher rates of cardiovascular disease mortality. Further investigation of β -carotene for cancer prevention was discontinued as a result.

One of the largest prevention studies was the Selenium and vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. Men (35 534) were randomised to receive α -tocopherol, selenium, both agents and a placebo. Unfortunately, the trial was closed early after an interim analysis indicated an extremely low likelihood of producing a positive result. A later report showed a significant 17% increase in the risk of prostate cancer among those who received vitamin E. Detailed analyses were subsequently undertaken on two smaller previous studies that had suggested a protective effect from selenium. In both of these, benefit of selenium was seen but was limited to those with lowest baseline blood selenium levels. The benefits and risks of nutritional supplementation may thus depend on prior exposure – those with marginal or deficient nutrient intakes may be the group to benefit whereas those whose intake is already adequate or high may experience harm.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^113YoRHF]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 1: routine management of protoporphyria

A 49-year-old nurse reported that, beginning in early childhood, she experienced cutaneous tingling followed by burning and severe pain within 3 minutes of exposure to sunlight and bright indoor light. Symptoms take up to 72 hours to resolve, and the patient notes a heightened sensitivity to light a day after increased light exposure. She stopped working to avoid workplace indoor lights and sunlight exposure during her commute. Laboratory tests revealed a total erythrocyte protoporphyrin level of 828 μg/dL (reference, < 80 μg/dL), zinc protoporphyrin 45 μg/dL (reference, < 60 μg/dL), metal-free protoporphyrin 738 μg/dL (reference, < 20 μg/dL), and plasma protoporphyrin level of 17.9 μg/dL (reference, < 1.0 μg/dL). Genetic testing was positive for both a rare pathogenic variant affecting 1 FECH allele (c.194+2T > G) and the common hypomorphic FECH variant (c.315–48T > C).

How is protoporphyria routinely managed?

Historically, management of the cutaneous manifestations of protoporphyria has primarily been sunlight avoidance and use of sun-protective clothing. Patients usually learn these self-protective behaviors at an early age. Traditional sunscreens only block UVA and UVB light and not the blue spectrum of visible light that is responsible for symptoms in EPP and XLP (peak ∼405 nm); however, some patients note mild improvement with opaque zinc-based sunscreen formulations. Narrow-band UVB phototherapy may increase sunlight tolerance in some patients but is not well studied. Various oral treatments have been tested without convincing evidence for efficacy, including beta carotene, vitamin C, and N-acetylcysteine. Analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiates do not relieve the phototoxic symptoms of protoporphyria.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^117QvE7f]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements — adverse effects and cautions: High-dose beta-carotene is associated with self-reported yellowing of the skin (8.3% in the antioxidant arm compared with 6.0% in the no antioxidant arm; P = 0.008) and in current smokers with an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer observed after 18 months, resulting in an 18% difference in incidence by study end (95% CI, 3%–36%; P = 0.01); the active treatment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.04–1.57; P = 0.02) compared with placebo. High-dose zinc supplements were associated with hospitalizations for genitourinary causes at 7.5% with zinc versus 4.9% without 80 mg of zinc (P = 0.001), and in the AREDS2 there was no significant difference in AMD progression between 80 mg and 25 mg of zinc; copper-deficiency anemia is noted, and concomitant copper is necessary according to AREDS and AREDS2. For long-term supplementation, because of potential adverse effects, the high doses of antioxidant vitamins and minerals recommended by the original AREDS and AREDS2 should be reviewed by the patient's primary care physician.

### Effects of vitamin A or beta carotene supplementation on pregnancy-related mortality and infant mortality in rural Bangladesh: a cluster randomized trial [^116P2qFr]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Maternal vitamin A deficiency is a public health concern in the developing world. Its prevention may improve maternal and infant survival.

Objective

To assess efficacy of maternal vitamin A or beta carotene supplementation in reducing pregnancy-related and infant mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cluster randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial among pregnant women 13 to 45 years of age and their live-born infants to 12 weeks (84 days) postpartum in rural northern Bangladesh between 2001 and 2007. Interventions Five hundred ninety-six community clusters (study sectors) were randomized for pregnant women to receive weekly, from the first trimester through 12 weeks postpartum, 7000 μg of retinol equivalents as retinyl palmitate, 42 mg of all-trans beta carotene, or placebo. Married women (n = 125,257) underwent 5-week surveillance for pregnancy, ascertained by a history of amenorrhea and confirmed by urine test. Blood samples were obtained from participants in 32 sectors (5%) for biochemical studies.

Main Outcome Measures

All-cause mortality of women related to pregnancy, stillbirth, and infant mortality to 12 weeks (84 days) following pregnancy outcome.

Results

Groups were comparable across risk factors. For the mortality outcomes, neither of the supplement group outcomes was significantly different from the placebo group outcomes. The numbers of deaths and all-cause, pregnancy-related mortality rates (per 100,000 pregnancies) were 41 and 206 (95% confidence interval [CI] 140–273) in the placebo group, 47 and 237 (95% CI, 166–309) in the vitamin A group, and 50 and 250 (95% CI, 177–323) in the beta carotene group. Relative risks for mortality in the vitamin A and beta carotene groups were 1.15 (95% CI, 0.75–1.76) and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.81–1.81), respectively. In the placebo, vitamin A, and beta carotene groups the rates of stillbirth and infant mortality were 47.9 (95% CI, 44.3–51.5), 45.6 (95% CI, 42.1–49.2), and 51.8 (95% CI, 48.0–55.6) per 1000 births and 68.1 (95% CI, 63.7–72.5), 65.0 (95% CI, 60.7–69.4), and 69.8 (95% CI, 65.4–72.3) per 1000 live births, respectively. Vitamin A compared with either placebo or beta carotene supplementation increased plasma retinol concentrations by end of study (1.46 [95% CI, 1.42–1.50] μmol/L vs 1.13 [95% CI, 1.09–1.17] μmol/L and 1.18 [95% CI, 1.14–1.22] μmol/L, respectively; P < .001) and reduced, but did not eliminate, gestational night blindness (7.1% for vitamin A vs 9.2% for placebo and 8.9% for beta carotene [P < .001 for both]).

Conclusion

Use of weekly vitamin A or beta carotene in pregnant women in Bangladesh, compared with placebo, did not reduce all-cause maternal, fetal, or infant mortality.

### Effect of carotenoid supplementation on plasma carotenoids, inflammation and visual development in preterm infants [^115fnj99]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Dietary carotenoids (lutein, lycopene and β-carotene) may be important in preventing or ameliorating prematurity complications. Little is known about carotenoid status or effects of supplementation.

Study Design

This randomized controlled multicenter trial compared plasma carotenoid levels among preterm infants (n = 203, < 33 weeks gestational age) fed diets with and without added lutein, lycopene and β-carotene with human milk (HM)-fed term infants. We assessed safety and health.

Result

Plasma carotenoid levels were higher in the supplemented group at all time points (P < 0.0001) and were similar to those of term HM-fed infants. Supplemented infants had lower plasma C-reactive protein (P < 0.001). Plasma lutein levels correlated with the full field electroretinogram-saturated response amplitude in rod photoreceptors (r = 0.361, P = 0.05). The supplemented group also showed greater rod photoreceptor sensitivity (least squares means 6.1 vs 4.1; P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Carotenoid supplementation for preterm infants raises plasma concentrations to those observed in HM-fed term infants. Carotenoid supplementation may decrease inflammation. Our results point to protective effects of lutein on preterm retina health and maturation.

### Impact of vitamin A and carotenoids on the risk of tuberculosis progression [^111KJsHC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points

Vitamin A deficiency was associated with a 10-fold increase in risk of developing TB disease after household exposure. Vitamin A supplementation among high risk individuals might represent an effective means of preventing progression from TB infection to TB disease.

### Systemic photoprotection with α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and β-carotene [^112GHjVn]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Cutaneous photodamage is partly mediated via oxidative pathways and there is evidence to suggest that antioxidants within the skin may have a photoprotective effect. Antioxidant activity is provided by a number of naturally occurring substances including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and beta-carotene, whose effects are mediated by their capacity to quench singlet oxygen, scavenge free radicals and prevent the formation of free radicals. Beta-carotene has been used as treatment for various photosensitivity disorders for more than 30 years. The main indication for its use is in the treatment of the photosensitivity associated with erythropoietic protoporphyria. A role for beta-carotene in the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer has yet to be demonstrated despite clinical research activity in this area. The role for alpha-tocopherol as a photoprotective agent is less clear-cut and it has yet to be established as treatment either for conditions characterized by photosensitivity or as an agent for preventing chronic photodamage or cutaneous malignancy.

### Hypocarotenemia after bariatric surgery: a preliminary study [^1163D6Cx]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary carotenoids have attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential clinical relevance in conditions such as age-related maculopathy, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Surgical procedures have become the primary treatment of severe obesity, although nutrient deficiencies are common and long-term metabolic sequelae remain unknown. Thus, our aim was to assess the carotenoid status in serum of subjects after obesity surgery.

Methods

We evaluated the status of lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha- and beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, alpha- and beta-carotene, and fat-soluble vitamins by a quality-controlled high-performance liquid chromatography method in serum of 53 patients. Subjects were consecutively included as they were monitored for nutritional status after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). Average follow-up time was 18 and 14 months for each protocol, respectively.

Results

After obesity surgery, a consistent and continuous decline in all carotenoids to almost undetectable levels occurs, especially in those who underwent BPD diversion who, on average, displayed serum levels about one half to one third of those found in RYGBP patients.

Conclusion

The hypocarotenemia observed after bariatric surgery may compromise the availability of carotenoids to tissues and the vitamin A status, reducing the fat-soluble antioxidant capacity and constituting an additional risk factor for several clinical conditions. Given the emerging role of carotenoids in disease prevention, dietary advice on carotenoid-rich and fortified foods or the use of supplements in these patients should be considered.

### The beta-carotene and retinol efficacy trial: incidence of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality during 6-year follow-up after stopping β-carotene and retinol supplements [^115K4m85]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) tested the effect of daily beta-carotene (30 mg) and retinyl palmitate (25,000 IU) on the incidence of lung cancer, other cancers, and death in 18,314 participants who were at high risk for lung cancer because of a history of smoking or asbestos exposure. CARET was stopped ahead of schedule in January 1996 because participants who were randomly assigned to receive the active intervention were found to have a 28% increase in incidence of lung cancer, a 17% increase in incidence of death and a higher rate of cardiovascular disease mortality compared with participants in the placebo group.

Methods

After the intervention ended, CARET participants returned the study vitamins to their study center and provided a final blood sample. They continue to be followed annually by telephone and mail self-report. Self-reported cancer endpoints were confirmed by review of pathology reports, and death endpoints were confirmed by review of death certificates. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

With follow-up through December 31, 2001, the post-intervention relative risks of lung cancer and all-cause mortality for the active intervention group compared with the placebo group were 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97 to 1.31) and 1.08 (95% CI = 0.99 to 1.17), respectively. Smoothed relative risk curves for lung cancer incidence and all-cause mortality indicated that relative risks remained above 1.0 throughout the post-intervention follow-up. By contrast, the relative risk of cardiovascular disease mortality decreased rapidly to 1.0 after the intervention was stopped. During the post-intervention phase, females had larger relative risks of lung cancer mortality (1.33 versus 1.14; p = 0.36), cardiovascular disease mortality (1.44 versus 0.93; p = 0.03), and all-cause mortality (1.37 versus 0.98; p = 0.001) than males.

Conclusions

The previously reported adverse effects of beta-carotene and retinyl palmitate on lung cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in cigarette smokers and individuals with occupational exposure to asbestos persisted after drug administration was stopped although they are no longer statistically significant. Planned subgroup analyses suggest that the excess risks of lung cancer were restricted primarily to females, and cardiovascular disease mortality primarily to females and to former smokers.

### Dietary profile of patients with stargardt's disease and retinitis pigmentosa: is there a role for a nutritional approach? [^115wnuvu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin A plays a crucial role in the biochemistry of visual signal cascade and the maintenance of an optimal vitamin A status has been considered relevant for a normal retinal physiology.

Stargardt's Disease (STGD) and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) are genetic-based relevant ocular diseases that may be affected, in opposite way, by vitamin A intake and other nutrients.

In an animal model of STGD vitamin A supplementation has been shown to accelerate the accumulation of toxic by-products, being prevented by a reduction of its serum levels with possible implications for the treatment. Moreover, in such patients a supplementation with lutein, a retinal carotenoid, increases macula pigment density but it seems not to be associated with changes in central vision over a 6 months-follow up period. Conversely, RP patients seems to get beneficial effects from a supplementation with vitamin A, since it has been associated with an improved preservation of cone electroretinogram amplitudes and has been proposed as a treatment to slow the progression of the disease. Moreover, for RP patients assuming vitamin A therapy addition of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid has been showed to slow the course of the disease over the first two years of supplementation. Similarly, an increased dietary intake of lutein, a retinal carotenoid, seems to slow visual function loss in RP adult patients assuming vitamin A. In the light of all these clinical observations, nutritional indications and/or supplementations for patients suffering from these retinal dystrophies are usually given but, to the best of our knowledge, no data on dietary habits of these patients are presently available.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dietary habits and nutritional intake of vitamin A in patients with STGD and RP, in order to suggest tailored dietary modifications in such diseases.

### Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration [^113vZbXF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It has been proposed that antioxidants may prevent cellular damage in the retina by reacting with free radicals that are produced in the process of light absorption. Higher dietary levels of antioxidant vitamins and minerals may reduce the risk of progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation on the progression of AMD in people with AMD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2012), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to August 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 20 August 2012. We searched the reference lists of identified reports and the Science Citation Index. We contacted investigators and experts in the field for details of unpublished studies. We also searched for systematic reviews of harms of vitamin supplements.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation (alone or in combination) to placebo or no intervention in people with AMD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a random-effects model unless three or fewer trials were available in which case we used a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials (6150 participants) were included in this review. Over half the participants (3640) were randomised in one trial (AREDS in the United States), which found a beneficial effect of antioxidant (beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E) and zinc supplementation on progression to advanced AMD (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.87) over an average of 6.3 years. People taking supplements were less likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96). The other trials, in general, had shorter follow-up (less than two years). No evidence for an effect of supplementation was seen in these smaller trials of shorter duration. Overall we considered the strength of the evidence to be moderate. We did not consider included trials, in general, to be at risk of bias, although we found it difficult to assess reporting biases. The main reason for downgrading the strength of the evidence was because, for several analyses, only one trial was included and therefore consistency of the findings could not be assessed. The included trials reported the following adverse effects: hospitalisation for genito-urinary problems was more common in people taking zinc and yellowing of skin was more common in people taking antioxidants. Systematic searching of the literature identified other potential harms of vitamin supplementation, in particular an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers associated with beta-carotene supplements, but we were unable to identify a good systematic review of the evidence for harms of nutritional supplementation.

Authors' Conclusions

People with AMD may experience delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. This finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population. The generalisability of these findings to other populations is not known. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. A systematic review of the evidence on harms of vitamin supplements is needed.

### Reducing stillbirths: behavioural and nutritional interventions before and during pregnancy [^112txfh1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin A is required for fetal tissue growth and maintenance, as well as maternal metabolism; it plays an important role in cell differentiation and, therefore, embryogenesis very early in pregnancy. Clinical and subclinical Vitamin A deficiency is a public health concern in at least 75 countries worldwide, and contributes to impaired immune host response, maternal eye problems including xerophthalmia, night-blindness, as well as decreased haemoglobin levels and anaemia. Vitamin A deficiency co-exists with iron deficiency in many countries, and is linked with an elevated risk of LBW, as well as an increased risk of infections (diarrhea, dysentery, acute respiratory illness) and poor growth in young infants. Given the potential teratogenic effect and toxicity of high-dose vitamin A, a variety of vitamin A interventions (daily supplementation with either low-dose vitamin A or β-carotene) have been evaluated with assessment of safety and impact on maternal, newborn and infant outcomes.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^113tABKk]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration — The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends ophthalmologists consider antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation as per the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 trials for patients with intermediate or advanced age-related macular degeneration to slow progression of the disease. AREDS formulation contains vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, zinc, and copper, and the AREDS2 formulation substitutes lutein/zeaxanthin for beta carotene because beta carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in smokers.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^115T9ei8]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Antioxidants and supplements in AMD — additional risk factors may include low systemic levels of antioxidants; the original AREDS showed that high-dose oral antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E, beta-carotene) plus zinc reduced progression of intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in the fellow eye to advanced AMD by 25%; additional vitamin E supplementation above AREDS levels should be avoided; AREDS2 supports removal of beta-carotene and addition of lutein/zeaxanthin, and removal of beta-carotene may reduce competitive absorption of lutein/zeaxanthin and may eliminate the increased incidence of lung cancer associated with supplemental beta-carotene; AREDS2 also found no effect on progression from reducing zinc dose (from 80 mg to 25 mg) or from adding an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]); a Cochrane review concluded that antioxidant vitamins plus zinc probably slows the progression to late AMD and vision loss (moderate-certainty evidence), while supplements containing only lutein and zeaxanthin may have little or no effect.

### Treatment with 9-cis β-carotene-rich powder in patients with retinitis pigmentosa: a randomized crossover trial [^116b9H7w]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the leading cause of incurable inherited blindness in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3500 individuals. Therefore, it is important to develop new treatments for this disease.

Objective

To determine the effect of oral treatment with 9-cis β-carotene on visual function of patients with RP.

Design

Randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial.

Setting

University tertiary medical facility.

Participants

Thirty-four patients with RP who were at least 18 years of age. Twenty-nine patients completed the study and were included in the analysis.

Interventions

Patients were treated daily for 90 days with capsules containing 300 mg of 9-cis β-carotene-ich alga Dunaliella bardawil (β-carotene, approximately 20 mg) or placebo (starch). Following a 90-day washout period, they were treated for 90 days with the other capsules.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomewas the change for both eyes from baseline to the end of each treatment in dark-adapted maximal electroretinographic b-wave amplitude. The secondary outcomes were the changes in light-adapted maximal b-wave amplitude, dark- and light-adapted visual field, and best-corrected visual acuity.

Results

The mean change in dark-adapted maximal b-wave amplitude relative to initial baseline was +8.4 μV for 9-cis β-carotene vs −.9 μV for placebo (P = .001). Ten participants (34.5%) had an increase of more than 10 μV for both eyes (range, 11–42 μV) after 9-cis β-carotene treatment compared with no participants after placebo treatment. The percentage change in light-adapted b-wave response was +17.8%for 9-cis β-carotene vs −.0% for placebo (P = .01). No significant differences were found between the groups for visual field and best-corrected visual acuity. No adverse effects were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment with 9-cis β-carotene significantly increased retinal function in patients with RP under the tested conditions. The optimal therapeutic regimen will be determined in future, larger clinical trials. 9-cis β-Carotene may represent a new therapeutic approach for some patients with RP.

### Vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women [^112QedJt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In areas where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health concern, the maternal dietary intake of vitamin A may be not sufficient to meet either the maternal nutritional requirements, or those of the breastfed infant, due the low retinol concentrations in breast milk.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (8 February 2016), LILACS (1982 to December 2015), Web of Science (1945 to December 2015), and the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-randomised trials that assessed the effects of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health (morbidity, mortality and vitamin A nutritional status).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Fourteen trials of mainly low or unclear risk of bias, enrolling 25,758 women and infant pairs were included. The supplementation schemes included high, single or double doses of vitamin A (200,000 to 400,000 internation units (IU)), or 7.8 mg daily beta-carotene compared with placebo, no treatment, other (iron); or higher (400,000 IU) versus lower dose (200,000 IU). In all trials, a considerable proportion of infants were at least partially breastfed until six months. Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl, water-miscible or beta-carotene) 200,000 to 400,000 IU versus control (placebo or no treatment) Maternal: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced maternal mortality at 12 months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 2.21; 8577 participants; 1 RCT, moderate-quality evidence). Effects were less certain at six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.71; 564 participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). The effect on maternal morbidity (diarrhoea, respiratory infections, fever) was uncertain because the quality of evidence was very low (50 participants, 1 RCT). We found insufficient evidence that vitamin A increases abdominal pain (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.73; 786 participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that vitamin A supplementation increased breast milk retinol concentrations by 0.20 µmol/L at three to three and a half months (mean difference (MD) 0.20 µmol/L, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.31; 837 participants; 6 RCTs). Infant: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced infant mortality at two to 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.52; 6090 participants; 5 RCTs; low-quality evidence). Effects on morbidity (gastroenteritis at three months) was uncertain (RR 6.03, 95% CI 0.30 to 121.82; 84 participants; 1 RCT; very low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence for the effect on infant adverse outcomes (bulging fontanelle at 24 to 48 hours) (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 6.55; 444 participants; 1 RCT). Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl) 400,000 IU versus 200,000 IUThree studies (1312 participants) were included in this comparison. None of the studies assessed maternal mortality, maternal morbidity or infant mortality. Findings from one study showed that there may be little or no difference in infant morbidity between the doses (diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, and febrile illnesses) (312 participants, data not pooled). No firm conclusion could be drawn on the impact on maternal and infant adverse outcomes (limited data available). The effect on breast milk retinol was also uncertain due to the small amount of information available.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence of benefit from different doses of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, compared with other doses or placebo. Although maternal breast milk retinol concentrations improved with supplementation, this did not translate to health benefits for either women or infants. Few studies reported on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Future studies should include these important outcomes.

### Yellow corneal ring associated with vitamin supplementation for age-related macular degeneration [^113LPWLW]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the first described cases of peripheral yellow corneal rings secondary to vitamin supplementation for age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).

Design

Retrospective single-center case series.

Participants

The eyes of 4 patients taking vitamin supplementation for ARMD were examined at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Department of Ophthalmology between January 2010 and April 2011.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 4 patients with peripheral corneal rings receiving vitamin supplementation for ARMD.

Main Outcome Measures

The presence of peripheral yellow corneal rings, skin findings, and serum carotene levels.

Results

Each patient had circumferential, yellow, peripheral corneal rings and exhibited subtle yellowing of the skin most notable on the palms. Serum carotene levels were normal in 2 of the 3 patients and markedly elevated in the last patient in whom it was measured.

Conclusions

It is unclear at this time how to counsel patients with this ocular finding. We suspect that these rings are more common than generally appreciated because they may have a subtle appearance or be misdiagnosed as arcus senilis. We suggest that a formal study be performed on a cohort of patients taking vitamin supplementation for macular degeneration that specifically screens for yellow rings and measures serum carotene levels when they are identified.

### Daily consumption of pro-vitamin A biofortified (yellow) cassava improves serum retinol concentrations in preschool children in Nigeria: a randomized controlled trial [^116WHfFM]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

We also observed that serum β-carotene concentration was very high at baseline (∼2.0 µmol/L) and did not change in response to intervention. This lack of response to treatment may have been due to the 2-wk washout period before endline assessments were conducted. During this period, children returned to consuming nonbiofortified cassava foods, and most of the β-carotene from the intervention available in systemic circulation may have been stored in the liver and/or extrahepatic stores. Nevertheless, serum β-carotene concentration was much higher than the 0.17–0.35 µmol/L reported from previous studies conducted in Kenya, Zambia, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. For unknown reasons, serum β-carotene concentration seems to be high in Nigerian children, as previously reported by Adelekan et al. This may have to do with the regular intake of high doses of β-carotene from foods prepared with palm oil, which was consumed by > 80% of the children at home. We speculate that regular intake of high doses of β-carotene at once may exceed the capacity to convert β-carotene to retinol in the enterocytes, thereby leading to high systemic concentrations of β-carotene. Alternatively, the specific population under study may be genetically predisposed as poor converters of β-carotene. These hypotheses require further investigation.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^113DkA4M]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Early age-related macular degeneration (AREDS category 2) — The combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals did not reduce progression from early to intermediate AMD and had insufficient power to determine effects on progression to advanced AMD; therefore, there is no evidence to support using these supplements in patients with less than intermediate AMD. In early AMD, only 1.3% of participants progressed to advanced AMD in 5 years. A meta-analysis in 2012 concluded there was accumulating evidence that taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay AMD onset. There is no evidence-based treatment for early AMD.

### Depletion of serum carotenoid and other fat-soluble vitamin concentrations following obesity surgery [^116HXbXZ]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity constitutes a growing health problem, and surgical treatment of severe obesity is increasingly used. Nutrient deficiencies are common following bariatric surgery and the evidence indicates a progressive increase in the incidence and severity of the deficiency of certain vitamins and related clinical conditions. Because of the potential role of carotenoids in disease prevention, our aim was to assess the carotenoid status in candidates for obesity surgery and the time-course changes following two bariatric procedures.

Methods

Seventy-five candidates for bariatric surgery (17 men, 58 women; age 43 ± 10 years) and a total of 362 serum samples after obesity surgery (i.e. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 187) and biliopancreatic diversion (n = 175)) were consecutively collected and assessed. Retinol, α- and γ-tocopherol, 25-OH-vitamin D3, lutein, zeaxanthin, α- and β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene (trans and cis), α- and β-carotene (trans and cis) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Results

Mean serum levels of carotenoids in candidates for obesity surgery were within the reference values reported in controls and seasonal variations were present in several analytes. After surgery, and regardless of the type of intervention, all serum carotenoids dropped following first-order kinetics. Cis/trans ratio of lycopene and β-carotene did not change after surgery, over the time or between surgical procedures. On a long-term, serum carotenoids were at or below fifth percentile of reference groups.

Conclusions

The chronic low levels of carotenoids in these patients compromise their availability to tissues, constituting an additional risk factor for other clinical conditions. Dietary advice on carotenoid-rich, fortified foods or supplements should be also evaluated in these patients.

### Effectiveness and safety of nutritional supplements in the treatment of hereditary retinal dystrophies: a systematic review [^114gdPPi]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

The hereditary retinal dystrophies (HRDs) are a group of genetically determined disorders that result in loss of the visual function. There is a lack of standard pharmacological treatments or widely accepted nutritional recommendations. The objective of this review is to summarise the scientific evidence on the effectiveness and safety of nutritional supplements for the treatment of HRDs. We conducted a scientific literature search on Medline and PreMedline, EMBASE, SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, and The Cochrane Library up to August 2014. Experimental, quasi-experimental and controlled observational studies were selected. Eight studies were ultimately included, seven on retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and one on Best disease. Vitamin A, vitamin E, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lutein and β-carotene were assessed. A 15000IU daily dose of vitamin A was reported to have shown a small protective effect on the progression of RP, as was the use of the carotenoids lutein and β-carotene. Different DHA doses has no effect on RP or Best disease. No supplement showed severe adverse effects in the selected studies although strong evidence of toxicity exists for high doses of vitamin A and β-carotene in certain populations. The selected studies concluded that there may be a small beneficial effect of vitamin A, lutein and β-carotene on the progression of RP. The limited evidence available indicates some well-designed additional studies on combined supplements strategies may achieve more robust conclusions. Moreover, the scarcity of evidence available on the treatment of HRD other than RP with nutritional supplements supports the need for further research efforts.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^116cmTr3]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract in the Adult Eye PPP — randomized controlled trials of nutritional supplements and cataracts — report no effect of vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene or vitamin E alone on cataract development, progression, or surgery across multiple studies. Under vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (2001; sample size 4629) found "No effect of treatment on the development or progression of cataracts", the Antioxidants in Prevention of Cataracts Study (2006; sample size 798) found "No effect of treatment on progression of cataracts", and the Roche European American Cataract Trial (2002; sample size 297) reported "No effect of treatment on the progression of cataracts in the U.K. group; small positive treatment effect in U.S. participants". Under vitamin E, the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene study (1998; sample size 28,934) showed "No effect of vitamin E on risk for cataract surgery", the SELECT Eye Endpoints Study (2015; 11,267 men) reported "No effect of vitamin E on development of cataract", the Vitamin E, Cataract and Age-Related Maculopathy Trial (2004; sample size 1193) found "No effect of treatment on the development or progression of cataracts", and the Women's Health Study (2008; 37,675 women) reported "No effect of vitamin E on development of cataract (600 IU QOD)". Vitamin E and beta-carotene combined in the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene Cancer Prevention Study (1997; sample size 1828) showed "No effect of treatment on the development or progression of cataracts".

### High provitamin A carotenoid serum concentrations, elevated retinyl esters, and saturated retinol-binding protein in Zambian preschool children are consistent with the presence of high liver vitamin A stores [^117Q4bDD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Biomarkers of micronutrient status are needed to best define deficiencies and excesses of essential nutrients.

Objective

We evaluated several supporting biomarkers of vitamin A status in Zambian children to determine whether any of the biomarkers were consistent with high liver retinol stores determined by using retinol isotope dilution (RID).

Design

A randomized, placebo-controlled, biofortified maize efficacy trial was conducted in 140 rural Zambian children from 4 villages. A series of biomarkers were investigated to better define the vitamin A status of these children. In addition to the assessment of total-body retinol stores (TBSs) by using RID, tests included analyses of serum carotenoids, retinyl esters, and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) by using high-pressure liquid chromatography, retinol-binding protein by using ELISA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity by using a colorimetric assay.

Results

Children (n = 133) were analyzed quantitatively for TBSs by using RID. TBSs, retinyl esters, some carotenoids, and PLP differed by village site. Serum carotenoids were elevated above most nonintervened reference values for children. α-Carotene, β-carotene, and lutein values were > 95th percentile from children in the US NHANES III, and 13% of children had hypercarotenemia (defined as total carotenoid concentration > 3.7 μmol/L). Although only 2% of children had serum retinyl esters > 10% of total retinol plus retinyl esters, 16% of children had > 5% as esters, which was consistent with high liver retinol stores. Ratios of serum retinol to retinol-binding protein did not deviate from 1.0, which indicated full saturation. ALT activity was low, which was likely due to underlying vitamin B-6 deficiency, which was confirmed by very low serum PLP concentrations.

Conclusions

The finding of hypervitaminosis A in Zambian children was supported by high circulating concentrations of carotenoids and mildly elevated serum retinyl esters. ALT-activity assays may be compromised with co-existing vitamin B-6 deficiency. Nutrition education to improve intakes of whole grains and animal-source foods may enhance vitamin B-6 status in Zambians.

### Biofortified β-carotene rice improves vitamin A intake and reduces the prevalence of inadequacy among women and young children in a simulated analysis in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines [^113nbVLy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Globally, child deaths annually attributable to vitamin A deficiency are estimated to be 157,000 among preschool children 6–59 mo of age. Although the prevalence of clinical symptoms of vitamin A deficiency (e.g. signs of xerophthalmia) has declined, subclinical vitamin A deficiency affects high proportions of children in Africa and Southeast Asia. Biofortification, the process of increasing nutrients in food crops, provides a sustainable and long-term strategy for delivering micronutrients (including vitamin A through its precursor β-carotene) to populations in developing countries. Conventional breeding methods and the transgenic approach are currently being used to increase the concentrations of micronutrients in food crops. Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of whether biofortification is an effective strategy to reduce population micronutrient deficiency by establishing proof of concept for conventionally bred β-carotene–rich orange sweet potato and showing effects on maternal and child intake of vitamin A and child vitamin A status.

Rice, which is a staple food crop in many Asian countries, provides up to 80% of the energy intake of the poor; thus, it is a perfect candidate for addressing vitamin A deficiency through biofortification. Germplasm screening did not reveal any cultivar of rice capable of accumulating provitamin A carotenoids in the grain. Therefore, increasing provitamin A content could be achieved only through a transgenic approach. In β-carotene rice, commonly known as golden rice because of its yellow hue, 2 genes naturally involved in carotene biosynthesis were inserted into the rice genome by using transgenics. This insertion restarts the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway that is normally inactive, leading to the production of β-carotene in the grain. The current amount of β-carotene in biofortified β-carotene rice is 35 parts per million (ppm), 7 with an estimated bioconversion rate of 3.8:1 from β-carotene to vitamin A. A review on the bioconversion of β-carotene to vitamin A supports the inclusion of dietary interventions with plant sources of β-carotene as a strategy for increasing vitamin A status in populations at risk of deficiency. Biofortified β-carotene rice has been backcrossed into popular rice varieties for the Philippines, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh.

Vitamin A

Function of Vitamin

Vitamin A is a fat soluble nutrient obtained primarily from dietary intake, which is crucial for cellular division, growth, immune system integrity and vision. Vitamin A constitutes a group of biochemical compounds, including retinol, retinaldehyde, retinoic acid, and beta-carotene. Most pertinent for vision, 11-cis retinaldehyde (or retinal) combines with opsin in the photoreceptor outer segments to create rhodopsin. Once light strikes rhodopsin, 11-cis retinal isomerizes to all-trans retinal, leading to hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor and ultimately, initiation of the visual pathway. 11-cis retinal is regenerated in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), to allow the visual cycle to continue. Outside of the retinal photoreceptors, vitamin A maintains corneal and conjunctival epithelial cell integrity. If vitamin A deficiency occurs, these cells undergo metaplasia and keratinization, reducing the amount of mucous secreting epithelial cells on the ocular surface.

Vitamin A is obtained through leafy greens, fish oils, egg yolks, butter, and orange-coloured vegetables such as carrots. Once in the digestive tract, pancreatic enzymes break down vitamin A into monomers for absorption within the duodenum; the primary site of storage is in the liver. In times of vitamin A deficiency, this nutrient is released into circulation bound to albumin in a molecule known as transthyretin. Issues with restricted dietary habits, small intestine disease or liver pathology can lead to vitamin A deficiency. The recommended daily intake of vitamin A is between 700 μg – 900 ug/day in females and males, respectively.

Epidemiology of Disease

The global prevalence of hypovitaminosis A is approximately 30% in those less than 5 years of age and contributes to approximately 2% of deaths for that demographic. However, there is a large predilection for this disease in developing countries, as a study in 2013 found only 0.3% prevalence of vitamin A deficiency within the United States of America. Prevalence of disease though can increase to upwards of 16% in developing countries for those with inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease, and an incidence of 70% of hypovitaminosis A has been cited in those with liver cirrhosis due to poor vitamin A storage.

The etiology of hypovitaminosis A can be broken down into three groups: reduced intake, impaired absorption, and reduced storage of vitamin A. Further risk factors include lower socioeconomic status, malnutrition, zinc-deficiency (due to poor hepatic synthesis of retinol-binding protein), and exposure to diarrheal illness.

### Xanthoma of rib: a case report and review of the literature [^115p1JG9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Xanthomas (or Xanthofibromas) are well-circumscribed benign proliferative lesions seen mainly in soft tissues such as skin, tendons, fasciae and occasionally in the periosteum. On physical examination, they appear as semi-solid areas such as macules or papules or large nodules, generally yellow (Greek xanthos = yellow), due to the presence of carotene contained in the lipids.

Histologically, they are characterized by macrophage-like mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and abundant foam cells formed by macrophages because of the gradual intracellular accumulation of lipids captured by specific receptors or by the mechanism of phagocytosis.

Recently, their interest has increased for three reasons: the mechanisms involved in the development of these pathological lesions appear to be similar to those involved in the early stages of atherosclerotic plaques; their development can signal a high risk of severe metabolic and cardiovascular diseases; they are useful diagnostic markers of severe hypertriglyceridaemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia.

Bone xanthoma is rare appearing mainly in the long bones of the appendicular skeleton, in male patients and over 20 years of age; in particular, rib localization is extremely rare. Therefore, we report a case of intraosseous rib xanthoma, propose a review of the literature and discuss clinical, radiological, histopathological aspects.

### Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration [^117TUwCg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

It has been proposed that antioxidants may prevent cellular damage in the retina by reacting with free radicals that are produced in the process of light absorption.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation, or both, on the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006); SIGLE (1980 to March 2005); EMBASE (1980 to January 2005); NRR (2005, Issue 4); AMED (1985 to January 2006); and PubMed (24 January 2006 covering last 60 days), reference lists of identified reports and the Science Citation Index. We contacted investigators and experts in the field for details of unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplemention (alone or in combination) to a control intervention in people with AMD.

Data Collection and Analysis

The author extracted data and assessed trial quality. Where appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model unless three or fewer trials were available in which case a fixed-effects model was used.

Main Results

Eight trials were included in this review. The majority of people were randomised in one trial (AREDS in the United States) that found a beneficial effect of antioxidant (beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E) and zinc supplementation on progression to advanced AMD (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 99% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.93). People taking supplements were less likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity (adjusted odds ratio 0.77, 99% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.03). Hospitalisation for genito-urinary problems was more common in people taking zinc and yellowing of skin was more common in people taking antioxidants. The other trials were, in general, small and the results were inconsistent.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence as to the effectiveness of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation in halting the progression of AMD comes mainly from one large trial in the United States. The generalisability of these findings to other populations with different nutritional status is not known. Further large, well-conducted randomised controlled trials in other populations are required. Long-term harm from supplementation cannot be ruled out. Beta-carotene has been found to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers; vitamin E has been associated with an increased risk of heart failure in people with vascular disease or diabetes.

Safety outcomes

There were 16 adverse events and none were related to the supplementation. We attributed the indigestion reported by the participant who withdrew to a past medical history of acid peptic disease. In most patients (78.3%), there was either no change or a decrease in glycated hemoglobin at 3 months compared to baseline (range: 0.0 to −2.7). This proportion increased slightly to 80% at 6 months compared to baseline (range: 0.0 to −3.5). Only one patient (2%) required treatment as per the standard of care during the period of the study.

### Role of vitamin A metabolism in IIH: results from the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial [^116WEW2k]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin A and its metabolites (called retinoids) have been thought to play a role in the development of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The IIH Treatment Trial (IIHTT) showed the efficacy of acetazolamide (ACZ) in improving visual field function, papilledema grade, quality of life and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. We postulated that IIH patients would demonstrate elevated measures of vitamin A metabolites in the serum and CSF.

Methods

Comprehensive measures of serum vitamin A and its metabolites were obtained from 96 IIHTT subjects, randomly assigned to treatment with ACZ or placebo, and 25 controls with similar gender, age and body mass index (BMI). These included retinol, retinol binding protein, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), alpha- and beta-carotenes, and beta-cryptoxanthin. The IIHTT subjects also had CSF and serum vitamin A and metabolite measurements obtained at study entry and at six months.

Results

At study entry, of the vitamin A metabolites only serum ATRA was significantly different in IIHTT subjects (median 4.33nM) and controls (median 5.04nM, p = 0.02). The BMI of IIHTT subjects showed mild significant negative correlations with serum ATRA, alpha- and beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. In contrast, the control subject BMI correlated only with serum ATRA. At six months, the serum retinol, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and CSF retinol were increased from baseline in the ACZ treated group, but only increases in alpha-carotene (p = 0.02) and CSF ATRA (p = 0.04) were significantly greater in the ACZ group compared with the placebo group. No other vitamin A measures were significantly altered over the six months in either treatment group. Weight loss correlated with only with the change in serum beta-carotene (r = -0.44, p = 0.006) and the change in CSF retinol (r = -0.61, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Vitamin A toxicity is unlikely a contributory factor in the causation of IIH. Our findings differ from those of prior reports in part because of our use of more accurate quantitative methods and measuring vitamin A metabolites in both serum and CSF. ACZ may alter retinoid metabolism in IIH patients.

### Predicting the impact of diet and enzymopathies on human small intestinal epithelial cells [^114tG1th]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Heme is essential for life and is often referred to as 'pigment of life'. It is synthesized from succinyl-CoA and glycine. Enzyme deficiencies in any of the steps along the biosynthetic pathway cause different forms of porphyrias. Consistently, the metabolic task 'heme synthesis' was blocked in the porphyria models (Fig. 3). Usually porphyrias show an accumulation of porphyrins, excreted in urine and feces, which is used for biochemical diagnosis. Possible GI signs include ileal infarction in acute intermittent porphyria and villous atrophy in variegate porphyria. These clinical signs may be attributed to the lack of heme in the diet, which can lead to non-optimal bilirubin concentrations within the enterocyte. Since neither of the analyzed diets contained heme supplementation, the porphyrias also resulted in a block in the metabolic task 'heme degradation', which produces bilirubin. This compound has potential antioxidant activity, comparable with that of beta-carotene and tocopherol, under low oxygen conditions and, at very low concentrations, bilirubin tends to exert protective effects on the small intestine. The porphyria models were not able to secrete carbon monoxide (Fig. 4), which has various roles in the GI tract, including regulation of GI motility, activation of guanylate cyclase (suggested role in inflammation), function as a neurotransmitter, contribution to the membrane potential gradient and exerting protective role during GI injury. Particularly, the latter role suggests that this compound may contribute to the GI inflammation observed in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Interestingly, IBD patients are prone to develop acute intermittent porphyria, i.e. AIP. The clinical manifestations of AIP patients also include neurological dysfunction. The predicted reduced urea secretion flux (Fig. 4) in the porphyria models was due to a reduced urea cycle, indicating ammonia toxicity. For instance, clinical features of hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria include neurological dysfunction. The computed altered urea secretion flux for porphyrias could thus indicate that ammonia toxicity may also affect the brain of patients with types of other porphyrias. These computational results provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the extensive clinical manifestations observed in porphyria patients.

### Toxicity of oxidized β-carotene to cultured human cells [^111jKpUk]. Experimental Eye Research (2005). Low credibility.

Carotenoids are effective antioxidants in vitro, but they are also susceptible to autoxidation, which generates volatile and biologically active aldehydes and ketones. In a previous study, we showed that autoxidized beta-carotene inhibits Na+-K+-ATPase activity more effectively than aldehydic products derived from lipid peroxidation, such as 4-hydroxynonenal. In this study, we compared mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured human K562 erythroleukaemic and 28 SV4 retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in response to the degradation products of beta-carotene autoxidation using the MTT assay. We found that oxidized beta-carotene is cytotoxic and that mitochondrial function is decreased in both K562 and RPE cells. In addition, the RPE cells were more resistant to this form of oxidative stress, suggesting that its cytotoxicity may depend on cellular antioxidant capacity.

Ocular Manifestations

Patients with abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) lose apolipoprotein B which leads to reduced levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and in turn low absorption of lipid soluble vitamins like vitamin E. Ocular manifestations of ABL like ophthalmoplegia, strabismus and nystagmus usually appear in childhood. However, the most profound ocular manifestation is ABL retinopathy, which can eventually lead to reduction in visual acuity. Early treatment with vitamin E supplementation attenuates the severe retinal damage associated with this disorder.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is another retinopathy associated with vitamin E deficiency. Infants, especially premature newborns, are at higher risk of oxidative damage due to increased exposure to ROS and decreased levels of antioxidants. Premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) are at even higher risk as treatment of RDS exposures them to elevated concentrations of oxygen, further increasing the level of free radicals. Prematurity and oxidative damage promote the development of ROP. Due to its function as an effective antioxidant, vitamin E's role in the management of ROP has been studied. Although prophylactic vitamin E in premature infants is inconclusive, there is some evidence that vitamin E supplementation reduces the severity but not total incidence of ROP.

Oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related ocular diseases such as AMD and cataracts. As a result, antioxidants such as vitamin E have been studied for their potential role in protecting against these diseases. The landmark AREDS clinical trial investigated the role of antioxidants vitamin C and E, beta-carotene (vitamin A), zinc and copper on the progression of AMD. Their results indicated that the AREDS formulation which contains 400 IU of vitamin E daily (1334% the RDA) reduced the progression of AMD. Furthermore, patients with AMD had lower levels of serum vitamin E compared to healthy controls.

Workup of Vitamin Deficiency

Severe vitamin E deficiency is more common children compared to adults, likely due to their lower stores. Severe vitamin E deficiency leads to anemia, spinocerebellar ataxia, AVED, neuropathies and myopathies. Patients with malabsorption disorders, α-TTP or signs of severe malnutrition showing symptoms associated with vitamin E deficiency should be tested. Definite diagnosis is made by measuring serum α-tocopherol level. In adults, α-tocopherol < 12 mol/L (0.5mg/dL) is considered inadequate or deficient. As vitamin E status is affected by lipid levels, correction of α-tocopherol to lipid concentration is recommended in patients with hyperlipidemia so that the lipid:α-tocopherol ratio is similar to those with normal circulating lipid concentrations.

### Erythropoietic protoporphyria in Sweden: demographic, clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics [^112EUTWG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the demographic, clinical, biochemical and genotypic features of patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) in a Swedish cohort.

Design

Cross-sectional questionnaire, biochemical and genetic study.

Setting

Sweden.

Subjects

Fifty-one Swedish individuals known in 2008 to have EPP confirmed by molecular diagnosis. There were no exclusion criteria; all patients were included in the demographic and genetic study. A total of 92% participants completed the questionnaire study and 82% the biochemical study.

Results

The prevalence of EPP was 1: 180,000. Nine novel ferrochelatase gene mutations were found. The most commonly reported age at onset of symptoms was the first year of life and the mean age at diagnosis was 22 years. Painful photosensitivity was the main symptom. Exogenous factors other than sunlight were frequently reported to cause cutaneous symptoms. One in five patients reported a positive effect of beta-carotene therapy. A marked impact of EPP on quality of life was reported. Women had a significantly lower mean erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration than men. Of all participants, 84% had insufficient vitamin D concentrations, 44% had below normal serum ferritin or transferrin saturation levels and red cell abnormalities were common.

Conclusions

The notably delayed diagnosis suggests the need for an increased awareness of EPP. Disturbed erythropoiesis, biochemical signs of iron deficiency and low vitamin D levels are frequent findings in this disease. New and better treatments are needed as current treatment options for symptom amelioration are limited. Vitamin D supplementation should be considered.

### Low xanthophylls, retinol, lycopene, and tocopherols in Grey and white matter of brains with Alzheimer's disease [^111n8J6s]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The importance of low lutein and zeaxanthin in AD brains is emphasized by reports that those with highest levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in their diet, plasma, serum, or macular pigment (retinal accumulation of lutein and zeaxanthin) have a 50% lower risk for an AD diagnosis, and higher cognitive performance. Performance of cognitively normal and AD subjects on the Mini-Mental State Examination correlated positively with plasma levels of both lutein and zeaxanthin, even after correction for HDL cholesterol levels. The observation that lutein and zeaxanthin were selectively lower in white matter aligns with previous reports associating better white matter integrity with higher serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin, and increased risk for white matter lesions with low serum carotenoids. Presence of white matter lesions are a risk factor for greater progression from MCI to AD and white matter dysfunction is linked to cognitive decline in mutation carriers. Lutein and zeaxanthin may slow cognitive decline and reduce risk for AD by helping to preserve white matter connectivity.

Meso-zeaxanthin not detected

The absence of meso-zeaxanthin in the brain is not surprising, as it is rarely detected in human serum except in subjects taking meso-zeaxanthin supplements or eating eggs laid by meso-zeaxanthin supplemented chickens. Other known sources — fish skin, shrimp shells, turtle fat, and vertebrate eyes — are rare dietary components. A small trial found that absorption of lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin from a combined supplement was less robust than when the supplement contained equal amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin alone or in combination; this raises the possibilities that meso-zeaxanthin in the diet would be poorly absorbed, and/or that meso-zeaxanthin could interfere with absorption of lutein and zeaxanthin.

Meso-zeaxanthin found in macular pigment is produced by conversion of lutein to meso-zeaxanthin by the enzyme RPE65 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE, a monolayer located under the retina). RPE65 is specifically localized in the RPE where it also plays an essential role in the visual cycle. Zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin are accumulated in macula pigment by binding to GSTP1 (glutathione-S-transferase, pi isoform) where they absorb damaging blue light and synergistically reduce membrane peroxidation; the bound meso-zeaxanthin is thus not available for circulation to the brain.

### Dietary intakes of vitamins A, C, and E and risk of melanoma in two cohorts of women [^112wnrKt]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of melanoma in the US is increasing at a greater rate than that of any other cancer site, and this is considered real and not because of earlier detection or changes in diagnostic criteria. Excessive exposure to sunlight is the primary environmental risk factor for melanoma. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun produces free radicals that may initiate carcinogenesis through oxidative damage to DNA, and antioxidant nutrients, such as carotenoids and vitamins E and C, can neutralize the free radicals or even suppress their creation. In animals, β -carotene and α -tocopherol can inhibit skin tumours induced by UV light. Preformed vitamin A (i.e. retinol) is necessary for the regulation of cell differentiation and can also reduce the incidence of skin tumours in animals exposed to UV light. Certain carotenoids (e.g. α -carotene, β -carotene, β -cryptoxanthin) are metabolised to retinol. These retinol precursors along with antioxidant nutrients are prominent components of fruits and vegetables and may account for the observed anticancer effects of these foods.

Although antioxidants and retinol appear to be beneficial for some cancers, little is known about their effect on the development of melanoma. In case–control studies, lower risks of melanoma have been associated with higher blood levels of α -tocopherol, β -carotene, and retinol, and with greater dietary intakes of vitamin E and β -carotene. Only one prospective study of diet and melanoma has been reported and no associations were found for carotenoids, retinoids, or vitamins C and E, although the questionnaire was inadequate for accurate assessment of these nutrients.

In this prospective study within two cohorts of women, we examined the risk of melanoma by intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E and specific tocopherols, retinol, and β -carotene and other carotenoids.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^117Lmoyt]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) supplements and AREDS2 — In patients at high risk for progression, the AREDS2 study found no statistically significant difference for AMD progression between the modified AREDS formula and other modifications, and omega-3 supplementation (DHA and EPA) had no effect and no benefit. In subgroup analysis of those in the lowest quartile for lutein and zeaxanthin intake, lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation was protective (95% CI, 0.59–0.94; P = 0.01), and lutein and zeaxanthin represent an appropriate substitute for beta-carotene in the supplement. A meta-analysis of adverse effects reported increased risk of death from vitamin A, beta-carotene, and vitamin E supplements (16%, 7%, 4%, respectively), and two studies reported increased mortality among heavy smokers taking beta-carotene to prevent lung cancer. Zinc findings included no demonstrated detrimental effect of lowering zinc to 25 mg on progression to advanced disease, a meta-analysis indicating zinc alone may not produce clinically meaningful changes in VA, and a post hoc AREDS/AREDS2 analysis evaluating 1602 eyes with GA that found oral zinc supplementation slowed GA progression toward the central macula.

### Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission [^115xPUbF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Vitamin A refers to a group of unsaturated organic compounds that include preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids (Damodaran 2017). The vitamin exists as preformed retinol in animal food sources, retinyl esters in fortified foods, and provitamin A carotenoids in plant sources. Both preformed vitamin A and provitamin A are metabolized in cells to retinal and retinoic acid, the active forms of vitamin A, to upkeep the vitamin's multiple biological functions (Thorne‐Lyman 2012).

The biological functions of vitamin A include the regulation and promotion of growth and differentiation of many cells, and maintenance of the integrity of the epithelial cells of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Vitamin A is necessary for formation of the photosensitive visual pigment in the retina, and reproductive functions (Wolf 2001; Tanumihardjo 2011). In the 1920s the vitamin was considered to be an anti‐infective agent (Green 1928), and there is increasing evidence that it is essential for normal immune function (Ross 1996; Semba 1998).

Vitamin A deficiency is most prevalent in areas where diets lack preformed vitamin A, such as in South and Southeast Asia, and Sahel and sub‐Saharan regions of Africa (West 2001). It has been estimated that about 19 million pregnant women in low‐income countries are affected with vitamin A deficiency each year (West 2002; WHO 2009). Vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women is associated with night blindness, severe anaemia, wasting, malnutrition, reproductive and infectious morbidity (Christian 1998a), and increased risk of mortality one to two years following delivery (Christian 2000). About 10 million women suffer from night blindness during pregnancy as a result of Vitamin A deficiency, and this is associated with a constellation of adverse health and nutritional conditions among mothers and their infants (Christian 1998b; Christian 1998c; Christian 2001; WHO 2009).

Management

A daily recommended intake of 12–15 mg of α-tocopherol is recommended for adults. In people with symptomatic vitamin E deficiency, daily vitamin E supplementation up to 2000 mg is given. In patients with ABL, prophylactic vitamin E supplementation is recommended to prevent the development and progression of neurologic symptoms.

### Dietary profile of patients with stargardt's disease and retinitis pigmentosa: is there a role for a nutritional approach? [^113HXPga]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over the last years, some nutrients like vitamin A, docosahexaenoic acid, and lutein have been proposed to influence the clinical course of the two most common retinal dystrophies, STGD and RP. In fact in STGD vitamin A cannot be properly metabolized because of ABCA4 protein impairment and gives origin to toxic byproducts which are the main components of lipofuscin. On the other side in most RP patients genetic abnormalities prevent the appropriate processing of vitamin A in phototransduction and visual cycle. Indeed, in opposite ways, both STGD and RP may be significantly influenced by dietary intake of these nutrients.

In STGD, experimental studies in animal models suggested that a reduction of vitamin A dietary intake, and their resulting circulating levels, might arrest the accumulation of retinal toxic metabolites, so ameliorating the clinical course of the disease. However, a low vitamin A diet has never been proposed and evaluation of dietary profiles of these patients has never been conducted. Conversely, in RP, nutritional supplementation with vitamin A associated with docosahexaenoic acid or lutein has been already evaluated in clinical trials, showing some beneficial effects, even if the efficacy and safety of this approach is still controversial: in fact, the high doses of vitamin A proposed in RP patients have the potential risk of bone and liver damage, and severe birth defects if assumed by pregnant women.

Materials and methods

Study population

The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study included 29 133 male smokers, aged 50–69 years, recruited between 1985 and 1988 from southwestern Finland (latitude of study area 60 — 64°N).

The original randomised trial tested the effects of daily supplementation with α -tocopherol (50 mg per day), β -carotene (20 mg per day), both, or placebo on cancer incidence. Study supplementation continued for 5–8 years until death or trial closure (30 April 1993), after which participants were followed as a longitudinal cohort. At study entry, participants completed detailed questionnaires including data on education, physical activity, medical history, and smoking and dietary habits. A follow-up questionnaire that queried hair colour at age 20, eye colour, and skin phototype (patterned after theclassification) was administered between 1989 and 1993 to the 20 863 active study participants (among these men, 1105 had fasting serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) subsequently measured as controls in other substudies). The ATBC study was approved by the institutional review boards of the US National Cancer Institute and the National Public Health Institute of Finland, with written informed consent obtained from each participant.

Prostate cancer ascertainment

A total of 1982 incident prostate cancers were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry from among all 20 863 subjects who completed the follow-up questionnaire (including all trial arms). The Registry has been shown to identify and correctly classify nearly all cancers occurring in the ATBC cohort.

Statistical analysis

Follow-up time for each participant was calculated from the date of randomisation through the date of prostate cancer diagnosis, death or end of follow-up (31 December 2009), with up to 25 years of individual follow-up. Calculating follow-up time from the date of the follow-up questionnaire did not alter the findings. Baseline descriptive statistics, contrasting participants with and without self-reported red hair, were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (continuous variables) or χ 2 -tests (categorical variables). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression, with the most common hair colour, eye colour, and skin phototype categories as reference. Multivariate-adjustment (see Table 2 for adjustment factors) did not alter the risk estimates substantially. The hazard proportionality assumption was met. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

### Improvements in circulating cholesterol, antioxidants, and homocysteine after dietary intervention in an Australian aboriginal community [^114w2cDe]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Poor nutrition contributes to high rates of coronary heart disease among Australian Aboriginal populations. Since late 1993, the Aboriginal community described here has operated a healthy lifestyle program aimed at reducing the risk of chronic disease.

Objective

We evaluated the effectiveness of a community-directed intervention program to reduce coronary heart disease risk through dietary modification.

Design

Intervention processes included store management policy changes, health promotion activities, and nutrition education aimed at high-risk individuals. Dietary advice was focused on decreasing saturated fat and sugar intake and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Evaluation of the program included conducting sequential, cross-sectional risk factor surveys at 2-y intervals; measuring fasting cholesterol, lipid-soluble antioxidants, and homocysteine concentrations; and assessing smoking status. Nutrient intakes were estimated from analysis of food turnover in the single community store.

Results

There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (age-adjusted prevalences were 31%, 21%, and 15% at baseline, 2 y, and 4 y, respectively; P < 0.001). There were significant increases in plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, lutein and zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene across the population. Retinol and lycopene concentrations did not change significantly. Mean plasma homocysteine concentrations decreased by 3 micromol/L. There was no significant change in smoking prevalence between the 2 follow-up surveys. There was an increase in the density of fresh fruit and vegetables and carotenoids in the food supply at the community store.

Conclusion

This community-directed dietary intervention program reduced the prevalence of coronary heart disease risk factors related to diet.

### Carotenemia vs jaundice… [^114Lobrp]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. To the Editor — Included in the differential diagnosis of jaundice is the yellow tint of the skin caused by carotene. A recent clinical observation differentiated these entities. The patient was a 28-year-old woman who was referred for evaluation of a yellow color to her skin. She had felt well except for some loss of visual acuity. In addition to oral contraceptives, she ingested many vitamins and food supplements including multivitamin tablets; vitamins C, E, D, and A; wheat germ oil; desiccated liver; brewer's yeast; zinc; bone meal and kelp tablets; and lecithin capsules. Her diet contained ample yellow, carotene-containing vegetables. Abnormal physical findings were limited to the skin, which showed a striking yellow color, most notable on the palms of the hands, the knees, and the soles of the feet.

This was clearly evident when viewed under artificial light but barely discernible when viewed in natural light. The. Leonard JW. Carotenemia vs Jaundice. JAMA. 1976;

### Orangeness-peeling back the myths behind carotenemia… [^113C9gHF]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Orange skin, often attributed to carotenemia, features prominently in pop culture and media. Such appearances tend to fall into 2 categories: biomedically oriented approaches or ones indicating deeper symbolic meaning. The first approach emphasizes biological mechanisms, as seen in medical television shows such as House and Scrubs. Patients present as orange after gorging on carrots and either niacin or tomato juice. In a clear example on the children's show The Magic School Bus, Ms Frizzle takes her audience on a field trip to determine why Arnold has turned orange. They discover that rapacious consumption of Sea Wheedies, Arnold's favorite snack, released massive amounts of beta-carotene, causing his skin change. Hsiao C, Clukay CJ.

### Carotinemia in an adult… [^112JWUf6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Carotinemia as a clinical entity was established by the work of Hess and Meyers1 in 1923. They observed a peculiar symptomless discoloration of the cheeks, alae nasi and forehead, and occasionally a generalized tinting of the skin in children fed on a high carrot diet. They were able to produce the pigmentation by the administration of carotin, and they saw it disappear when the pigment was withheld and the pigment-bearing vegetables were eliminated from the diet. It was also discovered that spinach, oranges and egg yolk contain a large amount of carotin. DeBuys2 reported two interesting cases of carotinemia in new-born children, observed and studied in 1911 and 1913, and diagnosed in 1923 after the publication of the paper by Hess and Meyers. A high vegetable diet had been advised for the mother, who took the advice too literally and practically lived on green vegetables. Each child when. Potts WJ. CAROTINEMIA IN AN ADULT.

### Localized carotenoid pigmentation (aurantiasis) [^116Sxs6N]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This case report deals with an unusual localization of carotenoid pigment associated with diffuse arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, following overingestion of saffron. Carotenemia is due either to metabolic error as in diabetes, xanthoma, and myxedema, or to the excessive ingestion of lipochromes in oranges, carrots, egg yolks, saffron, and other brightly colored foods. 1, 2 The nasolabial folds, the palms, and soles are the sites of predilection affected in mild cases; when severe, pigmentation is generalized except in the sclerae. 3 Hashimoto4 gave the concept the name "aurantiasis" when it is a result merely of overingestion. Wolf, 5 Auckland, 6 and McConaghey7 reported cases in persons following eccentric dietary habits. Carotene is the yellow coloring matter in the lipochromes of carrots, spinach, palm oil, and nettles. It is a highly concentrated hydrocarbon, C40H56, existing in three forms — α, β, and γ. All these are precursors of vitamin A. REISCH M.

### Hypercarotenemia in anorexia nervosa… [^116ggRhR]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Twelve patients with anorexia nervosa and weight loss ranging from 25% to 44% of total body weight were studied with respect to aberrations in serum carotene levels. Hypercarotenemia was found in nine of the 12. Hypercarotenemia apparently has not been previously described in other forms of human starvation. Other conditions which may lead to disturbances in lipid metabolism and which have been associated with hypercarotenemia were ruled out. An abnormality in lipid metabolism in anorexia nervosa is suggested by these findings. Pops MA, Schwabe AD. Hypercarotenemia in Anorexia Nervosa. JAMA. 1968; 205: 533–534.
