## Question

Labs to evaluate for coagulation disorders

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which labs to order to evaluate coagulation disorders across clinical contexts, and how to interpret and expand testing stepwise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario because preoperative screening, active bleeding, thrombosis, and anticoagulant monitoring drive different test choices. Then, I should define an initial core panel and its limitations. Next, I will map abnormal results to second-line tests, consider global/advanced assays, integrate population-specific issues, highlight pre-analytical pitfalls, and finally synthesize practical algorithms for common scenarios, all while verifying each step against guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the importance of clinical context; routine universal coagulation screening is discouraged because it poorly predicts bleeding risk, so I need to anchor testing to indications such as high-bleeding-risk procedures, active bleeding, suspected thrombosis, DIC, or anticoagulant exposure before I order anything [^116gw3S5] [^112FaoWG] [^117TZEX1] [^111CtB8o].

> I should identify who truly needs evaluation; high-risk procedures, sepsis or trauma with suspected DIC, liver disease, malnutrition or prolonged antibiotics suggesting vitamin K deficiency, known or suspected anticoagulant use, unexplained preoperative aPTT prolongation, active bleeding of unclear cause, or a strong family/personal bleeding history are the groups where targeted testing is warranted, and I must remember that INR in cirrhosis is a poor bleeding predictor despite frequent prolongation [^112FaoWG] [^116TdBDH] [^113Axzdh] [^111CtB8o] [^113Uiqqi] [^117TZEX1] [^112DUYA3].

> Next, I will set the core initial laboratory screen; PT/INR for extrinsic and common pathways, aPTT for intrinsic and common pathways, Clauss fibrinogen for clot substrate, platelet count for primary hemostasis, and D-dimer when DIC is suspected, with recognition that aPTT prolongation is nonspecific and INR is not a reliable bleeding predictor in liver disease while the ISTH DIC score uses platelets, PT prolongation, fibrinogen, and fibrin-related markers to stratify risk [^117AYd2c] [^113Uiqqi] [^113Axzdh] [^116TdBDH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with an abnormal PT or aPTT; I should verify with mixing studies, both immediate and after incubation, to distinguish factor deficiencies from inhibitors, then proceed to factor assays such as VIII, IX, XI for hemophilias or II, V, VII, X for specific deficits, and I must also consider lupus anticoagulant when aPTT is prolonged with thrombotic rather than bleeding risk, and test for acquired hemophilia A when a new bleeding phenotype coincides with isolated aPTT prolongation that fails to correct on incubation [^113Uiqqi] [^117XShmk] [^111Vx1e7].

> If bleeding persists despite a normal PT, aPTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen, I need to check for von Willebrand disease with VWF antigen, activity, and possibly multimers; I should review platelet function with light transmission or impedance aggregometry when mucocutaneous bleeding suggests a primary hemostasis disorder; I must not forget factor XIII activity because FXIII deficiency causes significant bleeding with normal routine screens; and wait, let me verify dysfibrinogenemia if thrombin time or reptilase time is abnormal and the fibrinogen activity to antigen ratio is low [^116xUx7K] [^1174tvJN] [^1112d7DR] [^1167yYwG] [^113H1yJx].

> For thrombosis or suspected inherited thrombophilia, I should double-check whether testing will alter management because guidelines advise against routine testing in many scenarios; when justified, functional antithrombin, protein C and S activity, APC resistance with factor V Leiden genotyping, and prothrombin G20210A are reasonable, while timing off anticoagulants and excluding liver disease or acute thrombosis effects is critical for interpretation, and in parallel I can use D-dimer for VTE evaluation and anti-Xa for heparin quantitation when needed [^112DUYA3] [^111pNvRP] [^1138hsiC] [^117KpFqP] [^117TZEX1].

> I will now examine the role of global or advanced assays; viscoelastic testing with TEG or ROTEM provides real-time guidance in trauma, massive hemorrhage, and liver disease and is recommended to be initiated early and repeated to guide transfusion, whereas thrombin generation assay is a promising research tool for assessing overall pro and anticoagulant balance but is not yet standard of care in routine practice [^111CtB8o] [^114qYFMj] [^114MhbJT] [^116TdBDH] [^114oBxwu].

> Let me consider population-specific nuances; in pediatrics and neonates I must use age-appropriate reference ranges given developmental hemostasis and remember higher likelihood of FXIII deficiency or VWD in children with bleeding phenotypes, and I should confirm that a prolonged aPTT in neonates may reflect physiologic contact factor immaturity rather than pathology [^115NkTg5] [^114e6Rzi] [^112qZnA1].

> In pregnancy, I need to ensure I interpret tests within the hypercoagulable physiology of increased fibrinogen and factor VIII with reduced protein S, so unexpected "normal" values may actually be low relative to pregnancy norms, and the clinical threshold for thrombosis evaluation is lower in high-risk presentations [^113hufDC].

> For liver disease, I should verify the concept of rebalanced hemostasis; INR reflects reduced procoagulants but not concomitant drops in anticoagulants, so it is a poor bleeding predictor and should not be "corrected" in isolation before procedures, and instead I should target platelet and fibrinogen thresholds and consider viscoelastic testing to guide hemostatic therapy in bleeding or procedural settings [^113Axzdh] [^116TdBDH] [^111RdFG4].

> Regarding DOACs, I should confirm that routine monitoring is not required, yet when decisions hinge on drug effect I can use calibrated anti-Xa assays for factor Xa inhibitors and dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran as pragmatic approaches in selected perioperative or bleeding scenarios [^117TZEX1].

> I need to ensure pre-analytical integrity; a 9:1 blood to 3.2% sodium citrate ratio, proper filling, and avoidance of hemolysis or lipemia are essential to avoid spurious results, and during supply constraints it is reasonable to conserve citrate tubes and limit nonessential testing; but wait, I should also remember drug interferences such as emicizumab causing falsely normal or abnormal clotting assays and heparin lowering antithrombin activity, which require alternative or drug-specific assays [^114PxjnE] [^115xWzfn] [^117KpFqP].

> When DIC is suspected, I should review PT, aPTT, platelets, fibrinogen, and D-dimer and calculate the ISTH DIC score; I must avoid basing transfusion purely on labs and instead treat active bleeding or procedural needs while maintaining platelets above 50×10⁹/L in bleeding malignancy-associated DIC and remembering that APL specifically mandates prompt coagulation assessment for DIC at diagnosis [^117AYd2c] [^113mp8oJ] [^113kT5ec] [^115j35Ws] [^115EeFtN].

> Let me synthesize scenario-based algorithms. For preoperative assessment, I should first take a structured bleeding history using validated tools and only order PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count when the history is positive or the procedure is high risk; unexplained abnormalities warrant mixing studies and factor assays, and if screening is normal but suspicion remains, I proceed to VWF testing, platelet function testing, and factor XIII activity while avoiding routine population screening [^112FaoWG] [^116gw3S5] [^114vHxZQ]. For active bleeding, I should obtain PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, platelet count, and D-dimer urgently, compute the ISTH DIC score if sepsis or malignancy is suspected, and add viscoelastic testing in massive hemorrhage to guide component therapy in real time [^117AYd2c] [^114qYFMj]. For thrombotic evaluation, I should use D-dimer and appropriate imaging first and reserve thrombophilia testing for cases where results will change management after counseling and timing off anticoagulants [^112DUYA3] [^111pNvRP] [^1138hsiC].

> Finally, I should double-check the key takeaways; the core screen is PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen by Clauss, platelet count, and D-dimer when DIC is on the table; escalation depends on patterns and clinical context rather than blanket screening; global viscoelastic tests have value in trauma and liver disease; specialized assays for VWD, platelet function, FXIII, and dysfibrinogenemia are essential when screens are normal but bleeding persists; and a careful bleeding history often outperforms indiscriminate lab panels in predicting perioperative bleeding risk [^111CtB8o] [^116TdBDH] [^117XShmk] [^1167yYwG] [^115apUhR] [^116gw3S5].

The essential laboratory tests to evaluate coagulation disorders include **PT/INR, aPTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen** as the initial screen, with D-dimer and viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) for global assessment and guidance in acute bleeding or thrombosis [^112FaoWG] [^111CtB8o]. For unexplained bleeding or thrombosis, add **factor assays, VWF panel, and mixing studies** to identify specific deficiencies or inhibitors [^114vHxZQ]. Thrombophilia testing (antithrombin, protein C/S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, antiphospholipid antibodies) is reserved for selected patients with unprovoked or recurrent events [^112DUYA3]. Use thrombin generation assays for complex or rare disorders, and interpret results in clinical context, considering medication effects and clinical scenario [^114eqc3F].

---

## Initial screening tests

- **Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)**: Evaluates extrinsic and common pathways; prolonged PT/INR suggests factor VII deficiency, vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, or warfarin therapy [^114v1HCb].

- **Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)**: Assesses intrinsic and common pathways; prolonged aPTT indicates hemophilia A/B, von Willebrand disease, lupus anticoagulant, or heparin therapy [^113Uiqqi].

- **Platelet count**: Identifies thrombocytopenia, a common cause of bleeding [^111DbZRS].

- **Fibrinogen level**: Low fibrinogen suggests DIC, liver disease, or congenital fibrinogen disorders [^117AYd2c] [^113H1yJx].

- **D-dimer**: Elevated in DIC, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and COVID-19-associated coagulopathy [^113kT5ec] [^112bx7Jv] [^111Yv3ze].

---

## Specialized coagulation tests

### Coagulation factor assays

- **Factor VIII and IX assays**: Diagnose hemophilia A and B [^112qZnA1].

- **Factor XI and XIII assays**: Identify rare factor deficiencies [^1147p2vn].

- **Von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and activity assays**: Diagnose von Willebrand disease [^114vHxZQ].

- **Mixing studies**: Differentiate factor deficiencies from inhibitors [^113Uiqqi].

---

### Platelet function tests

- **Platelet function analyzer (PFA-100)**: Screens for platelet dysfunction [^111DbZRS].

- **Light transmission aggregometry (LTA)**: Gold standard for platelet function disorders [^1174tvJN].

- **Flow cytometry**: Detects specific platelet receptor defects [^111DbZRS].

---

### Global hemostasis assays

Among global hemostasis assays, the **thrombin generation assay (TGA)** assesses overall hemostatic balance and is useful in complex bleeding or thrombotic disorders [^1141Z1aQ], whereas **thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)** provide real-time assessment of clot formation, stability, and lysis, guiding transfusion and hemostatic therapy during acute bleeding [^114qdTDt] [^114MhbJT].

---

## Thrombophilia testing

Thrombophilia testing includes **antithrombin, protein C, and protein S** assays to identify inherited thrombophilias; Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A genetic tests detect common genetic thrombophilias, and **antiphospholipid antibody testing** diagnoses antiphospholipid syndrome [^112DUYA3] [^111pNvRP].

---

## Clinical context and patient history

A detailed **bleeding history** is essential to guide test selection and interpretation. A **medication review** is also crucial because anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents significantly affect test results, and the clinical scenario — acute bleeding, thrombosis, or chronic conditions such as liver disease — likewise influences which tests are ordered and how results are interpreted [^117TZEX1] [^111RdFG4].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to preoperative coagulation testing, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a coagulation screen (including PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen) in patients undergoing high-bleeding-risk procedures, and in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, prolonged antibiotic use, and those at risk of coagulopathy, such as in cases of sepsis or critical illness.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for transfusion strategies in critical care, the ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining early and repeated monitoring of hemostasis. This includes using traditional laboratory determinations such as PT/INR, Clauss fibrinogen level, and platelet count, and/or point-of-care PT/INR and/or a viscoelastic method.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^117TZEX1]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

A detailed medication and symptomatic bleeding history should identify oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs and their last intake. Laboratory tests can be used to monitor effects or residual effects on coagulation, which, particularly in patients with multiorgan dysfunction, may be present despite timely termination of drug intake. For example, the INR is the reference assay for warfarin and VKA therapy. Platelet function testing (e.g. impedance aggregometry) facilitates monitoring of preoperative antiplatelet drug effects. Preoperatively, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can be monitored with specific calibrated assays or, in the case of targeting factor Xa, with a global (uncalibrated) anti-Xa assay as a qualitative screening tool. Recent recommendations have provided a pragmatic approach for DOAC monitoring.

When the unconscious patient requires emergency surgery or when a thorough history or assessment is not possible, a qualitative screening of the coagulation system for inherited and acquired coagulation disorders can be helpful. Even given the limitations of available routine laboratory coagulation assays, such a protocol may be helpful to provide an initial assessment of the coagulation to screen for inherited coagulation disorders and/or potential use of anticoagulants. Limitations of laboratory tests, particularly in severe trauma, should be considered. This includes the fact that colloids and fibrinolysis may alter prothrombin time, activated PTT, and fibrinogen assays.

### Clinical use of thrombin generation assays [^114eqc3F]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

**Essentials**: Evaluation of a patient's hemostatic profile is crucial in many clinical situations. The thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a versatile global assay used for assessing the hemostatic balance. Decreased thrombin generation (TG) is associated with a bleeding propensity, whereas exaggerated TG is linked to an increased thrombotic risk. TGA is a powerful method for diagnosing patients with thrombotic disorders and infection-related coagulopathy. It has also proven to be an effective tool in managing patients with inherited and acquired bleeding disorders.

### Thrombophilia testing: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^112DUYA3]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Although these effects are significant, their utility is limited. Clinical history, in conjunction with simple tests such as D-dimer in selected patients, can identify those whose risk of recurrence is high enough to warrant long-term anticoagulation and which is not lowered significantly by the absence of a thrombophilic trait. These factors also identify patients with a low risk of recurrence not requiring long-term anticoagulation, even in the presence of heritable thrombophilic traits.

There is no evidence that the presence of heritable thrombophilia influences the intensity, choice, or monitoring of anticoagulant therapy when treating thrombosis, except potentially in those with AT deficiency. In AT deficiency, diagnosis makes specific treatment (antithrombin concentrate) available, which can be valuable and can also facilitate interpretation of laboratory monitoring of heparin. Nonetheless, this is a rare disorder, and routine testing is not advised in the absence of a strong family history (defined as two or more first-degree relatives with VTE).

### Comparison of diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Diagnostic criteria of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis and of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare for overt DIC [^117AYd2c]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). High credibility.

The ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of DIC, a complex systemic thrombohemorrhagic disorder. This tool is particularly useful in stratifying patients based on the severity of their coagulation abnormalities, thereby facilitating timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions.

The ISTH DIC criteria incorporate four primary components: platelet count, fibrinogen degradation product level, prothrombin time (PT) prolongation, and fibrinogen level. Each component is scored based on the severity of the abnormality.

- **Platelet count**: Scored as 0 for counts ≥ 100 ×10⁹/L, 1 for counts between 51–100 ×10⁹/L, and 2 for counts < 51 ×10⁹/L.
- **Fibrinogen degradation product level**: Scored as 0 for no increase, 2 for moderate increase, and 3 for strong increase.
- **Prothrombin time (PT) prolongation**: Scored as 0 for < 3 seconds, 1 for 3–6 seconds, and 2 for > 6 seconds.
- **Fibrinogen level**: Scored as 0 for > 1 g/L and 1 for ≤ 1 g/L.

The total score is calculated by summing the scores from each of the four components. A total score of less than 5 suggests that the criteria for DIC are not met, while a score of 5 or more meets the criteria for DIC. This scoring system allows for a standardized and objective assessment of DIC, which can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable clinical presentation and the lack of a single definitive diagnostic test.

### A diagnostic approach to mild bleeding disorders [^114vHxZQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Mild inherited bleeding disorders are relatively common in the general population. Despite recent advances in diagnostic approaches, mild inherited bleeding disorders still pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Hemorrhagic diathesis can be caused by disorders in primary hemostasis, such as von Willebrand disease and inherited platelet function disorders, secondary hemostasis, such as hemophilia A and B and other rare coagulant factor deficiencies, as well as fibrinolysis and issues in connective tissue or vascular formation.

This review summarizes the currently available diagnostic methods for mild bleeding disorders and their pitfalls, ranging from structured patient history to highly specialized laboratory diagnosis. A comprehensive framework for a diagnostic approach to mild inherited bleeding disorders is proposed.

### International recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of acquired hemophilia A [^113Uiqqi]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

A prolonged APTT is not specific to FVIII deficiency; other causes of APTT prolongation are much more common. Therefore, a prolonged APTT does not constitute a good predictive biomarker for bleeding, as evidenced by UK guidelines recommending against routine testing in unselected patients. However, we recommend that an unexplained APTT prolongation should not be ignored if it is encountered before surgery or in bleeding patients. Measuring normal FVIII, factor IX (FIX), or factor XI (FXI) levels will exclude a bleeding diathesis in such cases, and testing for conditions that prolong the APTT but do not pose a bleeding risk, such as lupus anticoagulant (LA) and factor XII deficiency, may be performed.

We recommend that the diagnosis of AHA should be considered whenever an acute or recent onset of bleeding is accompanied by an unexplained prolonged APTT (GRADE 1B).

We recommend that unexplained APTT prolongation prior to surgery should be investigated and not ignored (GRADE 1C).

- **Mixing tests**: Coagulation factor deficiencies or coagulation factor inhibitors, including autoantibodies, LA, or pharmacological anticoagulants, may result in a prolonged APTT. To distinguish a factor deficiency from the presence of an inhibitory substance, mixing tests may be conducted if FVIII:C is not immediately available. AHA FVIII inhibitors are time- and temperature-dependent, so APTT results obtained immediately following the mixture of normal and patient plasma and following a 2-hour incubation should be compared. These tests are poorly standardized and cannot be used to establish or exclude AHA.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: Sixth edition [^112uYtQi]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for red blood cell transfusion, specifically in the context of coagulation and viscoelastic testing, the ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend initiating monitoring and measures to support coagulation immediately upon hospital admission of patients with traumatic hemorrhage.

### Coagulation testing and management in liver disease patients [^116TdBDH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The present article aims to provide clinicians with an overview of coagulation testing in individuals with liver disease, discuss available procoagulants and the rationale for their use, and offer management strategies in various common clinical scenarios.

Clinicians and researchers are gaining an increased understanding of the shortfalls of assessing bleeding risk using traditional tests of coagulation. The use of global tests of clot formation, including viscoelastic testing and thrombin generation analysis, continues to evolve and guide the management of these patients.

Abnormal coagulation testing in individuals with cirrhosis leads to a variety of difficult clinical scenarios that can be challenging for practitioners. With advanced liver disease, changes in the traditional tests of hemostasis, such as the international normalized ratio, reflect decreased synthesis of procoagulant factors but do not capture concomitant decreases in anticoagulant factors. In this setting, transfusion thresholds targeting platelet and fibrinogen goals may provide an effective strategy to optimize clot formation. Global tests of clot formation provide practical information to clinicians and can help guide decision making, although optimal target levels have not been validated.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: Guideline from the College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^115EeFtN]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute promyelocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to coagulation studies, the ASH/CAP 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining appropriate coagulation tests to evaluate for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with APL.

### Perioperative assessment of coagulation in paediatric neurosurgical patients using thromboelastography [^112xh55y]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary brain tumours may be associated with coagulation disorders, which can pose intraoperative and postoperative management difficulties. Thromboelastography is a useful technique for evaluating coagulability. In this study, we evaluated the perioperative coagulation profile using both standard laboratory work and thromboelastography in paediatric patients undergoing craniotomy for primary brain tumours.

- **Methods**: Forty paediatric patients were enrolled in the study. All patients received standard anaesthesia. Blood was analysed for both standard laboratory analysis and thromboelastography at three points for each patient: preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Postoperative patients were divided into two groups according to the occurrence or non-occurrence of postoperative haematomas: non-haematoma group and haematoma group. The standard blood analysis and thromboelastography values for both groups were compared.

- **Results**: Perioperative standard blood analysis was within normal limits for all patients, with no significant difference between both groups. In the non-haematoma group, thromboelastography values were indicative of a hypercoagulable state that started intraoperatively and continued into the first postoperative day. In the haematoma group, thromboelastography values were indicative of a hypocoagulable state that was evident in the preoperative thromboelastography values and continued into the intraoperative as well as the postoperative period.

- **Conclusion**: Thromboelastography may be useful in the perioperative assessment.

### An update on pediatric bleeding disorders: Bleeding scores, benign joint hypermobility, and platelet function testing in the evaluation of the child with bleeding symptoms [^113Ki8MW]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluating a child with symptoms of easy bruising and/or bleeding remains a challenge in pediatric hematology, and there is no "one size fits all" approach. This review focuses on recent research in three elements of the evaluation of a child with a suspected bleeding disorder.

- **Pediatric bleeding questionnaire**: We will first discuss the development of the standardized Pediatric Bleeding Questionnaire and its applications in research and clinical settings.

- **Benign hypermobility syndromes and hemostasis**: We will then discuss the relationship between benign hypermobility syndromes and hemostasis, and the importance of including a Beighton Score in the physical examination of any child presenting with unusual bruising or bleeding. While prolonged bleeding times and abnormal platelet aggregation are common findings in children with benign hypermobility, normal coagulation studies do not exclude the presence of a connective tissue disorder in a child presenting with easy bleeding and joint hypermobility on examination.

- **Platelet function evaluation**: Finally, we will discuss the state of knowledge regarding the laboratory evaluation of platelet function in children. Platelet function disorders are among the most common inherited bleeding disorders. However, testing for such disorders is time-consuming and requires a step-wise approach. We will review the indications for and limitations of the most commonly utilized platelet function laboratory studies.

### Development of a screening tool for identifying women with menorrhagia for hemostatic evaluation [^114mgEhJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

A study was conducted to develop a short, easy-to-administer screening tool useful for stratifying women with unexplained menorrhagia for hemostatic testing for underlying bleeding disorders.

- **Study design**: One hundred forty-six women with a physician diagnosis of menorrhagia underwent comprehensive hemostatic testing for the diagnosis of bleeding disorders, including von Willebrand disease, platelet dysfunction, and coagulation factor deficiencies. A 12-page questionnaire of bleeding symptoms was administered. Bleeding symptoms with high predictive values for laboratory hemostatic abnormalities were combined and used as single variables to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to develop a short screening tool to identify females for testing and evaluation.

- **Results**: A combination of 8 questions in 4 categories resulted in a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 75–90) for bleeding disorders. Adding a pictorial blood assessment chart score > 100 increased the sensitivity of the screening tool to 95% (95% CI 91–99).

- **Conclusion**: These results demonstrate the feasibility of a simple questionnaire-based screening tool to identify females for testing and evaluation for bleeding disorders.

### Approaches to investigating common bleeding disorders: An evaluation of North American coagulation laboratory practices [^116xUx7K]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Bleeding disorders commonly result from deficiencies or defects in von Willebrand factor (VWF), platelets, coagulation factors, or fibrinolytic proteins. The primary goal of our study was to assess North American coagulation laboratory practices for diagnosing bleeding disorders, using an online patterns-of-practice survey of diagnostic laboratory members of the North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association.

The survey examined laboratory approaches to evaluating bleeding disorders, with specific questions about the tests and test panels offered and compliance with recent guideline recommendations on diagnosing von Willebrand disease (VWD) and platelet function disorders. All laboratories responding to the survey performed a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, an activated partial thromboplastin time, and coagulation factor assays, and many tested for VWD and platelet disorders.

However, few laboratories had test panels that evaluated the more common bleeding disorders, and few performed some assays, including VWF multimer assessments and assays for fibrinolytic disorders. Additionally, the cutoffs used by laboratories to diagnose type 1 VWD varied considerably, with only a minority following the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommendations.

In contrast, laboratories that tested for platelet function disorders mostly complied with aggregation testing recommendations, as published in the recent North American guidelines. Our results indicate that there are some gaps in the strategies used by laboratories to diagnose bleeding disorders.

### Teg® and ROTEM® in trauma: Similar test but different results [^116A11Uv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Coagulation is a complex, dynamic, highly regulated, and interwoven process involving a myriad of cells, molecules, and structures. Only recently are the unique changes in coagulation caused by trauma starting to be understood, but they remain mostly unknown. Trauma patients are among the largest consumers of blood and blood products, and the decision of what, when, and how much blood and blood product to transfuse is often empirical or based on traditional coagulation lab tests such as INR/PT, PTT, and platelet count. However, traditional lab tests have been heavily criticized for their limitations in assisting physicians with the clinical decision to transfuse, and alternatives are warranted.

The traditional laboratorial evaluation of coagulation initially evolved to quantify specific cellular, molecular, or factor deficiencies. Numeric values (quantity) of individual elements do not necessarily indicate how well hemostasis is functioning. For example, a cirrhotic patient with a low platelet count and an abnormal INR of 2 does not necessarily bleed and probably can tolerate minor invasive procedures. In contrast, a hypothermic trauma patient with a normal platelet count and INR might bleed to death. Another limitation of traditional lab tests is the prolonged time to obtain the results or turnaround time. Dealing with rapid changes, as frequently occurs in massively bleeding trauma patients, is challenging. In such situations, any delay in obtaining the lab results can lead to inadequate transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality.

### A British Society for Haematology guideline on the assessment and management of bleeding risk prior to invasive procedures [^111bpfsH]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative bleeding, specifically with respect to preoperative coagulation testing, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend not obtaining platelet count testing before low-risk procedures, such as paracentesis or central line insertion, unless there is a known hematological disorder where the platelet count may be less than 30×10⁹/L.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^115swv1x]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for priapism, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a CBC, WBC count with blood cell differential, platelet count, and coagulation profile in patients with priapism. Further laboratory testing should be obtained depending on the history, clinical, and laboratory findings.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: Sixth edition [^113YJnpE]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for red blood cell transfusion, particularly concerning coagulation and viscoelastic testing, the ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining early and repeated monitoring of hemostasis. This should be done using traditional laboratory determinations such as PT/INR, Clauss fibrinogen level, and platelet count, and/or point-of-care PT/INR, and/or a viscoelastic method.

### The laboratory diagnosis of platelet disorders [^111DbZRS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To provide both a detailed description of the laboratory tests available in the diagnosis of platelet disorders and a testing algorithm, based on platelet count, that can be used to direct the evaluation of platelet disorders, a literature search was conducted using the National Library of Medicine database. The literature on laboratory testing of platelet function was reviewed, and based on this review, an algorithm for platelet testing was developed.

A history of mucocutaneous bleeding often indicates abnormal platelet function, which can be associated with a normal, increased, or decreased platelet count. Multiple laboratory procedures can now be used to determine the underlying pathological condition of platelet dysfunction when other deficiencies or defects of the coagulation cascade or fibrinolysis are ruled out. Simple procedures, such as platelet count, peripheral blood smear, and a platelet function screening test, often lead the investigator to more specific analyses.

Although platelet function testing is often limited to larger medical centers with highly trained technologists, newer technologies are being developed to simplify procedures and make platelet function testing more accessible. This review provides an algorithm for platelet testing that may benefit pathologists and physicians who deal with hemostatic disorders.

### Rare bleeding disorders: Diagnosis and treatment [^1147p2vn]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the worldwide prevalence of rare bleeding disorders (RBDs), knowledge of these conditions and their management is suboptimal; health care professionals often have little diagnostic and treatment experience with variable access to diagnostic modalities required for accurate identification. Therefore, patients often experience morbidity and mortality due to delayed diagnosis. As RBDs represent a small potential commercial market, few, if any, specific therapies exist for these conditions. As a result, affected individuals commonly face delayed diagnosis, incomplete laboratory evaluation, and limited treatment options.

Standardization and customization of coagulation assays, full genome sequencing, and global clotting assays will significantly improve the diagnosis of patients with RBDs. In addition, new therapeutic modalities, both recombinant and plasma-derived, are emerging, at least in developed countries. Registries and clinical trials have demonstrated decreased bleeding and improved outcomes when patients are appropriately diagnosed and properly treated. Expansion and harmonization of international registries have been initiated to correlate genotype, laboratory, and clinical phenotypes, including bleeding severity, to improve the diagnosis and therapeutic approach. This review focuses on the latest advances in our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of RBDs.

### Clinical use of thrombin generation assays [^111ic5S7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Determining a patient's coagulation profile, such as identifying a bleeding tendency or a thrombotic risk, is crucial for clinicians in many situations. Routine coagulation assays, and even more specialized tests, may not allow for a relevant characterization of the hemostatic balance. In contrast, thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a global assay allowing the dynamic, continuous, and simultaneous recording of the combined effects of both thrombin generation and thrombin inactivation. TGA thus reflects the result of procoagulant and anticoagulant activities in blood and plasma.

Because of this unique feature, TGA has been widely used in a wide array of settings, from research to clinical and pharmaceutical perspectives. This includes diagnosis, prognosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of inherited and acquired bleeding and thrombotic disorders. In addition, TGA has been shown to provide relevant information for the diagnosis of coagulopathies induced by infectious diseases, including disturbances of the coagulation system in COVID-19, or for the assessment of early recurrence in breast cancer. This review article aims to document most clinical applications of TGA.

Inform the patient and/or caregiver that Hemlibra interferes with some laboratory tests that measure blood clotting and may cause a false reading. Advise the patient and/or caregiver that they should notify any healthcare provider about this possibility prior to any blood tests or medical procedures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hemlibra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare provider. If a patient or caregiver is to administer subcutaneous Hemlibra, instruct them in injection techniques and assess their ability to inject subcutaneously to ensure proper administration and suitability for home use [see Instructions for Use].

Advise the patient to follow the recommendations in the FDA-approved patient labeling regarding proper sharps disposal.

### Diagnosis and management of mild bleeding disorders [^111ZHhFD]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Mild bleeding disorders are a common reason for referral to a hematologist and can be challenging to evaluate. Recent research has highlighted that some bleeding symptoms are quite common in the general population and that there is clinical variability in symptom expression among individuals with defined bleeding problems. Moreover, bleeding risks for many bleeding disorders are unknown. This article reviews symptoms and problems that can be considered suspicious of a mild form of bleeding disorder and the diagnostic investigations useful to evaluate these problems.

A stepwise approach is presented for the diagnostic evaluation, allowing detection of common and rare coagulation and fibrinolytic defects, and adequate assessments of potential von Willebrand factor and platelet problems. Some common issues in the diagnosis and management of mild bleeding problems are reviewed, including the frequent failure to establish a diagnosis with testing. An approach is proposed for translating knowledge to patients faced with mild bleeding problems.

### Thrombin generation assays are versatile tools in blood coagulation analysis: A review of technical features, and applications from research to laboratory routine [^1141Z1aQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Thrombin generation assays (TGAs) are important instruments in examining blood coagulation and play a versatile role in both research and clinical laboratory settings. They are used to investigate a variety of clotting disorders and assess the efficacy of anticoagulant treatments. TGAs offer insights into the kinetics of thrombin production, which is critical for understanding hemostatic balance and the risk of thrombosis.

These assays have transitioned from specialized research applications to more routine use in clinical laboratories. The technical features of TGAs include various levels of sensitivity, calibration, and data interpretation methods. Moreover, the adaptability of these assays makes them suitable for a wide range of clinical and research applications. They are increasingly being used to personalize patient care by tailoring anticoagulation therapy to individual needs, thereby improving treatment outcomes.

### Aminocaproic acid [^117XB1ir]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Aminocaproic acid should not be used when there is evidence of an active intravascular clotting process. When there is uncertainty as to whether the cause of bleeding is primary fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this distinction must be made before administering aminocaproic acid.

- **Tests for differentiation**: The following tests can be applied to differentiate the two conditions:
	- Platelet count is usually decreased in DIC but normal in primary fibrinolysis.
	- Protamine paracoagulation test is positive in DIC; a precipitate forms when protamine sulfate is dropped into citrated plasma. The test is negative in the presence of primary fibrinolysis.
	- The euglobulin clot lysis test is abnormal in primary fibrinolysis but normal in DIC.

Aminocaproic acid must not be used in the presence of DIC without concomitant heparin.

### Update on selected inherited venous thrombotic disorders [^115cZvJf]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

The inherited thrombophilias are a group of conditions that predispose individuals to thrombotic events. Most inherited thrombotic disorders are associated with venous thromboembolism rather than arterial thrombosis. Frequently, patients with thrombosis have one or more predisposing genetic factors and/or environmental risk factors. Significant advances in understanding the etiologies of inherited thrombosis have been reported recently.

The most common inherited thrombotic disorders include:

- **Activated protein C (APC) resistance (factor V Leiden)**: Associated with blood clotting.
- **Hyperhomocysteinemia**: Elevated levels of homocysteine.
- **Prothrombin gene variant G20210A**: Gene mutation increasing clot risk.
- **Elevated factor VIII levels**: May increase clotting risk.
- **Deficiencies**: Thrombomodulin, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiencies.

Less well-characterized disorders include elevated factor IX, X, and XI levels. Recognition of these disorders now allows for a laboratory diagnosis in approximately 70% of patients being evaluated for inherited thrombosis. This review focuses on the clinical and laboratory aspects of some of the most common inherited venous thrombotic disorders, including APC resistance, hyperhomocysteinemia, the prothrombin G20210A mutation, and elevated coagulation factor levels.

### Bleeding issues in neonates and infants - update 2015 [^115NkTg5]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

The presentation of a neonate with clinical bleeding symptoms commonly causes considerable anxiety for parents and treating physicians. Since inherited coagulation disorders are rare, many children with persistently abnormal coagulation screens will have an underlying bleeding disorder. Apart from emergency cases, a family history, including a bleeding questionnaire, is mandatory. This questionnaire should ask for the onset and/or severity of hemorrhage symptoms prior to laboratory assessment.

The absolute values of reference ranges for coagulation assays in neonates and children vary with analyzer and reagent systems. However, they confirm the concept of developmental hemostasis, showing that physiologic concentrations of coagulation proteins gradually increase and are lower in premature infants compared to full-term babies or healthy children. The evaluation should include global screening tests and a full blood cell count to rule out thrombocytopenia.

As in adults, a prolonged PT in neonates reflects decreased plasma concentrations of vitamin-K-dependent factors, whereas the prolonged PTT stems from decreased plasma levels of contact factors. When initial laboratory test results reveal abnormalities compared to age-related values, a stepwise diagnostic approach should be followed. In the bleeding neonate or infant with no laboratory abnormality, FXIII and alpha2-antiplasmin activity should be assessed. When primary hemostatic defects are suspected, platelet function should be further evaluated. Treatment options for a bleeding neonate vary according to the underlying medical condition.

### The evaluation and management of neonatal coagulation disorders [^114e6Rzi]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Neonatal hemostatic abnormalities can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the physician. Developmental deficiencies and/or increases of certain coagulation proteins, coupled with acquired or genetic risk factors, can result in a hemorrhagic or thromboembolic emergency. The timely diagnosis of a congenital hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorder can avoid significant long-term sequelae. However, due to the lack of randomized clinical trials addressing the management of neonatal coagulation disorders, treatment strategies are usually empiric and not evidence-based.

- **Neonatal hemostatic system**: In this chapter, we will review the neonatal hemostatic system and will discuss the most common types of hemorrhagic and thrombotic disorders.
- **Congenital and acquired risk factors**: Congenital and acquired risk factors for hemorrhagic and thromboembolic disorders will be presented, as well as treatment options.
- **Evaluation suggestions**: Finally, suggested evaluations for neonates with either hemorrhagic or thromboembolic problems will be reviewed.

### Coagulation in liver disease: A guide for the clinician [^113Axzdh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The human hemostasis system is complex and poorly understood after decades of intense scientific study. Despite multiple defects in routine coagulation laboratory studies in patients with chronic liver disease, there is growing evidence that these patients are effectively "rebalanced" with regard to procoagulant and anticoagulant activity, and most of these patients remain in a tenuous but balanced state of hemostasis.

A major difficulty in the assessment of these patients is that there are no established laboratory tests that accurately reflect the changes in both the procoagulant and anticoagulant systems; therefore, routine laboratory testing is misleading to the clinician and may prompt inappropriate or risky therapies with little real benefit to the patient. The international normalized ratio is an example of this type of misleading test. Although the international normalized ratio is inextricably linked to prognosis and severity of protein synthetic dysfunction in acute and chronic liver disease, it is a very poor marker for bleeding risk and should not be used in isolation for this purpose.

Coagulation disorders are critical in the management of frequent clinical scenarios such as esophageal variceal bleeding, invasive and percutaneous procedures, portal vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, and acute liver failure. This article summarizes the pathophysiology of hemostasis in liver disease, describes the strengths and weaknesses of various laboratory tests in the assessment of these patients, and outlines the optimal management of hemostasis for some common clinical situations.

### Kreuth V initiative: European consensus proposals for treatment of hemophilia using standard products, extended half-life coagulation factor concentrates and non-replacement therapies [^1162rG1j]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Dedicated data governance, evaluation, and reporting should be implemented with adequate sustainable financial support under public control. Core data elements, as recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and a minimal dataset for post-registration surveillance should be implemented according to the communication from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Scientific and Standardization Subcommittee (SSC) on Factor VIII, Factor IX, and Rare Coagulation Disorders.

Although there are a number of ongoing registries in Europe, their organization, status, and the amount and quality of collected data are quite variable. There are various models of registries, and promoters may be patient organizations, scientific societies, networks of treatment centers, or government institutions.

Important questions need to be answered and solutions found for the problems related to each registry:

- **Data organization**: How is the collection of data organized (preferably as user-friendly online portals)?
- **Data integrity and quality**: How are data integrity and quality assured?
- **Data ownership and analysis**: Who owns the data? Who performs which analysis?
- **Reporting results**: How and by whom are results reported and eventually published?

Additional challenges may also arise from some degree of reluctance from hemophilia caregivers to share their patients' data and to make the effort needed to enter the data into a registry. To tackle these challenges, the German Transfusion Act was updated to include mandatory adherence to the German Hemophilia Register Participation agreement. The organization of registries is a complex affair and requires comprehensive strategies to ensure success.

Low platelet count, high d-dimer levels, and elevated fibrinogen may serve as risk indicators for the progression of COVID-19 severity during early screening of severe and nonsevere patients. Further exploration of coagulation function is crucial for prophylactic and anticoagulation therapy in severe COVID-19 cases.

### Development of North American consensus guidelines for medical laboratories that perform and interpret platelet function testing using light transmission aggregometry [^1174tvJN]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Platelet function testing is important for the diagnostic evaluation of common and rare bleeding disorders. Our study goals were to promote best practices and reduce unnecessary testing variances by developing North American guidelines on platelet function testing. Guidelines were developed by consensus for expert recommendations (minimum level for approval, 70%) that included recommendations on the evaluation and interpretation of light transmission platelet aggregometry (LTA).

To assess consensus, medical opinions on recommendations were gathered from diagnostic laboratories that perform LTA, in collaboration with the Quality Management Program-Laboratory Services (QMP-LS) in Ontario, Canada (10 laboratories), and the North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association (NASCOLA; 47 laboratories, 5 overlapping the QMP-LS group). Adequate consensus was achieved for all and 89% of recommendations for the QMP-LS and NASCOLA groups, respectively. The recommendations adopted provide North American laboratories with additional guidance on platelet function testing, including how to interpret LTA abnormalities.

### American society of hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^1138hsiC]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Some of these recommendations introduce the potential for change in clinical practice and therefore deserve some additional consideration. First, the recommendations are all conditional, based mostly on patient preferences and values attached to relevant outcomes. We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision-making.

However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations. Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive; for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely t

### Guidance on the critical shortage of sodium citrate coagulation tubes for hemostasis testing [^114PxjnE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

In mid-June 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) notified United States (US) laboratories of pending supply shortages for 3.2% (0.109 M) sodium citrate tubes. These shortages were due to several tube recalls in addition to unprecedented levels of demand, presumably linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the testing for assessing coagulopathy associated with severe COVID-19 illness.

CAP recommended several strategies to the three primary stakeholders — ordering providers and nurses, phlebotomy, and the clinical laboratory — including efforts to:

- **Reduce standing orders**: Limit standing orders for coagulation testing.
- **Limit routine testing**: Reduce routine (non-essential) coagulation testing.
- **Avoid using discard tubes**: Avoid using citrate tubes as discard tubes.
- **Reserve smaller volume tubes**: Reserve smaller volume tubes for select patient populations.
- **Consider point-of-care testing (POCT)**: Implement POCT where suitable and available. As a last resort, consider using citrate tubes beyond their expiry date.

Later in July 2021, the FDA issued a second statement regarding the interruption of supply for sodium citrate tubes. The FDA echoed the conservation practices recommended by CAP. Moreover, the FDA initiated an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Becton Dickinson, allowing US sites to acquire and use 3.2% citrate tubes manufactured in the United Kingdom for evaluating "coagulopathy", including those associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections.

### Congenital fibrinogen disorders: a retrospective clinical and genetic analysis of the prospective rare bleeding disorders database [^115wTmd8]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Laboratory assays

The historical diagnosis of fibrinogen deficiency was based on coagulant activity levels below the normal threshold of each laboratory; however, plasma samples and blood cells from most cases were shipped for diagnosis confirmation and genetic analysis to central laboratories: the Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of the Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre in Milan, Italy, and the Division of Angiology and Haemostasis at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. Fg:C was measured by the Clauss method, and Fg:Ag level by the turbidimetric latex immunoassay (HYPHEN BioMed, LIAPHEN, Neuville-sur-Oise, France). Most patients were classified based on the activity/antigen ratio, which was used to distinguish between hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia (with the ratio of Fg:C/Fg:Ag being 0.7 in hypofibrinogenemia). Half of the lowest detection limit was considered to represent a complete deficiency to facilitate analysis relating to factor activity levels (i.e. 5 mg/dL for a detection limit of 10 mg/dL in afibrinogenemic cases).

Genetic analysis

Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction under standard conditions using sense and antisense primers designed on the basis of known sequences of the fibrinogen cluster. Direct sequencing of amplified fragments was performed by Sanger sequencing. The Human Gene Mutation Database and the Leiden Open Variation Database were used to find already reported variants associated with congenital fibrinogen disorders. Novel variants were evaluated using in silico prediction by Polymorphi.

### Clinical use of thrombin generation assays [^117EYvSV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Determining a patient's coagulation profile, such as detecting a bleeding tendency or a thrombotic risk, is crucial for clinicians in many situations. Routine coagulation assays and even more specialized tests may not provide a relevant characterization of the hemostatic balance. In contrast, the thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a global assay allowing the dynamic, continuous, and simultaneous recording of the combined effects of both thrombin generation and thrombin inactivation. TGA reflects the result of procoagulant and anticoagulant activities in blood and plasma.

Due to this unique feature, TGA has been widely used in a wide array of settings, including research, clinical, and pharmaceutical perspectives. This encompasses the diagnosis, prognosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of inherited and acquired bleeding and thrombotic disorders. In addition, TGA has been shown to provide relevant information for the diagnosis of coagulopathies induced by infectious diseases, including disturbances of the coagulation system in COVID-19, or for the assessment of early recurrence in breast cancer. This review article aims to document most clinical applications of TGA.

### Antithrombin deficiency: Issues in laboratory diagnosis [^117KpFqP]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To review the understanding of the pathophysiology of antithrombin deficiency and its role in congenital thrombophilia, recommendations for diagnostic testing of antithrombin function and concentration derived from the medical literature and consensus opinions of recognized experts in the field are included. These recommendations specify whom, how, and when to test.

- **Data sources**: Review of the published medical literature.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: A summary of the medical literature and proposed testing recommendations were prepared and presented at the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia. After discussion at the conference, consensus recommendations presented in this article were accepted following a two-thirds majority vote by the participants.

- **Conclusions**: Antithrombin deficiency is an infrequent genetic abnormality that may be a significant contributing cause of thrombophilia. Antithrombin deficiency also may be observed in conjunction with other genetic or acquired risk factors. Assay of antithrombin plasma levels is appropriate in the laboratory evaluation of individuals with thrombophilia, preferably using a functional, amidolytic antithrombin assay. The diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency should be established only after other acquired causes of antithrombin deficiency, such as liver disease, consumptive coagulopathy, or heparin therapy, are excluded. A low antithrombin level should be confirmed with a subsequent assay on a fresh specimen, and family studies may be helpful to establish the condition.

### Measuring fibrinolysis: From research to routine diagnostic assays [^113nJEGr]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018).

The significance of fibrinolysis in the hemostatic balance was identified early. However, methods available for investigating fibrinolysis have lagged behind methods used to study coagulation, which are widespread and standardized for routine testing purposes, such as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), or prothrombin time (PT). Under normal circumstances, fibrinolysis takes many hours or days to develop in healthy blood after clotting, which is a major obstacle in assessing the 'global fibrinolysis capacity'. This is in clear contrast to coagulation reactions, which are conveniently monitored for seconds or minutes.

In order to make some assessment of fibrinolysis, it is necessary to remove some inhibitors or add plasminogen activators, which obviously hinders complete understanding of the in vivo situation. Plasma-based systems, where clotting and lysis may be easily followed turbidimetrically, have tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) added to speed up lysis. Alternatively, euglobulin may be prepared from plasma, which reduces the concentration of fibrinolytic inhibitors. More details on these methods will be given below. Fibrinolysis techniques are often technically more difficult, time-consuming, and not so amenable to automation.

Congenital deficiencies of fibrinolytic components are not widespread in humans, unlike hemophilia A and B, which has driven research and therapeutic development in coagulation. All these factors contribute to the challenges in fibrinolysis research and diagnostics.

### Predicting bleeding after liver biopsy using comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigations: A prospective analysis of 302 procedures [^113Xr5wQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

The liver is the main site of the production of coagulation factors and plays a crucial role in maintaining normal hemostasis. Chronic liver disease can result in various derangements of the three phases of hemostasis: primary hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Clinically, patients with chronic liver disease may bleed following invasive procedures but can also develop thrombotic events.

Liver biopsy is frequently needed in patients with chronic liver disease. Clinically detectable bleeding complications have a frequency ranging from 1 to 6 per 1000 biopsies. When performing systematic ultrasound evaluation following biopsy, signs of bleeding, including liver hematoma or peritoneal fluid, are observed in 3%–23% of the patients. Identifying patients at risk of liver biopsy–related bleeding remains an unmet need.

- **Routine hemostasis tests**: Before liver biopsy, routine hemostasis tests usually include platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and, in some institutions, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Despite their common use, the predictive value of these tests is poor. Moreover, each of these tests examines only one phase of hemostasis and does not consider platelet function and fibrinolysis, two critical aspects of hemostasis that might be altered in chronic liver disease.

- **Viscoelastic tests**: Viscoelastic tests, such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), are global hemostasis tests that can assess the various phases of hemostasis. Four randomized controlled trials observed that the use of viscoelastic tests is associated with improved patient outcomes in certain settings.

### Cryptogenic oozers and bruisers [^1112d7DR]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

Bleeding disorders with normal, borderline, or nondiagnostic coagulation tests present a diagnostic challenge. Disorders of primary hemostasis can be further evaluated by additional platelet function testing modalities, platelet electron microscopy, repeat von Willebrand disease testing, and specialized von Willebrand factor testing beyond the usual initial panel.

Secondary hemostasis is further evaluated by coagulation factor assays, while factor XIII assays are used to diagnose disorders of fibrin clot stabilization. Fibrinolytic disorders are particularly difficult to diagnose with current testing options. A significant number of patients remain unclassified after thorough testing; most unclassified patients exhibit a clinically mild bleeding phenotype, and many may have undiagnosed platelet function disorders.

High-throughput genetic testing using large gene panels for bleeding disorders may potentially allow diagnoses for a larger number of these patients in the future. However, more study is needed. A logical laboratory workup, conducted in the context of the clinical setting and with a high level of expertise regarding test interpretation and limitations, facilitates a diagnosis for as many patients as possible.

### Laboratory testing for fibrinogen abnormalities [^113H1yJx]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Fibrinogen is essential for the formation of a fibrin clot. Acquired and congenital disorders of fibrinogen may result in decreased concentration or altered function, often leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Routine coagulation testing and specialized laboratory investigations can guide diagnosis in patients suspected of having a fibrinogen abnormality. This article summarizes the types of laboratory assays used to assess fibrinogen disorders and key abnormalities found in different types of fibrinogen disorders.

### Clinical use of thrombin generation assays [^111Vx1e7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Global hemostasis results from the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant antagonisms. Conventional coagulation assays selectively explore either a specific coagulation pathway (i.e. the extrinsic — or TF — and common pathways for PT, or the intrinsic — or contact — and common pathways for aPTT), or specific procoagulant (e.g. fibrinogen, FVIII, factor V) or anticoagulant (e.g. antithrombin, PC, PS) physiological factors. Although a pathological result may signal a bleeding propensity as in hemophilia A, or conversely may suggest an increased thrombotic risk in the case of a shortened aPTT, these assays may lack sensitivity. As such, both PT and aPTT are insensitive to physiological anticoagulant (e.g. antithrombin, PC, PS) defects, albeit their possible contribution to an increased thrombosis risk.

Moreover, the aPTT prolongation observed in the presence of a lupus anticoagulant paradoxically does not expose the patient to an increased bleeding risk in most cases but is a proven thrombotic risk when not transitory and part of the antiphospholipid syndrome. This emphasizes the limitations of currently used laboratory tests to assess the patient's overall hemostatic status. These limitations were, to some extent with regards to the knowledge the authors had in 1952, the rationale for proposing a TG test.

Thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a global assay exploring in a continuous and simultaneous manner both thrombin formation and inhibition. Thus, TGA reflects the result of pro‐ and anticoagulant activities and as a consequence, the balanced or imbalanced hemostatic state.

### Laboratory diagnosis of dysfibrinogenemia [^1167yYwG]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Dysfibrinogenemia is a coagulation disorder caused by a variety of structural abnormalities in the fibrinogen molecule that result in abnormal fibrinogen function. It can be inherited or acquired. The inherited form is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis, or both in the same patient or family. Traditionally, dysfibrinogenemia is diagnosed by abnormal tests of fibrin clot formation; the thrombin time and reptilase time are the screening tests, and the fibrinogen clotting activity-antigen ratio is the confirmatory test. The inherited form is diagnosed by demonstrating similar laboratory test abnormalities in family members and, if necessary, by analysis of the fibrinogen protein or fibrinogen genes in the patient. The acquired form is diagnosed by demonstrating abnormal liver function tests and by ruling out dysfibrinogenemia in family members. This article reviews the laboratory testing of dysfibrinogenemia and presents an algorithm for sequential test selection that can be used for diagnosis.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^117XShmk]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Detection of mild inherited bleeding disorders

Massive hemorrhagic diathesis can be caused by disorders of primary hemostasis, such as von Willebrand disease and platelet disorders; secondary hemostasis, such as hemophilia A and B; and disturbances of the fibrinolytic system, connective tissue, or vascular formation. These conditions are mostly diagnosed before adulthood. However, less severe disorders might have gone undiagnosed and can contribute to unexpected bleeding during major surgery.

The first step in the diagnostic approach is quantifying bleeding symptoms resulting from minor hemostatic challenges, including dental extraction, minor surgery or trauma, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis has a bleeding assessment tool that can be used for both adults and children. A severity score is calculated, and for patients at increased risk (score 4 or greater in men, 6 or greater in women, 2 or greater in children), this examination should be followed by a systematic diagnostic laboratory workup.

In patients with an increased bleeding risk during major surgery, it is crucial to identify potential inherited bleeding disorders. The activated PTT is often prolonged in factor deficiencies such as hemophilia A and B, hemophilia C, and sometimes in von Willebrand disease, as domains of this macromolecule bind and protect factor VIII, in rare isolated factor deficiencies, and in dys- or hypofibrinogenemia. However, prolongation of the activated PTT is also observed in common conditions that are usually not associated with significant bleeding risk.

### Timing for assessment of bleeding diathesis in pediatric blunt traumatic brain injury [^116rQdcy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Low credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage may complicate blunt traumatic brain injury (TBI) or result from underlying bleeding disorders, and coagulation studies or factor level assays may be abnormal for both. Studies do not identify when testing can reliably differentiate between traumatic injuries and bleeding disorders. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities in the initial 36 hours after presentation for blunt TBI and determine a time period for subsequent normalization.

- **Methods**: Patients under 18 years old with blunt TBI were identified from our institutional trauma registry from 2020 to 2022. Data collected included coagulation studies [prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT)], complete blood count, factor levels, final suspected/proven diagnosis, mechanism of injury, patient demographics, radiographic findings, and clinical interventions. Comparisons were made between laboratory values obtained and normal references, and differences were described.

- **Results**: Two hundred sixty-eight patients were identified. The majority were male, and the median age was 8.5 months (interquartile range 4–45.3 months). The coagulation studies and factor level assays were more often completed for patients who suffered child physical abuse, whereas testing was obtained in less than 10% of patients following unintentional trauma. The mechanism of injury was unintentional blunt injury in 70.1%, abusive TBI in 27.2%, and a medical cause in 3%. Intracranial hemorrhage was identified in 49.2% of patients.

### Screening for coagulation disorders in adolescents with abnormal uterine bleeding [^1138HKL8]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

To determine if screening for coagulation disorders was routinely performed during the evaluation of adolescents with abnormal uterine bleeding, a retrospective chart review was conducted. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, with P < 0.05 considered significant.

The setting for the study included outpatient clinics of an academic center. Participants were eligible charts of patients aged eighteen years and under with abnormal uterine bleeding, evaluated by either pediatric gynecologists, gynecologists, or pediatricians. The intervention involved a chart review.

- **Main outcome measures**: Data on provider type, documented patient history, and laboratory tests ordered were collected.

In our review, 43% (n = 36) of patients were evaluated by gynecologists, 38% (n = 32) by pediatricians, and 19% (n = 16) by pediatric gynecologists. The mean age of patients whose charts were reviewed was 15 years. Overall, 36.6% (n = 30) of providers indicated that they screened for a bleeding disorder by documenting at least one screening question in the patient's history. There was a significant difference among providers, with 68.8% (n = 11) of pediatric gynecologists documenting at least one screening question, compared to 31.4% (n = 11) of gynecologists and 25.8% (n = 8) of pediatricians (P < 0.05). Overall, 14.6% (n = 12) of subjects were screened for a coagulation disorder with laboratory testing.

The study concluded that the majority of adolescents with abnormal uterine bleeding were not screened for bleeding disorders. The frequency of evaluation for blood dyscrasias varied by specialty.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^111pNvRP]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Our work has several implications for practice and research. For the practicing clinician and patients, our guideline suggests that shared decision-making, covering the pros and cons and the practical implications of thrombophilia testing and the adoption of the associated VTE prevention strategies, may improve the quality of care for individuals with an increased risk of clotting events, particularly if they are at high risk of bleeding or have an indication or preference for hormonal therapy. Implementation of the guideline from this perspective will require educational tools and opportunities, which we strongly recommend being provided by scientific societies and patient organizations.

It is critical that proper thrombophilia tests are performed by high-quality clinical laboratories, as the guideline points out many times in each recommendation. Too often, thrombophilia testing includes tests with no supportive evidence, and laboratory results are frequently reported with insufficient details or interpretation. Training of physicians and laboratory medicine clinicians will be required for a positive impact of the proposed recommendations.

The guidelines suggest against thrombophilia testing in many clinical scenarios, thereby potentially decreasing overdiagnosis. More research is urgently needed, particularly large implementation studies comparing the impact, in terms of outcome rates, among management strategies involving or not involving thrombophilia testing.

### Clinical use of thrombin generation assays [^114oBxwu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Bleeding and thrombosis are challenging conditions for clinicians because of their potential critical impact on patients. Evaluating a patient's hemostatic balance, which reflects the risk of hemorrhage or thromboembolism, is crucial. Routine and specialized coagulation parameters help diagnose coagulation alterations but may fail to identify patients at risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Thrombin is the pivotal enzyme of secondary hemostasis, crucial for maintaining a normal hemostatic balance.

Thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a global dynamic assay that simultaneously and continuously measures thrombin generation (TG) and inhibition. Because of this unique feature, TGA has been widely used as a research tool for the diagnosis, prognosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of inherited and acquired coagulopathies. The availability of automated systems offering standardized assays with common features of clinical laboratory assays could pave the way for the adoption of TGA in routine clinical practice.

TGA can be run on platelet poor plasma (PPP), fresh or frozen platelet rich plasma (PRP), or whole blood. Despite several studies addressing pre-analytical and analytical sources of variations, TGA in the presence of platelets still lacks standardization, and the precise role of platelet-dependent TG in clinical practice remains inconclusive. The use of frozen PRP has been proposed as an alternative to fresh PRP, as the former must be analyzed soon after blood sampling. However, comparisons of TGA results obtained with fresh and frozen PRP lead to conflicting results.

### A novel approach to improving coagulation sample ordering in an emergency department [^115apUhR]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

It has been shown that many investigations ordered in the emergency department are inappropriate. Coagulation samples are acknowledged as one of the most common blood samples requested on admission. The common expectation among doctors is that these results will assist in identifying patients who are at increased risk of bleeding. However, there are many pitfalls of a coagulation screen. For instance, a normal result can be found in Von Willebrand's disease, the most common of the inherited bleeding disorders. Coagulation screens do not provide any information regarding fibrinolysis or platelet dysfunction.

Various studies have shown that coagulation studies have limited value prior to surgery and invasive procedures, suggesting that a structured bleeding history is more valuable in identifying those who require further evaluation. Similar studies performed in medical assessment units and emergency departments have advocated the use of a coagulation testing policy to guide staff in the requesting of these samples. A study carried out in a Glasgow emergency department removed coagulation bottles from the main clinical area, reducing the number of samples sent.

### Characterization of laboratory coagulation parameters and risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely premature neonates [^116NbTER]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

The coagulation system begins to develop around 10 weeks gestational age (GA) in utero and continues to progress and mature with advancing GA in neonates. This process continues postnatally in infants, moving towards adult levels around 6 months of age. Neonatal coagulation can be conceptualized as dynamic, as the majority of healthy term newborn infants do not experience spontaneous hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Therefore, even though coagulation protein concentrations may be lower than those of adults, balanced hemostasis is usually maintained.

Nevertheless, it is recognized that neonates have increased bleeding vulnerability related to congenital or acquired hemostatic disorders. The process of labor and mode of delivery have been shown to contribute significant effects on the coagulation system, with higher coagulant and anticoagulant protein levels in infants affected by the stress of labor compared to those delivered via elective cesarean section. In extremely premature neonates delivered via cesarean section, it may be hypothesized that there is an increased risk of suffering a hemostatic insult due to coagulation system immaturity and lower coagulation factor levels; however, supporting data are lacking.

We report a large, prospective study of laboratory coagulation parameters on cord blood samples in extremely premature neonates. Interestingly, our data signal generally reduced coagulation parameters compared to day 1 of life healthy premature infants, 30–36 weeks GA reference values per Andrew et al. for coagulation factor ac.

### How to assess hemostasis in patients with severe liver disease [^111RdFG4]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023).

Patients with advanced liver diseases frequently acquire profound alterations in their hemostatic system. Simultaneous changes in procoagulant and anticoagulant systems result in a reset in the hemostatic balance with a relatively neutral net effect, although there are notable hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable features in the hemostatic system in patients with liver disease. Laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that patients have a relatively well-preserved hemostatic system even though routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis, such as prothrombin time and platelet count, suggest a bleeding tendency.

Routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis are unsuitable to assess the hemostatic status of patients with liver disease, as these tests are insensitive to the prohemostatic and antihemostatic changes in these patients. However, these tests are frequently requested in patients with liver disease, as they are well-established indicators of the severity of liver disease. This paper discusses commonly used diagnostic and research-type hemostatic tests and outlines how test results should be interpreted in patients with liver disease.

### Hemostatic and thrombotic disorders in the pediatric patient [^112qZnA1]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

This review focuses on significant advances in the field of pediatric hemostasis and thrombosis, particularly studies published within the past decade. The evaluation and management of patients with excessive bleeding remain cornerstones of consultative hematology. The development of validated bleeding assessment tools relevant to pediatric practice is described, along with laboratory advances in the evaluation of von Willebrand disease and a shift in clinical practice regarding the interpretation of normal coagulation studies in patients with significant bleeding phenotypes.

There have also been critical advances in the management of hemostatic disorders. New treatment paradigms in hemophilia and the rise of multidisciplinary medical homes for women living with bleeding disorders are highlighted. Given the continued increase in the incidence of thrombosis, particularly in the hospital setting, a full call to arms against pediatric venous thromboembolism is now essential.

We describe recently completed clinical trials of direct oral anticoagulants in children and adolescents and ongoing work to determine the appropriate duration of therapy for children with provoked thrombosis. Recent work regarding the prevention of pediatric venous thromboembolism is highlighted, including studies of thromboprophylaxis and the development of risk prediction models for hospital-acquired thrombosis. Finally, we review advances in our understanding of thrombotic sequelae and the need for continued refinement of our evaluation tools.

### Covid-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation [^111Yv3ze]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can induce a coagulopathy. These findings are consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes, as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients globally and uncertainty regarding the management of complications arising from this viral illness. The primary target organ for COVID-19 is the lung, where patients may develop acute lung injury progressing to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur.

The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, while abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. It is suggested that coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, be performed. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient. This involves following established practices of thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, along with standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC.

Although indicators such as D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are associated with mortality, data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated.

### Heparin sodium [^116fk9X6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Heparin sodium should not be used in patients with the following conditions:

- **Severe thrombocytopenia**: Heparin is contraindicated in cases of severe thrombocytopenia.

- **Unsuitable blood coagulation tests**: Full-dose heparin should not be administered when suitable blood coagulation tests, such as the whole blood clotting time and partial thromboplastin time, cannot be performed at appropriate intervals. This contraindication is specific to full-dose heparin as coagulation parameters usually do not need monitoring in patients receiving low-dose heparin.

- **Uncontrolled active bleeding state**: Heparin is contraindicated in uncontrolled active bleeding states, except when this bleeding is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (see warnings).

### Disorders of coagulation in pregnancy [^113hufDC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The process of haemostasis is complex and is further complicated in the parturient due to the physiological changes of pregnancy. Understanding these changes and their impact on the safety profile of anaesthetic options for labour and delivery is crucial for any anaesthetist caring for the parturient. This article analyses theories on coagulation and reviews the physiological changes to coagulation that occur during pregnancy and the best methods to evaluate coagulation.

Finally, we examine some of the more common disorders of coagulation that occur during pregnancy, including von Willebrand disease, common factor deficiencies, platelet disorders, the parturient on anticoagulants, and the more rare acute fatty liver of pregnancy, focusing on their implications for neuraxial anaesthesia.

### Laboratory monitoring of haemostasis [^114v1HCb]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Peri-operative coagulation monitoring should begin with the assessment of individual bleeding risk using a standardised bleeding history before the surgical procedure. Laboratory testing should be performed if this history is abnormal or peri-operative bleeding is anticipated. This process sensitively identifies those at risk of peri-operative bleeding and therefore minimises their peri-operative risk, without costly and time-consuming population testing.

There are multiple potential causes of haemostatic derangement within the peri-operative period, and an understanding of both normal haemostasis and the coagulation tests available to detect coagulopathy is required to optimise patient management. In bleeding patients, routine coagulation tests should be requested, but one should be aware of the major limitations that exist. Delay whilst waiting for these laboratory results can aggravate coagulopathy, bleeding, blood product requirements, length of surgery, and overall morbidity and mortality.

### Effectiveness and costs of a stepwise versus an all-in-one approach to diagnose mild bleeding disorders [^114BhjYF]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnostic work-up of patients referred to the haematologist for bleeding evaluation is performed in a stepwise way; bleeding history and results of screening laboratory tests guide further diagnostic evaluation. This method can be ineffective, time-consuming, and burdensome for patients. To improve this strategy, the initial laboratory investigation can be extended.

In a model-based approach, the effectiveness and costs of a conventional stepwise versus a newly proposed all-in-one diagnostic approach for bleeding evaluation were evaluated and compared, using data from an observational patient cohort study, including adult patients referred for bleeding evaluation. In the all-in-one approach, specialized platelet function tests, coagulation factors, and fibrinolysis tests were included in the initial investigation. Final diagnosis, hospital resource use, costs, and patient burden were compared.

A total of 150 patients were included. Compared to the stepwise approach, in the all-in-one approach, 19 additional patients reached a diagnosis, and patient burden was lower, but total costs per patient were higher [€359, 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (BCI) 283–518, p = 0.001]. For bleeding evaluation of patients referred to the haematologist, an all-in-one diagnostic approach has a higher diagnostic yield and reduces patient burden, at a higher cost. This raises the question of what costs justify the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder and a less burdensome diagnostic strategy.

### Heparin sodium [^111wKREG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Coagulation testing and monitoring**: When using a full-dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10)]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Heparin resistance**: Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy.
