## Question

summarize in paragraph concisely likely cause neuropathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a concise paragraph summarizing the likely causes of neuropathy, emphasizing primary drivers, mechanisms, differences by diabetes type, risk modifiers, non-diabetic causes, and a concise synthesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and clinical context to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the central causal role of hyperglycemia and the strength of evidence in type 1 versus type 2 diabetes. Next, I will delineate key pathophysiologic mechanisms. After that, I need to distinguish type-specific differences and integrate additional risk modifiers, including metabolic syndrome and lifestyle factors. I should also check the evidence around prediabetes and small-fiber involvement and remember to note non-diabetic etiologies and screening principles before synthesizing the narrative concisely.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Diabetic neuropathy is common, with distal symmetric polyneuropathy as the predominant phenotype and a substantial global burden, affecting millions and contributing to disability and lower-extremity complications, which underscores the importance of early detection and prevention [^114qN5vn] [^114Yregc].

> Wait, let me verify the central causal factor. Chronic hyperglycemia is the primary driver of diabetic neuropathy, with the best causal evidence in type 1 diabetes from DCCT/EDIC showing that intensive glycemic control reduces incident neuropathy and its progression, and contemporary standards reinforce optimizing glycemia to prevent or delay neuropathy, while acknowledging that disease-modifying reversal is not established [^117DhfrM] [^114GzJEj] [^1158mkWx].

> I will now examine the key pathophysiological mechanisms. Hold on, I should verify that the metabolic and neurovascular pathways most consistently implicated include advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, polyol pathway flux, microvascular dysfunction with endoneurial ischemia, and a unifying theme of axonal bioenergetic failure in peripheral nerves due to their unique anatomy and high metabolic demand, with biomarkers such as carboxymethyllysine and sRAGE supporting the role of glycation [^1158mkWx] [^115NQxeo] [^115Si6Ga].

> Let me consider type-specific differences carefully. I was about to say "tight glycemic control halts neuropathy in all diabetes", but wait, that overgeneralizes; I should correct that to reflect that glucose control robustly prevents or halts progression in type 1 diabetes, whereas benefits in type 2 diabetes are modest, likely because cardiometabolic comorbidities and the metabolic syndrome contribute substantially, prompting guideline emphasis on weight, blood pressure, and lipid optimization alongside glycemic management [^114Yregc] [^116twWNM] [^115LHpiU].

> Next, I should review additional risk modifiers. I need to ensure I include diabetes duration and age, but also obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension as independent contributors in type 2 diabetes, with guideline-directed management of blood pressure and lipids recommended to reduce risk or slow progression; smoking and alcohol use further increase risk, with alcohol-related neuropathy likely additive rather than overlapping mechanistically, which reinforces the need to address lifetime alcohol exposure and cessation counseling in diabetes care [^116QMFz5] [^111xb6us] [^112R5L4p].

> But wait, what about earlier dysglycemia. Let me check the prediabetes signal. Multiple analyses suggest that peripheral neuropathy, often small-fiber predominant and milder, is more prevalent in impaired glucose tolerance and prediabetes than in normoglycemia, though some epidemiologic data show modest or uncertain associations and experts have cautioned that selection bias and study design limitations complicate inference, so I should present this as probable but not definitive and note that lifestyle interventions are prudent [^114TWwu1] [^111ZoRKr] [^114uBY1K].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge non-diabetic etiologies. Sensory polyneuropathies are heterogeneous and include nutritional deficiencies such as thiamine deficiency, autoimmune and inflammatory neuropathies, genetic conditions, toxins, and infections; therefore, diabetic polyneuropathy remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, guided by history, examination, and selective testing when features are atypical, asymmetric, rapidly progressive, or motor-predominant [^116Rofy5] [^116xEEQW].

> Hold on, I should verify screening principles that align with this pathophysiology-to-practice bridge. ADA standards recommend annual screening for distal symmetric polyneuropathy at T2DM diagnosis and starting 5 years after T1DM diagnosis using bedside tests of small-fiber (temperature or pinprick) and large-fiber function (128-Hz tuning fork), plus annual 10-g monofilament testing to identify feet at risk, alongside assessment for autonomic neuropathy and provision of therapeutic footwear for high-risk feet to prevent ulceration and amputation [^116kSEQj] [^1123j3Qy] [^112naCxP].

> Synthesis, keeping it concise: Diabetic neuropathy arises from chronic hyperglycemia–driven metabolic and microvascular injury, converging on axonal bioenergetic failure, with dominant roles for AGEs, oxidative stress, polyol pathway flux, and ischemia; in type 1 diabetes, intensive glucose control prevents or halts progression, whereas in type 2 diabetes, additional cardiometabolic factors blunt the impact of glycemic control, necessitating concurrent optimization of weight, blood pressure, and lipid status; risk amplifiers include duration, age, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol, and neuropathy can also occur in prediabetes, often with small-fiber features, though estimates vary; finally, non-diabetic etiologies should be excluded, and guideline-based screening is essential to detect disease early and mitigate downstream complications [^1158mkWx] [^114Yregc] [^111xb6us] [^1123j3Qy].

---

The most likely cause of neuropathy is **diabetes mellitus** [^1165mLaJ], with chronic hyperglycemia driving distal symmetric polyneuropathy via metabolic and microvascular injury, oxidative stress [^1158mkWx], and advanced glycation end products [^114Yregc] [^111F8KFX]. Risk increases with poor glycemic control, longer diabetes duration, and metabolic syndrome [^114Yregc] [^115NQxeo]; prediabetes also raises neuropathy risk [^111ZoRKr] [^1111XTRT]. Other common causes include alcohol use [^112R5L4p], **nutritional deficiencies (especially B12)**, and medications, particularly chemotherapeutic agents; less frequent causes include autoimmune, infectious, and genetic disorders [^116Rofy5]. Management centers on optimizing **glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control** [^112tU71u] [^116QMFz5]; for pain, **gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs, or sodium channel blockers** may be used [^112YjwVR] [^112ThFLs]; **opioids are not recommended** [^117Sc3X7] [^1142fPY8].

## References

### Progressive axonal dysfunction precedes development of neuropathy in type 2 diabetes [^111F8KFX]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes has increased dramatically in the last three decades and currently affects an estimated 285–347 million people worldwide. Neuropathy remains one of the most common and troubling complications of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of all patients. The development of neuropathy greatly increases the morbidity of diabetes and significantly affects quality of life. Typically presenting as a distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, diabetic neuropathy produces prominent symptoms, including neuropathic pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and balance problems. Furthermore, in addition to neuropathic symptoms, secondary complications may lead to serious further morbidity, including ulceration, fractures, amputations, and even death.

The pathophysiology underlying the development of diabetic neuropathy remains unclear but has been linked to multiple metabolic and neurovascular factors. Glycemic control and glycated hemoglobin levels correlate with the incidence of neuropathy, and tight glycemic control may slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy. However, glycemic control alone is not sufficient to account for the development of neuropathy, and a range of other factors may contribute, including the accumulation of advanced glycation end products, reductions in blood flow, and oxidative stress. Given the high risk of morbidity arising from diabetic neuropathy, early detection and intervention are crucial prior to the onset of neuropathic symptoms. However, neuropathy in diabetic patients remains underdiagnosed, and early identification is problematic.

### Diagnosis and management of sensory polyneuropathy [^116Rofy5]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Sensory polyneuropathies, caused by dysfunction of peripheral sensory nerve fibers, are a heterogeneous group of disorders ranging from common diabetic neuropathy to rare sensory neuronopathies. Presenting symptoms, acuity, time course, severity, and subsequent morbidity vary depending on the type of fiber affected and the underlying cause. Damage to small thinly myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers results in neuropathic pain, whereas damage to large myelinated sensory afferents results in proprioceptive deficits and ataxia. Causes of these disorders include metabolic, toxic, infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and genetic conditions. Idiopathic sensory polyneuropathies are common but should be considered a diagnosis of exclusion.

Diagnostic evaluation involves electrophysiologic testing, including nerve conduction studies, histopathologic analysis of nerve tissue, serum studies, and sometimes autonomic testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include immunotherapy, mitigation of risk factors, symptomatic treatment, and gene therapy. Recently developed RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotide therapies are used for transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Many of these disorders lack directed treatment; therefore, management remains symptomatic and supportive. More research into the pathophysiology of nerve damage in these polyneuropathies is needed to guide treatment advances.

### Alcohol consumption as a causator and/or an accelerator of neuropathy in people with diabetes is regularly overlooked [^112R5L4p]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol-induced neuropathy is thought to be due to the activation of spinal cord microglia, oxidative stress, free radical damage, activation of mGlu5-receptors in the spinal cord, as well as the activation of the sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary axes. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies, particularly of thiamine, and/or the direct toxic effect of alcohol and its metabolites (particularly acetaldehyde) on the nerve may play a role. Thus, there is very little, if any, overlap between the pathophysiologies of alcoholic and diabetic DSP, suggesting that peripheral nerve damage from these etiologies is likely to be additive. An actual threshold of alcohol intake for the development of alcohol-induced neuropathy is unknown. However, the most important risk factor is lifetime alcohol dose, with neuropathy being more common with chronic rather than episodic alcoholism. Other risk factors are genetics, male gender, and the type of alcohol consumed (higher for wine than for beer or spirits).

### Diabetic neuropathy [^114Yregc]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2019). Low credibility.

The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications associated with these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, of which distal symmetric polyneuropathy (for the purpose of this Primer, referred to as diabetic neuropathy) is very common. Diabetic neuropathy represents a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities, characterized by pain and substantial morbidity. Over time, at least 50% of individuals with diabetes develop this condition.

Glucose control effectively halts the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus; however, the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have led to new efforts to understand the etiology of diabetic neuropathy, culminating in the 2017 recommendations on specific approaches to prevent and treat this disorder tailored to each type of diabetes. In parallel, new guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy using distinct classes of drugs, with an emphasis on avoiding opioid use, have been issued. Although our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remain unknown.

Future discoveries on disease pathogenesis will be crucial to successfully address all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, from prevention to treatment.

This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that pre-diabetic patients had a greater risk of peripheral neuropathy compared to healthy subjects. Therefore, policymakers and public health bodies need to give special attention to preventive strategies and effective lifestyle interventions for pre-diabetic patients to reduce the risk of neuropathy and its consequences. Further well-designed longitudinal and interventional research is needed to identify associated factors for the development of neuropathy among pre-diabetics, as well as the benefits of lifestyle interventions.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^112HCaev]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Amputation and foot ulceration, consequences of diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD), are common and major causes of morbidity and disability in people with diabetes. Early recognition and management of risk factors can prevent or delay adverse outcomes.

The risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have the following risk factors: previous amputation; past foot ulcer history; peripheral neuropathy; foot deformity; peripheral vascular disease; vision impairment; diabetic nephropathy (especially patients on dialysis); poor glycemic control; and cigarette smoking.

Many studies have been published proposing a range of tests that might usefully identify patients at risk of foot ulceration. This has created confusion among practitioners as to which screening tests should be adopted in clinical practice. An American Diabetes Association (ADA) task force was therefore assembled in 2008 to concisely summarize recent literature in this area and then recommend what should be included in the comprehensive foot exam for adult patients with diabetes. Their recommendations are summarized below. Clinicians should refer to the task force report for further details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the comprehensive foot examination.

### Diabetic neuropathies [^113YQmwP]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes, presenting with a wide range of symptoms. These include symmetric distal motor dysfunction, sensory abnormalities (including positive and negative sensory symptoms), radiculoplexus neuropathies, mononeuropathies, and autonomic dysfunction. The condition can manifest in various forms, each with distinct characteristics. There is now more understanding regarding the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathies, particularly concerning what makes sensory neurons more susceptible to injury and bioenergetic failure in peripheral nervous system neurons. This monograph provides an overview of the different types of diabetic neuropathy, addresses the management of more common forms associated with diabetes, and highlights recent updates in the field, including nutraceuticals.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^111rhAon]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

**Neuropathy screening and treatment**: All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, using simple clinical tests (B). Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical (E). Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes (E). Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient (E).

### Neuropathy in prediabetes: Does the clock start ticking early [^114TWwu1]? Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Between 25% and 62% of patients with idiopathic peripheral neuropathy are reported to have prediabetes, and among individuals with prediabetes, 11–25% are thought to have peripheral neuropathy, and 13–21% have neuropathic pain. Population-based studies suggest a gradient for the prevalence of neuropathy, being highest in patients with manifest diabetes mellitus, followed by individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, then impaired fasting glucose, and least in those with normoglycemia. The most sensitive test to assess glucose metabolism status is the oral glucose tolerance test. Pathogenesis involves hyperglycemia, microvascular abnormalities, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome. Individuals with prediabetes have less severe neuropathy than those with manifest diabetes mellitus. Sensory modalities are more frequently affected than motor modalities, but impairment of small nerve fibers could be the earliest detectable sign. Diagnosis should rely on careful clinical examination, with emphasis on the evaluation of small fibers. An oral glucose tolerance test should be performed in patients with idiopathic neuropathy. The only treatment with any efficacy is lifestyle modification to improve control of hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors, but the long-term efficacy of this approach has not been established. This review summarizes the evidence on the association between prediabetes and neuropathy.

### Neuropathy and related findings in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study [^117DhfrM]. Diabetes Care (2014). High credibility.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) enrolled 1,441 patients with type 1 diabetes between 1983 and 1989. At study entry, participants were randomly assigned to intensive insulin therapy (INT), targeting near-normal glycemia, or conventional insulin therapy (CON) according to the standard of care at that time. Microvascular diabetes complications were assessed during the DCCT, including the development and progression of the peripheral and cardiovascular autonomic manifestations of diabetic neuropathy.

In 1993, after an average of 6.5 years of follow-up, the DCCT investigators reported that INT significantly reduced the incidence of diabetic neuropathy, similar to findings for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. INT was subsequently widely accepted as the standard of care for type 1 diabetes. At the end of DCCT, CON participants were taught INT, and all participants were encouraged to adhere as closely as possible to an intensive diabetes treatment regimen and were returned to their prior health care providers for ongoing care.

The observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up was established to monitor the long-term effects of prior INT compared with prior CON treatment on the development and progression of more advanced microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease in the DCCT cohort.

### The pathogenesis and management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a review [^116N1Ppv]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a challenging complication of diabetes mellitus. Emerging theories suggest that early dysaesthesia associated with painful neuropathy may serve as a marker for the development of the 'at-risk' foot, allowing preventative clinical strategies to be undertaken. The mechanisms of neuropathic pain are complex. The authors' intentions are to help members of the diabetes care team better understand and appreciate the diverse symptoms reported by patients. Various treatments available for painful neuropathy are discussed in detail. Robust comparative studies on such treatments are, however, unavailable, and the authors have designed a logical approach to management based on best evidence and their own clinical experience.

In this article, we will review the clinical signs and symptoms of diabetic somatic polyneuropathy (DPN), its prevalence, and clinical management. Staging and classification of DPN will be exemplified by various staging paradigms of varied sophistication. The results of therapeutic clinical trials will be summarized. The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy presents an extremely complex issue that is still not fully understood. Various recent advances in the understanding of the disease will be discussed, particularly with respect to the differences between neuropathy in the two major types of diabetes. The neuropathology and natural history of diabetic neuropathy will be discussed, highlighting the heterogeneities of the disease. Finally, the various prospective therapeutic avenues will be dealt with and discussed.

### Peripheral neuropathy defined by monofilament insensitivity and diabetes status: NHANES 1999–2004 [^1111XTRT]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether diabetes status, including prediabetes, is associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy as defined by monofilament insensitivity.

This study utilized data from the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 7,818). Peripheral neuropathy was defined as one or more insensate sites detected by a Semmes-Weinstein 10-g monofilament. Generalized linear models were employed to directly estimate relative risks (RRs) for the association between diabetes status and peripheral neuropathy.

After adjustment, compared with no diabetes, prediabetes [RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.92–1.34)] and undiagnosed diabetes [RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.73–1.61)] were associated with modest increases in the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Diabetes was associated with a 74% higher risk of peripheral neuropathy [RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.50–2.01)].

In conclusion, diabetes is associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy as defined by monofilament insensitivity, while prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes may be associated with only a modest increase in risk.

### Diabetes mellitus and the peripheral nervous system: manifestations and mechanisms [^1158mkWx]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). High credibility.

Diabetes targets the peripheral nervous system with several different patterns of damage and mechanisms of disease. Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a common disorder affecting a large proportion of diabetic patients, yet its pathophysiology remains controversial. Mechanisms considered include polyol flux, microangiopathy, oxidative stress, abnormal signaling from advanced glycation endproducts, and growth factor deficiency. Although some clinical trials have demonstrated modest benefits in disease stabilization or pain therapy in DPN, robust therapy capable of reversing the disease is unavailable.

This review examines general aspects of DPN and other diabetic neuropathies, including a summary of recent therapeutic trials. Particular emphasis is placed on the evidence that the neurobiology of DPN reflects a unique yet common and disabling neurodegenerative disorder.

### Treatment-induced neuropathy of diabetes: An acute, iatrogenic complication of diabetes [^111ywmTh]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment-induced neuropathy in diabetes, also referred to as insulin neuritis, is considered a rare iatrogenic small fibre neuropathy caused by an abrupt improvement in glycaemic control in the setting of chronic hyperglycaemia. The prevalence and risk factors of this disorder are not known. In a retrospective review of all individuals referred to a tertiary care diabetic neuropathy clinic over five years, the proportion of individuals that present with, and the risk factors for, the development of treatment-induced neuropathy in diabetes was defined.

Nine hundred and fifty-four individuals were evaluated for a possible diabetic neuropathy. Treatment-induced neuropathy in diabetes was defined as the acute onset of neuropathic pain and/or autonomic dysfunction within eight weeks of a large improvement in glycaemic control — specified as a decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) of ≥ 2 percentage points over three months. Detailed structured neurologic examinations, glucose control logs, pain scores, autonomic symptoms, and other microvascular complications were measured every three to six months for the duration of follow-up.

Of the 954 patients evaluated for diabetic neuropathy, 104 out of 954 subjects (10.9%) met criteria for treatment-induced neuropathy in diabetes. They experienced an acute increase in neuropathic or autonomic symptoms or signs coinciding with a substantial decrease in HbA1c. Individuals with a decrease in HbA1c had a much greater risk of developing a painful or autonomic neuropathy than those with no change in HbA1c (P < 0.001). They also had a higher risk of developing retinopathy (P < 0.001).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1123j3Qy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for diabetic neuropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a careful history. The guidelines advise assessing either temperature or pinprick sensation (small-fiber function) and vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function) to evaluate distal symmetric polyneuropathy. It is recommended to obtain annual 10-g monofilament testing in all patients with diabetes to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes: too little too late [^1137Ebuh]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes is poorly managed due to its insidious onset, delayed diagnosis, and complex etiology. This complexity arises not only from hyperglycemia but also includes factors such as aging, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. Without a US Food and Drug Administration-approved disease-modifying therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, early diagnosis and timely multi-factorial risk factor reduction are crucial for amelioration in type 2 diabetes.

The management of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy requires a detailed appraisal of therapy choices, which should consider efficacy, patient preferences, comorbidities, side effect profiles, and potential for abuse.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^115C5CGt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

A broad spectrum of presentations may occur in patients with DSPN, ranging from one extreme of the patient with very severe painful symptoms but few signs, to the other when patients may present with a foot ulcer having lost all sensation without ever having any painful or uncomfortable symptoms. When pressed, such patients may admit to the feet feeling somewhat "numb" or "dead". Thus, it is well-recognized that the severity of symptoms may not relate to the severity of the deficit on clinical examination.

The American Diabetes Association consensus statement recommended that the diagnosis of painful DSPN in clinical practice be a clinical one, relying on the patient's description of pain and typical features of peripheral neuropathy manifesting in reduction of sensory modalities and absence/reduction of ankle or knee reflexes. Because DSPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, a careful clinical history and a peripheral neurological and vascular examination of the lower limbs are essential to exclude other causes of neuropathic and leg/foot pain such as peripheral vascular disease, arthritis, malignancy, alcohol abuse, spinal canal stenosis, etc. Nerve conduction studies are rarely helpful in clinical practice but might aid in excluding other causes of pain such as entrapment syndromes. Patients with asymmetrical symptoms and/or signs (such as loss of an ankle jerk in one leg only), rapid progression of symptoms, or predominance of motor symptoms and signs should be carefully assessed.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^116qLT4Q]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Amputation and foot ulceration, consequences of diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease (PAD), are common and major causes of morbidity and disability in people with diabetes. Early recognition and management of risk factors can prevent or delay adverse outcomes.

The risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have the following risk factors: previous amputation, past foot ulcer history, peripheral neuropathy, foot deformity, peripheral vascular disease, visual impairment, diabetic nephropathy (especially patients on dialysis), poor glycemic control, and cigarette smoking.

Many studies have been published proposing a range of tests that might usefully identify patients at risk of foot ulceration, leading to confusion among practitioners as to which screening tests should be adopted in clinical practice. An ADA task force was therefore assembled in 2008 to concisely summarize recent literature in this area and recommend what should be included in the comprehensive foot exam for adult patients with diabetes. Their recommendations are summarized below, but clinicians should refer to the task force report for further details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the comprehensive foot examination.

Neuropathy is an important risk factor for diabetes-related lower-extremity complications, which collectively contribute to the increasing global disability burden, especially among adults aged 50–69 years. Due to the public health implications of DM and its complications in resource-limited settings, this narrative review aims to summarize the general principles of screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on established and emerging evidence in order to delineate a practical approach to identifying adult patients at risk for diabetes-related foot disease and its complications.

Medical literature published in English between 1770 and 2023 was identified and considered for the review. The primary search strategy involved retrieval of relevant literature from health sciences databases (EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PubMed) and grey literature (Google Scholar, Opengrey, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and organization websites) using a combination of keywords and Boolean operators: "comprehensive foot examination" AND "diabetic foot"; diabetes AND "microvascular complications"; ("diabetic foot" OR "diabetic foot syndrome"); ("diabetic peripheral neuropathy" OR "distal symmetrical polyneuropathy"); "diabetic peripheral neuropathy" AND guideline; epidemiology AND "diabetic peripheral neuropathy"; ("non-painful diabetic neuropathy" OR "painless diabetic neuropathy"); "painful diabetic neuropathy" AND treatment; "diabetic peripheral neuropathy" AND "risk factors"; prevention AND "diabetic peripheral neu…

### Diabetic neuropathy: Understanding the nexus of diabetic neuropathy, gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment [^112dCiBq]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is a traditional and one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes mellitus. The exact pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy is not fully understood. However, oxidative stress and inflammation are proven to be major underlying mechanisms of neuropathy, which are described in detail. Gut dysbiosis is being studied for various neurological disorders, and its impact on diabetic neuropathy is also explained. Diabetic neuropathy also causes a loss in an individual's quality of life; one such adverse event is cognitive dysfunction. The interrelation between neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis is reviewed.

- **Methods**: The exact mechanism is not understood, but several hypotheses, cross-sectional studies, and systematic reviews suggest a relationship between cognition and neuropathy. The review has collected data from various review and research publications that justify this inter-relationship.

- **Results**: The multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy are described, with special emphasis on the role of gut dysbiosis. There might exist a correlation between neuropathy and cognitive impairment occurring simultaneously in diabetic patients.

- **Conclusions**: This review summarizes the relationship that might exist between diabetic neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, and the impact of a disturbed gut microbiome on its development and progression.

### Association of peripheral neuropathy with circulating advanced glycation end products, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products and other risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115Si6Ga]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy remains uncertain, and nonenzymatic glycoxidation is one of the contributing mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of diabetic peripheral neuropathy with glycoxidation, compared with other identified risk factors, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: We included 198 patients with type 2 diabetes and a high risk for vascular complications. Circulating concentrations of three advanced glycation end products — carboxymethyllysine, methyl-glyoxal-hydroimidazolone-1, and pentosidine — and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) were measured. Peripheral neuropathy was assessed by the neuropathy disability score and the monofilament test, defined as either an abnormal monofilament test and/or a neuropathy disability score ≥ 6. Multivariate regression analyses were performed, adjusting for potential confounding factors for neuropathy: age, gender, diabetes duration, smoking, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, height, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, glycated hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lipid profile.

- **Results**: The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy was 20.7%. sRAGE and carboxymethyllysine were independently and positively associated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy. No significant association was found between peripheral neuropathy and methyl-glyoxal-hydroimidazolone-1 or pentosidine. Waist circumference, height, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease were independently associated with peripheral neuropathy.

- **Conclusions**: Carboxymethyllysine and sRAGE are independently associated with peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes, highlighting the potential role of glycation products in its pathogenesis.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^117VoSpU]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, using simple clinical tests. Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient.

### The spectrum of neuropathy in diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance [^117Joj3G]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the neuropathy associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) determined by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT).

- **Methods**: Patients with peripheral neuropathy of unknown cause were prescribed OGTT. Duration of neuropathic symptoms, neuropathic pain, neuropathy classification, nerve conduction test results, and intraepidermal nerve fiber densities (IENFD) were compared between IGT and DM groups.

- **Results**: Seventy-three patients completed OGTT; 41 (56%) had abnormal results. Of these 41 patients, 26 had IGT and 15 had DM. Patients with IGT had less severe neuropathy than patients with diabetes, as measured by sural nerve amplitudes (p = 0.056), sural nerve conduction velocities (p = 0.03), and distal leg IENFD (p = 0.01). Patients with IGT had predominantly small fiber neuropathy compared to patients with DM (p = 0.05), who had more involvement of large nerve fibers.

- **Conclusions**: The neuropathy associated with IGT is milder than the neuropathy associated with DM. Small nerve fibers are prominently affected and may be the earliest detectable sign of neuropathy in glucose dysmetabolism. OGTT is appropriate in patients with idiopathic neuropathy.

### Diabetic neuropathies: Clinical manifestations and current treatment options [^113mMe5y]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that encompass a wide range of abnormalities. These disorders can be focal or diffuse, proximal or distal, affecting both the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. They contribute significantly to morbidity, impacting the quality of life for people with diabetes and may lead to early death.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is the most common form of diabetic neuropathy and typically involves both small and large nerve fibers. Small-nerve-fiber neuropathy often presents with pain but lacks objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage. It is recognized as a component of impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndromes. Foot ulceration, followed by gangrene and potential amputation, is the greatest risk associated with small-fiber neuropathy.

Large-nerve-fiber neuropathies cause numbness, ataxia, and uncoordination, which impair daily living activities and lead to falls and fractures. A careful history and detailed physical examination are essential for diagnosis. Symptomatic therapy has become available, and newer treatment modalities, based on etiologic factors, are being explored with the potential to significantly impact morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient education remain key factors in reducing complication rates and mortality.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: Introduction to diabetic neuropathy [^112XaySw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The initial symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can include complaints of motor system involvement, which manifests as weakness, especially in more distal areas. As the disease progresses, weakness occurs more proximally and symptom severity increases. There are also autonomic symptoms that typically present later in the disease course. Autonomic symptoms may involve the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary systems and can include sweat gland involvement. Cardiac autonomic symptoms tend not to occur in the early stages but can be detected through cardiac autonomic testing.

- **The most common type of diabetic neuropathy**: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, also known as distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, is the most common form, characterized by the glove and stocking distribution of nerve damage. Autonomic neuropathy is also extremely common.

- **Prevention of diabetic neuropathy**:
	- For type 1 diabetes, maintaining excellent glycaemic control can prevent or halt the progression of diabetic neuropathy.
	- The effectiveness of glycaemic control in preventing diabetic neuropathy in type 2 diabetes remains uncertain.

### Diabetes distal peripheral neuropathy: Subtypes and diagnostic and screening technologies [^113ri2KT]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetes distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is the most prevalent form of neuropathy in industrialized countries, substantially increasing the risk for morbidity and premature mortality. DSPN may manifest with small-fiber disease, large-fiber disease, or a combination of both types.

- **DSPN subtypes**: This section examines small- and large-fiber disease, focusing on clinical signs and patient symptoms.

- **Technological diagnosis and screening**: This part of the review explores diagnostic and screening technologies for large- and small-fiber disease, including a comprehensive literature review of published studies from 2015 to the present (N = 66). The findings, informed by the most up-to-date research, enhance critical understanding of DSPN large- and small-fiber screening technologies, including those designed for point-of-care use in primary care and endocrinology practices.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy [^114aetr1]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic, and associated neuropathy is its most costly and disabling complication. Given the rising prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy, it is increasingly important to understand the best ways to diagnose and treat this condition. Diagnostic tests in this field are evolving rapidly. These include the use of skin biopsies to measure small unmyelinated fibers, as well as newer techniques that can measure both small unmyelinated fibers and large myelinated fibers in the same biopsy.

The main treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy remain the management of the underlying diabetes and drugs for the relief of pain. However, emerging evidence points to major differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including the ability of glycemic control to prevent neuropathy. Enhanced glucose control is much more effective at preventing neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 disease. This dichotomy emphasizes the need to study the pathophysiologic differences between the two types of diabetes, as different treatments may be needed for each condition.

The impact of metabolic syndrome on neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes may account for the difference between the two types of diabetes and requires further study. Finally, neuropathic pain is under-recognized and undertreated despite an ever-evolving list of effective drugs. Evidence exists to support several drugs, but the optimal sequence and combination of these drugs are still to be determined.

### Diabetic neuropathies: Update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^112UkhcY]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Estimating the severity of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) has not received the attention it deserves. For a given patient with diabetes, it is not sufficient to simply identify patients as having or not having DSPN; severity also needs to be ascertained. We suggest a reliable objective and quantitative measure (i.e. NC abnormality) as the minimal criterion for the diagnosis of DSPN. When NC values have not been assessed, it is not possible to provide a confirmed diagnosis of DSPN — only a possible or probable diagnosis. Since the severity of DSPN is a combination of neuropathy symptoms, signs, neurophysiologic test abnormalities, and other dysfunctions and impairments, the sum scores of various measures of neurologic signs, symptoms, neurophysiologic test abnormalities, or scores of function of activities of daily living may provide an indication of the severity.

An alternative approach to estimating severity is to indicate severity by grades. Dyck described the stages of severity:

- **Grade 0**: No abnormality of NC, e.g. Σ 5 NC normal deviates < 95th percentile or another suitable NC criterion
- **Grade 1a**: Abnormality of NC, e.g. Σ 5 NC normal deviates ≥ 95th percentile without symptoms or signs
- **Grade 1b**: NC abnormality of stage 1a plus neurologic signs typical of DSPN but without neuropathy symptoms
- **Grade 2a**: NC abnormality of stage 1a with or without signs (but if present, < 2b) and with typical neuropathic symptoms
- **Grade 2b**: NC abnormality of stage 1a, a moderate degree of weakness (i.e. 50%) of ankle dorsiflexion with or without neuropathy symptoms

### Neuropathy of impaired glucose tolerance and its measurement [^114uBY1K]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was originally shown in the prospective Whitehall Study to carry an increased risk of large-vessel disease only. Whether or not IGT may also confer an increased risk for microvascular complications is not clear. Although microalbuminuria has been shown to be increased in those with IGT compared with control subjects, the incidence of retinopathy (IGT 6.7% vs. NGT 5.8%) and moderate neuropathy (IGT 5.7% vs. NGT 2.8%) have been found to be similar.

Nevertheless, it has been proposed that IGT may cause neuropathy. However, little is new in clinical medicine; over 40 years ago, Ellenberg suggested that neuropathy may indeed occur in pre-diabetes, although it is interesting that the interpretation was that factors other than hyperglycemia may cause the neuropathy. The recent resurgence of interest in IGT neuropathy is based on four separate studies of patients with idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy, where the prevalence of IGT was found to be 34–35.6%, three times the prevalence in age-matched control subjects.

We believe the interpretation of these studies has significant limitations because the populations studied were selected for the presence of idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy, rather than IGT. Furthermore, as pointed out by Dyck et al. in a critical review, the association between IGT and neuropathy remains to be confirmed in an ongoing prospective study. Added to this, the relationship between the metabolic syndrome and its component constituents to IGT neuropathy has come under scrutiny.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: After removing duplicates, the titles and abstracts of all publications were screened by three reviewers independently, who excluded any that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or consultation with a fourth reviewer. The full texts of the remaining articles were then assessed by the same reviewers. Details of the screening process are depicted in the PRISMA flow chart (Figure 1).

	- The reviewers extracted data from the remaining eligible articles using a pre‐specified form. This form included: the first author's name, publication date, location, study design, sample size (overall and by study groups), participants' age, exposure assessment (pre-diabetic status), outcome definition (peripheral neuropathy), methods and types of peripheral neuropathy evaluation, definition of pre-diabetes and methods of its assessment, main findings, and adjustment factors.

- **Quality assessment**: The methodological quality of the included articles was evaluated independently by two reviewers using NHLBI quality assessment tools for observational studies. The cross-sectional and cohort tool includes 14 questions, and the case-control tool contains 12 questions, each scored 0 or 1, to determine potential flaws in study methods or implementation. Judgments on the overall methodological quality were determined by the total score for each article as follows: low quality (≤ 50%).

- **Study selection**: The literature search strategy yielded 839 records, and 515 remained after duplicate removal. After the initial screening based on titles and abstracts, 154 full‐text articles were retained and assessed. Ultimately, 26 studies were included in the qualitative assessment and meta‐analysis study as shown in the PRISMA flow diagram in Figure 1.

- **Study characteristics**: In the meta-analysis, separate forest plots were presented for the outcome of neuropathy based on the type of neuropathy assessment metrics. The severity of neuropathy was assessed to be worse in pre-diabetes patients compared with the controls. Results of the quality assessment of included studies are depicted in Table 2. The majority of the included studies were of high quality (17 studies), while only one study in the systematic review was of low quality.

- **Sample size**: The sample size of the study was 41,821, consisting of 16,009 patients and 25,812 controls. From all the 26 studies, we extracted data from 91 outcomes because each study may include more than one outcome assessment metric. Only 5 out of the 26 studies reported adjusted outcomes controlling for factors such as age, sex, and BMI.

### Towards prevention of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: Clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and new treatments [^115NQxeo]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) occurs in up to half of individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. DPN results from the distal-to-proximal loss of peripheral nerve function, leading to physical disability and sometimes pain, with the consequent lowering of quality of life. Early diagnosis improves clinical outcomes, but many patients still develop neuropathy. Hyperglycemia is a risk factor and glycemic control prevents DPN development in type 1 diabetes. However, glycemic control has modest or no benefit in individuals with type 2 diabetes, probably because they usually have comorbidities.

Among these, the metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for DPN. The pathophysiology of DPN is complex, but mechanisms converge on a unifying theme of bioenergetic failure in the peripheral nerves due to their unique anatomy. Clinical management focuses on controlling diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and pain, but remains suboptimal for most patients. Thus, research is ongoing to improve early diagnosis and prognosis, to identify molecular mechanisms that could lead to therapeutic targets, and to investigate lifestyle interventions to improve clinical outcomes.

The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (DN) continues to be unclear; as a result, progress in developing effective therapies has been disappointing. In particular, there is only limited understanding of why some patients suffer severe chronic pain, while others have painless symptoms. Assessment of the peripheral nerves frequently shows no differences between painful and painless DN. There is growing evidence that the nerve damage in DN is more generalized, including the central nervous system, and these central changes are key to the development and persistence of pain in DN. The advent of new radiological techniques provides us with non-invasive modalities to study central pathophysiological processes in greater detail. These insights are increasingly leading to the recognition that painful DN is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, which requires a multimodal approach to treatment.

### Diabetic neuropathy — a review [^114qN5vn]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is the most common neuropathy in industrialized countries, and it is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The vast majority of patients with clinical diabetic neuropathy have a distal symmetrical form of the disorder that progresses following a fiber-length-dependent pattern, with sensory and autonomic manifestations predominating. This pattern of neuropathy is associated with a progressive distal axonopathy. Patients experience pain, trophic changes in the feet, and autonomic disturbances.

Occasionally, patients with diabetes can develop focal and multifocal neuropathies that include cranial nerve involvement and limb and truncal neuropathies. This neuropathic pattern tends to occur after 50 years of age, mostly in patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus. Length-dependent diabetic polyneuropathy does not show any trend towards improvement and either relentlessly progresses or remains relatively stable over a number of years. Conversely, the focal diabetic neuropathies, which are often associated with inflammatory vasculopathy on nerve biopsies, remain self-limited, sometimes following a relapsing course.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: Focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, under or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is key to implementing earlier interventions and ensuring that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is critical, as many potentially effective therapies may never progress to the clinic, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify benefit.

Apart from improving glycaemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy; however, several pathogenetic pathways remain under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy causes considerable morbidity. While many pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We address the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and also consider potential new pharmacological therapies as well as non-pharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111V5u5h]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic neuropathy, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing for symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy. These symptoms include orthostatic dizziness, syncope, resting tachycardia, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, changes in sweating patterns, or dry cracked skin in the extremities. Assessment should start at diagnosis and continue at least annually thereafter in patients with evidence of other microvascular complications, particularly kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^114NCFFK]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter using simple clinical tests. Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient.

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important for a number of reasons:

1. Nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable.
2. A number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy.
3. Up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, and patients are at risk of insensate injury to their feet.
4. Autonomic neuropathy may involve every system in the body.
5. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality.

### Polymorphic variants and risk of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114qgXFQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease that has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades. It is estimated that around 79% of affected individuals reside in low and middle-income countries. In Latin America, studies also show a rise in the prevalence of DM, with Mexico, Haiti, and Puerto Rico being the most affected regions.

Neuropathies are a set of clinical syndromes that fall under microvascular complications developed by diabetic patients. They are characterized by variable symptoms, patterns of neurological involvement, risk factors, and mechanisms. Half of diabetic neuropathy (DN) cases present in its most typical form as distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP), a frequent type of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DSP manifests in the context of metabolic dysfunction and can occur in around 10–15% of recently diagnosed individuals with type 2 DM, and in 50% of patients after 10 years of the disease.

The estimated prevalence of DPN worldwide is 31.5% in patients with type 2 DM. It is characterized by variable clinical expressions, ranging from asymptomatic to the presence of painful neuropathic discomfort, diabetic foot, Charcot arthropathy, and non-traumatic lower limb amputations. Therefore, early detection and prevention are of vital importance.

While type 2 DM is a disease with multifactorial inheritance, various environmental risk factors, such as poor glycemic control, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and depressive symptoms, play significant roles.

### New trends in the etiopathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^114peh8i]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Neuropathy is well recognized as a major complication of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in adults, resulting in significant morbidity and possibly increased mortality. Both the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems can be involved, and adolescents with diabetes can show early evidence of neuropathy.

The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy remains unclear but is thought to involve various mechanisms. This complication can be traced to the metabolic effects of hyperglycemia and other effects of insulin deficiency on the various constituents of the peripheral nerve. The polyol pathway and nonenzymatic glycation affecting one or more cell types in the multicellular constituents of the peripheral nerve appear likely to have an inciting role. The role of other factors, such as possible direct neurotrophic effects of insulin and insulin-related growth factors, seems to be relevant.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic neuropathy, and more specifically clinical assessment, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a careful history. They advise assessing either temperature or pinprick sensation (small-fiber function) and vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function) for the assessment of distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Obtain annual 10-g monofilament testing in all patients with diabetes to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^116phtxZ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Neuropathies are the most common long-term microvascular complications of diabetes, affecting individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Up to 50% of older type 2 diabetic patients exhibit evidence of distal neuropathy. These neuropathies are characterized by a progressive loss of nerve fibers impacting both the autonomic and somatic divisions of the nervous system. The clinical features of diabetic neuropathies vary greatly, with only a minority associated with pain. This review primarily focuses on the most common painful neuropathy, chronic sensorimotor distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). This neuropathy significantly affects sufferers, confirming an increased risk of foot ulceration and Charcot neuroarthropathy, as well as an association with increased mortality.

In addition to DSPN, there are other rarer neuropathies that may also be associated with painful symptoms, including acute painful neuropathy that often follows periods of unstable glycemic control, mononeuropathies (e.g. cranial nerve palsies), radiculopathies, and entrapment neuropathies (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome). The most common presentation of diabetic polyneuropathy (over 90%) is typical DSPN or chronic DSPN.

The Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group recently defined DSPN as "a symmetrical, length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy attributable to metabolic and microvessel alterations as a result of chronic hyperglycemia exposure and cardiovascular risk covariates". An abnormality of nerve conduction (NC) tests, which is frequently subclinical, is often present.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^111PdgDj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for diabetes-related lower-extremity complications. Diffuse neuropathy is the most frequently encountered pattern of neurological dysfunction and presents clinically as distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Due to the increasing public health significance of diabetes mellitus and its complications, screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy is essential. Consequently, a review of the principles that guide screening practices, especially in resource-limited clinical settings, is urgently needed.

- **Main body**: Numerous evidence-based assessments are used to detect diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In accordance with guideline recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a screening algorithm for diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on multiphasic clinical assessment, stratification according to the risk of developing diabetic foot syndrome, individualized treatment, and scheduled follow-up is suggested for use in resource-limited settings.

- **Conclusions**: Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings requires a practical and comprehensive approach in order to promptly identify affected individuals. The principles of screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are multiphasic approach, risk stratification, individualized treatment, and scheduled follow-up.

### European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2019 conference: Podcast overview of the conference [^111nmCuT]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Both our interests are in neuropathy, so for me also this was a really good session. The work that they're doing is fantastic because painful neuropathy is such a big problem that we see day in and day out in the clinic, and absolutely more work needs to be done in this area. The brain imaging techniques that they're using to identify the causes of pain and to figure out what else we can do to manage this is really interesting. It gives us an idea of the mechanisms behind the complexity of pain in diabetic neuropathy.

Regarding the complexity of pain, there was a talk in the same neuropathy session where the authors tried to delineate more clinical factors in relationship to pain. They found an increase in BMI in those with painful neuropathy, but this was also shown in diabetic patients with neuropathy without pain. It is really difficult to delineate neuropathy based on clinical characteristics, but I think this is where the work in painful neuropathy will be going in the future — trying to delineate central mechanisms for pain in relation to clinical and neuropathy phenotyping.
