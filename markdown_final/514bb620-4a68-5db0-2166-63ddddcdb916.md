## Question

Is there a dose adjustment required for fluconazole for patients receiving hemodialysis two times a week?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fluconazole dosing needs to be adjusted for a patient receiving hemodialysis twice weekly, and if so, how to dose safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole and how dialysis affects exposure. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says for intermittent hemodialysis. Next, I will review HIV OI guidelines for practical, thrice-weekly HD regimens. After that, I need to translate this to a twice-weekly schedule and consider residual renal function. Finally, I should confirm loading dose strategy, monitoring, and any exceptions like single-dose therapy or critical illness, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation, because dosing hinges on it. Fluconazole is cleared predominantly unchanged by the kidneys, and a standard 3-hour hemodialysis session removes about 50% of plasma drug, which explains why post-dialysis supplementation is standard practice in renal failure [^114E7A9X] [^113YoDxc].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory guidance for intermittent HD. Multiple FDA sources consistently advise that patients on hemodialysis should receive 100% of the indication-specific dose after each dialysis session, and on non-dialysis days they should receive a reduced dose based on creatinine clearance, reflecting the 50% dialytic removal and impaired renal clearance between sessions [^116EYPxy] [^116EYPxy] [^112Wrsuy].

> Hold on, I should verify how this is operationalized in practice guidelines. The HIV OI guidance explicitly recommends 100% of the indication-specific initial dose, then 100% of the usual maintenance dose three times per week after each HD session, which aligns with the FDA principle and is the most concrete, clinically validated framework for thrice-weekly HD [^112Wrsuy] [^112hgD1f].

> Now, translating to twice-weekly HD, I need to ensure we preserve exposure while avoiding accumulation. The logical extension is to give 100% of the usual dose after each dialysis, and on non-dialysis days use a 50% dose reduction based on residual renal function, mirroring the thrice-weekly model but spacing doses further apart. Importantly, the HIV OI note clarifies that HD dosing guidance applies to intermittent HD several times weekly, and clinicians should individualize for other RRT modalities, which supports adapting the same principles to twice-weekly HD with attention to residual clearance and clinical response [^1142goiX] [^116EYPxy].

> I should double-check the loading dose strategy, because underexposure early is a common pitfall. Fluconazole reaches steady state in 5–10 days with once-daily dosing, and a loading dose of twice the usual maintenance dose achieves near steady-state by day 2; in dialysis patients, this still applies, so give the full loading dose on day 1 and then follow the post-HD/full-dose and non-HD/reduced-dose schedule thereafter [^114E7A9X] [^114UfW61].

> But wait, what if residual kidney function is substantial. I need to check that nuance. If residual urea clearance is meaningful, the inter-dialytic interval may allow more drug clearance, so the non-dialysis day dose may need further reduction; conversely, minimal residual function would argue for sticking close to the 50% reduction model, and clinicians should titrate to clinical response and, when available, consider therapeutic drug monitoring to navigate variability in exposure [^117MqhjM] [^114UfW61].

> Let me consider special scenarios so I don't overgeneralize. For single-dose therapy, such as vaginal candidiasis, no renal adjustment is needed because accumulation is not a concern. For critically ill patients with augmented clearance or CRRT, different PK/PD rules apply and higher, more frequent dosing may be required, so the twice-weekly HD schema does not fit those settings and should not be extrapolated there [^114UfW61] [^114UzzQ5] [^112EbFkL].

> I should confirm practical dosing language. For example, if the usual maintenance is 400 mg daily, a twice-weekly HD regimen could be 400 mg post-dialysis on dialysis days and 200 mg on non-dialysis days, with the 400 mg loading dose on day 1. If the usual dose is 200 mg daily, then 200 mg post-HD and 100 mg on non-HD days is reasonable, always reassessing for efficacy and tolerability and adjusting to residual function and MIC when known [^114UfW61] [^112Wrsuy].

> In summary, yes, dose adjustment is required for patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis. Give 100% of the indication-specific dose after each dialysis session and reduce to about 50% of the usual dose on non-dialysis days based on residual renal function, with a loading dose of twice the maintenance dose on day 1 to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels, and monitor clinically for response and adverse effects while considering TDM when available [^114UfW61] [^116eN9hw] [^114E7A9X] [^117MqhjM].

For patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis, **give 100% of the usual fluconazole dose after each dialysis session** [^114UfW61] [^116EYPxy] and **reduce the dose by 50% on non-dialysis days** based on residual renal function [^114UfW61] [^112Wrsuy]. This balances removal of ~50% of fluconazole per dialysis [^114E7A9X] with impaired renal clearance between sessions [^114E7A9X]. For a 400 mg daily indication, typical dosing is 400 mg post-dialysis and 200 mg on non-dialysis days; adjust to clinical response and consider therapeutic drug monitoring when available [^117MqhjM].

## Pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in hemodialysis

- **Renal clearance**: Fluconazole is ~80% renally cleared as unchanged drug [^114E7A9X]; impaired renal function prolongs half-life and increases exposure [^114E7A9X].

- **Dialysis removal**: A 3-hour hemodialysis session removes ~50% of fluconazole [^114E7A9X], necessitating post-dialysis dosing to restore therapeutic levels [^114UfW61].

- **Accumulation risk**: Between dialysis, reduced renal clearance can cause accumulation; dose reduction mitigates toxicity [^114UfW61].

## Clinical guidelines for fluconazole dosing in hemodialysis

Current FDA and IDSA guidance recommend:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosing strategy** |
|-|-|
| Hemodialysis patients | - 100% of usual dose after each dialysis session [^114UfW61] [^116EYPxy] <br/> - 50% dose reduction on non-dialysis days based on residual renal function [^114UfW61] [^112Wrsuy] |
| Loading dose | Administer a standard loading dose (e.g. 800 mg) to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels [^112xUMv3] [^114E7A9X] |
| Single-dose therapy (e.g. vaginal candidiasis) | No adjustment required [^114UfW61] |

## Practical dosing recommendation for twice-weekly hemodialysis

For patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis, apply the same principles: **100% dose post-dialysis** and **50% reduction on non-dialysis days**. For example, if the usual dose is 400 mg daily, give 400 mg after each dialysis and 200 mg on non-dialysis days. Adjust based on clinical response, infection severity, and residual renal function [^114UfW61] [^117MqhjM].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Clinical response**: Monitor for efficacy and toxicity; adjust dosing as needed [^114UfW61].

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Consider TDM when available to guide dosing, especially in severe infections or variable clearance [^117MqhjM].

- **Drug interactions**: Fluconazole interacts with agents like warfarin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus; monitor closely and adjust interacting drugs as needed [^117Ri3QC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Post-dialysis dosing**: 100% of usual dose after each dialysis session [^114UfW61] [^116EYPxy].

- **Non-dialysis days**: 50% dose reduction based on residual renal function [^114UfW61] [^112Wrsuy].

- **Loading dose**: Use a standard loading dose to achieve therapeutic levels quickly [^112xUMv3] [^114E7A9X].

- **Monitoring**: Tailor to clinical response and consider TDM when available [^117MqhjM].

---

Patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis should receive **full-dose fluconazole after each dialysis** and a **50% dose on non-dialysis days**, with adjustments based on clinical response and residual renal function [^114UfW61] [^112Wrsuy].

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112xUMv3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Fluconazole — adult dosing and renal adjustment: For candidiasis in adults, it should be administered with an average loading dose of 800 mg (12 mg/kg), followed by an average daily dose of 400 mg (6 mg/ kg). The higher-dose level (800 mg daily, 12 mg/kg) is often recommended for therapy of susceptible C. glabrata infections, but this has not been validated in clinical trials. Fluconazole elimination is almost entirely renal; thus, a dose reduction is needed in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute.

Patients on hemodialysis should receive 100% of the recommended dose after each hemodialysis; on non-dialysis days, patients should receive a reduced dose according to their creatinine clearance.

These are suggested dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics following administration of multiple doses. Further adjustment may be needed depending upon clinical condition.

When serum creatinine is the only measure of renal function available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) should be used to estimate the creatinine clearance in adults:

Females: 0.85 × above value

Although the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole has not been studied in pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, dosage reduction in pediatric patients with renal insufficiency should parallel that recommended for adults. The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in pediatric patients:

[K × linear length or height (cm)]/[serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)]

(Where K = 0.55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year and 0.45 for infants.)

Administration

Fluconazole tablets are administered orally. Fluconazole tablets can be taken with or without food.

Dosage In Patients With Impaired Renal Function:

Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. There is no need to adjust single dose therapy for vaginal candidiasis because of impaired renal function. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of DIFLUCAN, an initial loading dose of 50 mg to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following summary:

Patients on hemodialysis should receive 100% of the recommended dose after each hemodialysis; on non-dialysis days, patients should receive a reduced dose according to their creatinine clearance.

These are suggested dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics following administration of multiple doses. Further adjustment may be needed depending upon clinical condition.

Administration

DIFLUCAN is administered orally. DIFLUCAN can be taken with or without food.

Directions for Mixing the Oral Suspension

Prepare a suspension at time of dispensing as follows: tap bottle until all the powder flows freely. To reconstitute, add 24 mL of distilled water or Purified Water (USP) to fluconazole bottle and shake vigorously to suspend powder. Each bottle will deliver 35 mL of suspension. The concentrations of the reconstituted suspensions are as follows:

### Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) [^117WiGcK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Recommended Dosage for Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease

The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg given orally twice daily.

Consider tapering Jakafi after 6 months of treatment in patients with response who have discontinued therapeutic doses of corticosteroids. Taper Jakafi by one dose level approximately every 8 weeks (10 mg twice daily to 5 mg twice daily to 5 mg once daily). If GVHD signs or symptoms recur during or after the taper of Jakafi, consider retreatment.

Dose Modification Guidelines for Patients with Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease

Monitor complete blood counts (CBC), including platelet count and ANC, and bilirubin prior to initiating therapy, every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as indicated clinically.

Modify the dose of Jakafi for adverse reactions as described in Table 8. For dose reductions, patients who are currently receiving Jakafi 10 mg twice daily may have their dose reduced to 5 mg twice daily; patients receiving 5 mg twice daily may have their dose reduced to 5 mg once daily. Patients who are unable to tolerate Jakafi at a dose of 5 mg once daily should have treatment interrupted until their clinical and/or laboratory parameters recover.

2.6 Dose Modifications for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Fluconazole

Modify the Jakafi dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or doses of less than or equal to 200 mg of fluconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)], according to Table 9. Avoid concomitant use of Jakafi with fluconazole doses of greater than 200 mg daily.

2.7 Dose Modifications for Renal or Hepatic Impairment

Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment or End Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Modify the Jakafi dosage for patients with moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) to severe (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis according to Table 10. Avoid use of Jakafi in patients with ESRD (CLcr less than 15 mL/min) not requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatic Impairment

Modify the Jakafi dosage for patients with hepatic impairment according to Table 11.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations for antifungal therapy optimisation in the treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis [^114UzzQ5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluconazole

Fluconazole is a triazole which inhibits the 14-α-demethylase which is an enzyme required for conversion of lanosterol into ergosterol. It has low plasma protein binding of 12% and is a weakly basic, highly polar, hydrophilic (LogP 0.5) drug with a small molecular weight. These physicochemical properties expose fluconazole to unpredictable concentrations in the critically ill patient. Indeed, hydrophilic, low protein-binding and low molecular weight are highly influenced by increased Vd and renal clearance; leading to low drug exposure.

Fluconazole exhibits concentration- and time-dependent antifungal activity with a prolonged post-antifungal effect. The predictive PK/PD index associated with maximal fungal killing is the ratio of free-drug area under the concentration time curve (from 0 to 24 h) to minimum inhibitory concentration of the fungal organism (f AUC 0–24 /MIC). An f AUC 0–24 /MIC of greater than 100 is associated with optimal fungicidal activity and positive outcomes in critically ill patients. Current dosing regimens in critically ill patients with normal renal function recommend a loading dose of 12 mg/kg intravenously followed by a maintenance dose of 6 — 12 mg/kg/day. Maintenance doses of up to 18 mg/kg per day have been proposed. Factors associated with suboptimal fluconazole exposure include obesity, high renal clearance and patients undergoing continuous RRT. In obese patients, total body weight has been used to calculate doses. In the setting of RRT, adjusting the maintenance dose to 800 mg (400 mg q12h) has been suggested. In contrast, ECMO by itself does not seem to influence fluconazole PK. Indeed, PK alteration under ECMO is mostly related to lipophilicity or changes in Vd and to date, no sequestration in the ECMO circuit has been demonstrated with fluconazole. However, data in adult patients are scarce and more studies are warranted to better address optimal dosing of fluconazole in patients undergoing ECMO.

### Fluconazole [^114E7A9X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Steady-state concentrations are reached within 5 to 10 days following oral doses of 50 mg to 400 mg given once daily. Administration of a loading dose (on Day 1) of twice the usual daily dose results in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day. The apparent volume of distribution of fluconazole approximates that of total body water. Plasma protein binding is low (11 to 12%). Following either single-or multiple oral doses for up to 14 days, fluconazole penetrates into all body fluids studied (see table below). In normal volunteers, saliva concentrations of fluconazole were equal to or slightly greater than plasma concentrations regardless of dose, route, or duration of dosing. In patients with bronchiectasis, sputum concentrations of fluconazole following a single 150 mg oral dose were equal to plasma concentrations at both 4 and 24 hours post dose. In patients with fungal meningitis, fluconazole concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are approximately 80% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.

A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue: plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing.

A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, resulting in fluid: plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing.

* Relative to concurrent concentrations in plasma in subjects with normal renal function.

† Independent of degree of meningeal inflammation.

Mean body clearance in adults is reported to be 0.23 (17%) mL/min/kg. In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.

The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. The dose of fluconazole may need to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.

In normal volunteers, fluconazole administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response.

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^112nYq6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosage In Patients With Impaired Renal Function:

Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of fluconazole, an initial loading dose of 50 mg to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following summary:

Patients on hemodialysis should receive 100% of the recommended dose after each hemodialysis; on non-dialysis days, patients should receive a reduced dose according to their creatinine clearance.

These are suggested dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics following administration of multiple doses. Further adjustment may be needed depending upon clinical condition.

When serum creatinine is the only measure of renal function available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) should be used to estimate the creatinine clearance in adults:

(Where K = 0.55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year and 0.45 for infants.)

Administration

Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be administered by intravenous infusion.

Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP has been used safely for up to fourteen days of intravenous therapy. The intravenous infusion of fluconazole should be administered at a maximum rate of approximately 200 mg/hour, given as a continuous infusion.

Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride injections in flexible plastic containers are intended only for intravenous administration using sterile equipment.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

Do not use if the solution is cloudy or precipitated or if the seal is not intact.

### Treatment with echinocandins during continuous renal replacement therapy [^1175NGuy]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Echinocandins are indicated as first-line treatment for invasive candidiasis in moderate to severe illness. As sepsis is the main cause of acute kidney injury, the combination of echinocandin treatment and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is common. Optimizing antibiotic dosage in critically ill patients receiving CRRT is challenging. The pharmacokinetics of echinocandins have been studied under various clinical conditions; however, data for CRRT patients are scarce. Classically, drugs like echinocandins with high protein binding and predominantly non-renal elimination are not removed by CRRT, indicating that no dosage adjustment is required. However, recent studies report different proportions of echinocandins lost by filter adsorption. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear.

### Voriconazole [^111h1vUk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multiple dose study of IV voriconazole (6 mg/kg IV loading dose x 2, then 3 mg/kg IV x 5.5 days) in 7 patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min), the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were not significantly different from those in 6 subjects with normal renal function.

However, in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of SBECD were increased 4-fold and almost 50%, respectively, in the moderately impaired group compared to the normal control group.

A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis showed that voriconazole is dialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Patients at Risk of Aspergillosis

The observed voriconazole pharmacokinetics in patients at risk of aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or hematopoietic tissue) were similar to healthy subjects.

### Treatment with echinocandins during continuous renal replacement therapy [^113pAV9X]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Echinocandins are the first systemic antifungal agents that selectively target the fungal cell. Three echinocandins are currently available: caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin. Echinocandins are cyclic hexapeptides with N-linked acyl lipid side chains. These lipophilic side chains predominantly differentiate the three echinocandins, resulting in variations in solubility, microbiological potency, and pharmacokinetic disposition. Echinocandins are indicated as first-line antifungal treatment for invasive candidiasis in patients with moderately severe to severe illness.

The mechanism of action of the echinocandins is the non-competitive inhibition of β-(1,3)-D-glucan synthase, an essential component of many fungal cell walls, leading to osmotic instability and cell death. Echinocandins exhibit fungistatic activity against Aspergillus species and concentration-dependent fungicidal activity against Candida species with a prolonged post-antifungal effect. Acquired resistance to the echinocandins remains sporadic. Both maximum concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration (C max /MIC) and AUC 0–24 /MIC (area under the curve over 24-hour dosing interval/MIC) have been associated with efficacy. All echinocandins are highly protein-bound and have a low to moderate volume of distribution and very low excretion as unchanged drug in the urine. Echinocandins have an excellent safety profile and low potential for pharmacological interactions.

Acute renal failure is a common complication of critical illness and carries a high mortality. It affects up to 20% of critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. These patients usually receive continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and antibiotics simultaneously. Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics are affected by CRRT and may be altered by acute renal failure and critical illness. Several factors should be considered in antibiotic prescription under CRRT: pharmacokinetics, causative microorganism, MIC, renal replacement therapy mode, membrane and surface area, sieving coefficient, effluent and dialysate rates, and others. Only the unbound fraction of a drug is available for filtration, and drugs with high protein binding are largely unaffected by CRRT. The degree of protein binding is the most important factor influencing whether a drug needs dose adjustment during CRRT. Drugs that are more than 90% bound to plasma proteins are unlikely to be removed by hemodialysis and hemofiltration, but the adsorption on the membrane in the filter could result in a significant clearance.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^115b1hPY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

### Pharmacokinetics and the most suitable dosing regimen of fluconazole in critically ill patients receiving continuous hemodiafiltration [^1168be6B]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate fluconazole pharmacokinetics and the dosage best suited to maintain effective plasma concentration in patients with continuous hemodiafiltration.

Design and Setting

Prospective study in the general intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Four critically ill patients being treated with fluconazole and receiving continuous hemodiafiltration.

Interventions

Fluconazole was administered at three dosing regimens: 200 and 400 mg every 24 h, 400 mg every 12 h, and 800 mg every 24 h.

Measurements and Results

The following pharmacokinetic variables for fluconazole were obtained: The mean volume distribution of steady state dosed at 400 mg every 12 h and 800 mg every 24 h were 0.55 ± 0.23 and 0.71 ± 0.16 l/kg, half-life of the elimination phase 8.08 ± 0.83 and 9.12 ± 0.75 h, total body clearance of fluconazole 1.14 ± 0.44 and 0.98 ± 0.20 ml/kg per minute, respectively. None of the dosing regimens reached the effective plasma trough concentration of fluconazole; however, simulation study found the recommended dose.

Conclusions

Continuous hemodiafiltration is highly effective in removing fluconazole from circulation. We recommend fluconazole to be dosed at 500–600 mg intravenously every 12 h in patients receiving hemodiafiltration. This dosing regimen resulted in adequate trough plasma levels for systemic fungal infection.

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^113YoDxc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue: plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing.

A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, resulting in fluid: plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing.

Table 2: Ratio of Fluconazole Tissue (Fluid)/Plasma Concentration

Mean body clearance in adults is reported to be 0.23 (17%) mL/min/kg. In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.

The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. The dose of fluconazole may need to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.

In normal volunteers, fluconazole administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulated cortisol response.

### Caspofungin acetate [^114R7NPf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

Two single-dose radiolabeled pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. In one study, plasma, urine, and feces were collected over 27 days, and in the second study plasma was collected over 6 months. Plasma concentrations of radioactivity and of caspofungin were similar during the first 24 to 48 hours postdose; thereafter drug levels fell more rapidly. In plasma, caspofungin concentrations fell below the limit of quantitation after 6 to 8 days postdose, while radiolabel fell below the limit of quantitation at 22.3 weeks postdose. After single intravenous administration of [3H] caspofungin acetate for injection, excretion of caspofungin and its metabolites in humans was 35% of dose in feces and 41% of dose in urine. A small amount of caspofungin is excreted unchanged in urine (~1.4% of dose). Renal clearance of parent drug is low (~0.15 mL/min) and total clearance of caspofungin is 12 mL/min.

Special Populations

Renal Impairment

In a clinical study of single 70-mg doses, caspofungin pharmacokinetics were similar in healthy adult volunteers with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) and control subjects. Moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 49 mL/min), severe (creatinine clearance 5 to 30 mL/min), and end-stage (creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min and dialysis dependent) renal impairment moderately increased caspofungin plasma concentrations after single-dose administration (range: 30 to 49% for AUC). However, in adult patients with invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, or other Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections) who received multiple daily doses of caspofungin acetate for injection 50 mg, there was no significant effect of mild to end-stage renal impairment on caspofungin concentrations. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Caspofungin is not dialyzable, thus supplementary dosing is not required following hemodialysis.

Geriatric Use

In non-AIDS patients, side effects possibly related to fluconazole treatment were reported in fewer patients aged 65 and older (9%, n = 339) than for younger patients (14%, n = 2240). However, there was no consistent difference between the older and younger patients with respect to individual side effects. Of the most frequently reported (> 1%) side effects, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred in greater proportions of older patients. Similar proportions of older patients (2.4%) and younger patients (1.5%) discontinued fluconazole therapy because of side effects. In post-marketing experience, spontaneous reports of anemia and acute renal failure were more frequent among patients 65 years of age or older than in those between 12 and 65 years of age. Because of the voluntary nature of the reports and the natural increase in the incidence of anemia and renal failure in the elderly, it is however not possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Controlled clinical trials of fluconazole did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to evaluate whether they respond differently from younger patients in each indication. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

Fluconazole is primarily cleared by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance. It may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112fwrau]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Voriconazole — step-down role, pharmacokinetics, and dosing: Voriconazole has demonstrated effectiveness for both mucosal and invasive candidiasis, and its clinical use has been primarily for step-down oral therapy in patients with infection due to C. krusei and fluconazole-resistant, voriconazole-susceptible C. glabrata. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and vitreous concentrations are > 50% of serum concentrations in adults, and although urine concentrations may exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most Candida isolates, voriconazole does not accumulate in active form in the urine and thus should not be used for urinary candidiasis. The oral bioavailability of voriconazole is excellent and is not affected by gastric pH, but it decreases when the drug is administered with food. In adults, the recommended oral dosing regimen for candidiasis includes a loading dose of 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, followed by 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily. Intravenous voriconazole is complexed to a cyclodextrin; after 2 loading doses of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours, a maintenance dosage of 3–4 mg/kg every 12 hours is recommended, and intravenous voriconazole is not currently recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute. Oral voriconazole does not require dosage adjustment for renal insufficiency, but it is the only triazole that requires dosage reduction for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.

In infants with a very low birth weight who may accumulate high plasma concentrations because of poor renal function due to immaturity, the use of flucytosine without careful monitoring of serum drug levels is discouraged.

### Pharmacokinetics of single, oral-dose voriconazole in peritoneal dialysis patients [^114vPrRB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Voriconazole is a new triazole antifungal drug. Its pharmacokinetics and transfer to peritoneal dialysate in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients have not been studied.

Methods

Five patients with end-stage renal disease requiring support by PD were administered a single dose of 200 mg of voriconazole orally. Plasma and peritoneal dialysate were collected for measurement of voriconazole concentrations at times 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours.

Results

Voriconazole was absorbed and achieved maximum concentration (Cmax) in plasma at mean time 2.4 ± 0.7 (SE) hours. Time to Cmax in dialysate was 2.8 ± 0.5 hours. Mean Cmax for plasma was 0.55 ± 0.20 microg/mL, and for dialysate, approximately half that of plasma (0.25 ± 0.09 mug/mL). The dialysate to plasma ratio of voriconazole was 0.66 ± 0.11. Less than 1% of the administered voriconazole dose (1.3 ± 0.2 mg) was recovered in dialysate 24 hours after dosing.

Conclusion

Voriconazole penetrates well into peritoneal fluid. There is minimal peritoneal clearance of voriconazole; therefore, no dosage adjustment is needed for patients on PD therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis in the ICU: an updated approach to an old enemy [^113FZJra]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

There are only sparse data to suggest that the PK of echinocandins changes significantly in critically ill patients and they are not greatly influenced by RRT. A reduced AUC has been described for anidulafungin and caspofungin with a lower Cmax, but this is yet to be correlated with reduced efficacy. Use of adequate loading doses is particularly important for these agents (except micafungin), with caspofungin not even reaching steady-state concentrations by day 3 of treatment. The high protein binding of echinocandins may mean that the presence of hypoalbuminemia could severely alter the PK. Preliminary data for micafungin demonstrate an altered volume of distribution with changes in serum albumin concentrations. There are again few data for the various amphotericin formulations or flucytosine. Table 1 presents a summary guidance based on current understanding of how doses should be adjusted in different subpopulations of critically ill patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is likely to play an increasingly important role in our antifungal dosing decisions, and recommendations for when TDM should be used with the different agents available have been published recently. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in critically ill patients with invasive fungal infections that have measured the patient outcome benefits of a dose-optimization approach, such as TDM. Until such data become available, results from other patient populations, which support achievement of PK/PD targets and the use of TDM, suggest that we should actively optimize antifungal dosing, including the use of TDM where available.

Dosing of antifungal agents

Pathophysiological changes associated with critical illness can change drug concentrations so that they are significantly different from those observed in noncritically ill patients. In these circumstances, if standard dosing is used, then suboptimal concentrations (either too low or unnecessarily high) may result, putting the patient at risk of clinical failure or drug toxicity. Antifungal agents tend not to be as markedly affected by altered PK in critical illness. The drugs are mostly lipophilic, hepatically metabolized, and with high protein binding. Drugs such as fluconazole are an exception to these characteristics. Use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) can influence the clearance of some antifungal drugs, particularly those that are predominantly eliminated by renal mechanisms, are not highly protein bound, and have low molecular weights, notably the azoles and 5-flucytosine. Moreover, different RRT characteristics, including the specific mode, membrane characteristics, flow rates, and duration of treatment, may influence the effects of RRT on drug PK and should be taken into consideration when evaluating dosing.

From a PD perspective, efficacy for the triazole antifungals is described in terms of the ratio of the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The echinocandins are mostly described in terms of the ratio of the maximum concentration in a dosing interval (Cmax) to the MIC. Fluconazole is the antifungal for which most of the dosing challenges for critically ill patients exist. Data comparing the PK of fluconazole in critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients show a lower AUC, including both Cmax and minimum concentration during a dosing interval. Lack of achievement of the AUC/MIC target in particular is associated with doses < 6 mg/kg, suggesting that standard maintenance dosing should be at this level. In sepsis, interstitial fluid concentrations of fluconazole in tissues, which are commonly the target site of infection, are lower than those in plasma by ~50%. These data suggest that reduced efficacy may occur in states of microvascular failure. In the presence of RRT, very high drug clearances of fluconazole are common, necessitating even higher doses than in patients with normal renal function. Few data are available regarding altered PK of posaconazole, itraconazole, or isavuconazole in critically ill patients. For voriconazole, the unpredictability of dosing for individual patients tends to mean that critical illness does not in itself result in differences to dosing recommendations — although issues such as drug–drug interactions may be more common in these patients, necessitating more careful dose considerations.

### Fluconazole dosing in continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVHF): need for a high daily dose of 800 mg [^115gmZCx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

To cover intermediate sensitive Candida glabrata in ICU patients, fluconazole plasma peak levels at least in the range of 16–32 microg/ml appear necessary for treatment. Previous studies did not reach these fluconazole levels under continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVHF) with dosages of 200–600 mg fluconzole daily. In the present study, nine patients simultaneously requiring CVVHF for treatment of acute oligoanuric renal failure and antimycotic therapy of Candida septicemia received fluconazole 800 mg/day. Fluconazole plasma levels were determined to evaluate whether this dosage is adequate to reach the advised fluconazole levels. Patients were dialysed on two consecutive days with an ultrafiltration rate (UF) of 1000 ml/h or 2000 ml/h, respectively, in a randomized order. The predilution was 800 ml/h and 1800 ml/h, respectively. The treatment was tolerated without adverse effects. All patients reached plasma fluconazole concentrations between 16 and 32 microg/ml, remaining in this range for a minimum of 1 up to 24 h with a mean of 9.6 h and a UF rate of 2000 ml/h, and 15.7 h with a UF rate of 1000 ml/h. So far, there are no in vivo data on the fluconazole plasma concentrations required for effective treatment. However, our data demonstrate, that at least the fluconazole concentrations desirable on the basis of in vitro susceptibility testing can be reached in critically ill patients on CVVHF in an ICU setting. However, in these patients, 800 mg fluconazole/day are necessary to achieve fungicidal drug concentrations.

Organ transplant recipients without active coccidioidomycosis — primary prevention with oral azole: For all patients undergoing organ transplantation in the endemic area without active coccidioidomycosis, we recommend the use of an oral azole (such as fluconazole 200 mg) for 6–12 months (strong, low). The dosage of oral fluconazole used for the current prophylaxis of seronegative patients is 200 mg daily, whereas a 400-mg daily dosage is used for seropositive patients undergoing transplantation. At the conclusion of the 6- to 12-month posttransplantation prophylaxis period, fluconazole can be stopped, and because fluconazole administration increases serum levels of calcineurin inhibitors, we recommend close monitoring of such levels and dosage adjustment of antirejection medication following the discontinuation of fluconazole.

### Anidulafungin (Eraxis) [^115fbP8S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with fungal infections

Population pharmacokinetic analyses from four clinical trials including 107 male and 118 female patients with fungal infections showed that the pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin are not affected by age, race, or the presence of concomitant medications which are known metabolic substrates, inhibitors or inducers.

The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin in patients with fungal infections are similar to those observed in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin estimated using population pharmacokinetic modeling following IV administration of a maintenance dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day (following a loading dose) of ERAXIS are presented in Table 6.

Gender

Dosage adjustments are not required based on gender. Plasma concentrations of anidulafungin in healthy men and women were similar. In multiple-dose patient studies, drug clearance was slightly faster (approximately 22%) in men.

Geriatric

Dosage adjustments are not required for geriatric patients. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that median clearance differed slightly between the elderly group (patients ≥ 65, median CL = 1.07 L/h) and the non-elderly group (patients < 65, median CL = 1.22 L/h) and the range of clearance was similar.

Race

Dosage adjustments are not required based on race. Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics were similar among Whites, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics.

HIV Status

Dosage adjustments are not required based on HIV status, irrespective of concomitant anti-retroviral therapy.

Hepatic Insufficiency

Anidulafungin is not hepatically metabolized. Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics were examined in subjects with Child-Pugh class A, B or C hepatic insufficiency. Anidulafungin concentrations were not increased in subjects with any degree of hepatic insufficiency. Though a slight decrease in AUC was observed in patients with Child-Pugh C hepatic insufficiency, it was within the range of population estimates noted for healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Renal Insufficiency

Anidulafungin has negligible renal clearance. In a clinical study of subjects with mild, moderate, severe or end stage (dialysis-dependent) renal insufficiency, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in subjects with normal renal function. Anidulafungin is not dialyzable and may be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill adult patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112hKzTu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is now commonly used as a means of support for critically ill patients with renal failure. No recent comprehensive guidelines exist that provide antibiotic dosing recommendations for adult patients receiving CRRT. Doses used in intermittent hemodialysis cannot be directly applied to these patients, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics are different than those in patients with normal renal function. We reviewed the literature for studies involving the following antibiotics frequently used to treat critically ill adult patients receiving CRRT: vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, nafcillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, colistin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B (deoxycholate and lipid formulations), and acyclovir. We used these data, as well as clinical experience, to make recommendations for antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.

### Fluconazole [^117Ri3QC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Theophylline: Fluconazole increases the serum concentrations of theophylline. Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving fluconazole and theophylline is recommended. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies .)

Tofacitinib: Systemic exposure to tofacitinib is increased when tofacitinib is coadministered with fluconazole. Reduce the dose of tofacitinib when given concomitantly with fluconazole (i.e., from 5 mg twice daily to 5 mg once daily as instructed in the XELJANZ®* [tofacitinib] label). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)

Tolvaptan: Plasma exposure to tolvaptan is significantly increased (200% in AUC; 80% in Cmax) when tolvaptan, a CYP3A4 substrate, is coadministered with fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. This interaction may result in the risk of a significant increase in adverse reactions associated with tolvaptan, particularly significant diuresis, dehydration, and acute renal failure. If tolvaptan and fluconazole are concomitantly administered, the tolvaptan dose should be reduced as instructed in the tolvaptan prescribing information and the patient should be frequently monitored for any adverse reactions associated with tolvaptan.

Triazolam: Fluconazole increases the AUC of triazolam (single dose) by approximately 50%, Cmaxby 20% to 32%, and increases t½ by 25% to 50% due to the inhibition of metabolism of triazolam. Dosage adjustments of triazolam may be necessary.

### Are contemporary antifungal doses sufficient for critically ill patients? Outcomes from an international, multicenter pharmacokinetics study for screening antifungal exposure in intensive care units-the SAFE-ICU study [^1122E7dF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Relationship to previous studies

Lower antifungal exposures in critically ill patients compared to the general patient population or healthy adults have been documented for fluconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, posaconazole and isavuconazole, indicating a need for specific dosing regimens for ICU patients. The significant variability (> 30%) in antifungal exposure observed in this study (Supplementary Table 12) aligns with previous reports for fluconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, liposomal amphotericin B, voriconazole, and posaconazole. This variability can impact dosing regimen effectiveness and safety and support the need for antifungal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

Azoles — The DALI study found that 33% of patients receiving fluconazole did not achieve the PK/PD target, consistent with other studies showing subtherapeutic exposures. While there is room to improve fluconazole dosing by adjusting for weight and renal function, caution is needed as the absence of a defined toxicity threshold does not eliminate the risk of adverse events at higher doses. Patients on voriconazole for prophylaxis achieved higher target attainment (≥ 75%) compared to those receiving treatment (< 53%) (Table 2) despite the treatment group receiving significantly higher doses reflecting the higher trough concentration target for treatment. This pattern of low voriconazole target attainment has been observed in previous studies. Dosing adjustments should be approached with caution as the PK/PD target range accommodates both over- and underexposure. Posaconazole prophylaxis led to > 80% of patients reaching the PK/PD target, compared to 37.5% of those receiving treatment despite similar dosing. Previous research has shown insufficient target attainment in critically ill patients prescribed posaconazole for treatment. Additionally, understanding the PK of available posaconazole formulations is crucial to optimizing dosing regimens. Previous studies on isavuconazole have reported ⁓70% of trough concentrations within 1–5.13 mg/L, while others found ⁓20–32% of troughs < 1 mg/L. There are a limited number of studies on isavuconazole in critically ill patients, but dosing adjustments and higher loading doses have been recommended. No associations between patient characteristics and endpoints were found in this study, likely due to the small number of patients administered isavuconazole.

Systemic Candida infections

For the treatment of candidemia and disseminated Candida infections, daily doses of 6–12 mg/kg/day have been used in an open, noncomparative study of a small number of children.

Cryptococcal meningitis

For the treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis, the recommended dosage is 12 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 6 mg/kg once daily. A dosage of 12 mg/kg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10–12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. For suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in children with AIDS, the recommended dose of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is 6 mg/kg once daily.

Dosage In Patients With Impaired Renal Function

Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, an initial loading dose of 50 to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following table:

Cryptococcosis — Adjunctive flucytosine and monitoring considerations state that addition of flucytosine to amphotericin B has been associated with more rapid sterilization of CSF and decreased risk for subsequent relapse. Patients receiving flucytosine should have either blood levels monitored (peak level 2 hours after dose should be 25–100 μg/mL) or at least twice weekly monitoring of complete blood counts for toxicity, and dosage should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency (BII). Opening pressure should always be measured when an LP is performed, and repeated LPs or CSF shunting are essential to effectively managing increased intracranial pressure.

Results

A total of 350 patients were recruited from 30 ICUs across 12 countries. Of these, 11 were excluded due to meeting exclusion criteria, withdrawal of consent, incomplete information, or missing samples. Among the remaining 339 patients, 349 antifungal courses were administered (Supplementary Table 3), with 9 patients receiving a second antifungal and one patient receiving a third. Patient characteristics at admission and on occasion 1 are detailed in Table 1, with electronic supplementary table 4 providing stratification by antifungal. Antifungal therapy was primarily prescribed for treatment (274/339, 80.8%). Fluconazole was the most frequently prescribed antifungal, accounting for 142/349 (40.7%) courses. The most common indication for treatment was intra-abdominal infection (84/274, 30.7%). Fungemia was present in 43/274 (15.7%) patients.

Geriatric Use

In non-AIDS patients, side effects possibly related to fluconazole treatment were reported in fewer patients aged 65 and older (9%, n = 339) than for younger patients (14%, n = 2240). However, there was no consistent difference between the older and younger patients with respect to individual side effects. Of the most frequently reported (> 1%) side effects, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred in greater proportions of older patients. Similar proportions of older patients (2.4%) and younger patients (1.5%) discontinued fluconazole therapy because of side effects. In post-marketing experience, spontaneous reports of anemia and acute renal failure were more frequent among patients 65 years of age or older than in those between 12 and 65 years of age. Because of the voluntary nature of the reports and the natural increase in the incidence of anemia and renal failure in the elderly, it is however not possible to establish a casual relationship to drug exposure.

Controlled clinical trials of fluconazole did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to evaluate whether they respond differently from younger patients in each indication. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

Fluconazole is primarily cleared by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance. It may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Progressive hemodialysis: is It the future? [^114EB7jk]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Progressive hemodialysis is based on the simple idea of adjusting its dose according to residual renal function (RRF). The progressive, infrequent paradigm is slowly gaining a foothold among nephrologists, despite a lot of skepticism in the scientific world. Given the importance of RRF preservation in conservative therapy, it seems a contradiction to ignore the contribution of RRF when patients initiate hemodialysis (HD), especially when it is routinely considered with peritoneal dialysis. While a three-times-weekly HD regimen is broadly considered the standard starting regimen for new patients, twice-weekly HD has been used in selected patients and is currently a common practice in South-East Asia. Small studies indicate that a once-weekly HD regimen may be a viable starting option as well. Progressive hemodialysis still requires validation, yet it is promising. We share the belief that a randomized clinical trial to investigate progressive hemodialysis is much needed, but we also strongly recommend including a once-weekly HD starting dose as part of any such investigation.

### Anidulafungin for the treatment of candidaemia / invasive candidiasis in selected critically ill patients [^115cfciq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment duration was longer than in prospective trials assessing echinocandins for C/IC in general patient populations; ICU patients may require longer durations of antifungal treatment than non-ICU patients. Our results suggest that survival and global response rates in critically ill patients were lower at all time-points than previously observed in a general population. This is consistent with other analyses indicating that ICU patients with invasive Candida infections have higher mortality and worse outcomes regardless of the antifungal agent used, probably reflecting the worse underlying condition of this population.

ICU patients with systemic Candida infections should therefore receive the most effective antifungal therapy available, as early as possible. Because the rapidly fungicidal action of echinocandins may positively impact treatment outcomes, these agents are now generally recommended as first-line therapy for C/IC in moderately to severely ill patients. The results of our study support these clinical guidelines. Anidulafungin is the only echinocandin without dose adjustment requirements for renal and hepatic impairment, and with no known drug–drug interactions. In our trial, patients with hepatic and/or renal insufficiency (including patients on dialysis) responded just as well as ICU patients overall, further supporting the potential value of anidulafungin in patients with organ dysfunction. Even though all patients received concomitant medications, the tolerability of anidulafungin was excellent.

Our study included a significant proportion (about one-third) of C/IC patients with deep-tissue infection. This proportion is considerably larger than in previous echinocandin trials in C/IC, including post hoc analyses in ICU patients, and supports the efficacy of anidulafungin for treating invasive candidiasis as well as candidaemia. Also noteworthy is that anidulafungin was just as effective against C. parapsilosis as against other species. This particular pathogen has somewhat higher echinocandin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) than other Candida species, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The treatment response for C. tropicalis was lower than for other Candida species and also lower than reported previously with anidulafungin for C. tropicalis. However, our sample size for this subpopulation was small. The observed species distribution matched what would be expected from a pan-European study and MICs were similar to those reported previously.

For patients from birth to 3 months postnatal age, and gestational age less than 30 weeks, a loading dose of 35-mg/kg on the first day followed by 9-mg/kg once daily is recommended. For patients from birth to 3 months postnatal age and gestational age 30 weeks and above, a loading dose of 35-mg/kg on the first day followed by 12-mg/kg once daily is recommended.

Cryptococcal meningitis: For the treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis, the recommended dosage is 12 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 6 mg/kg once daily. A dosage of 12 mg/kg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. For suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in pediatric patients with AIDS, the recommended dose of fluconazole is 6 mg/kg once daily.

Dosage In Patients With Impaired Renal Function:

Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. There is no need to adjust single dose therapy for vaginal candidiasis because of impaired renal function. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of fluconazole, an initial loading dose of 50 mg to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following summary:

Coccidioidal meningitis (CM) — primary treatment recommends fluconazole 400–1200 mg orally daily for most patients with normal renal function (strong, moderate), and there is no role for a dose < 400 mg daily in adults without substantial renal impairment; some experts prefer itraconazole 200 mg 2–4 times daily but this requires closer monitoring for absorption and has more drug–drug interactions than fluconazole. Opinion varies on whether to give an initial daily dose of 400 mg or doses of 800–1200 mg every 24 hours, and itraconazole has also been used as primary therapy, usually as 200 mg every 12 hours, with fatty food and an acidic beverage to increase absorption. Intravenous AmB deoxycholate was not shown to be efficacious for CNS infection, whereas intrathecal AmB is commonly utilized as rescue therapy in azole failures; therapy is often initiated with low doses that are gradually increased, and if the disease begins to remit, de-escalation can be attempted.

Use in Patients with Renal Impairment, Hepatic Impairment, and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation

Data on the PK of LAmB in patient groups with impaired renal function or those treated with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are extremely limited. According to the prescribing information and summary of product information, dose adjustment is not required in patients with renal failure. However, little information is available on how renal failure impacts the PK of LAmB. A single patient receiving hemodialysis was included in the previously mentioned study in critically ill patients, and a few case reports suggest that LAmB is not removed by renal replacement therapy. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients and in different forms of renal replacement therapies.

Similar to renal impairment, it is not clear whether changes in hepatic function affect the clearance of LAmB, despite hepatic side effects having been reported in the literature and being listed in the prescribing information. A cumulative rise in AmB plasma concentrations has been observed in cases of acute liver transplant failure, and failure of the liver, as a major component of the reticuloendothelial system, may cause changes in the disposition of the compound; however, the clinical relevance of this has not been well studied up to this point.

More PK investigation is also needed in those who are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Potential adsorption to the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation tubing can be expected because of the lipophilic nature of AmB.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117MqhjM]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Table 6 — renal insufficiency dosing principles for opportunistic infection drugs explain that individuals with reduced renal function are at risk of drug accumulation and concentration-dependent toxicities when taking medications primarily excreted by the kidneys, and that dosage adjustments are based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but CrCl and eGFR are not interchangeable and may yield differing results. Renal clearance is only one of several pharmacokinetic parameters influencing drug disposition, and alterations in volume of distribution or reduction in oral absorption can impact concentrations; reduced renal clearance may necessitate a dose reduction, whereas increased volume of distribution or impaired oral absorption might require a dose increase to achieve therapeutic concentrations. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), if available and appropriate, allows the clinician to make informed, individualized decisions leading to more precise dose adjustments than those based on estimated CrCl or eGFR, and when TDM is desired, clinicians should contact their clinical laboratory to determine assay availability and turnaround time.

An important observation from this study was the variation in doses of fluconazole used (Table 1). In particular, use of a "standard" 400-mg daily dose was common, which when converted to a mg/kg dose, commonly fell below the 6 mg/kg recommended dose (with 12 mg/kg loading dose), which was then associated with not achieving the PK/PD target (Figure 1). Although a 50% dose reduction is recommended in patients with CrCL < 50 ml/min, neither these patients with renal dysfunction nor those with normal renal function had a median dose in line with the recommended dose. Of note, only two (20%) patients, both with CrCL < 50 ml/min, received the recommended weight-based fluconazole dose, and both attained the target exposure. Our data support observations from previous studies, which have demonstrated that suboptimal dosing with fluconazole is prevalent. Moreover, as shown in Figure 1, a clear association exists between the mg/kg dose administered and attainment of a PK/PD target supporting individualized weight-based dosing. Indeed, the use of the standard 400-mg dose appears to result in suboptimal exposure, suggesting that a "one dose fits all" approach for fluconazole is flawed. It follows that in some patients with higher body weight, doses higher than the standard 400 mg are required. In line with this, the use of loading doses may help the early achievement of PK/PD targets for fluconazole. Toxicity concerns should not dissuade clinicians from more-aggressive doses because fluconazole is a very-well-tolerated drug with much higher doses successfully used without adverse effects.

### Rezafungin in special populations with candidaemia and / or invasive candidiasis [^11299MvP]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Achieving and maintaining therapeutic drug exposures with antifungals can be challenging in special patient populations, such as those with organ dysfunction (liver or kidney) or obesity, or elderly patients, due to dose-exposure relationships and potential drug-drug interactions. Dose adjustments may be needed in these populations to maintain therapeutic efficacy and/or prevent toxicity. We reviewed specific dosing considerations for antifungals in special populations with candidaemia and/or invasive candidiasis, focusing on those relating to echinocandins (based on prescribing information), and then explored the utility of the second-generation echinocandin rezafungin in treating these populations (based on currently available data identified from a PubMed and congress abstract search). Available data showed that echinocandins may sometimes require dosing modifications for special populations with candidaemia/invasive candidiasis, primarily due to decreases in pharmacokinetic exposures. Rezafungin appears to be suitable for use in a variety of special populations without the need for dose modifications based on available data, including patients with organ dysfunction or obesity, and elderly and critically ill patients. Further research is needed in populations where rezafungin data are not available including children, people living with HIV, patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and those with underlying neurological conditions.

### Treatment with echinocandins during continuous renal replacement therapy [^116Ndi94]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The study by Hirata and colleagues also has some methodological flaws. First, their data came from only three patients, and each of these apparently received different doses of micafungin. Moreover, replacement and dialysis flow varied based on the requirements of each patient. Finally and most importantly, the authors do not report how long the filters had been in use at the time of micafungin infusion or the number of doses administered before the concentration of the drug was determined.

### Diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis in the ICU: an updated approach to an old enemy [^112yi2zK]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

There are three main groups of antifungals: the azoles, the polyenes, and the echinocandins. The selection of an antifungal regimen is based on multiple factors, including epidemiological data, patient characteristics, hospital setting, fungal strain, site of infection, and safety profiles of the antifungal agents. Although different antifungals can show comparable efficacy in treating candidemia, their differences in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) (including fungistatic versus fungicidal activity, need for dose adjustment in case of hepatic or renal failure and drug–drug interactions), toxicity, and selection pressure remain significant and can affect the clinical outcome of fragile patient populations, such as the critically ill. Specific guidelines are therefore available to help direct optimal antifungal choices. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines no longer consider fluconazole the drug of choice for invasive candidiasis, and endorse the use of echinocandins as first-line empiric treatment. The rationale for this statement is that, compared with fluconazole, echinocandins show a broader spectrum of activity, fungicidal activity, an excellent safety profile, and fewer drug–drug interactions. The recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines also recommend echinocandins for initial therapy. All three available echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) penetrate well into the biofilm formed on vascular devices. Nevertheless, fluconazole remains a well-known and well-tolerated antifungal with a significantly lower cost compared with the echinocandins and may still be of value in clinically stable patients who have had no recent azole exposure or have known fluconazole-sensitive organisms.

### Differential association of fluconazole dose and dose / MIC ratio with mortality in patients with Candida albicans and non-albicans bloodstream infection [^112D4yza]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Targeting fluconazole therapy to achieve predefined pharmacodynamic goals has been suggested as a means of optimizing the treatment of patients with candidaemia. However, data regarding species-specific dosing targets are inconclusive. We retrospectively analysed a cohort of 75 adult patients with Candida bloodstream infection (BSI) who received initial treatment with fluconazole for ≥ 48 h (36 Candida albicans and 39 non-albicans Candida (NAC)). Fluconazole dose, the dose/MIC ratio and the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24)/MIC ratio were determined for each patient, and classification and regression tree analysis was used to determine breakpoints for significant interactions with 30-day survival. Both fluconazole exposure parameters and patient-related and disease-related variables were assessed in univariable and multivariable survival models. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 32% (44% and 21% for C. albicans and NAC, respectively). An average fluconazole dose of > 200 mg/day, a dose/MIC ratio of > 400 and an AUC24/MIC ratio of > 400 were associated with a higher 30-day survival rate and better microbiological response in patients with C. albicans BSI but not in those with NAC BSI. Baseline chronic kidney disease was a risk factor for fluconazole underdosing and mortality. Severity of sepsis (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) was the only significant predictor of death in patients with NAC BSI. We conclude that, although pharmacodynamic target-directed fluconazole dosing may help to optimize outcomes for patients with C. albicans BSI, additional studies are needed to define the role of fluconazole in the treatment of NAC BSI.

Clinical data collection

Admission demographic and clinical characteristics were collected prospectively, including age, sex, height, weight, admission details, and severity of illness (APACHE II and III scores or SAPS II score). Additionally, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, albumin concentrations, serum creatinine concentrations, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations, AST/ALT ratios, and information on whether patients were undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and receiving vasopressors/inotropes were collected on each sampling occasion. The site of infection (if applicable) was recorded, along with any identified fungi and their susceptibility from collected microbiology samples. Clinical outcomes and 30-day mortality were also documented. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the treating clinician and categorized as either clinical cure, defined as either improvement (a marked or moderate reduction in severity and/or number of signs and symptoms of infection) or resolution (disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the infection)–, or clinical failure (insufficient lessening of the signs and symptoms of infection to qualify as improvement, including death or indeterminate). Antifungal data, including the antifungal agent, date the study antifungal commenced, date of occasion, dose number, dose administered, frequency, route of administration, infusion duration (when applicable), dosing time, and sampling time points were documented.

Pharmacokinetic analysis

The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets used in this study are stated in electronic supplementary table 2. Where available, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the identified fungus was used; otherwise, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) epidemiologic cut-off values (ECOFFs) were applied. Where no fungi were identified, we conservatively used the highest MIC for a pathogen susceptible to the antifungal. The area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC 0–24) was estimated using noncompartmental in Phoenix WinNonlin™ version 8.3.5.340. Concentrations from the first (A) and last (C) samples were considered as Cmax and Cmin, respectively.
