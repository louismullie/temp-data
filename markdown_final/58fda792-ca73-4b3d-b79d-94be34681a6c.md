82 year olf female with normal hgb and hct with MCV 105

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate an 82-year-old woman with normal hemoglobin/hematocrit but an MCV of 105 fL, i.e., macrocytosis without anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this represents true versus spurious macrocytosis. Then, I should distinguish megaloblastic from non-megaloblastic patterns on the smear. Next, I need to check common etiologies in older adults: B12 and folate status, thyroid and liver disease, renal inflammation, alcohol, smoking, medications, and reticulocytosis from hemolysis or recovery. Finally, I should consider red flags that would prompt evaluation for myelodysplastic syndrome and outline a pragmatic testing and follow-up plan [^111bDP7o] [^113HMPXu] [^1123nFSh].

> Wait, let me verify that this is true macrocytosis and not an artifact. I should repeat the CBC on a fresh EDTA sample, obtain a reticulocyte count, and review a peripheral smear to exclude spuriously elevated MCV from reticulocytosis or cold agglutinins; large reticulocytes and red cell agglutination can falsely raise automated MCV, and the smear will show the actual red cell size and morphology, so I need to ensure the macrocytosis is real before proceeding [^111etdk1] [^111bDP7o].

> Let me place the value in context. An MCV of 105 fL is definite macrocytosis, but hold on, I initially thought "macrocytic anemia"; however, the hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal, so this is macrocytosis without anemia, which in older adults can reflect early nutritional deficiency, medication effect, alcohol/liver disease, hypothyroidism, hemolysis with compensatory reticulocytosis, or early myelodysplastic changes; importantly, in older patients, MCV ≥ 96 fL is a red flag that should heighten attention to dysplasia and other marrow processes, although marrow biopsy is guided by accompanying cytopenias or smear abnormalities, so I should double-check the full blood counts and smear carefully [^1123nFSh] [^113HMPXu].

> Next, I should review the smear to differentiate megaloblastic from non-megaloblastic macrocytosis, because that will prioritize testing. Macro-ovalocytes with hypersegmented neutrophils point toward B12 or folate deficiency, whereas round macrocytes without hypersegmentation suggest alcohol, liver disease, hypothyroidism, reticulocytosis, or medication effects; I need the pathologist's explicit comment on neutrophil segmentation and red-cell shape to anchor this branch point [^111bDP7o] [^113CeDTX].

> I will now examine nutritional and metabolic deficiencies. I should check serum B12, with methylmalonic acid and homocysteine if B12 is borderline, because B12 deficiency in older adults is common and may present with macrocytosis even before anemia; I need to ensure I do not give folate alone before excluding or treating B12 deficiency to avoid neurological harm, and if folate deficiency remains suspected with normal serum folate, RBC folate can be considered after ruling out cobalamin deficiency, though availability varies, so I should confirm local lab capacity first [^113AAYBz] [^1123nFSh] [^113zezNq] [^115RPuGb] [^111FUsk2] [^1135fGzx] [^111smUWL].

> Hold on, I should also verify non-megaloblastic causes that are common in this age group. I need to check TSH for hypothyroidism, liver enzymes for hepatic disease, review alcohol intake, assess renal function and CRP for inflammation, and, importantly, ask about and document active smoking because smoking is independently associated with higher MCV; these checks help me avoid premature closure on a single cause [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh] [^11185Ssu].

> Let me consider medications next, because iatrogenic macrocytosis is frequent. I should review for hydroxyurea, methotrexate, azathioprine, zidovudine, valproate, phenytoin, and antifolate antibiotics such as trimethoprim; if present, I need to correlate timing and dose, monitor counts closely, and adjust or discontinue as appropriate in collaboration with the prescriber, given risks of marrow suppression with agents like azathioprine and folate antagonism with trimethoprim [^117QZNk1] [^1145hSdo] [^115ZZVLp].

> But wait, what if the reticulocyte count is elevated with normal hemoglobin? That could indicate compensated hemolysis or recovery from a recent bleed; I should check LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin, because reticulocytosis itself increases MCV and can explain macrocytosis without anemia, so I must correlate hemolysis labs with the smear and retic count before attributing macrocytosis to other etiologies [^111bDP7o] [^111etdk1].

> I need to ensure I recognize when to escalate to marrow evaluation. If the smear shows dysplasia, blasts, or if there are additional cytopenias, progressive macrocytosis, or other red flags (e.g. MCV > 96 fL with abnormal counts), bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and, if indicated, next-generation sequencing should be considered to evaluate for myelodysplastic syndrome or other marrow disorders; in stable patients without red flags, immediate biopsy is usually not required, but I should verify stability over time [^1123nFSh] [^113HMPXu].

> Let me summarize a pragmatic plan. First, repeat CBC, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear to confirm true macrocytosis and classify morphology. Next, obtain B12 with reflex methylmalonic acid and homocysteine if borderline, defer folate until B12 deficiency is excluded, then assess serum folate or RBC folate if warranted, alongside TSH, liver panel, creatinine/eGFR, and CRP; review alcohol, smoking, and medications, and check hemolysis labs if reticulocytes are elevated. Finally, if the evaluation is unrevealing, counts remain stable, and the smear is benign, monitor; if cytopenias or dysplasia emerge, proceed to marrow studies promptly, keeping in mind that age-related thresholds for escalation are lower in older adults due to higher pretest probability of clonal marrow disease [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh] [^113HMPXu].

In an 82-year-old woman with normal hemoglobin and hematocrit and an MCV of 105 fL, the most likely causes are **early myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)**, **medication effects** (hydroxyurea, methotrexate, azathioprine, valproic acid, zidovudine) [^1145hSdo], or **alcohol use** [^117QZNk1] [^113AAYBz]. Less common causes include **hypothyroidism, liver disease, or reticulocytosis** [^111bDP7o] [^117QZNk1]. Evaluate with a focused history, medication review, assessment of alcohol use and nutrition, and laboratory tests including B12, folate, TSH, LFTs, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear [^113HMPXu]. If unexplained or persistent, consider bone marrow biopsy to assess for MDS or other marrow disorders [^1123nFSh].

## Differential diagnosis of isolated macrocytosis

Macrocytosis without anemia is common in older adults and often reflects **early or mild disease, medication effects, or alcohol use**. The differential includes:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Less common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Nutritional deficiencies | - Vitamin B12 deficiency <br/> - Folate deficiency [^117QZNk1] | - Copper deficiency [^111bDP7o] [^113AAYBz] |
| Medications | - Hydroxyurea <br/> - Methotrexate <br/> - Azathioprine <br/> - Valproic acid <br/> - Zidovudine [^117QZNk1] [^1145hSdo] | ∅ |
| Alcohol use | - Chronic alcohol consumption [^111bDP7o] [^117QZNk1] | ∅ |
| Bone marrow disorders | - Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [^111bDP7o] [^113AAYBz] | - Aplastic anemia <br/> - Pure red cell aplasia [^113kg9kP] [^113iLuTB] |
| Endocrine disorders | - Hypothyroidism [^111bDP7o] [^117QZNk1] | ∅ |
| Liver disease | - Chronic liver disease <br/> - Cirrhosis [^111bDP7o] [^114hL7Ur] | ∅ |
| Hemolysis/reticulocytosis | - Hemolytic anemia <br/> - Recent blood loss [^1123nFSh] | ∅ |

## Clinical significance of isolated macrocytosis in elderly patients

Isolated macrocytosis in the elderly often signals **early or mild disease, medication effects, or alcohol use**. It can precede anemia in MDS or other marrow disorders and may reflect subclinical B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, or liver disease [^117QZNk1] [^113AAYBz]. Persistent macrocytosis warrants evaluation to detect treatable causes and prevent progression.

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

A structured evaluation includes a **history and physical examination** with review of medications, alcohol use, nutrition, and symptoms of anemia, neuropathy, hypothyroidism, or liver disease [^113HMPXu]. Laboratory testing should include CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smear, vitamin B12 and folate levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and liver function tests (LFTs) [^111bDP7o]. If hemolysis is suspected, obtain lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin. Additional tests include methylmalonic acid and homocysteine when B12/folate levels are borderline [^113zezNq] [^113AAYBz]. Consider bone marrow biopsy if macrocytosis is persistent or unexplained, especially with cytopenias or dysplasia [^1123nFSh].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**.

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Treat B12/folate deficiency with supplementation [^113AAYBz].
- **Medication-induced macrocytosis**: Adjust or stop the offending drug when possible [^117QZNk1] [^1145hSdo].
- **Alcohol-related macrocytosis**: Counsel on cessation and provide support [^117QZNk1].
- **Bone marrow disorders**: Refer to hematology; consider supportive care, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or hypomethylating agents for MDS [^113AAYBz].
- **Endocrine or liver disease**: Treat the underlying condition [^113AAYBz].

---

## Prognosis and clinical outcomes

Prognosis depends on the **cause** and response to treatment. Nutritional or medication-related macrocytosis often resolves with therapy [^117QZNk1]. Persistent macrocytosis, especially with cytopenias or dysplasia, may indicate MDS or other marrow disorders and requires close follow-up and hematology referral [^113AAYBz].

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). Low credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory, such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10⁹/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear, or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate potential causes.

### Imuran [^1145hSdo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Severe cytopenias, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemias (such as macrocytic anemia), and pancytopenia, may occur in patients treated with Imuran. Severe bone marrow suppression is also possible and is often dose-related. These hematologic toxicities can be more severe in renal transplant patients whose homograft is undergoing rejection.

It is recommended that patients on Imuran undergo complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months, and then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary. There is a risk of delayed hematologic suppression. A prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in, or persistently low leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression. Notably, leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect; therefore, the dose should not be intentionally increased to lower the white blood cell count.

- **TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency**: Patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency may be at increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity when receiving conventional doses of Imuran. Death associated with pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine. In cases of severe myelosuppression, consider evaluating for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency. It may be necessary to consider alternative therapy for patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis.

When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Other possible etiologies include hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders), which are some of the more common causes.

### Active smoking and macrocytosis in the general population: Two population-based cohort studies [^11185Ssu]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes, is a highly prevalent phenomenon in adult individuals. MCV is the measurement of the average volume of red blood cells, and macrocytosis is defined as an MCV exceeding 100 fL. Currently, in textbooks and guidelines, a myriad of causes are mentioned for macrocytosis, with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, alcohol use, myeloid dysplastic syndromes, and liver disease as the most prominent ones.

In the 1970s, several papers reported a positive association between smoking and MCV. However, this has not resulted in the inclusion of cigarette smoking as an important cause of macrocytosis in textbooks and guidelines. Hence, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between smoking — assessed by both a questionnaire and 24-hour urinary cotinine excretion as an objective measurement of nicotine exposure — and MCV in two large population-based cohorts.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10^9/L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells, and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio of 2:1.

### Lysinuric protein intolerance presenting as pancytopenia and splenomegaly mimicking acute leukaemia: a case report [^112zht66]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Lysinuric protein intolerance is a rare inherited metabolic disease due to autosomal recessive mutations of the SLC7A7 gene. Affected patients commonly present with protein-rich food intolerance, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, muscle hypotonia, and lung involvement due to impaired intestinal absorption and excessive urinary excretion of dibasic amino acids. Presentation with splenomegaly and cytopenia without other features has not been reported. Here we report a Sri Lankan girl with lysinuric protein intolerance presenting with pancytopenia and splenomegaly mimicking acute leukaemia.

- **Case presentation**: A two years and six months old Sri Lankan girl presented with persistent pancytopenia following a viral illness. She was asymptomatic without vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or irritability. Physical examination revealed pallor and isolated firm splenomegaly of 2 cm. Growth parameters and other system examinations were normal. A full blood count revealed anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The blood picture showed a mixture of hypochromic microcytic and normochromic normocytic red cells with occasional pencil cells and macrocytes. Bone marrow examination was normal except for occasional megaloblasts; however, serum vitamin B12 and red blood cell folate were normal. The metabolic screen showed a high anion gap compensated metabolic acidosis, high lactate, and ketosis. Genetic mutation analysis using whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants of the SLC7A7 gene, confirming the diagnosis of lysinuric protein intolerance.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. Hematological abnormalities [^112bHCyt]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by macrocytic anemia, with the presence of megaloblasts on bone marrow biopsy. It is most often caused by B12 or folic acid deficiency due to malabsorption or an inadequate diet. Inherited disorders of cobalamin metabolism that lead to megaloblastic anemia in infancy or early childhood include transcobalamin II deficiency, Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome, and gastric intrinsic factor deficiency.

Megaloblastic anemia can be diagnosed on a blood film with hypersegmented neutrophils and oval macrocytosis. There is often unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and a markedly elevated LDH, which can lead to confusion with a hemolytic picture, but the reticulocyte count is not elevated. Inherited disorders of folate metabolism, such as dihydrofolate reductase deficiency and proton-coupled folate transport deficiency, present with similar hematological features.

Most cases of megaloblastic anemia, even in childhood, are due to a deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate, due to malabsorption (as in pernicious anemia) or diet. In the case of breastfed infants, if the mother is deficient in vitamin B12, the infant may also be at risk of deficiency. However, a high index of suspicion is required for those presenting at a young age. Investigations should include serum total vitamin B12, active vitamin B12 (holotranscobalamin), serum and red cell folic acid level, total homocysteine, urinary organic acids including methylmalonic and orotic acid, amino acids, and possibly methylmalonic acid. It is increasingly recognized that total serum vitamin B12 level…

### How I manage acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults [^116QKnvN]. Blood (2021). High credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder with multiple etiologies. The multifaceted nature of this disease is emphasized by the variety of concomitant clinical features. Classic idiopathic presentation aside, prompt recognition of pathogenetic clues is important because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications. As a consequence, treatment of PRCA is diverse and strictly dependent on the presented clinical scenario.

We propose a series of clinical vignettes that showcase instructive representative situations derived from our routine clinical practice. Using these illustrative clinical cases, we review the diagnostic workup needed for a precise diagnosis and the currently available therapeutic options, discussing their applications concerning the various PRCA-associated conditions and individual patients' characteristics. Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm that may offer guidance for personalized therapeutic recommendations.

### How I diagnose non-thalassemic microcytic anemias [^112AkgfE]. Seminars in Hematology (2015). High credibility.

Microcytic anemia can be caused by various conditions, including acquired sideroblastic anemia, hereditary sideroblastic anemia, beta thalassemia minor, alpha thalassemia trait, anemia of chronic inflammation, hereditary atransferrinemia, iron deficiency anemia, and lead poisoning.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis in a patient with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia [^111xC6aD]. Blood (2000). Low credibility.

Herein is described the case of a young woman presenting with iron overload and macrocytosis. The initial diagnosis was hereditary hemochromatosis. Severe anemia developed following a few phlebotomies, and she was also found to have congenital dyserythropoietic anemia that, though not completely typical, resembled type II. Only genetic testing allowed the definition of the coexistence of the two diseases, both responsible for the iron overload. This report points out the need to consider congenital dyserythropoietic anemia in patients with hemochromatosis and unexplained macrocytosis, and conversely, to check for the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and severe iron overload. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in a patient affected by congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^112rJeco]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Peripheral blood smear findings (P‐IIIA)**: The peripheral blood smear exhibited low levels of polychromasia, indicating suboptimal reticulocytosis. There was mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes, occasional hypochromic red cells, and notable ovalocytes.

- **Bone marrow aspirate findings (P‐IIIA)**: The bone marrow aspirate showed erythroid hyperplasia with a mild left shift. Rare but notable signs of dyserythropoiesis were present, including binucleated or multinucleated erythroblasts (thick arrows), karyorrhexis (arrowhead), and even occasional cytoplasmic bridges (thin arrow).

- **Peripheral blood smear findings (P‐II)**: The peripheral blood smear showed low levels of polychromasia, notable anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes, occasional hypochromic red cells, frequent ovalocytes, and several stomatocytes.

### New sporadic case of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III in an aged woman: Detailed description of ultrastructural findings [^113b9yLa]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a new case of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type III. This least common type of CDA was diagnosed at the age of 59 in a 70-year-old woman who suffered from a young age from mild macrocytic anemia, while the long follow-up since diagnosis documented a benign clinical course. No family history of blood diseases was obtained, and no anemia was documented in the medical records of any of her four children.

The bone marrow (BM) examination on light microscopy revealed severe erythroid hyperplasia with the presence of giant multinucleated erythroblasts. Ultrastructural examination of the BM disclosed the presence of many large multinucleated erythroblasts bearing a variety of ultrastructural findings, including nuclear clefts, autophagic vacuoles, iron-loaded mitochondria, and intracytoplasmic myelin figures. Moreover, extensive hyperlobulation of the nucleus and partial loss of the nuclear membrane with "spilling" of nuclear material into the adjacent cytoplasm was also noted in some of the erythroblasts. These last two findings have not been previously described in CDA III.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^116sTZky]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

When evaluating the cause of microcytosis, a longitudinal evaluation can be very helpful. The timing and rate of decline of the MCV can be informative in determining the aetiology. Our patient's microcytosis appears to have developed over the course of almost 4 years. His decline in MCV was slow but consistent, beginning at an MCV of roughly 90 and decreasing to a nadir of 68.5. This very gradual decline in MCV suggests a more insidious and chronic process than iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease. It remains unclear whether the timeline of the development of microcytosis is connected with progression in mutation burden.

- **Learning points**: Microcytosis has several common causes, but an unremarkable initial workup may warrant a more thorough investigation. Acquired microcytosis has been associated with certain haematological disorders, most commonly myelodysplastic syndromes and most commonly affecting production of alpha-haemoglobin. Elements of the timeline and severity of microcytosis can offer clues to its aetiology. Microcytosis is caused by increased nucleic acid synthesis and progenitor divisions relative to haemoglobin production.

### Hereditary myopathies associated with hematological abnormalities [^1132eM56]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected hereditary muscle disease can be challenging. Clinicians rely largely on clinical history and examination features, with additional serological, electrodiagnostic, radiologic, histopathologic, and genetic investigations assisting in definitive diagnosis. Hematological testing is inexpensive and widely available, but frequently overlooked in the hereditary myopathy evaluation. Hematological abnormalities are infrequently encountered in this setting; however, their presence provides a valuable clue, helps refine the differential diagnosis, tailors further investigation, and assists in the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance.

A diverse spectrum of hematological abnormalities is associated with hereditary myopathies, including anemias, leukocyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia. Rhabdomyolysis in certain glycolytic enzymopathies co-occurs with hemolytic anemia, often chronic and mild in phosphofructokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase deficiencies, or acute and fever-associated in aldolase-A and triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Sideroblastic anemia, commonly severe, accompanies congenital-to-childhood onset mitochondrial myopathies including Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome and mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia phenotypes.

Congenital megaloblastic macrocytic anemia and mitochondrial dysfunction characterize SFXN4-related myopathy. Neutropenia, chronic or cyclical, with recurrent infections, infantile-to-childhood onset skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy are typical.

### Jak2 unmutated erythrocytosis: Current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by hemoglobin/hematocrit levels above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former results from either a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm, as in polycythemia vera (PV), or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis, where an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume, thus masked by normal hemoglobin/hematocrit levels. Similarly, in situations with normal hemoglobin/hematocrit and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized.

Conversely, apparent erythrocytosis may result from a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values that exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-, and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution. However, upon evaluating its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis, elevated RCM was observed in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% of patients with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In this particular study, RCM significantly correlated with both hematocrit and hemoglobin levels.

### Images from the haematologica atlas of hematologic cytology: parvovirus-induced pure red cell aplasia [^113iLuTB]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare disorder characterized by normochromic-normocytic or normochromic-macrocytic anemia, marked reticulocytopenia, and almost complete absence of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. In most cases, the granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages are normal. This disorder includes congenital and acquired conditions. The most common form of acute PRCA in older children and adults is due to parvovirus B19 infection. The virus invades and destroys red cell progenitors, and the aplasia is terminated when neutralizing antibodies develop.

In immunocompromised patients, parvovirus B19 infection can cause a chronic form of PRCA. Distinctive morphological features of parvovirus-induced PRCA are illustrated in the figure showing bone marrow smears from a heart transplant recipient presenting with severe normochromic normocytic anemia, a low reticulocyte count, normal leukocyte, differential and platelet counts, and high levels of erythropoietin:

- **Figure details**:
	- (A and B) There is marked hypoplasia of the erythroblastic lineage with almost total absence of maturing erythroblasts. Note the atypical hyperbasophilic giant cells with very large, prominent nucleoli, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and blebs. These giant cells are proerythroblasts with morphological features pathognomonic for parvovirus B19 infection.
	- **Panel C** shows an enormous proerythroblast with numerous nuclear inclusions.
	- (D) The atypical erythroblasts show an abnormal, very strongly positive periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction. The diagnosis of parvovirus B19-induced PRCA was confirmed by immunocy.

The study analyzes a three-generation family cohort afflicted with macrocytic anemia and iron overload. These conditions were observed across several family members, providing a unique opportunity to study the genetic basis of these disorders. Advanced genetic testing techniques were employed to identify potential causative mutations. The findings have implications for better understanding the hereditary aspects of this hematological anomaly and may help inform future therapeutic strategies.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC, particularly the RBC indices and the peripheral blood smear, along with the history and the physical examination, can help organize the focus of further evaluations and ultimately minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non-mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are:

- **Impaired DNA synthesis**: This occurs in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony.
- **Altered red cell hydration**: This increases cell volume.
- **Altered composition of the lipid bilayer**: Changes in the RBC membrane can also lead to macrocytosis.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions or malabsorption syndromes like short-gut syndrome.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^117F7MuX]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis occurs in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients; however, its significance is unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and distribution of macrocytosis, to identify its clinical associations, and to determine if macrocytosis is associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of 150 stable, adult CHD patients followed for nine months. Macrocytosis was defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) > 97 fl. We analyzed MCV as a continuous variable, in tertiles and using a cutoff point of 102 fl.

- **Results**: The mean MCV was 99.1 ± 6.4 fl (range 66–120 fl), and MCV was normally distributed. A total of 92 (61%) patients had an MCV > 97 fl and 45 (30%) > 102 fl. Patients were not deficient in B12 or folate in the available data, and three patients with an MCV > 102 fl had hypothyroidism. In logistic regression analysis, an MCV > 102 fl was associated with a higher Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index (CACI) and higher ratios of darbepoetin alfa to hemoglobin (Hb), [(weekly darbepoetin alfa dose in micrograms per kg body weight / Hb in g/L)×1000]. There were 23 deaths at nine months in this study. Unadjusted, MCV > 102 fl was associated with mortality (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.42–7.39, P = 0.005). Adjusting for the CACI, an MCV > 102 fl was still associated with mortality (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.07–5.71, P = 0.035).

- **Conclusions**: Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients. Future studies will need to be conducted to confirm this finding.

### Hydroxocobalamin [^112AgbBk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Warnings**: Avoid the intravenous route. Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B12, although it may improve vitamin B12-deficient megaloblastic anemia. Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B12-deficient megaloblastic anemia could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage.

- **Therapeutic response considerations**: A blunted or impeded therapeutic response to vitamin B12 may be due to conditions such as infection, uremia, or drugs with bone marrow suppressant properties, such as chloramphenicol, and concurrent iron or folic acid deficiency.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (e.g. antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review. The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and leukemia disorders.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^117299xv]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

MCV showed good specificity but low sensitivity in diagnosing reduced iron stores. Thus, MCV is a useful tool for clinicians to strengthen suspicion of iron deficiency, but a normal or high MCV does not rule out iron deficiency. In our patient population, underlying bone marrow diseases can increase the MCV and thus reduce its utility. In the general population, MCV is more accurate. However, the low sensitivity of MCV is an issue even in more general populations; in older age, most patients with IDA can have normal MCVs.

The diagnostic efficacy of a test is often measured by its sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC. However, in clinical practice, the PPV and NPV are the most relevant markers. PPV and NPV can be calculated for a cutoff with known sensitivity and specificity if the pre-probability is known. In a clinical setting, the pre-probability is estimated from the patient's background information (e.g. age, sex, medication, chronic medical conditions), symptoms, clinical tests, and other diagnostic tests. For example, an 18-year-old female in the United States has approximately a 35% pre-probability of iron deficiency; and if she is known to have heavy menstrual bleeding and fatigue, the pre-probability is even higher. To illustrate the pre-probability's significance, we presented PPV and NPV in a novel way in a figure as a continuous function of different pre-probabilities (Figure 5; shown in a linear scale in supplemental Figure 2; supplemental Table 9). We show that ruling in iron deficiency with 95% PPV is feasible at least for ferritin.

### Rationale for revision and proposed changes of the WHO diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis [^114UXnEC]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The key diagnostic issue in polycythemia vera (PV) is which red cell parameters, such as hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, may be more conveniently used as a surrogate for an increased red cell mass as measured by the isotope test. According to the 2007/2008 updated WHO classification, the first major diagnostic criterion requires one of the following four components: Hb level > 18.5 g/dl in men and > 16.5 g/dl in women; red cell mass that is > 25% above the mean normal predicted; or an Hb level > 17 g/dl in men (> 15 g/dl in women) associated with a sustained increase of ⩾2 g/dl from baseline that cannot be attributed to the correction of iron deficiency.

It has been argued that applying these criteria may result in an underdiagnosis of PV by excluding patients with an actual red cell mass that is 25% above the mean predicted value but whose Hb and Hct levels are below the WHO guidelines. Recently, the term masked polycythemia vera (mPV) was re-introduced for JAK2-mutated patients with latent (initial, occult pre-polycythemic) disease manifestations who present with a bone marrow morphology consistent with PV and display persistently raised Hb levels between 16.0 and 18.5 g/dl for men and 15.0 and 16.5 g/dl for women. Subsequently, an Hb level of 16.5 g/dl in men and 16.0 g/dl for women, or in accordance with the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) criteria, an Hct level of 49% in men and 48% in women, was determined to be the optimal cutoff levels for distinguishing JAK2-mutated essential thrombocythemia (ET) from mPV. These data were entered into the new proposal for the WHO guidelines. The clinical relevance of recognizing mPV was demonstrated in a recent study.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Significant issues arise regarding what constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Folic acid [^115RPuGb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, as hematologic remission can occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing neurologic complications to progress, resulting in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia.

- **Drug interactions**: There is evidence that the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin is antagonized by folic acid. A patient whose epilepsy is completely controlled by phenytoin may require increased doses to prevent convulsions if folic acid is given. Folate deficiency may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis, and/or interference with metabolism (e.g. folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate); the administration of anticonvulsants, such as diphenylhydantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption and, especially, alcoholic cirrhosis; and the administration of pyrimethamine and nitrofurantoin. False low serum and red cell folate levels may occur if the patient has been taking antibiotics, such as tetracycline, which suppress the growth of Lactobacillus casei.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^113tHbyY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in the blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population, adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive.

In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease [^115QLxxB]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case highlights the rare occurrence of SCA and SA in a patient. This case also underscores the importance of generating a broad differential diagnosis and the ramifications of anchoring bias, which can lead to delayed diagnosis. While this patient's presentation of anaemia with an increased need for red cell transfusion was thought to be due to SCD, the workup revealed a much less common diagnosis of SA. SA is rare in the general population, and when coupled with anchoring bias related to a well-known cause of anaemia such as SCD, it can lead to a delay in diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of avoiding premature closure when managing common diseases and calls on the clinician to ask, 'What else could it be?'

- **Learning points**: Due to its low prevalence, the diagnosis of sideroblastic anaemias (SA) is often difficult. High suspicion on the part of the clinician and a low threshold for workup of anaemia often aid in the diagnosis of SA. Loss of response to a previously effective long-term treatment of anaemia should raise suspicion of an additional cause of anaemia. A full workup, including peripheral smear, complete blood count with differential, iron studies, ferritin, and reticulocyte count, is warranted when SA is suspected. A bone marrow biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis, and genetic testing should be done if congenital SA is suspected. Workup to identify the cause of SA includes ruling out secondary and acquired causes, genetic testing in the appropriate population, and identifying myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasms-related conditions.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^115UR4K9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old white man with known myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented with worsening leucocytosis and thrombocytosis in the setting of a presumed infection. The patient had been diagnosed two years earlier with an MPN/MDS overlap syndrome, based on characteristic mutations in JAK2, IDH1, and SRSF2. During his evaluation, he was noted to have new microcytosis, with a mean corpuscular volume of approximately 70 fL, down from his baseline of approximately 90 fL. His laboratory workup showed normal iron studies, normal haemoglobin electrophoresis, and no evidence of haemoglobin H or mutations in his ATRX coding region. Without any identifiable cause of his new microcytosis, he was given a presumptive diagnosis of acquired thalassemia in the setting of his unusual MPN/MDS overlap syndrome.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115fQhob]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia in autoimmune gastritis (AIG), with or without pernicious anemia (PA), may present as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, although macrocytic anemia is the classic association. Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, and is most often due to iron and vitamin B12 deficiency.

Gastric acid is vital for enzyme activation and releasing micronutrients from dietary sources. It also plays an essential role in the reduction and absorption of iron. As previously described, vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with AIG can result from parietal cell loss as well as autoantibodies targeting intrinsic factor (IF). IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating its uptake in the terminal ileum.

Iron stores deplete faster than vitamin B12 stores, making iron deficiency anemia an often early manifestation of AIG. Although vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia usually prompt an AIG workup, it should be noted that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should also be evaluated. Anemia diagnosis may be confounded by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism.

A multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients found that nearly 50% had anemia, with certain patient characteristics associated with different anemia patterns. Pernicious anemia was more common in males and older patients, while iron deficiency anemia was more prevalent in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in individuals with and without anemia, aligning with findings from another cohort study.

### Hypersegmented neutrophils and oval macrocytes in the setting of B deficiency and pancytopaenia [^113CeDTX]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a recognized pathology in several populations, with a particular prevalence in an older adult population. We present two cases where vitamin B12 deficiency is the causative factor in marked pancytopaenia. Oval macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils were noted on both peripheral blood samples, which are characteristic findings in macrocytic anaemia due to B12 deficiency. Distinct underlying pathologies were identified in both cases: food-cobalamin malabsorption and pernicious anaemia. Parenteral vitamin B12 supplementation resulted in a marked reticulocytosis and rapid improvement of haematological indices in both cases.

We present this series to serve as a reminder that B12 deficiency can present as life-threatening pancytopaenia. It has multiple underlying pathologies, defined risk populations, and characteristic blood film findings which can guide investigations, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^112Ygq5d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old active duty African American male presented to the emergency room 18 days post-COVID pneumonia infection, complaining of persistent fatigue, weakness, and subjective weight loss. He stated that his initial symptoms of dysgeusia, anosmia, headache, and fever had previously resolved since his initial COVID-positive test. He had no family history of blood disorders and no significant past medical and surgical history. He was not on any medications or supplements at the time of admission.

Initial investigation with a complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin (HGB) of 4.1 g/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 4.1 g/dL, and platelets (PLTs) of 64 × 10(9)/L. His anemia was normocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 95.3) and normochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] 32.0). His leukopenia was lymphocytes predominant (55% lymphocytes, 33% granulocytes, and 6% monocytes). A peripheral smear showed moderate oval macrocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, schistocytes, and atypical lymphocytes, most consistent with a hypocellular sample with dilution. The patient was admitted to the medicine ward for blood transfusion, volume resuscitation, and further workup.

Diagnostic evaluation for hypo-proliferation, hemolysis, and malnutrition was initiated. There was concern for a hemolytic process, so a bilirubin level was obtained, which was elevated at 3.4 mg/dL with indirect bilirubin predominance at 1.8 mg/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated, suggesting hemolytic anemia. However, his reticulocyte index was 0.13, consistent with hypo-prolifera.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who have received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia.

Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Investigation of microcytosis: A comprehensive approach [^111CfBTL]. European Journal of Haematology (1996). High credibility.

Microcytosis can be attributed to a variety of causes, including sideroblastic anemia, vitamin C deficiency, iron deficiency, and heterozygous beta thalassemia. Other causes include homozygous beta thalassemia, dialysis-related aluminum toxicity, vitamin A deficiency, copper deficiency, and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. Additionally, iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 5 are potential factors. Various hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell-thalassemia disease, hemoglobin H disease, hemoglobin E disease, Hemoglobin Bart's, beta thalassemia minor, and alpha thalassemia trait are also associated with microcytosis.

### Diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia [^115scVYY]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of the concept of aplastic anemia (AA) by Paul Ehrlich in 1888, and despite a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in this disease, a clear delimitation among bone marrow failure syndromes is still a matter of debate. The diagnosis of AA can be difficult due to the overlapping morphological characteristics with other bone marrow failure disorders. This paper reviews critical data relevant to the diagnosis of acquired AA and recommends work-out steps and main considerations to determine the severity and characterization of the disease. The diagnostic challenge in differentiating between AA and hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndromes is also addressed. The definition of the response criteria to treatment is part of the diagnostic tasks and is included in this review, along with an overview of novel tools for the diagnosis of AA.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally through laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy. However, in many patients, the etiology is unknown. Evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia.

- **Evaluation for gastrointestinal malignancy**: In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy.

- **Underlying conditions**: Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy.

- **Treatment**: Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require a blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement.

### Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II in a teenager presenting with severe anaemia [^113NWigz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA) type II is a rare disease characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis and mononuclear cytopenia. Patients generally present with extravascular haemolytic anaemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. A female patient in her mid-teens presented with severe anaemia and abdominal distention. Her medical history was significant for the diagnosis of β-thalassaemia intermedia made in her infancy. However, subsequent investigations showed normal reticulocyte counts that were disproportionate to the severity of her anaemia and a negative β-thalassemia mutation analysis, leading to concerns about a specific lineage disorder. A bone marrow trephine showed features typical of CDA type II — erythroid hyperplasia with multiple binucleate erythrocytes. CDA type II has often been mistaken for other congenital or acquired forms of anaemia; this case report intends to raise awareness among clinicians to consider CDA type II as a rare but possible cause of severe anaemia in a teenager with a previous presumptive diagnosis of β-thalassaemia.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^114SzkiY]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis occurs in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients; however, its significance is unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and distribution of macrocytosis, identify its clinical associations, and determine if macrocytosis is associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of 150 stable, adult CHD patients followed for nine months. Macrocytosis was defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) > 97 fl. We analyzed MCV as a continuous variable, in tertiles, and using a cutoff point of 102 fl.

- **Results**: The mean MCV was 99.1 ± 6.4 fl (range 66–120 fl). MCV was normally distributed. Ninety-two (61%) patients had an MCV > 97 fl, and 45 (30%) had an MCV > 102 fl. Patients with available data were not B12 or folate deficient, and three patients with an MCV > 102 fl had hypothyroidism. In a logistic regression analysis, an MCV > 102 fl was associated with a higher Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index (CACI) and higher ratios of darbepoetin alfa to hemoglobin (Hb), calculated as (weekly darbepoetin alfa dose in micrograms per kg body weight / Hb in g/L) × 1000. There were 23 deaths at nine months in this study. Unadjusted MCV > 102 fl was associated with mortality (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.42–7.39, P = 0.005). Adjusting for the CACI, an MCV > 102 fl was still associated with mortality (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.07–5.71, P = 0.035).

- **Conclusions**: Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients. Future studies will need to be conducted to confirm this finding.

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^116vjNHY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition of lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is frequently seen in patients who are already suffering from bone marrow depression and thus may become a comorbidity. Because several different types of chemical agents may be required for test procedures, a large volume of blood could be removed for each set of testing, perhaps 50–60 mL. Often, local and reference laboratories request larger samples than are really necessary to perform a given test and still have some left to perform any required repeat testing. My experience shows that a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Extreme thrombocytosis as a sign of coeliac disease in the elderly: Case report [^114wE5hQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

An increase in the number of blood platelets to over 1,000,000/mm³ in elderly patients is generally considered secondary to a myeloproliferative or neoplastic disease. In this case study, we report on an elderly woman hospitalized for extreme thrombocytosis associated with severe anaemia, later found to be suffering from coeliac disease. The patient, aged 83 years, was hospitalized presenting with fatigue. Laboratory tests showed microcytic hypochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 4 g/dL) and extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count 1,400,000/mm³). Physical examination was normal, except for marked thinness. There was no evidence of macroscopic bleeding from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts.

She had never suffered from gastrointestinal problems and had no family history of gastroenterological diseases. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and histology of the gastric and duodenal mucosa evidenced atrophic gastritis and an adenomatous polyp. The duodenal mucosa showed total villous atrophy, suggesting the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Antiendomysial IgA and anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies were also positive. Colonoscopy was negative. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen was normal, and the spleen was within the normal range. A peripheral blood smear showed no alterations in erythrocyte morphology typical of hyposplenism due to coeliac disease. The platelet count decreased rapidly after blood transfusions, when both serum iron and ferritin levels were still below normal limits. Furthermore, we observed a significant inverse correlation between the platelet count and haemoglobin.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^115WhN3M]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

At its nadir, his MCV was 71.6 fL with an associated red blood cell count of 6.1 million cells/μL, resulting in a Mentzer index of 11.7. Iron studies demonstrated a ferritin of 520 μg/L (normal range 20–300), total iron binding content of 206 μg/dL (normal range 230–400), and iron of 47 μg/dL (normal range 45–160). His serum vitamin B12 and serum folate levels were normal. Serum copper and serum zinc levels were also normal. His comprehensive metabolic panel was normal, including total and indirect bilirubin. Lactate dehydrogenase was 511 U/L. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 13 mm/hour (normal range 0–13). Abdominal imaging revealed splenomegaly, which would be expected in the setting of his MPN, and no other abnormalities.

The peripheral blood smear confirmed his microcytosis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed a very mildly elevated hemoglobin A2 but was otherwise normal. Gene sequencing of his hemoglobin alpha chains did not reveal any abnormalities. The mutational analysis was repeated and revealed the presence of an additional mutation in the ASXL1 gene that was not detected during his initial profiling. Notably, no mutation in the ATRX coding sequence was identified.

The patient was treated for his presumed infection and discharged home after 6 days.

A 59-year-old white man with known myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented with worsening leucocytosis and thrombocytosis in the setting of a presumed infection. The patient had been diagnosed 2 years earlier with an MPN/MDS overlap syndrome, based on characteristic mutations in JAK2, IDH1, and SRSF2. During his evaluation, he was noted to have new microcytosis, with a mean corpuscular volume of ~70 fL, down from his baseline of ~90 fL. His laboratory workup showed normal iron studies, normal haemoglobin electrophoresis, and no evidence of haemoglobin H or mutations in his ATRX coding region. Without any identifiable cause of his new microcytosis, he was given a presumptive diagnosis of acquired thalassemia in the setting of his unusual MPN/MDS overlap syndrome.

### Anemia in the elderly [^114sBarU]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia should not be accepted as an inevitable consequence of aging. A cause is found in approximately 80 percent of elderly patients. The most common causes of anemia in the elderly are chronic disease and iron deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, and myelodysplastic syndrome are among other causes of anemia in the elderly. Serum ferritin is the most useful test to differentiate iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disease. Not all cases of vitamin B12 deficiency can be identified by low serum levels. The serum methylmalonic acid level may be useful for diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency is effectively treated with oral vitamin B12 supplementation. Folate deficiency is treated with 1 mg of folic acid daily.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency presenting with neurological dysfunction in an adolescent [^112SJeP9]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is classically encountered in the adult Caucasian population and manifests as subacute combined degeneration in the presence or absence of macrocytic anemia. However, B12 deficiency is extremely rare in children in developed countries, with pernicious anemia as an even rarer etiology of this deficiency. The clinical presentation of B12 deficiency in children is not as easily recognizable or well-characterized, potentially resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis.

- **Patient description**: We describe a previously healthy adolescent girl who presented with emotional lability, mental status changes, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. She was found to have megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration secondary to B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia.

- **Conclusion**: Though B12 deficiency is uncommon in pediatrics, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion because early recognition and treatment of B12 deficiency are key to preventing long-term neurological sequelae.

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, which often they are not, the physician must make a decision based on the population distribution of hemoglobin values. The question becomes how likely it is that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution, known as "the lower limit".

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^114hL7Ur]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Genetic disorders causing altered red blood cell (RBC) hydration and hereditary hemolytic anemia (HHA) with macrocytosis include PIEZO1- or KCNN4-associated hereditary xerocytosis (HX), and RHAG-associated overhydrated stomatocytosis (OHSt). Increased reticulocyte count and characteristic osmotic gradient ektacytometry (OGE) curves point toward these diagnostic possibilities.

OGE is a diagnostic assay measuring the deformability of RBCs as they are subjected to constant shear stress in a medium of increasing osmolality in a laser diffraction viscometer, allowing for differential diagnosis between the various RBC membrane disorders. Macrocytic stomatocytes and macrothrombocytopenia associated with increased phytosterol content in the membrane lipid bilayer are seen in the autosomal-recessive disorder of sitosterolemia. Increased cholesterol and phospholipids in the RBC membrane contribute to the macrocytic anemia associated with chronic alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease. Other causes of macrocytic anemia, not completely understood in their pathophysiology, include hypothyroidism and trisomy 21.

### From microcytosis to macrodiagnosis [^111mviMJ]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level.

The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

### Aplastic anaemia [^113kg9kP]. Lancet (2005). High credibility.

The disease aplastic anemia is associated with various symptoms and conditions including fatigue, gum bleeding, pallor, and dyspnea. Patients may experience nosebleeds, decreased blood neutrophil and platelet counts, fever, reduced blood monocytes, and petechiae. Other manifestations include easy bruising, retinal hemorrhage, bleeding tendency, macrocytosis, and diseases such as Fanconi anemia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Subconjunctival hemorrhage, decreased reticulocyte count, anisopoikilocytosis, dyskeratosis congenita, pancytopenia, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, anemia, exercise intolerance, and vitreous hemorrhage are also noted.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into three subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme), which in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation.

Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status must be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload.

Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From an epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias are significant disorders.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^111BVPGL]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

- **Results**: All 150 eligible patients completed three sets of blood tests prior to study analysis (Figure 1). The mean MCV (mean corpuscular volume, average of three values) for all patients was 99.1 ± 6.4 fl, with a range of 66–120 fl. The MCVs for each of the three measurements were 99.0 ± 6.4 fl, 99.1 ± 6.3 fl, and 99.2 ± 6.4 fl, showing an intra-patient variation of 1 ± 0.7 fl. The MCV was normally distributed (Figure 2). Specifically, 92 (61%) of patients had an MCV > 97 fl, 59 (39%) > 100 fl, 45 (30%) > 102 fl, and 24 (16%) > 105 fl.

	- **Patient characteristics**: TSH, serum B12, and RBC folate levels were available at baseline in 22 (49%), 21 (47%), and 28 (62%) patients with an MCV > 102 fl, respectively. In those patients with available data, serum B12 and RBC folate levels were normal. Three patients exhibited biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism, characterized by elevated TSH and low free T4. Reticulocyte counts were available only in a few patients.

- **Figure 2**: The distribution of MCV (fl) is shown, with the mean MCV being 99.1 ± 6.4 fl, and a range of 66–120 fl.

### Clonal haematopoiesis associates with distinct cytometric changes of red blood cells and platelets [^11271YXK]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Individuals with macrocytosis or a high RDW are at increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. The mechanisms that mediate this association remain unknown but may involve the presence of clonal haematopoiesis (CH). Here, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing on all individuals aged 60 years or older with macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL; n = 269) or high RDW (RDW ≥ 16%; n = 242) and 1:2 age- and sex-matched controls from the population-based Lifelines cohort.

Macrocytosis is not associated with CH or peripheral blood count abnormalities. In contrast, individuals with a high RDW were associated with an increased number of mutated genes, larger clone sizes, and a high prevalence of blood count abnormalities. Interestingly, individuals with a high RDW and CH display a uniform population of red blood cells in distribution plots, despite not all cells carrying the respective mutation, suggesting an indirect effect of CH on the red blood cell population. While macrocytosis is not associated with CH in general, SF3B1 mutations are associated with an elevated MCV. Individuals with a combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations show marked disturbances in platelet morphology.

In conclusion, cytometric parameters of peripheral blood cells may serve as early indicators of dysplastic changes and are associated with distinct mutational patterns in CH.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo-, or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which might help define the etiology of anemia.

- **Methods**: The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anemia in primary care. Seven etiologies of anemia were defined based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, and renal anemia as anemia etiology.

- **Results**: Data for 4,129 patients were analyzed. One anemia etiology could be assigned to 2,422 (59%) patients, more than one anemia etiology to 888 (22%) patients, and uncertainty regarding the etiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3,505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anemia etiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anemia etiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

- **Conclusions**: Anemia etiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV-guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias result from defective iron handling by erythroblasts, which decreases the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our understanding of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that must be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. Atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as follows:

- **Defects of intestinal iron absorption**: These affect iron uptake directly from the digestive tract.
- **Disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle**: These impair erythroblast iron uptake.
- **Defects of mitochondrial iron utilization**: These affect haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis.
- **Defects of iron recycling**: These impact the body's ability to reuse iron efficiently.

A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow for the distinction of the different types, which is a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Sanjad-Sakati syndrome with macrocytic anemia and failure to thrive: a case from South Jordan [^112NZMGb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (SSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a deletion mutation (155–166del) in exon 3 of the TBCE gene on chromosome 1q42–43. The syndrome is characterized by primary hypoparathyroidism, typical dysmorphic features, and severe growth retardation.

We encountered a 2-year-old boy with hypocalcemia, failure to thrive, and macrocytic anemia. The patient had the characteristic features of SSS, and genetic testing confirmed that he was homozygous for the TBCE mutation. Although malabsorption was initially considered the cause of his symptoms, the results did not confirm that diagnosis. Our patient had cow milk protein allergy and folic acid deficiency, which have not been described in previous SSS cases. It was difficult to treat the patient's hyperphosphatemia, and we ultimately selected sevelamer treatment, which was tolerated well and improved his hypocalcemia.

SSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any infant with hypocalcemia, dysmorphism, and failure to thrive.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^112HYMu9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has benefitted from the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme synthesis. Numerous case reports illustrate that the implementation of these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has increased our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases.

Integration of these insights into daily clinical practice will reduce delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments. To assist the clinician, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages and, therefore, these guidelines are relevant for pediatricians as well as clinicians who treat adults.

This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, recommendations, and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate using these guidelines in the clinical setting.

### CALR-mediated clonal hematopoiesis causes severe hemolytic anemia in a female PGK1 carrier [^113oCkXm]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Low credibility.

In June 2021, a 32-year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department with a two-week history of asthenia and jaundice without choluria, recent infections, or medications. Laboratory tests identified mild regenerative macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 105 fL [normal range (NR): 79–99 fL]; reticulocytes count, 204,000/µL [NR: 15,000–80,000/µL]) associated with hemolysis pattern (total and indirect bilirubin 6.4 and 6.1 mg/dL, respectively [NR: 0.30–1.20 and 0.10–0.30 mg/dL, respectively]; LDH 674 U/L [NR: 208–378 U/L]; undetectable haptoglobin), thrombocytosis (platelets 814,000/µL), along with iron overload (ferritin 176 ng/mL [NR: 10–120 ng/mL]) and hypergammaglobulinemia (1.9 g/dL [NR: 0.8–1.4 g/dL]). Chronic liver disease, monoclonal gammopathy, hereditary spherocytosis, β-thalassemia, and autoimmune origin were excluded. Abdominal ultrasound did not show hepatosplenomegaly.

A peripheral blood smear showed anisocytosis, polychromasia, and thrombocytosis with anisothrombosis (Fig. S1). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) levels were within reference limits.

Throughout recent years (2017–2019), compensated hemolysis was evidenced by normal hemoglobin levels but elevated bilirubin and LDH. Due to hepatic colic, she underwent cholecystectomy in 2018. Notably, the onset of anemia coincided with the appearance of thrombocytosis (June 2019, Fig. 1A). Her pediatric history indicated she was born after two first-trimester miscarriages and was the oldest of three siblings (Fig. 1B).

### Unveiling the genetic landscape of suspected congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I: A retrospective cohort study of 36 patients [^112ULrZ6]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA I) is a rare hereditary condition characterized by macrocytic/normocytic anemia, splenomegaly, iron overload, and distinct abnormalities during late erythropoiesis, particularly internuclear bridges between erythroblasts. The diagnosis of CDA I remains challenging due to its rarity, clinical heterogeneity, and overlapping phenotype with other rare hereditary anemias. In this case series, we present 36 patients with suspected CDA I. A molecular diagnosis was successfully established in 89% of cases, identifying 16 patients with CDA I through the presence of 18 causative variants in the CDAN1 or CDIN1 genes. Transcriptomic analysis of CDIN1 variants revealed impaired erythroid differentiation and disruptions in transcription, cell proliferation, and histone regulation. Conversely, 16 individuals received a different diagnosis, primarily pyruvate kinase deficiency.

Comparisons between CDA I and non-CDA I patients revealed no significant differences in erythroblast morphological features. However, hemoglobin levels and red blood cell count differed between the two groups, with non-CDA I subjects being more severely affected. Notably, most patients with severe anemia belonged to the non-CDA I group (82% non-CDA I vs. 18% CDA I), with a subsequent absolute prevalence of transfusion dependency among non-CDA I patients (100% vs. 41.7%). All patients exhibited reduced bone marrow responsiveness to anemia, with a more pronounced effect observed in non-CDA I patients. Erythropoietin levels were significantly higher in non-CDA I patients.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113AAYBz]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

Patients may present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper, which may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment, including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged over 60 years are at the highest risk for developing pernicious anemia, characterized by autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells. A B12 level of less than 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrant a diagnostic trial of B12. Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories, and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement.

In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency with normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.
