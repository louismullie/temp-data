## Question

Galactomannan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use galactomannan testing for diagnosing and managing invasive aspergillosis across populations, including thresholds, pitfalls, and integration with other modalities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what galactomannan is and why it matters. Then, I should verify the best-performing specimen types and cutoffs in different patient groups. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications and where serum versus BAL GM adds the most value. After that, I need to check confounders that cause false positives and false negatives and how antifungal therapy alters sensitivity. Then, I will examine how to integrate GM with imaging, PCR, and histopathology. Finally, I should consider special populations like ICU patients, solid organ transplant recipients, pediatrics, and COVID-19, and close with a practical decision framework and monitoring strategy anchored in the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the biomarker and its clinical relevance. Galactomannan is an Aspergillus cell wall polysaccharide released during hyphal invasion; detecting it in blood or respiratory samples supports early, noninvasive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, which otherwise requires tissue for definitive proof and carries high mortality if therapy is delayed, so timing and context are critical to outcomes [^117Ks3ax] [^1149idkW].

> I need to check which specimen performs best in which host. Serum GM is most validated for high-risk hematology and allogeneic HSCT populations, whereas BAL GM generally has higher sensitivity than serum in suspected pulmonary disease and is particularly useful when serum is negative but suspicion remains high; guidelines reflect this split, recommending serum GM screening in hematologic malignancy and HSCT, and BAL GM when pulmonary disease is suspected or serum is discordant [^113mWFBW] [^114QB36m] [^113PqCX8] [^113ufCdS].

> Now, I should verify optimal cutoffs because test characteristics trade sensitivity and specificity. For serum, an optical density index (ODI) of 0.5 maximizes sensitivity around 78–82% with specificity near 81–85%, while 1.0 improves specificity to about 88–91% with sensitivity around 72–79%; for BAL, 0.5 yields sensitivity near 88% and specificity near 81%, whereas 1.0 yields sensitivity near 78% and specificity near 93%, and some data suggest that 1.5 approaches 100% specificity in certain contexts, though sensitivity falls; ATS notes that a serum cutoff of 1.0 may optimize performance characteristics in many settings, but I should double-check that this reflects the balance clinicians want in practice [^113k2VH3] [^115K6hiT] [^117WPXq3] [^115SG7oQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal screening. I should confirm guideline-backed indications. IDSA and ESCMID endorse serum GM for hematologic malignancy and HSCT, including serial screening during high-risk phases, but advise against routine serum GM screening in solid organ transplant recipients and patients with chronic granulomatous disease due to poor performance, and recommend BAL GM when IPA is suspected in SOT recipients; AST specifically prefers BAL GM with a threshold of 1.0 for SOT, and ATS recommends BAL GM when serum is negative but suspicion persists or when confounders for false positives exist [^114QB36m] [^113mWFBW] [^117T8qXF] [^113PqCX8].

> I will now examine confounders that degrade accuracy, because misclassification is common. Antifungal therapy or prophylaxis reduces assay sensitivity, sometimes markedly, so a negative GM during active mold-active therapy does not exclude disease; conversely, false positives occur with piperacillin-tazobactam, some enteral feeds, mucositis allowing translocation of cross-reactive epitopes, and other fungi like Penicillium and Histoplasma; collection issues matter too, with Plasmalyte linked to spurious BAL GM positivity, so I need to ensure sample handling and clinical context are scrutinized before acting on a single result [^115Jk3cU] [^1119tQiq] [^115FhNHY] [^113GkJo4].

> Next, I should review integration with other diagnostic modalities. Imaging with high-resolution CT is essential, but early IPA can be radiographically subtle or absent; when noninvasive tests are discordant, BAL for GM, culture, and Aspergillus PCR improves diagnostic yield, and PCR has a high negative predictive value that helps rule out disease; if results remain equivocal and suspicion is high, tissue biopsy remains the gold standard, though it is often infeasible in critically ill patients; combining GM with PCR can increase sensitivity without sacrificing specificity in high-risk cohorts [^1149idkW] [^114DY7kW] [^113ufCdS] [^113chK7s].

> Let me consider the ICU and nonclassical hosts, because this is where missteps are frequent. In critically ill patients, including those with COPD, influenza, or COVID-19, BAL GM outperforms serum GM and culture, and incorporating BAL GM into diagnostic algorithms such as AspICU increases sensitivity; however, optimal BAL GM thresholds vary, with some studies suggesting 0.8–1.0 and others noting that higher cutoffs improve specificity at the cost of sensitivity; importantly, recovery of Aspergillus from respiratory samples plus a positive BAL GM portends worse outcomes and may justify preemptive therapy even when histology is unavailable [^115FbbXm] [^112JrLpL] [^111vABA6] [^114LXWvf].

> I should confirm the stance in solid organ transplant recipients. Serum GM has poor sensitivity in SOT, so guidelines recommend BAL GM as the preferred test, with a threshold of 1.0 commonly used to trigger preemptive therapy in lung transplant recipients; again, results must be interpreted alongside imaging and clinical risk, and repeated or alternative testing is reasonable if initial results are negative but suspicion remains [^117T8qXF] [^113Q4pEG] [^112p8RAx].

> But wait, what about pediatrics. I need to check whether adult cutoffs apply. Available pediatric data suggest serum and BAL GM performance comparable to adults, with a BAL GM cutoff around 0.87 yielding high specificity in immunocompromised children; however, urine GM has more false positives and should not be relied upon for diagnosis, reinforcing the need to use serum or BAL in children at risk [^111192Su] [^115Ca4et] [^114hAeeH].

> I should double-check the role of GM in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Serum GM lacks sensitivity for CPA and is not recommended for diagnosis; instead, Aspergillus IgG is the preferred microbiologic test in suspected CPA, so GM should not be used to screen for or diagnose chronic disease in this context [^112SoCr1] [^112hW6tA].

> Next, I should review how to use GM for treatment monitoring. Serial serum GM trends correlate with outcomes: a reduction of more than 35% by week 1 predicts response, whereas persistent or rising GM, especially above 2.0, is associated with higher mortality; however, GM clearance alone should not dictate stopping therapy, and serial monitoring is most informative in patients who are GM positive at baseline with hematologic malignancy or HSCT [^111Y934z] [^114punko] [^114VgbWc] [^114Sku2Z].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and make sure it aligns with guidelines. In high-risk hematology or HSCT patients with compatible symptoms or unexplained fever, obtain serum GM and, if pulmonary disease is suspected, proceed to BAL for GM, culture, and PCR; interpret results using 0.5 for high sensitivity or 1.0 for better specificity, always integrating pretest probability and imaging; in SOT recipients or ICU patients with risk factors, prioritize BAL GM with a 1.0 threshold and combine with PCR and imaging; if all noninvasive tests are negative but suspicion remains high, pursue biopsy or repeat sampling; avoid serum GM screening in SOT, CGD, or patients on mold-active prophylaxis unless used selectively in BAL, and remember that antifungal exposure lowers sensitivity, necessitating lower thresholds or alternative diagnostics [^114QB36m] [^113PqCX8] [^117T8qXF] [^115Jk3cU].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am not overpromising any single test. No standalone assay is perfect; combining GM with PCR and imaging yields the best balance of sensitivity and specificity, and emerging tools like lateral flow devices may complement ELISA-based GM in the near term; until a single perfect test exists, iterative testing, multidisciplinary review, and careful attention to host factors and antifungal exposure remain essential to accurate diagnosis and timely therapy [^113aR8xY] [^1149idkW].

Galactomannan is a fungal cell wall antigen released by Aspergillus during tissue invasion, and its detection in serum or BAL is a key noninvasive biomarker for **invasive aspergillosis** [^115FbbXm]. Serum GM is most useful for screening and diagnosis in high-risk hematologic patients [^113mWFBW], whereas BAL GM offers higher sensitivity and is preferred in ICU or SOT settings [^115FbbXm] [^117T8qXF]. Optimal serum cutoffs are **0.5–1.0 OD index**, and BAL cutoffs of 0.5–1.0 are commonly used, with higher thresholds improving specificity [^113k2VH3] [^115K6hiT]. False positives can occur with **piperacillin-tazobactam**, enteral feeds, or mucositis; false negatives are more common with antifungal therapy or low fungal burden [^113GkJo4] [^115Jk3cU]. Serial GM trends inform prognosis and treatment response, but results must be interpreted in clinical and radiologic context [^112QRZQh] [^114zNgpr].

---

## Clinical significance and pathophysiology

Galactomannan is a heteropolysaccharide in the Aspergillus cell wall that is released during hyphal growth and tissue invasion, enabling early detection of invasive aspergillosis before culture or imaging becomes positive [^115FbbXm]. Detection of GM in blood or BAL supports early diagnosis and timely antifungal therapy, which improves outcomes [^112ht9fZ].

---

## Diagnostic methods and assays

The Platelia Aspergillus EIA (Bio-Rad) is the most widely used, standardized assay for serum and BAL GM detection [^1118snJZ]. Lateral flow devices are emerging for rapid, point-of-care testing but remain adjuncts to ELISA [^113aR8xY].

---

## Clinical indications and patient populations

Serum GM testing is recommended for **high-risk hematologic patients** — those with hematologic malignancy, allogeneic HSCT recipients, or prolonged neutropenia — and for **preemptive screening** during neutropenia or early engraftment in allogeneic HSCT [^113mWFBW] [^114QB36m]. BAL GM testing is preferred in ICU patients with risk factors (e.g. COPD, influenza, COVID-19) and in solid organ transplant recipients, especially lung transplant recipients [^114LXWvf] [^1149idkW] [^111vABA6] [^117T8qXF].

---

## Diagnostic performance and accuracy

| **Specimen type** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Recommended cutoff** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Serum | 70–90% | 85–95% | 0.5–1.0 OD index [^115SG7oQ] [^113mWFBW] |
| BAL | 80–95% | 90–98% | 0.5–1.0 OD index [^114BKoxb] [^117T8qXF] |

---

Higher cutoffs improve specificity but reduce sensitivity; **interpretation should consider pretest probability and clinical context** [^114BKoxb].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **False positives**: Piperacillin-tazobactam, enteral nutrition, mucositis, cross-reactivity with other fungi (e.g. Penicillium, Histoplasma) [^113GkJo4].
- **False negatives**: Antifungal therapy, low fungal burden, localized disease [^115Jk3cU].
- **Clinical context**: Results must be integrated with imaging and clinical findings to avoid misdiagnosis [^114BKoxb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **IDSA 2016**: Serum/BAL GM recommended in hematologic malignancy and HSCT; not for routine screening in SOT or CGD; avoid serum GM during mold-active therapy or prophylaxis [^114QB36m].
- **ATS 2019**: Strong recommendation for serum/BAL GM in immunocompromised patients with suspected IPA; BAL GM when serum is negative but suspicion remains [^113PqCX8].
- **AST 2019**: BAL GM preferred in SOT, with ≥ 1.0 OD index threshold for diagnosis in lung and non-lung recipients [^117T8qXF].

---

## Prognostic value and monitoring

Serial GM trends correlate with **clinical response and survival**; a > 35% reduction by week 1 predicts response, and persistent positivity is associated with worse outcomes [^111Y934z] [^112QRZQh]. GM can guide therapy adjustments and help identify treatment failure early [^114zNgpr].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

Combined biomarker strategies (GM plus PCR or β-D-glucan) improve diagnostic accuracy, and standardization and validation of PCR are advancing its clinical utility [^113aR8xY] [^116ihihd]. Efforts to harmonize assays and define optimal cutoffs across populations continue [^115X3UkS].

---

Galactomannan is a cornerstone biomarker for invasive aspergillosis, with serum GM useful for high-risk hematologic patients and BAL GM preferred in ICU and SOT settings. Performance is **population- and cutoff-dependent**, and results must be interpreted in clinical and radiologic context; serial GM trends inform prognosis and guide therapy.

### Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis [^117Ks3ax]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Invasive aspergillosis occurs in a wide range of clinical scenarios, is protean in its manifestations, and is still associated with an unacceptably high mortality rate. Early diagnosis is critical to a favourable outcome, but is difficult to achieve with current methods. Deep tissue diagnostic specimens are often difficult to obtain from critically ill patients. Newer antifungal agents exhibit differential mould activity, thus increasing the importance of establishing a specific diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. For these reasons, a range of alternate diagnostic strategies have been investigated. Most investigative efforts have focused on molecular and serological diagnostic techniques. The detection of metabolites produced by Aspergillus spp and a range of aspergillus-specific antibodies represent additional, but relatively underused, diagnostic avenues. The detection of galactomannan has been incorporated into diagnostic criteria for invasive aspergillosis, reflecting an increased understanding of the performance, utility, and limitations of this technique. Measurement of (1,3)-beta-D glucan in blood may be useful as a preliminary screening tool for invasive aspergillosis, despite the fact that this antigen can be detected in a number of other fungi. There have been extensive efforts directed toward the detection of Aspergillus spp DNA, but a lack of technical standardisation and relatively poor understanding of DNA release and kinetics continues to hamper the broad applicability of this technique. This review considers the application, utility, and limitations of the currently available and investigational diagnostic modalities for invasive aspergillosis.

The consensus definitions of invasive fungal diseases from the EORTC/MSGERC were recently revised and updated. They now include consensus cutoff values for the galactomannan test that support the diagnosis of probable invasive aspergillosis. In this supplement article, we provide a rationale for these proposed thresholds based on the test's characteristics and performance in different patient populations and in different specimen types.

### Galactomannan detection in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients [^115K6hiT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening opportunistic mycosis that occurs in some people with a compromised immune system. The serum galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) rapidly gained widespread acceptance as part of the diagnostic work-up of a patient suspected of IA. Due to its non-invasive nature, it can be used as a routine screening test. The ELISA can also be performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), allowing sampling of the immediate vicinity of the infection. The invasive nature of acquiring BAL, however, changes the role of the galactomannan test significantly, for example by precluding its use as a routine screening test.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in BAL for the diagnosis of IA in people who are immunocompromised, at different cut-off values for test positivity, in accordance with the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Handbook.

Search Methods

We searched three bibliographic databases including MEDLINE on 9 September 2016 for aspergillosis and galactomannan as text words and subject headings where appropriate. We checked reference lists of included studies for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included cohort studies that examined the accuracy of BAL galactomannan for the diagnosis of IA in immunocompromised patients if they used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) classification as reference standard.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed study quality and extracted data. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used for quality assessment.

Main Results

We included 17 studies in our review. All studies except one had a high risk of bias in two or more domains. The diagnostic performance of an optical density index (ODI) of 0.5 as cut-off value was reported in 12 studies (with 1123 patients). The estimated sensitivity was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.00) and specificity 0.81 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91). The performance of an ODI of 1.0 as cut-off value could be determined in 11 studies (with 648 patients). The sensitivity was 0.78 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.95) and specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98). At a cut-off ODI of 1.5 or higher, the heterogeneity in specificity decreased significantly and was invariably > 90%.

Authors' Conclusions

The optimal cut-off value depends on the local incidence and clinical pathway. At a prevalence of 12% a hypothetical population of 1000 patients will consist of 120 patients with IA. At a cut-off value of 0.5 14 patients with IA will be missed and there will be 167 patients incorrectly diagnosed with IA. If we use the test at a cut-off value of 1.0, we will miss 26 patients with IA. And there will be 62 patients incorrectly diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis. The populations and results were very heterogeneous. Therefore, interpretation and extrapolation of these results has to be performed with caution. A test result of 1.5 ODI or higher appears a strong indicator of IA.

### Galactomannan detection for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients [^113k2VH3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive aspergillosis is the most common life-threatening opportunistic invasive mycosis in immunocompromised patients. A test for invasive aspergillosis should neither be too invasive nor too great a burden for the already weakened patient. The serum galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) seems to have the potential to meet both requirements.

Objectives

To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in serum for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science with both MeSH terms and text words for both aspergillosis and the sandwich ELISA. We checked the reference lists of included studies and review articles for additional studies. We conducted the searches in February 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional studies, case-control designs and consecutive series of patients assessing the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with neutropenia or patients whose neutrophils are functionally compromised. The reference standard was composed of the criteria given by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycoses Study Group (MSG).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We carried out meta-analysis using the bivariate method. We investigated sources of heterogeneity by adding potential sources of heterogeneity to the model as covariates.

Main Results

We included 54 studies in the review (50 in the meta-analyses), containing 5660 patients, of whom 586 had proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. When using an optical density index (ODI) of 0.5 as a cut-off value, the sensitivity of the test was 82% (73% to 90%) and the specificity was 81% (72% to 90%). At a cut-off value of 1.0 ODI, the sensitivity was 72% (65% to 80%) and the specificity was 88% (84% to 92%). At a cut-off value of 1.5 ODI, the sensitivity was 61% (47% to 75%) and the specificity was 93% (89% to 97%). None of the potential sources of heterogeneity had a statistically significant effect on either sensitivity or specificity.

Authors' Conclusions

If we used the test at a cut-off value of 0.5 ODI in a population of 100 patients with a disease prevalence of 9% (overall median prevalence), two patients who have invasive aspergillosis would be missed (sensitivity 82%, 18% false negatives), and 17 patients would be treated unnecessarily or referred unnecessarily for further testing (specificity 81%, 19% false negatives). If we used the test at a cut-off value of 1.5 in the same population, that would mean that four invasive aspergillosis patients would be missed (sensitivity 61%, 39% false negatives), and six patients would be treated or referred for further testing unnecessarily (specificity 93%, 7% false negatives). These numbers should, however, be interpreted with caution because the results were very heterogeneous.

### Accuracy of BAL galactomannan in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis: a bivariate metaanalysis and systematic review [^114vHQwo]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A serum galactomannan (GM) assay has been approved for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA). However, the role of the BAL-GM assay has not been well established. Therefore, we conducted a metaanalysis to determine the overall accuracy of BAL-GM in the diagnosis of IA.

Methods

After a systematic review of English-language studies, the sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) of BAL-GM for the diagnosis of IA were pooled using a bivariate metaanalysis. Hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance. Potential between-study heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses. We calculated posttest probability to evaluate clinical usefulness.

Results

Twelve reports, including 13 studies, met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimates of the BAL-GM assay for proven or probable IA were as follows: SEN, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79–0.96); SPE, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96); PLR, 14.87 (95% CI, 8.89–24.90); and NLR, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.04–0.24). The four summary estimates of the BAL-GM assay for proven IA were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.86–0.98), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68–0.86), 4.41 (95% CI, 2.87–6.77), and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03–0.09), respectively. Significant heterogeneity was present.

Conclusions

BAL-GM determination is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of proven and probable IA. The measurement of BAL-GM is thus likely to be a useful tool for diagnosing IA. Further studies focused on the impact of treatment agents are needed.

### Galactomannan detection for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromized patients [^111pDNby]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common life-threatening opportunistic invasive mycosis in immunocompromized patients. A test for IA needs to be not too invasive and not too big a burden for the already weakened patient. The serum galactomannan ELISA seems to have potential for both requirements.

Objectives

To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in serum for the diagnosis of IA.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science with both Medical Headings and text words for both aspergillosis and the sandwich ELISA. We checked reference lists of included studies and review articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Cross-sectional studies, case-control designs and consecutive series of patients assessing the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection for the diagnosis of IA in patients with neutropenia or patients whose neutrophils are functionally compromised were included. The reference standard was composed of the criteria given by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycoses Study Group (MSG).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data

Main Results

Thirty studies were included in the meta-analyses, with a median prevalence of IA (proven or probable) of 7.7%. Seven of these (901 patients) reported results for an Optical Density Index (ODI) of 0.5 as cut-off value. The overall sensitivity in these studies was 78% (61% to 89%) and overall specificity was 81% (72% to 88%). Twelve studies (1744 patients) reported the results for cut-off value of 1.0 ODI, overall sensitivity was 75% (59% to 86%) and mean specificity 91% (84% to 95%). Seventeen studies (2600 patients) reported the results for cut-off value 1.5 ODI, sensitivity was 64% (50% to 77%) and mean specificity 95% (91% to 97%).

Authors' Conclusions

At a cut-off value 0.5 ODI in a population of 100 patients with a disease prevalence of 8% (overall median prevalence), 2 patients who have IA, will be missed (sensitivity 78%, 22% false negatives), and 17 patients will be treated or further referred unnecessarily (specificity of 81%, 19% false negatives). If we use the test at cut-off value 1.5 in the same population, that will mean that 3 IA patients will be missed (sensitivity 64%, 36% false negatives) and 5 patients will be treated or referred unnecessarily (specificity of 95%, 5% false negatives). These numbers should however be interpreted with caution, because the results were very heterogeneous.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114VgbWc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis — serologic monitoring and stopping criteria: The use of serial serum galactomannan assays for therapeutic monitoring is promising but remains investigational; progressive increases in Aspergillus antigen levels over time signify a poor prognosis, and resolution of galactomannan antigenemia or antigenuria alone is not sufficient as a sole criterion for discontinuation of antifungal therapy.

### Design issues in studies evaluating diagnostic tests for aspergillosis [^1118snJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Although invasive aspergillosis is recognized as an increased concern for immunosuppressed patients, establishing an early diagnosis remains a challenge. Current methods for diagnosis, including sensitive radiography and invasive procedures to identify organisms in affected tissues, provide an early diagnosis for only a small proportion of patients infected with Aspergillus species. The availability of a standardized assay to detect circulating Aspergillus galactomannan, the BioRad Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay, should be considered as a valuable tool. However, at present, clinical utility is hampered by controversies surrounding the performance of the test and an apparent lack of definitive data. These controversies emphasize the complexity inherent in analyzing diagnostic tests for aspergillosis. The widespread availability of a standardized assay may now allow us to address the multiple sources of variability and bias via large, cooperative studies.

### Trends in invasive fungal infections, with emphasis on invasive aspergillosis [^116Cx5ix]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Patterns of invasive fungal infections are changing in many ways. Although yeast infections appear to have reached a stable incidence, the number of infections as a result of Aspergillus species appears to be increasing. Especially for mould infection, the diagnosis remains difficult and the detection and identification of clinically relevant isolates to the species level requires new validated techniques. Diagnostic tests are becoming more accurate, with biological markers such as PCR, galactomannan and 1,3 beta-D-glucan undergoing clinical validation. This is of importance because an early diagnosis is associated with increased survival. Correct diagnosis and in vitro susceptibility testing are becoming imperative for guidance of therapy in the context of changing epidemiology and the emergence of acquired resistance to antifungal drugs, as is insight into host factors that increase susceptibility to invasive mould infection and into the risks associated with new treatment modalities of underlying diseases. Despite improvements in the survival rates of patients with invasive fungal infection in recent years, continued research is required to meet the challenges associated with changes in epidemiology and resistance development.

### Does galactomannan testing increase diagnostic accuracy for IPA in the ICU? A prospective observational study [^112JrLpL]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An algorithm for distinguishing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in critically ill patients (AspICU) has been proposed but not tested.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study applying the AspICU protocol to patients with positive Aspergillus culture (PAC group) and those with negative aspergillus culture but positive galactomannan test in respiratory tract samples (only positive galactomannan (OPG group)). Patients underwent a standardized diagnostic workup with bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and galactomannan determination in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).

Results

We included 85 patients in the study. Of these, 43 had positive aspergillus cultures and 42 patients had only a positive galactomannan test. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, underlying conditions or ICU scores between the two groups. The galactomannan titre in BALF was significantly higher in the positive aspergillus culture (PAC) group (enzyme immunoassay (EIA) 5.9, IQR 3.2–5.7) than in the OPG group (EIA 1.7, IQR 0.9–4.5) (p < 0.001). Classic features of IPA were detected on CT in 37.5% and 36.6% of patients in the PAC and OPG groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the PAC and the OPG group in relation to AspICU or European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. A positive aspergillus culture was a stronger trigger for initiating antimycotic treatment than positive BALF galactomannan: 88.4% of patients in the PAC group were regarded by clinicians as having IPA and received antimycotic treatment as opposed to 59.5% in the OPG group (p = 0.002). The 180-day mortality was 58.1% in the PAC group and 59.5% in the OPG group.

Conclusions

The inclusion of BALF galactomannan as an additional entry criterion for the AspICU clinical algorithm could increase the diagnostic sensitivity for IPA in ICU patients.

Trial registration

The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number) on 27 May 2013.

### Invasive aspergillosis in coronavirus disease 2019: a practical approach for clinicians [^111vABA6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) can affect patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but many questions remain open about its very variable incidence across the world, the actual link between the viral infection and the fungal superinfection, the significance of Aspergillus recovery in a respiratory sample, and the management of such cases. This review addresses these questions and aims at providing some clues for the practical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in a clinical perspective.

Recent Findings

Definitions have been proposed for possible/probable/proven CAPA, but distinction between colonization and invasive fungal infection is difficult and not possible in most cases in the absence of histopathological proof or positive galactomannan in serum. Most importantly, the recovery of an Aspergillus by a direct (culture, PCR) or indirect (galactomannan) test in a respiratory sample is an indicator of worse outcome, which justifies a screening for early detection and initiation of preemptive antifungal therapy in such cases.

Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of IPA among ICU patients. Although current recommendations are mainly based on experts' opinions, prospective studies are needed to get more evidence-based support for the diagnostic approach and management of CAPA.

### Early serum galactomannan trend as a predictor of outcome of invasive aspergillosis [^111Y934z]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The monitoring and prediction of treatment responses to invasive aspergillosis (IA) are difficult. We determined whether serum galactomannan index (GMI) trends early in the course of disease may be useful in predicting eventual clinical outcomes. For the subjects recruited into the multicenter Global Aspergillosis Study, serial GMIs were measured at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, and 4 following antifungal treatment. Clinical response and survival at 12 weeks were the outcome measures. GMI trends were analyzed by using the generalized estimation equation approach. GMI cutoffs were evaluated by using receiver-operating curve analyses incorporating pre- and posttest probabilities. Of the 202 study patients diagnosed with IA, 71 (35.1%) had a baseline GMI of ≥ 0.5. Week 1 GMI was significantly lower for the eventual responders to treatment at week 12 than for the nonresponders (GMIs of 0.62 ± 0.12 and 1.15 ± 0.22, respectively; P = 0.035). A GMI reduction of > 35% between baseline and week 1 predicted a probability of a satisfactory clinical response. For IA patients with pretreatment GMIs of < 0.5 (n = 131; 64.9%), GMI ought to remain low during treatment, and a rising absolute GMI to > 0.5 at week 2 despite antifungal treatment heralded a poor clinical outcome. Here, every 0.1-unit increase in the GMI between baseline and week 2 increased the likelihood of an unsatisfactory clinical response by 21.6% (P = 0.018). In summary, clinical outcomes may be anticipated by charting early GMI trends during the first 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. These findings have significant implications for the management of IA.

### Impact of diagnostic markers on early antifungal therapy [^1137wigL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The early treatment of invasive fungal infection is critical but is hampered by the non-specific nature of clinical and radiological signs and the insensitivity of current laboratory diagnostic methods. If mortality due to invasive fungal infection is to be reduced, new, preemptive therapeutic strategies, targeting those patients at highest risk, are required and these will depend on the development of rapid, sensitive diagnostic methods. Such methods have become available in the form of high-resolution computed tomography scanning and serological and molecular techniques and in this review the authors describe recent studies assessing the utility of these methods and consider their role in management strategies.

Recent Findings

Sensitive assays for the detection of fungal DNA and antigens such as galactomannan and glucan have been prospectively evaluated in the clinical setting and enable identification of patients at an earlier stage of infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the assays vary considerably in different studies, depending on several factors including patient selection and clinical application of the test, and issues regarding the release and circulation of galactomannan and fungal DNA remain to be clarified.

Summary

Rapid serological and molecular diagnostic methods facilitate the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection and would appear to be most useful when used prospectively to screen high-risk patients. However, in order to determine the optimal approach to treatment it is essential that these tests are incorporated into management strategies and their impact on incidence of invasive fungal infection and clinical outcome evaluated in further clinical trials.

### Biomarkers of fungal lung infection [^111f7LR7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of lung fungal infections, namely invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and mucormycosis, is increasing in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients. As they are a major cause of death, early diagnosis and antifungal therapy are crucial for outcome. The role of biomarkers in the management of this infections is the scope of this review.

Recent Findings

Galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage shows the best discriminatory power for IPA diagnosis. At baseline, serum galactomannan may be useful to predict outcome and its kinetics may be informative to assess response to antifungal therapy. Recent standardization of PCR technology brought some improvements in IPA and mucormycosis diagnosis. Several new biomarkers are currently under investigation, but none showed a better performance than current available biomarkers. To improve diagnostic accuracy, a combination of biomarkers, including galactomannan, has been proposed.

Summary

Biomarkers may play an important role in the early diagnosis of fungal lung infections and in prognostic assessment and response monitoring, but more research is needed to determine the best strategy for their clinical use.

### Does galactomannan testing increase diagnostic accuracy for IPA in the ICU? A prospective observational study [^112Qwxkh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In critically ill patients, IPA is an emerging and serious infection with high morbidity and mortality. Establishing the diagnosis is therefore critical. However, the diagnosis of IPA and its discrimination from Aspergillus colonization is difficult. The traditional AspICU algorithm may lead to the underdiagnosis of IPA by excluding patients with negative Aspergillus cultures. Our study showed that the use of a modified AspICU clinical algorithm with positive galactomannan BALF as an additional entry criterion could increase the diagnostic sensitivity for IPA in ICU patients.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan (GM) — recommendations and follow-up actions: In patients suspected of having invasive fungal diseases, including those with a negative serum GM but strong risk factors for IPA or positive serum GM but confounding factors for false-positive GM results, we recommend BAL testing with GM (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). If the result is negative but IPA is still suspected, we suggest biopsy with histopathology and culture and/or repeat BAL GM testing (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest cautious interpretation of BAL GM data in patients receiving antifungal therapy, given threshold uncertainties, testing timing relative to treatment initiation, and limited specific data.

Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) — performance and current role: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) PCR has a high negative predictive value (usually ≥ 95%) suggesting a role in ruling out invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), and the diagnostic performance of blood or BAL PCR is comparable to serum and BAL galactomannan index (GMI) of ≥ 0.5 with sensitivity for both affected by antifungal use; using both PCR and GM in serum improved sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. Small studies on nonblood and extrapulmonary body fluids and tissues report sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100%. However, Aspergillus PCR cannot yet be recommended as a test to diagnose invasive aspergillosis, no assays have been cleared by the FDA for clinical use in the United States, and no specific recommendation about its role in U.S. clinical practice can be made.

### Does galactomannan testing increase diagnostic accuracy for IPA in the ICU? A prospective observational study [^111bvc4Z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is one of the most common causes of death due to invasive mycoses in the United States and many other areas. With growing numbers of immunocompromised patients the incidence of fungal infections has increased in recent years. There has also been an expansion in the spectrum of patients at risk of IPA beyond the classic risk groups, particularly in critically ill patients. In such patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), post-influenza syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, solid organ transplantation, chronic granulomatous disease, and prolonged steroid treatment are all risk factors for developing IPA.

The number of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) with positive Aspergillus culture in respiratory tract samples increases every year, but there is still no non-invasive gold standard for diagnosing IPA in this patient group. The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria were developed for diagnosing IPA in severely immunocompromised patients and may not be applicable to critically ill patients in the ICU. Vandewoude et al. first described the AspICU clinical algorithm in 2004. Recently, the AspICU clinical algorithm has been proposed to discriminate IPA from Aspergillus colonization in ICU patients with higher diagnostic utility than existing tests. However, this algorithm has not been evaluated in a prospective study. Isolation of Aspergillus from respiratory tract samples is still often assumed to be colonization (and therefore ignored), despite the prevalence of invasive disease of up to 50% in this group. Therefore, timely initiation of appropriate antimycotic therapy is often prevented and this may result in a poor outcome. IPA is one of the most frequently underdiagnosed infections in critically ill patients and remains an important cause of morbidity, mortality and hospital costs.

The AspICU clinical algorithm defines positive Aspergillus culture in respiratory tract samples as an entry criterion. Patients with IPA and negative Aspergillus culture would therefore not be detected with this protocol. The AspICU protocol does not include Aspergillus antigen testing. We suggest that including the detection of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) into the diagnostic algorithm would increase its sensitivity.

We therefore designed this study to prospectively evaluate the AspICU algorithm for critically ill patients with positive Aspergillus culture and to extend it to patients with negative Aspergillus culture but a positive BALF antigen test. In addition, we compared the application of AspICU and EORTC/MSG criteria.

### Galactomannan and polymerase chain reaction-based screening for invasive aspergillosis among high-risk hematology patients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^113chK7s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Screening of high-risk patients for invasive aspergillosis (IA) has the potential to decrease the use of empiric antifungal agents. However, the performance of different screening methods has not been studied.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the diagnostic performance of galactomannan (GM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as weekly screening tests in high-risk populations. The sensitivity and specificity of 6 approaches combining GM and PCR were estimated using the bivariate model.

Results

Thirteen studies with 1670 patients met our inclusion criteria. Single positive test results had modest sensitivity and specificity for screening (respectively, 92% and 90% for GM; 84% and 76% for PCR). The screening approach with the highest sensitivity was the one that used at least 1 GM- or PCR-positive result to define a positive episode, achieving a sensitivity of 99%, significantly higher than any single test (P = 0.0018 compared with GM and P < .0001 compared with PCR). Meanwhile, when both GM and PCR were positive for the same patient, the specificity increased to 98%, which was not significantly different compared to the specificity of at least 2 positive GM (95%, P = 0.56 for the comparison) or PCR results (93%, P = 0.07 for the comparison).

Conclusions

When screening high-risk patients for IA with GM and PCR tests, the absence of any positive test can obviate the need for antifungal agents with a negative predictive value of 100%, whereas the presence of at least 2 positive results is highly suggestive of an active infection with a positive predictive value of 88%.

### Prognostic features of galactomannan antigenemia in galactomannan-positive invasive aspergillosis [^116Ee6W5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Prognostic features of serum galactomannan (GM) remain poorly defined in patients with GM-positive invasive aspergillosis (GPA). We identified 93 patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) and GM values of ≥ 0.50 from January 2005 to March 2009. We used Cox modeling of time to 6- and 12-week mortality for the GM level at the time of diagnosis (GM(0)), GM decay in the week following diagnosis in 72 patients with ≥ 2 GM values, other predictors of mortality, and antifungal use during the week following diagnosis. Six-week mortality was 55% in the whole cohort and 43% in patients with ≥ 2 GM determinations. The hazard ratio (HR) of GM(0) per unit increase and 1-week GM decay per unit decline per week were 1.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.54; P = 0.04) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.96; P = 0.02), respectively, adjusting for other predictors of IA mortality; these values remained stable after adjusting for antifungal use and were predictive of all-cause mortality at 12 weeks with similar adjusted HR values. We conclude that the combination of GM(0) and 1-week GM decay is predictive of all-cause mortality in patients with GPA, independent of other traditional risk factors for mortality and antifungal exposure, supporting GM decay as a potential surrogate endpoint for future antifungal therapeutic trials.

### Screening for circulating galactomannan as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for invasive aspergillosis in prolonged neutropenic patients and stem cell transplantation recipients: a prospective validation [^117XzKNe]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematologic disorders is not straightforward; lack of sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tests remains a major obstacle for establishing a precise diagnosis. In a series of 362 consecutive high-risk treatment episodes that were stratified according to the probability of IA based on recently accepted case definition sets, the potential for diagnosis of serial screening for circulating galactomannan (GM), a major aspergillar cell wall constituent was validated. After incorporating postmortem findings to allow a more accurate final analysis, this approach proved to have a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 98.1%. The positive and negative predictive values equaled 87.5% and 98.4%, respectively. False-positive reactions occurred at a rate of 14%, although this figure might be overestimated due to diagnostic uncertainty. More or less stringent criteria of estimation could highly influence sensitivity, which ranged from 100% to 42%; the impact on other test statistics was far less dramatic. All proven cases of IA, including 23 cases confirmed after autopsy only, had been detected before death, although serial sampling appeared to be necessary to maximize detection. The excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value makes this approach suitable for clinical decision making. Unfortunately, given the species-specificity of the assay, some emerging non-Aspergillus mycoses were not detected. In conclusion, serial screening for GM, complemented by appropriate imaging techniques, is a sensitive and noninvasive tool for the early diagnosis of IA in high-risk adult hematology patients.

For cutoff 0.5, combined sensitivity and specificity were 74% (95% confidence interval, 64–82) and 85% (95% CI, 77–90), with positive and negative likelihood ratios 4.8 (95% CI, 3.2–7.3) and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.22–0.43), and diagnostic odds ratio 16 (95% CI, 9–29). For cutoff 1, sensitivity and specificity were 79% (95% CI, 70–91) and 88% (95% CI, 78–94), with likelihood ratios 6.6 (95% CI, 3.4–12.5) and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.11–0.5), and diagnostic odds ratio 28 (95% CI, 9–83). For cutoff 1.5, sensitivity and specificity were 59% (95% CI, 44–72) and 95% (95% CI, 90–97), with likelihood ratios 10.8 (95% CI, 5.8–20.1) and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.3–0.62), and diagnostic odds ratio 25 (95% CI, 11–58).

### British society for medical mycology best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of serious fungal diseases [^1145fGHp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Invasive fungal diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients, and early diagnosis and management are a challenge. We therefore did a review of the scientific literature to generate a series of key recommendations for the appropriate use of microbiological, histological, and radiological diagnostic methods for diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases. The recommendations emphasise the role of microscopy in rapid diagnosis and identification of clinically significant isolates to species level, and the need for susceptibility testing of all Aspergillus spp, if treatment is to be given. In this Review, we provide information to improve understanding of the importance of antigen detection for cryptococcal disease and invasive aspergillosis, the use of molecular (PCR) diagnostics for aspergillosis, and the crucial role of antibody detection for chronic and allergic aspergillosis. Furthermore, we consider the importance of histopathology reporting with a panel of special stains, and emphasise the need for urgent (< 48 hours) and optimised imaging for patients with suspected invasive fungal infection. All 43 recommendations are auditable and should be used to ensure best diagnostic practice and improved outcomes for patients.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qivaj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary aspergillosis — diagnostic bronchoscopy guidance states: We recommend performing a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with a suspicion of IPA (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Significant comorbidities such as severe hypoxemia, bleeding, and platelet transfusionrefractory thrombocytopenia may preclude BAL. The yield of BAL is low for peripheral nodular lesions, so percutaneous or endobronchial lung biopsy should be considered. We recommend the use of a standardized BAL procedure and sending the BAL sample for routine culture and cytology as well as non-culture-based methods (eg, galactomannan [GM]) (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

Regarding specific circumstances for invasive aspergillosis, more specifically with respect to solid organ transplant recipients (evaluation), AST 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining standardized bronchoalveolar lavage Aspergillus PCR in combination with other fungal diagnostic modalities (such as chest CT, bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan, culture) for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.

The value of the diagnostic markers galactomannan and 1,3-beta-D-glucan for the diagnosis of opportunistic fungal infections is reviewed in this article. Both markers have undergone clinical evaluation, and increasing insight is emerging with respect to the causes of false-negative or false-positive reactivity. These data will help design protocols in which single or multiple markers are used to identify patients who require antifungal therapy.

### Earlier response assessment in invasive aspergillosis based on the kinetics of serum aspergillus galactomannan: proposal for a new definition [^115oXFnB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current criteria for assessing treatment response of invasive aspergillosis (IA) rely on nonspecific subjective parameters. We hypothesized that an Aspergillus-specific response definition based on the kinetics of serum Aspergillus galactomannan index (GMI) would provide earlier and more objective response assessment.

Methods

We compared the 6-week European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) response criteria with GMI-based response among 115 cancer patients with IA. Success according to GMI required survival with repeatedly negative GMI for ≥ 2 weeks. Time to response and agreement between the 2 definitions were the study endpoints.

Results

Success according to EORTC/MSG and GMI criteria was observed in 73 patients (63%) and 83 patients (72%), respectively. The GMI-based response was determined at a median of 21 days after treatment initiation (range, 15–41 days), 3 weeks before the EORTC/MSG time point, in 72 (87%) of 83 responders. Agreement between definitions was shown in all 32 nonresponders and in 73 of the 83 responders (91% overall), with an excellent κ correlation coefficient of 0.819. Among 10 patients with discordant response (EORTC/MSG failure, GMI success), 1 is alive without IA 3 years after diagnosis; for the other, aspergillosis could not be detected at autopsy. The presence of other life-threatening complications in the remaining 8 patients indicates that IA had resolved.

Conclusions

The Aspergillus-specific GMI-based criteria compare favorably to current response definitions for IA and significantly shorten time to response assessment. These criteria rely on a simple, reproducible, objective, and Aspergillus-specific test and should serve as the primary endpoint in trials of IA.

### Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction: systematic review of evidence for clinical use in comparison with antigen testing [^116ihihd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was excluded from the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions of invasive fungal disease because of limited standardization and validation. The definitions are being revised.

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed to identify analytical and clinical information available on inclusion of galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA) (2002) and β-d-glucan (2008), providing a minimal threshold when considering PCR. Categorical parameters and statistical performance were compared.

Results

When incorporated, GM-EIA and β-d-glucan sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis were 81.6% and 91.6%, and 76.9% and 89.4%, respectively. Aspergillus PCR has similar sensitivity and specificity (76.8%-88.0% and 75.0%-94.5%, respectively) and comparable utility. Methodological recommendations and commercial PCR assays assist standardization. Although all tests have limitations, currently, PCR is the only test with independent quality control.

Conclusions

We propose that there is sufficient evidence that is at least equivalent to that used to include GM-EIA and β-d-glucan testing, and that PCR is now mature enough for inclusion in the EORTC/MSG definitions.

### Assessment of the role of 1, 3-β-D-glucan testing for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in adults [^113KGfWy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Detection of 1,3-β-d-glucan (BDG) in serum has been evaluated for its inclusion as a mycological criterion of invasive fungal infections (IFI) according to EORTC and Mycoses Study Group (MSG) definitions. BDG testing may be useful for the diagnosis of both invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis, when interpreted in conjunction with other clinical/radiological signs and microbiological markers of IFI. However, its performance and utility vary according to patient population (hematologic cancer patients, solid-organ transplant recipients, intensive care unit patients) and pretest likelihood of IFI. The objectives of this article are to provide a systematic review of the performance of BDG testing and to assess recommendations for its use and interpretation in different clinical settings.

### The role of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan in the diagnosis of pediatric invasive aspergillosis [^115Ca4et]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Molecular biomarkers such as the galactomannan assay are of increasing interest in clinical settings for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). The use of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan (BAL GM) is being validated in adult populations, but has not been systematically evaluated in pediatric patients.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed of patients for whom GM assays from BAL were submitted between November 1, 2006 and November14, 2007 at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Medical charts were reviewed and patients were categorized as having no, possible, probable, and proven IA, per established definitions.

Results

Of 85 pediatric patients who had a BAL GM submitted during the study, 59 were immunocompromised. Three patients were identified as having proven IA, 6 had probable IA, 37 had possible IA, and 39 had no evidence of IA; 38 had a concurrent serum GM performed. A positive, linear correlation was established between BAL and serum GM, using OD index values (rho = 0.48, P = 0.002). Among immunocompromised patients, receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated an optimal BAL GM OD cut-off value of 0.87, that yielded a sensitivity for probable/proven IA of 78% and a specificity of 100%. At 0.87, the positive and negative predictive values among immunocompromised patients were 58% and 96%, respectively.

Conclusions

We found a correlation between BAL GM values and a diagnosis of IA. We also noted a linear relationship between serum and BAL GM values. Receiver operating characteristic curves obtained from our pediatric data validate the current cut off for serum and suggest a possible cut off for BAL specimens.

### Performance of existing definitions and tests for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in critically ill, adult patients: a systematic review with qualitative evidence synthesis [^114LXWvf]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the available evidence on the diagnostic performance for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in non-hematological, non-solid organ transplantation critically ill patients of the following: (i) existing definitions of IA (developed either for classical immunocompromised populations or for non-immunocompromised critically ill patients); (ii) laboratory tests; (iii) radiology tests.

Methods

A systematic review was performed by evaluating studies assessing the diagnostic performance for IA of a definition/s and/or laboratory/radiology test/s vs. a reference standard (histology) or a reference definition.

Results

Sufficient data for evaluating the performance of existing definitions and laboratory tests for the diagnosis of IA in critically ill patients is available only for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Against histology/autopsy as reference, the AspICU definition showed a promising diagnostic performance but based on small samples and applicable only to patients with positive respiratory cultures. Studies on laboratory tests consistently indicated a better diagnostic performance of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) galactomannan (GM) than serum GM, and a suboptimal specificity of BALF and serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan.

Conclusions

Evidence stemming from this systematic review will guide the discussion for defining invasive aspergillosis within the FUNDICU project. The project aims to develop a standard set of definitions for invasive fungal diseases in critically ill, adult patients.

### Diagnostic accuracy of PCR alone compared to galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: a systematic review [^11639GAn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid has not been accepted as a diagnostic criterion for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). We conducted a systematic review assessing the diagnostic accuracy of PCR in BAL fluid with a direct comparison versus galactomannan (GM) in BAL fluid. We included prospective and retrospective cohort and case-control studies. Studies were included if they used the EORTC/MSG consensus definition criteria of IPA and assessed ≥ 80% of patients at risk for IPA. Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. Summary sensitivity and specificity values were estimated using a bivariate model and reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Nineteen studies published between 1993 and 2012 were included. The summary sensitivity and specificity values (CIs) for diagnosis of proven or probable IPA were 90.2% (77.2 to 96.1%) and 96.4% (93.3 to 98.1%), respectively. In nine cohort studies strictly adherent to the 2002 or 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria for reference standard definitions, the summary sensitivity and specificity values (CIs) were 77.2% (62 to 87.6%) and 93.5% (90.6 to 95.6%), respectively. Antifungal treatment before bronchoscopy significantly reduced sensitivity. The diagnostic performance of PCR was similar to that of GM in BAL fluid using an optical density index cutoff of 0.5. If either PCR or GM in BAL fluid defined a positive result, the pooled sensitivity was higher than that of GM alone, with similar specificity. We conclude that the diagnostic performance of PCR in BAL fluid is good and comparable to that of GM in BAL fluid. Performing both tests results in optimal sensitivity with no loss of specificity. Results are dependent on the reference standard definitions.

Recommendations for Specific Diagnostic Questions

Question 1

Is serum and/or BAL GM testing sufficiently accurate to guide therapeutic decisions in place of histopathology and/or fungal culture in patients with impaired immunity suspected of having IPA?

Background

Patients with impaired immunity, including those with neutropenia, hematological malignancies, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and lung and other solid organ transplants are at risk for IPA. In addition, IPA has been reported in intubated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly those receiving corticosteroids, and after influenza. Pulmonary infiltrates are frequently present but are not specific; other times, patients with early disease or extrapulmonary aspergillosis may even present with normal chest imaging studies. The "gold standard" for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis requires tissue histopathology confirmation of the invasion of hyphae or a positive culture for Aspergillus spp. in the appropriate clinical setting. Unfortunately, in many of these patients, tissue biopsy cannot be obtained, owing to excessive bleeding risk or tenuous respiratory status. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the culture from BAL ranges from 30% to 60%. Initiation of appropriate therapy is particularly important in this often very tenuous population because invasive aspergillosis carries a high mortality and can be greater than 50% if not adequately treated in critically ill patients. An early and accurate diagnosis using less invasive techniques is therefore preferred, making serum and BAL GM a very attractive alternative test.

### Role of galactomannan determinations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: a prospective study [^117CzViS]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The current study has several limitations. First, since the collection and processing of BALF samples has not yet been standardized, we followed the method used in a previous study. Second is the relatively small sample size. Third, serum GM and LRT Aspergillus isolation were included in the criteria to define IPA. This may have caused 'incorporation bias'. By incorporating the test(s) under evaluation in the reference standard (the IPA criteria), the sensitivity and specificity of these tests may look higher than they are in reality. Finally, although all probable IPA patients enrolled were non-survivors, post-mortem examinations were rejected by the family members of these patients and were not performed for a definitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.

Aspergillus PCR — next steps when PCR is negative despite high suspicion: In patients with severe immunocompromise such as those with hematological malignancy or transplant recipients who are strongly suspected of having IPA but have a negative Aspergillus PCR, we recommend consideration of biopsy and/or additional testing with or without additional nonculture PCR or galactomannan (GM) testing (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113ufCdS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) — serum galactomannan (GM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) GM, and Aspergillus PCR testing are recommended in defined immunocompromised settings. In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with neutropenia or hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants presenting with unexplained lung infiltrates suspected of IPA, we recommend the use of serum GM testing (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). In patients suspected of invasive fungal diseases, including those with a negative serum GM but strong risk factors for invasive aspergillosis or positive serum GM but confounding factors for false-positive GM results, we recommend BAL testing with GM (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants who are suspected of having IPA, we recommend the use of blood or serum Aspergillus PCR testing (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants who are suspected of having IPA, we recommend the inclusion of Aspergillus PCR in BAL testing as part of the evaluation (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants who are strongly suspected of having IPA but in whom the result of PCR testing for Aspergillus is negative, we suggest consideration of biopsy and/or additional testing with or without additional PCR or GM testing (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114zNgpr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Biomarker monitoring in IA — serial monitoring of serum galactomannan (GM) can be used in appropriate patient subpopulations (hematologic malignancy, allogeneic HSCT) who have an elevated GM at baseline to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response, and predict outcome (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), whereas (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan has not been extensively studied in IA to predict outcome (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Multiple studies have evaluated serial serum GM and found excellent correlations between GMI and outcomes, including a review of 27 published studies with excellent correlation between GMI and survival, and a prospective study of 70 patients with prolonged neutropenia showing good correlation with clinical outcome at 6 weeks and excellent correlation at 12 weeks, with significantly better survival in patients who became GM negative by 12 weeks; another prospective study found significantly better survival in patients whose GMI normalized compared to those with persistently positive GM, regardless of resolution of neutropenia.

### Progress on nonculture based diagnostic tests for invasive mould infection [^113aR8xY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the current status of diagnosing invasive mould disease and Pneumocystis pneumonia using nonconventional diagnostics methods.

Recent Findings

There has been significant development in the range of nonculture mycological tests. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) for diagnosing aspergillosis complement galactomannan ELISA testing, and LFTs for other fungal diseases are in development. Rapid and low through-put B-D-Glucan assays increase access to testing and there has been significant progress in the standardization/development of molecular tests. Despite this, no single perfect test exists and combining tests (e.g., antigen and molecular testing) is likely required for the optimal diagnosis of most fungal diseases.

Summary

Based on established clinical performance few mycological tests can be used alone for optimal diagnosis of fungal disease (FD) and combining tests, including classical approaches is the preferred route for confirming and excluding disease. Next-generation sequencing will likely play an increasing role in how we diagnose disease, but optimization, standardization and validation of the entire molecular process is needed and we must consider how host biomarkers can stratify risk. Given the burden of FD in low- and medium-income countries, improved access to novel but more so existing diagnostic testing is critical along with simplification of testing processes.

### Utility of aspergillus antigen detection in specimens other than serum specimens [^113YncNF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of circulating galactomannan in serum is an important tool for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Platelia Aspergillus; BioRad) was shown to be both highly sensitive and specific for detection of galactomannan in serum samples. Despite the fact that this assay is validated for serum samples, specimens of other body fluids are increasingly used for detection of galactomannan, including urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. Review of the literature shows that galactomannan can be detected in each of these samples from patients with invasive aspergillosis with higher sensitivity than is the case with culture, as well as early in the course of infection. However, the evidence thus far is based on case reports — predominantly retrospective studies — that often include heterogeneous patient populations and limited numbers of cases of proven infection. Clearly, well-designed prospective studies with systematic sampling and use of consensus case definitions are needed to compare the performance of antigen detection in samples other than serum specimens with that in serum specimens.

### Invasive mycoses: diagnostic challenges [^111vwqNV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of newer antifungal drugs, outcomes for patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) continue to be poor, in large part due to delayed diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy. Standard histopathologic diagnostic techniques are often untenable in at-risk patients, and culture-based diagnostics typically are too insensitive or nonspecific, or provide results after too long a delay for optimal IFI management. Newer surrogate markers of IFIs with improved sensitivity and specificity are needed to enable earlier diagnosis and, ideally, to provide prognostic information and/or permit therapeutic monitoring. Surrogate assays should also be accessible and easy to implement in the hospital. Several nonculture-based assays of newer surrogates are making their way into the medical setting or are currently under investigation. These new or up-and-coming surrogates include antigens/antibodies (mannan and antimannan antibodies) or fungal metabolites (d-arabinitol) for detection of invasive candidiasis, the Aspergillus cell wall component galactomannan used to detect invasive aspergillosis, or the fungal cell wall component and panfungal marker β-glucan. In addition, progress continues with use of polymerase chain reaction- or other nucleic acid- or molecular-based assays for diagnosis of either specific or generic IFIs, although the various methods must be better standardized before any of these approaches can be more fully implemented into the medical setting. Investigators are also beginning to explore the possibility of combining newer surrogate markers with each other or with more standard diagnostic approaches to improve sensitivity, specificity, and capacity for earlier diagnosis, at a time when fungal burden is still relatively low and more responsive to antifungal therapy.

### Challenges with utilizing the 1, 3-beta-D-glucan and galactomannan assays to diagnose invasive mold infections in immunocompromised children [^111192Su]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Establishing the diagnosis of invasive mold infections (IMI) in immunocompromised children is challenging due to nonspecific clinical presentations and the limited sensitivity of traditional culture-based methods. Rapid non-culture-based diagnostics such as the 1,3-beta-d-glucan and galactomannan assays have emerged as promising adjuncts to conventional diagnostic tests in adults. Available data suggest that 1,3-beta-d-glucan has limited accuracy in the pediatric population and is not recommended to be used for the diagnosis of IMI in children. On the other hand, the diagnostic performance of the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan in immunocompromised children is comparable to results observed in adults and can be used as a screening tool in children at high risk of developing invasive aspergillosis (IA) who are not receiving mold-active antifungal prophylaxis and as a diagnostic tool in symptomatic children suspected of having IA. Herein, we summarize the available evidence for the use of these rapid non-culture-based diagnostics in immunocompromised children. We also summarize potential causes of false positivity for the 1,3-beta-d-glucan and galactomannan assays.

Conclusions

Compared to serum GM and LRT Aspergillus isolation, BALF GM appears to have a higher sensitivity in the early diagnosis of IPA in critically ill COPD patients. The ROC curve suggests a possible cut off value of 0.8 for BALF specimens. Evidence-based prospective studies are needed for further evaluation of the usefulness and standardization of the procedure of BALF GM in critically ill COPD patients.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115SG7oQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Serum galactomannan (GM) — recommendations and technical remarks: In patients with severe immunocompromise who present with unexplained lung infiltrates suspected of IPA, we recommend the use of serum GM testing (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). A serum GM index cutoff of 1.0 provides the best diagnostic performance characteristics, but this is based on 7 studies using a cutoff of 1.0 and 29 studies using a cutoff of 0.5. We suggest cautious interpretation of serum GM data in patients receiving antifungal therapy, but the test can still be applied in these settings and interpreted in the context of other clinical information. PCR approaches may provide another diagnostic approach as discussed elsewhere.

### Antifungal therapy decreases sensitivity of the aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay [^115Jk3cU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Reported sensitivity of the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay as an early diagnostic test for invasive aspergillosis (IA) has been widely variable, ranging from 29% to 100% in earlier clinical studies.

Methods

Studies performed to date have analyzed performance using per-patient calculations, limiting their ability to measure the impact of clinical variables that change over time, such as receipt of preventive antifungal therapy. In our study, performance of the test was calculated in per-patient and per-test analyses in a large cohort of patients at high risk for IA from 2 North American centers. A total of 272 serum samples obtained from 46 patients with IA and 3005 serum samples obtained from 269 control patients were analyzed using multiple index cutoff values to define positivity.

Results

Per-patient calculations yielded sensitivities of 43% and 70% using index cutoff values of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively; specificity decreased from 93% with use of the 1.5 index cutoff to 70% with use of the 0.5 index cutoff. Per-test calculations yielded sensitivities of 31% and 59% and specificities of 99% and 92% using index cutoff values of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively. Receipt of mold-active antifungal drugs on the day of testing decreased sensitivity; samples obtained from patients not receiving prophylactic or empirical antifungal drugs yielded a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 92% (with use of an index cutoff value of 0.5).

Conclusions

These findings have direct implications for preventive strategies, because the diagnostic utility of the antigen assay is compromised during receipt of prophylactic or empirical antifungal therapies.

### Serum galactomannan versus a combination of galactomannan and polymerase chain reaction-based aspergillus DNA detection for early therapy of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk hematological patients: a randomized controlled trial [^112ht9fZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of the combination of serum galactomannan (GM) assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of serum Aspergillus DNA for the early diagnosis and therapy of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk hematological patients remains unclear.

Methods

We performed an open-label, controlled, parallel-group randomized trial in 13 Spanish centers. Adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome on induction therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to 1 of 2 arms: "GM-PCR group" (the results of serial serum GM and PCR assays were provided to treating physicians) and "GM group" (only the results of serum GM were informed). Positivity in either assay prompted thoracic computed tomography scan and initiation of antifungal therapy. No antimold prophylaxis was permitted.

Results

Overall, 219 patients underwent randomization (105 in the GM-PCR group and 114 in the GM group). The cumulative incidence of "proven" or "probable" IA (primary study outcome) was lower in the GM-PCR group (4.2% vs 13.1%; odds ratio, 0.29 [95% confidence interval, .09-.91]). The median interval from the start of monitoring to the diagnosis of IA was lower in the GM-PCR group (13 vs 20 days; p = 0.022), as well as the use of empirical antifungal therapy (16.7% vs 29.0%; p = 0.038). Patients in the GM-PCR group had higher proven or probable IA-free survival (P = 0.027).

Conclusions

A combined monitoring strategy based on serum GM and Aspergillus DNA was associated with an earlier diagnosis and a lower incidence of IA in high-risk hematological patients. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT01742026.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111C7dtc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Overview

The purpose of this guideline is to analyze evidence relevant to commonly available laboratory testing, including the use of specific antigen tests, serological assays (serum antibody detection), and PCR studies for diagnosis of fungal infections commonly encountered in pulmonary and critical care practice. These guidelines focus on the use of galactomannan (GM) antigen and PCR testing in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), (1→3)-β — glucan (BDG) assays for invasive candidiasis (IC), and the use of antigen and antibody testing in the diagnosis of endemic mycosis.

### Does galactomannan testing increase diagnostic accuracy for IPA in the ICU? A prospective observational study [^113R37sh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The major strength of the modified algorithm was the reduction of underdiagnosis of patients with IPA and negative Aspergillus cultures. The diagnosis of IPA in the ICU is notoriously difficult. The gold standard, histopathological analysis, is often unavailable, not feasible or considered too risky. In our study, we compared the AspICU clinical criteria and EORTC/MSG criteria with clinical diagnosis of IPA formulated as a decision to treat. In our setting, the EORTC/MSG criteria would result in a much lower yield (Fig. 1), resulting in underdiagnosis of IPA. There was much greater agreement between patients diagnosed with IPA and the clinical decision to treat when AspICU criteria were used. However, the AspICU clinical algorithm demands a positive Aspergillus culture as an entry criterion. However, up to 50% of IPA infections are not culture-positive, and relying on a positive culture might result in withholding treatment to patients with an active infection. Including the positive galactomannan test as an entry criterion, we identified patients (the OPG group) with the same risk factors, demographic data and outcome as patients with positive fungal culture. This OPG group had the same proportion of Aspergillus-positive thoracic imaging as the culture-positive group as defined by EORTC/MSG criteria. Interestingly, the only two patients with histologically proven IPA had a negative Aspergillus culture but positive BALF galactomannan antigen.

Key messages

- Compared to serum GM and LRT culture, BALF GM appears to have an increased sensitivity in the diagnosis of IPA in critically ill COPD patients.

- A possible cut off value of OD ratio of 0.8 for GM from BALF specimens may be suggested for the diagnosis of IPA in critically ill COPD patients.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115g1ebf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Aspergillosis biomarkers — Galactomannan (GM) and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) performance and caveats are summarized as follows: The detection of GM in BAL fluid has been shown to have a sensitivity that exceeds 70% in most studies and provides additional sensitivity compared with culture even with mold-active antifungal therapy. The Fungitell assay for detection of (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan is cleared by the FDA for the diagnosis of invasive mycoses, including aspergillosis, but BDG is not specific for Aspergillus species; other invasive mycoses can yield positive results. Comparative studies have reported that Fungitell may be slightly more sensitive than GM for invasive aspergillosis (IA) but with poor specificity, and others have found it is not as helpful; in a large cancer center study comparing GM and BDG prospectively over a 3-year period in 82 patients, each for 12 weeks, the (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assay was more sensitive than GM for IA and other mold infections in patients with hematological malignancy. False-positive BDG results can occur from glucan-contaminated collection materials and certain drugs, including some antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115FhNHY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedure and galactomannan (GM) testing — there is no uniform agreement on the best timing for bronchoscopy, with consensus that hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are nonneutropenic and do not have cavitary infiltrates on chest CT scan should receive bronchoscopy only after a failure of empiric antimicrobial therapy; BAL is an invasive procedure that requires instruction and consent and sufficient respiratory capacity, and large series report major bronchoscopy-related complications rates between 0.08% and 0.5%, with mortality rates of 0%–0.04%. In a standardized BAL procedure in 248 consecutive cancer patients, thrombocytopenia was not considered a contraindication, and platelet transfusions were administered for platelet counts < 20 000 platelets/μL. BAL is usually performed in the segmental or subsegmental bronchus of the most affected area of the lung based on a recent CT scan; saline is the most often used fluid, and false-positive Aspergillus GM detection tests were reported when Plasmalyte was used. The instilled volume in nonpediatric patients should be at least 100 mL (most commonly 100–150 mL) in aliquots of 20–50 mL, and BAL samples should be sent for cytologic assessment, Gram staining, fungal staining, culture, and GM. GM testing from BAL samples provides additional sensitivity compared to culture and exceeds 70% in most studies; the optimal threshold has not been determined, with an OD of 1.0 cleared by the FDA for clinical testing and some centers positing positivity at OD > 0.5, and a higher threshold OD index results in a lower sensitivity but a higher specificity.

### COVID-19-associated invasive aspergillosis: data from the UK national mycology reference laboratory [^111XzvUJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) was recently reported as a potential infective complication affecting critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with incidence rates varying from 8 to 33% depending on the study. However, definitive diagnosis of CAPA is challenging. Standardized diagnostic algorithms and definitions are lacking, clinicians are reticent to perform aerosol-generating bronchoalveolar lavages for galactomannan testing and microscopic and cultural examination, and questions surround the diagnostic sensitivity of different serum biomarkers. Between 11 March and 14 July 2020, the UK National Mycology Reference Laboratory received 1,267 serum and respiratory samples from 719 critically ill UK patients with COVID-19 and suspected pulmonary aspergillosis. The laboratory also received 46 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from COVID-19 patients (including three that exhibited environmental triazole resistance). Diagnostic tests performed included 1,000 (1–3)-β-d-glucan and 516 galactomannan tests on serum samples. The results of this extensive testing are presented here. For a subset of 61 patients, respiratory specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, tracheal aspirates, and sputum samples) in addition to serum samples were submitted and subjected to galactomannan testing, Aspergillus -specific PCR, and microscopy and culture. The incidence of probable/proven and possible CAPA in this subset of patients was approximately 5% and 15%, respectively. Overall, our results highlight the challenges in biomarker-driven diagnosis of CAPA, especially when only limited clinical samples are available for testing, and the importance of a multimodal diagnostic approach involving regular and repeat testing of both serum and respiratory samples.

### Detection of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: analytical and clinical validity [^114BKoxb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is frequent and often fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Timely diagnosis of IPA improves survival but is difficult to make. We examined the analytical and clinical validity of galactomannan (GM) testing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in diagnosing IPA in a mixed population by retrospectively reviewing records of 251 consecutive at-risk patients for whom BAL fluid GM testing was ordered. The performance of the enzyme immunoassay was evaluated by using a range of index cutoffs to define positivity. Three samples were associated with proven IPA, 56 were associated with probable IPA, 63 were associated with possible invasive fungal disease (IFD), and 129 were associated with no IFD. Using a BAL fluid GM index of ≥ 0.8 (optimal optical density [OD] index cutoff identified by a receiver operating characteristic curve), the sensitivity in diagnosing proven and probable IPA was 86.4%, and the specificity was 90.7%. At this cutoff, positive and negative predictive values were 81% and 93.6%, respectively. However, an OD index value of ≥ 3.0 corresponded to a 100% specificity, thus ruling the disease in, irrespective of the pretest probability. Conversely, an OD index cutoff of < 0.5 corresponded to a high sensitivity, virtually always ruling the disease out. For all values in between, the posttest probability of IPA depends largely on the prevalence of disease in the at-risk population and the likelihood ratio of the OD index value. Detection of GM in BAL fluid samples of patients at risk of IPA has an excellent diagnostic accuracy provided results are interpreted in parallel with clinico-radiological findings and pretest probabilities.

### Serum galactomannan-based early detection of invasive aspergillosis in hematology patients receiving effective antimold prophylaxis [^116a34qv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is a practical need to investigate the performance of the serum galactomannan (GM) assay in hematology patients with a potentially low pretest risk of invasive aspergillosis following effective antimold prophylaxis.

Methods

We present a 4-year study with 262 unselected consecutive high-risk episodes, prospectively managed with posaconazole primary prophylaxis and a uniform diagnostic algorithm, including biweekly serum GM quantification for early detection of invasive aspergillosis.

Results

A total of 2972 serum GM tests were performed (median, 11 per episode [range, 3–30]); the vast majority were negative (96.7% of tests and 83.6% of episodes). The incidence of breakthrough invasive aspergillosis was 1.9% (5/262), all with true-positive GM test results. Our study identified 30 false-positive GM evaluable episodes (85.7%; 13.8% of all evaluable episodes), validating with real-life data the low positive predictive value of the assay in this setting (12%). In 26 of these 30 episodes (86.7%), the false-positive result(s) occurred in tests performed as preemptive surveillance only. Conversely, in evaluable cases with positive GM tests and a clinical suspicion of invasive fungal disease, the performance of diagnostic-driven GM tests improved, with a positive predictive value of 89.6%.

Conclusions

The low pretest risk of invasive aspergillosis in the context of effective antimold prophylaxis renders serum GM surveillance of asymptomatic patients unreliable, as all results would be either negative or false positive. The test remains useful to diagnose patients with a clinical suspicion of invasive fungal disease, calling for a more efficient copositioning of effective prophylaxis and GM testing in this clinical setting.

### Galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid: a tool for diagnosing aspergillosis in intensive care unit patients [^115FbbXm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, IA appears to be gaining a foothold in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients without classical risk factors. A recent study described 89 cases of IA in patients in a medical ICU without leukemia or cancer. The diagnosis of IA remains difficult and is often established too late. Galactomannan (GM) is an exo-antigen released from Aspergillus hyphae while they invade host tissue.

Objectives

This prospective single-center study was conducted to investigate the role of GM in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a tool for early diagnosis of IA in the ICU.

Methods

All patients with risk factors identified in our earlier study were evaluated. BAL for culture and GM detection, serum GM levels, and computed tomography scan were obtained for all included patients with signs of pneumonia. Patients were classified as having proven, probable, or possible IA.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 110 patients out of 1,109 admissions were eligible. There were 26 proven IA cases. Using a cutoff index of 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity of GM detection in BAL fluid was 88 and 87%, respectively. The sensitivity of serum GM was only 42%. In 11 of 26 proven cases, BAL culture and serum GM remained negative, whereas GM in BAL was positive.

Conclusions

IA is common in immunocompromised, critically ill patients. GM detection in BAL fluid seems to be useful in establishing or excluding the diagnosis of IA in the ICU.

### Galactomannan antigen testing for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in pediatric hematology patients [^114hAeeH]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) can cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. The galactomannan (GM) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been shown in adult studies to be a useful adjunct in diagnosing IA. Data on this assay in children are limited by small sample sizes and conflicting results; false-positive assays were a concern in historical studies. We sought to evaluate the GM EIA in a large cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. A focus was placed on evaluating the assay specificity, and the potential of measuring GM antigen in urine.

Methods

A multicenter prospective observational study in children with anticipated prolonged neutropenia was performed. Serum specimens were collected twice weekly, and urine was collected once weekly during neutropenic periods. Operating characteristics were calculated using the GM EIA optical density index cutoffs of 0.5 and 1.0 for both serum and urine specimens.

Results

At least one serum or urine specimen was tested from 198 patients. Ten patients had one or more repeatedly positive serum specimens, while 37 patients had one or more repeatedly positive urine specimens. The specificity of serum and urine testing was 95% and 80%, respectively. Although the urine test resulted in a higher false positivity rate, it successfully identified the only case of probable IA.

Conclusions

Data suggest that the serum GM EIA does not provide frequent false-positive results as previously reported. Screening for galactomannan, or a related antigen in urine, needs to be further evaluated as it may be amenable to development of surveillance strategies.

### Galactomannan testing during mold-active prophylaxis [^111skzDg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

How do Duarte's findings affect prophylactic strategies? At the University Hospital of Cologne, galactomannan screening 3 times weekly was routine practice when posaconazole prophylaxis was introduced in January 2006. In 2003–2005, we ran 6950 serum galactomannan assays on samples of 190 patients, or 35 galactomannan tests per patient. When we abandoned galactomannan screening during prophylaxis in 2009, the average number substantially decreased to 8 galactomannan tests per patient (2391 tests in 273 patients) (Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients, NCT01821456).

Should we stop all galactomannan testing? There is at least one caveat: The pretest probability of the galactomannan test increases, if the test is not used for screening but for confirmation of IFI in symptomatic patients. Persistent fever of unknown etiology should always trigger a chest computed tomographic scan regardless of posaconazole prophylaxis, as any lung infiltrate should prompt bronchoalveolar lavage for microbiological and virological workup. In Cologne we do, for example, test galactomannan on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, although there is an ongoing debate regarding its diagnostic value. Our infectious diseases team further advises that an investigational galactomannan test series be done over 5 consecutive days to confirm the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, we quite intensely use galactomannan for the purpose of confirming disease, in a situation where the positive predictive value reaches almost 90%.

Importantly, Duarte reminds us that the result of any in vitro diagnostic assay needs to be interpreted in the clinical context. Appreciating all known uncertainties of the galactomannan assay, there are populations where galactomannan screening is considered state of the art. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, vinca alkaloids are a cornerstone of induction chemotherapy regimens, but mold-active azoles inhibit their metabolism, resulting in neuropathy. Azole prophylaxis is not recommended, and alternative prophylactic regimens are currently undergoing clinical evaluation (eg, in the Ambiguard trial [NCT01259713].

In general, it becomes apparent that we need more advanced in vitro diagnostic assays. Ideally these would detect not only Aspergillus species, but other unmet clinical needs, for example, in managing mucormycosis. Although we may have to wait for such tests to arrive, what we can tackle immediately is education. Every large hospital treating patients with hematological malignancy should establish multidisciplinary teams focusing on infections in these patients, because management of invasive fungal infection is far too complex to be dealt with by one specialty alone.

### Does galactomannan testing increase diagnostic accuracy for IPA in the ICU? A prospective observational study [^114KANTa]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The cutoff point for galactomannan antigen testing in BALF has been widely debated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for the galactomannan test in BALF by positive culture for Aspergillus species produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.709 (Additional file 1: Figure S3). At the cutoff of a galactomannan titer of 1.0 EIA, the sensitivity and specificity for positive culture were 94.3% and 38.1%, respectively. For the cutoff of 3.0 EIA, the sensitivity and specificity for positive culture was 71.8% and 61.9%, respectively.

Our study has several limitations. The number of patients with histologically proven IPA was small. Prospective studies with histological analysis as the gold standard would be helpful. However, diagnostic lung biopsy is often not feasible in critically ill, ventilated patients who also often have impaired hemostasis and thrombocytopenia. The number of patients included in our study does not allow us to compare the outcome of those who received antimycotic treatments and those who did not. Mortality was high in both the PAC group and the OPG group; however, the outcomes in our study were better than those published elsewhere. The 12-week mortality in the recent follow-up AspICU study was 66% and 73% in patients with and without immunosuppression, respectively, compared with 180-day mortality of 59% in our study. One explanation might be that the use of BALF galactomannan as a biomarker led to more timely antimycotic therapy and thus, improved the outcome.

The effectiveness of galactomannan detection with the Platelia test was evaluated in a prospective study of 3,327 sera from 807 patients. The specificity was 99.6% (748 of 751 cases). For the groups of patients with proven and probable invasive aspergillosis, the sensitivity was 50.0% (17 of 34 cases). The disappointing sensitivity associated with the presence of rare false-positive cases underlines the limits of this test.

### Detection of galactomannan antigenemia by enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: variables that affect performance [^113B58vs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a frequent complication of blood or marrow transplantation. Previous studies have reported that the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM EIA) may be a useful diagnostic tool for IA, but its sensitivity is variable. We examined the performance of the GM EIA in 986 serum samples from 67 patients. Results demonstrated that decreasing the index cutoff for positivity to 0.5 increased its sensitivity, with minimal loss of specificity. The low cutoff increased the duration of test positivity before diagnosis by clinical means. Sensitivity was highest in patients who did not receive preventative mold-active antifungals (87.5%). A rabbit model demonstrated that the level of circulating antigen correlated with the tissue fungus burden. A quantifiable response to antifungal therapy in clinical samples and the rabbit model supports the development of this assay for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. The 0.5 cutoff may allow for better performance as an early diagnostic test.

### Detecting influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis by determination of galactomannan in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid and in serum: should we add (1, 3)-β-D-glucan to improve efficacy [^115TZRma]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the recent research letter by Thevissen et al. who reported the findings of their international survey regarding the detection of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA), with a focus on the use of galactomannan (GM) in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum. They note that greater awareness of IAPA is needed, as are rapid diagnostic tests. We would like to make some comments. Indeed, over the past decades, the patient population having invasive aspergillosis (IA) or IAPA risk factors has expanded significantly, and given that IA/IAPA is associated with high morbidity and mortality, improved diagnostic modalities are required. GM is currently a commonly used method and has a high specificity for IA/IAPA diagnosis, while another test, the (1,3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) assay, has a high negative predictive value (NPV), making it quite useful to rule out IA/IAPA rather than to confirm it. GM and BDG assays can play an important role in IA/IAPA diagnosis in non-neutropenic patients with underlying respiratory diseases without hematologic malignancy. BDG is the most important and abundant polysaccharide component of the cell wall of most fungi. While incorporated within the fungal cell wall, BDG typically exists as an insoluble structure. In the presence of blood or other body fluids, it transforms into single helix, triple helix (most commonly), or random coil forms and is rendered soluble. The GM assay has been found to be more specific than BDG (97% versus 82%) and BDG more sensitive than GM (81% versus 49%), suggesting that a combination of both tests could strengthen the diagnosis of IA/IAPA. We would like to conclude that GM was found to have high diagnostic specificity, while BDG displayed better sensitivity. Either test used alone carries a certain level of diagnostic limitation. A combination of both assays would improve the diagnostic capacity.

### Serum galactomannan antigen test for the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis [^112SoCr1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A serum galactomannan (GM) antigen test has been widely used to diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. However, there are limited data on the use of the serum GM antigen test for the serologic diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA).

Methods

Data were collected from all consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of CPA who underwent a serum GM antigen test.

Results

In total, 334 patients who were suspected to have CPA were eligible for this study and 168 (50%) patients were finally diagnosed with CPA. The serum GM antigen test was positive in 38 (23%) patients with CPA and in 25 (15%) patients without CPA. The sensitivity of the serum GM antigen test was 23% (95% confidence interval, 17–30%), and its specificity was 85% (95% CI, 79–90%), with positive and negative predictive values of 60% (95% CI, 47–72%) and 52% (95% CI, 46–58%), respectively. The accuracy of the test was 54%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.538 (95% CI, 0.496–0.580).

Conclusion

The serum GM antigen test could not be used for the serologic diagnosis of CPA.

### Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction: systematic review of evidence for clinical use in comparison with antigen testing [^111WWiKn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to aid diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) has been used for over 2 decades, but is not included in the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions of invasive fungal disease. In the 2002 definitions, PCR was excluded on the basis of potential false-positive results and lack of standardized commercial testing platforms. It was reconsidered when the definitions were revised in 2008, but despite continued development, molecular methods were not to be included because there was no standard; and clinically, validation was limited.

The EORTC/MSG definitions are currently under review. To provide impartial review of Aspergillus PCR technology, we reassessed information that was available at the time of inclusion of previous biomarkers, galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA) in 2002, and β — glucan (BDG) in 2008. This baseline information provides a systematic dataset for categorical and standardized comparison of PCR, and any other emerging or future diagnostic assays (eg, Aspergillus lateral flow device;. The evidence forms the basis for full review of manuscripts describing Aspergillus PCR allowing the EORTC/MSG consensus committee to consider PCR in future definitions.

This manuscript describes the findings of this initial review and is a joint effort of the European Aspergillus PCR initiative (EAPCRI), a working group of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology, the EORTC Infectious Disease Group, and the Mycoses Study Group (MSG).

### Combined real-time PCR and galactomannan surveillance improves diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in high risk patients with haematological malignancies [^1119wau1]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading complication of intensive treatment for haematological malignancies. Earlier diagnosis should facilitate effective antifungal therapy and prevent progression to invasive disease, which is often lethal. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, targeting the 28S and ITS ribosomal gene regions respectively, were evaluated for early detection of Aspergillus DNA and for diagnostic utility in patients receiving treatment in two busy haematopoietic stem cell transplant centres. Patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic transplant were eligible for inclusion in the study. EDTA blood and serum samples for circulating Aspergillus biomarkers, including galactomannan (GM), were collected twice-weekly on a prospective basis from all study patients who were categorized according to international consensus criteria for defining invasive fungal disease (IFD). Of 278 patients recruited there were 44 probable IA cases and only one proven case. Moderate sensitivity and specificity, poor positive predictive value (50–80%), but good negative predictive value (> 80–90%) were common to both PCR assays. Overall biomarker performance could be improved by combining positive results of either PCR assay with GM taken within a 12-d period. The addition of PCR to GM monitoring in high-risk patients with haematological malignancies provides greater diagnostic accuracy in invasive aspergillosis.
