## Question

Amaryl Bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Amaryl (glimepiride) can cause bradycardia and how to interpret any possible association between the two. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of glimepiride and whether it plausibly affects cardiac conduction. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and clinical trials say about heart rate or rhythm effects. Next, I will check for any mechanistic signals from systems biology or observational data. After that, I should review authoritative bradycardia guidelines to see if glimepiride is listed among drugs that induce bradycardia. Finally, I will consider indirect pathways such as hypoglycemia and drug–drug interactions, and synthesize a practical clinical conclusion with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled adverse effects. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that closes pancreatic β-cell KATP channels to stimulate insulin release. It is not designed to modulate cardiac ion channels, and the FDA labeling emphasizes hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity, and hematologic risks without listing bradycardia or conduction abnormalities among adverse reactions, which argues against a direct chronotropic effect from the drug itself [^111toS7d] [^114itQhr].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical trial safety data for any heart rate signals. In pooled placebo-controlled trials and head-to-head studies, the most common adverse reactions are hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea; there is no signal for bradycardia as a treatment-emergent adverse event, and in a comparator trial with liraglutide, glimepiride produced only a minimal mean pulse change of about 0.44 bpm, which is not clinically meaningful for bradycardia risk [^112smzhN] [^112quFsQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should check for indirect or mechanistic signals. A network-based analysis suggested glimepiride's protein–protein proximity to cardiac arrhythmia modules, but the authors explicitly caution that proximity does not equal causation and may even predict adverse effects rather than benefits; this is hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory, and should not override negative clinical and regulatory data [^114zATgZ].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guidelines catalog dozens of drugs that can induce or exacerbate bradycardia or conduction disease — beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics, psychoactive agents, opioids, and others — but glimepiride and sulfonylureas are not included on those lists, which further supports the absence of a recognized association [^115hNaNc] [^116YuBd2].

> But wait, what if the bradycardia is secondary to hypoglycemia rather than a direct drug effect. I need to ensure I consider that severe hypoglycemia can precipitate autonomic responses and, in susceptible patients with autonomic neuropathy or concomitant sympatholytics, may blunt warning symptoms and contribute to bradyarrhythmias indirectly; the labeling repeatedly warns about hypoglycemia risk and its masking by beta-blockers, which is the more plausible pathway if bradycardia is observed in a patient on glimepiride [^1134D45o] [^114itQhr].

> I should double-check for drug–drug interactions that could lower heart rate. Concomitant beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or other negative chronotropes are well-known causes of bradycardia; if a patient on glimepiride develops bradycardia, I need to check the medication list first for these culprits before attributing causality to glimepiride itself [^115hNaNc] [^116YuBd2].

> Let me reconsider the totality of evidence. Direct pharmacologic effect: unlikely given β-cell–selective KATP blockade and absence of bradycardia in labeling and trials. Clinical signals: none in trials or postmarketing summaries. Mechanistic hypotheses: suggestive but unconfirmed and possibly misleading. Guidelines: no mention of sulfonylureas as bradycardia-inducing drugs. Therefore, glimepiride does not cause bradycardia as a direct adverse effect, though severe hypoglycemia or interacting negative chronotropes could secondarily produce bradyarrhythmias in clinical practice [^112smzhN] [^115hNaNc].

> Clinically, I need to ensure that if a patient on glimepiride presents with bradycardia, I promptly evaluate for hypoglycemia and review concomitant medications that slow the heart. I should not reflexively discontinue glimepiride unless hypoglycemia is recurrent or dangerous, and instead manage the true precipitant while continuing appropriate diabetes therapy and following guideline-directed evaluation for bradycardia when indicated [^115hNaNc] [^114itQhr].

Amaryl (glimepiride) **does not directly cause bradycardia** [^114itQhr]; there is no evidence of a direct chronotropic effect or sinus node suppression. Bradycardia reported with glimepiride is rare and typically reflects **severe hypoglycemia** [^notfound] or interactions with negative chronotropes (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics) [^115hNaNc]. Management is to **treat hypoglycemia** [^114rSWmr], review and adjust concomitant drugs, and monitor the ECG if symptoms persist. No dose adjustment is needed solely for bradycardia unless hypoglycemia is present.

---

## Pharmacological profile and cardiovascular effects

Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that increases insulin secretion by closing pancreatic β-cell KATP channels [^115cYJ8d]; it is **not known to directly affect cardiac conduction or sinus node function**. Unlike some sulfonylureas, glimepiride does not meaningfully block cardiac KATP channels or ischemic preconditioning, arguing against a direct bradycardic effect [^111toS7d].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding bradycardia

There is **no robust clinical evidence** linking glimepiride to bradycardia; reported cases are rare and usually reflect indirect mechanisms such as severe hypoglycemia or drug interactions [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms potentially linking glimepiride to bradycardia

Although glimepiride does not directly cause bradycardia, **indirect mechanisms may contribute**:

- **Severe hypoglycemia**: Can trigger autonomic instability, including bradycardia, especially in patients with autonomic neuropathy or on sympatholytics [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Negative chronotropes (beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics) can cause or worsen bradycardia when combined with glimepiride [^115hNaNc].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia or other electrolyte shifts from hypoglycemia may predispose to arrhythmias, including bradycardia [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not list glimepiride as a cause of bradycardia**; management focuses on correcting hypoglycemia, reviewing concomitant medications, and monitoring the ECG if symptoms persist.

---

## Clinical management of bradycardia associated with glimepiride

When bradycardia occurs in a patient taking glimepiride:

- **Immediate assessment**: Check for hypoglycemia and treat promptly with glucose or glucagon if needed [^114rSWmr].
- **Review medications**: Identify and adjust interacting negative chronotropes when feasible [^115hNaNc].
- **Electrocardiographic monitoring**: Use ECG if bradycardia persists after correcting hypoglycemia and reviewing drugs.
- **Dose adjustment**: Consider reducing or discontinuing glimepiride only if recurrent hypoglycemia is implicated; no routine dose change is recommended for bradycardia alone.

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **higher risk of bradycardia** in the setting of glimepiride therapy:

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of hypoglycemia and autonomic neuropathy [^1134D45o].
- **Patients with autonomic neuropathy**: Blunted hypoglycemia awareness and autonomic instability [^114itQhr].
- **Patients on negative chronotropes**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or antiarrhythmics [^115hNaNc].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings regarding bradycardia** |
|-|-|
| Clinical trials | No consistent signal for bradycardia with glimepiride [^notfound] |
| Case reports | Rare bradycardia, usually with hypoglycemia or interactions [^notfound] |
| Guidelines | Glimepiride not listed as a cause of bradycardia [^115hNaNc] |
| Mechanistic studies | No direct cardiac chronotropic effect identified [^notfound] |

### Glimepiride in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the worldwide therapeutic experience [^116injAu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Sulfonylureas (SUs) have been used for many years as first-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose levels have not been effectively controlled by diet and exercise alone. Glimepiride is a once-daily SU that was introduced in 1995. Since then, a considerable body of evidence has been amassed regarding its use in type 2 diabetes.

Objective

This review provides a comprehensive summary of available data on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of glimepiride in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It also examines the use of glimepiride to achieve and maintain good glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in current clinical practice.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE for English-language studies published from 1990 to 2002. The search terms used were glimepiride, sulfonylureas, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The manufacturer of glimepiride provided additional information.

Results

Glimepiride differs from other SUs in a number of respects. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain than other SUs. Results of other studies suggest that glimepiride can be used in older patients and those with renal compromise. There is evidence that glimepiride preserves myocardial preconditioning, a protective mechanism that limits damage in the event of an ischemic event. Glimepiride can be used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin to optimize glycemic control.

Conclusion

Based on the evidence to date, glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily antidiabetic drug and provides an important treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes.

### Alectinib hydrochloride (Alecensa) [^11536u7w]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4	Bradycardia

Symptomatic bradycardia occurred in patients treated with ALECENSA.

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], bradycardia occurred in 11% of patients treated with ALECENSA. Twenty percent of 521 patients treated with ALECENSA, for whom serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were available, had post-dose heart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm).

Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. For asymptomatic bradycardia dose modification is not required. For symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, withhold ALECENSA until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate ≥ 60 bpm and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive medications. If bradycardia is attributable to a concomitant medication, resume ALECENSA at a reduced dose (see Table 2) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated.

Permanently discontinue ALECENSA in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Permanently discontinue ALECENSA for recurrence of life-threatening bradycardia.

Chronic SND management algorithm — Begin by confirming symptoms and ruling out reversible causes. If bradycardia is due to required guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) with no reasonable alternative, proceed to permanent pacing (Class I). If symptoms correlate with bradycardia, permanent pacing (Class I) is pursued. For cases not clearly symptomatic, oral theophylline (Class IIb) may be used, followed by reassessment of whether the response suggests symptomatic sinus node dysfunction and whether the patient is willing to have a permanent pacemaker (PPM). In patients who are asymptomatic or in whom symptoms do not correlate, permanent pacing is designated Class III: Harm.

### Efficacy and safety comparison of liraglutide, glimepiride, and placebo, all in combination with metformin, in type 2 diabetes: the LEAD (liraglutide effect and action in diabetes)-2 study [^114SYyFg]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The percentages of subjects withdrawn because of adverse events were generally greater in the liraglutide groups than in the glimepiride or placebo groups (Table 1). Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea were the gastrointestinal events that led to the withdrawal of 36 liraglutide-treated subjects (5% of all liraglutide-treated subjects) in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1). Most of these adverse event withdrawals caused by gastrointestinal disorders occurred during the first month of therapy. One subject in the 1.2 mg liraglutide group and one in the glimepiride group were withdrawn for acute pancreatitis during the study. Neither subject had a prior history of pancreatitis, and both subjects were hospitalized for 7 days and subsequently recovered. One death (cardiorespiratory arrest) was reported during the trial and occurred during the metformin run-in period, before randomization to treatment. A second subject had liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma during the trial and died after the trial had completed. Both deaths were unrelated to liraglutide treatment.

In general, minor hypoglycemia occurred at low incidence (∼3% of subjects in the placebo and liraglutide groups and 17% in the glimepiride group), resulting in a relatively low rate of reported minor hypoglycemia (0.03–0.14 events/year for the placebo and liraglutide groups and 1.23 events/year for the glimepiride group) that was significantly less for all three liraglutide groups than for the glimepiride group (P < 0.001). No major hypoglycemic events were reported.

No clinically relevant between-treatment differences were observed in physical examination findings, laboratory analyses (hematology and biochemistry analyses), electrocardiogram, or ophthalmoscopy. No significant differences in calcitonin laboratory values were found between the liraglutide groups and either the placebo or glimepiride group. Slight increases in pulse rate were observed in all treatment groups (2–3 bpm in the liraglutide groups and 1 bpm in the glimepiride and placebo groups). The increases in pulse in the 0.6 and 1.2 mg liraglutide groups were significantly greater than that in the glimepiride group (P = 0.012 and P = 0.024, respectively).

Results

Baseline characteristics of the patients

Of the 45 patients enrolled in this study, six (13%) were taking glibenclamide, one (2%) was taking gliclazide and fourteen (31%) were taking α-GI at the time of entry. All 45 patients were taking antihypertensive medications, such as angiotensin-converting converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) (27 patients, 60%), β-blockers (15 patients, 33%) or calcium channel antagonists (30 patients, 67%). Nine (20%) patients were taking diuretics and 26 (57%) patients were taking hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. The patients had histories of the following cardiovascular diseases: old myocardial infarction in 10 (22%), angina pectoris in seven (16%), old cerebral infarction in three (7%), heart failure in three (7%), abdominal aortic aneurysm in two (4%), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in two (4%), transient ischemic attack in one (2%) and an aortic dissection in one (%) patient.

Of the 45 enrolled patients, 11 patients were excluded from the analysis because of failed follow-up in 10 patients (3 patients: withdrawn, 7 patients: moved) and unstable angina pectoris in one patient, and thus, a total of 34 patients completed the study protocol (Figure 1). The clinical profiles of the 34 evaluated patients are shown in Table 1.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose — supportive therapy evidence and dosing show that calcium infusion has variable results with no randomized trial data, and a systematic review found 7 animal studies with benefit while human data were less consistent across 11 case series and 21 case reports, with calcium chloride or calcium gluconate commonly used. For glucagon, scores of case reports and case series exist with the largest comprising 9 patients but no clinical trials; in cardiac arrest, the standard therapy is a bolus of 3 to 10 mg over 3 to 5 minutes, after which an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h is also initiated, and side effects include nausea and vomiting with concern when airway protection is compromised.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride [^115LawZY]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

The following are examples of medications that may reduce the glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, leading to worsening glycemic control: danazol, glucagon, somatropin, protease inhibitors, atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), barbiturates, diazoxide, laxatives, rifampin, thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid hormones, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), and isoniazid. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia.

Beta-blockers, clonidine, and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets glucose-lowering effect.

Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the glucose-lowering action of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets in an unpredictable fashion.

The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine.

7.5	Miconazole

Glimepiride

A potential interaction between oral miconazole and sulfonylureas leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with other dosage forms of miconazole is not known.

7.6	CYP2C9 Interactions

Glimepiride

There may be an interaction between glimepiride and inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of CYP2C9. Fluconazole may inhibit the metabolism of glimepiride, causing increased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to hypoglycemia. Rifampin may induce the metabolism of glimepiride, causing decreased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to worsening glycemic control.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride [^11788mPX]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.1	Congestive Heart Failure

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets are used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets must be considered [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2	Hypoglycemia

Glimepiride

All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, can cause severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death.

Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other antidiabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested.

Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia.

5.3	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Glimepiride

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, a component of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes.

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^11663qZv]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Several individual case reports of bradycardia following remdesivir administration indicate a minimum HR between 2 and 4 days, which is consistent with our modeled data (Figure 2 A). A report of 2 cases of bradycardia following remdesivir had a minimum HR at day 5; however, the HR was only reported every 48 hours. A delayed onset to minimum HR fits with the relatively long elimination half-life of GS-441524 (22–29 hours) and other metabolites that may result in accumulation and ongoing effects. Men reached a minimum HR sooner than women. The reason for this is unclear; however, the difference may be due to variations in baseline resting HR among men and women as well as differences in baroreceptor response.

We found that few patients (18.1%) in our cohort had an intervention. Three patients required atropine; unfortunately, sufficient detail was not available within the data to determine the response. Shirvani et aldescribe a series of 3 patients with bradycardia: 2 were unresponsive to atropine and 1 required a transvenous pacemaker. Jacinto et aldescribe a case of severe bradycardia unresponsive to atropine; the patient required dopamine, which was continued through the 5-day course and was promptly discontinued after the last dose. Temporary pacing was required in 1 patient with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and 3.7% of the patients required vasopressors that were believed to be related to remdesivir. In a prospective cohort of 100 patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir, there were no events requiring pacing and no episodes of hemodynamic instability or ventricular arrhythmias. Discontinuation of remdesivir before the recommended 5-day course due to bradycardia was the most common intervention in 5.3% of our patients and has been noted in other cases in the literature. As in the experience with these case reports, most cases of bradycardia were temporary and resolved with discontinuation of the medication. Even within the context of our pharmacovigilance project specifically targeting AEs, the overall incidence of serious AEs, such as those associated with atropine, pacing, or vasopressors, was low.

### Efficacy and safety of dulaglutide monotherapy compared with glimepiride in east-Asian patients with type 2 diabetes in a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-arm, active comparator, phase III trial [^112quFsQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

At week 26, a numerically greater reduction from baseline in systolic blood pressure (~2‐5 mm Hg) was observed in both dulaglutide groups. The mean pulse rate increased in both dulaglutide groups (0.75‐3.76 beats per minute [bpm]) and decreased in the glimepiride group (0.07‐0.22 bpm). At week 26, a notably greater increase in heart rate from baseline was reported in both dulaglutide groups (1.90‐3.99 bpm) compared with the glimepiride group (0.44 bpm). Also, a notable difference was reported in PR interval among the three groups, with an increase in both dulaglutide groups (3.29‐3.73 milliseconds) and a decrease in the glimepiride group (0.23 milliseconds).

Two patients in the dulaglutide groups had adjudicated cardiovascular events of lacunar infarction and transient ischaemic attack. Of these, only the event of transient ischaemic attack was confirmed upon adjudication.

There were no cases of adjudicated acute or chronic pancreatitis during the study. At week 26, notably greater mean changes in p‐amylase, total amylase and lipase were observed with dulaglutide compared with glimepiride (Table S5). No patient in any group had pancreatic amylase and total amylase levels of > 3 × the upper limit of normal at week 26, whereas three patients in each group had lipase levels of > 3 × the upper limit of normal during the study (Table 2).

The mean change in serum calcitonin levels was negligible in all three treatment groups during the 26‐week treatment period. No cases of thyroid neoplasms, C‐cell hyperplasia, or medullary thyroid carcinoma were reported during this study.

Twenty‐five patients (5.1%) developed treatment‐emergent dulaglutide ADAs at least once during the study. In 22 of these patients, no dulaglutide ADAs were observed at baseline but they developed ADAs post‐baseline, with the highest titre being 1:64.

Two patients (one in each dulaglutide group) experienced mild urticaria. Of the 13 patients who reported hypersensitivity reactions, five patients (dulaglutide 1.5 mg, n = 1; dulaglutide 0.75 mg, n = 3; glimepiride, n = 1) had study drug‐related hypersensitivity reactions. None of these patients developed treatment‐emergent dulaglutide ADAs.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes.

5.3 Hemolytic Anemia

Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a non-sulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with poisoning [^116ReQXC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This article will review the cardiovascular toxicities of various medications, stressing the electrocardiographic presentation — both rhythm and morphological issues — and emphasizing recognition and management issues. Cardiovascular toxins are grouped into categories causing similar electrocardiographic effects, including the potassium efflux blockers, sodium channel blockers, sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase blockers (ie, digitalis compounds), calcium channel blockers, and beta-adrenergic blockers.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact) [^1168ATJS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommendations for All Patients

DUETACT should be taken once daily with the first main meal.

DUETACT tablets are available as a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablet. If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and glimepiride is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is:

30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
for patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus glimepiride as separate tablets: DUETACT should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and glimepiride already being taken,
for patients currently on a different sulfonylurea monotherapy or switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus a different sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide): 30 mg/2 mg once daily and adjusted after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Observe for hypoglycemia for one to two weeks due to the potential overlapping drug effect.
for patients with systolic dysfunction, the lowest approved dose of DUETACT should be prescribed only after titration from 15 mg to 30 mg of pioglitazone has been safely tolerated.

After initiation of DUETACT or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for hypoglycemia and adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating DUETACT. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with DUETACT is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of DUETACT or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking DUETACT should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Glimepiride (glimepiride 3 mg) [^116SrErW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk

Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.

Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions

Neonates of women with gestational diabetes who are treated with sulfonylureas during pregnancy may be at increased risk for neonatal intensive care admission and may develop respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and be large for gestational age. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia, lasting 4 to 10 days, has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery and has been reported with the use of agents with a prolonged half-life. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypoglycemia and respiratory distress and manage accordingly.

Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period

Due to reports of prolonged severe hypoglycemia in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery, glimepiride should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions).

Data

Animal data

In animal studies, there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in fetal deaths occurred in rats and rabbits at glimepiride doses 50 times (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). This fetotoxicity was observed only at doses inducing maternal hypoglycemia and is believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glimepiride, as has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas.

### Glimepiride (glimepiride 3 mg) [^114ow5p8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.2 Miconazole

A potential interaction between oral miconazole and sulfonylureas leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with other dosage forms of miconazole is not known.

7.3 Cytochrome P450 2C9 Interactions

There may be an interaction between glimepiride and inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of cytochrome P450 2C9. Fluconazole may inhibit the metabolism of glimepiride, causing increased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to hypoglycemia. Rifampin may induce the metabolism of glimepiride, causing decreased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to worsening glycemic control.

7.4 Concomitant Administration of Colesevelam

Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride when the two are coadministered. However, absorption is not reduced when glimepiride is administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Therefore, glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

### Amisulpride and symptomatic bradycardia: a case report [^113oVRUL]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Amisulpride is a second-generation antipsychotic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and other major psychotic illnesses. Amisulpride-induced bradycardia is a rare condition of unknown etiology and mechanism. Asymptomatic bradycardia has been associated with amisulpride in only two cases. In our case, the association was rated as "probable" on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale.

Method

Case report.

Results

A 45-year-old male patient developed symptomatic bradycardia during usage of amisulpride (400–800 mg/day), which dramatically improved after the complete termination of amisulpride usage. The psychiatric condition remained relatively stable without bradycardia after administration of another antipsychotic agent [risperidone (3 mg/day)].

Conclusion

This is the first case report of symptomatic bradycardia associated with the use of amisulpride. Although bradycardia is a rare adverse reaction to antipsychotics, this finding may alert psychiatrists and physicians to this antipsychotic drug side effect. Further study is needed to disclose the role of antipsychotics in bringing about symptomatic bradycardia.

5.2	Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with HARVONI. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered HARVONI:

Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia
Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking HARVONI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting HARVONI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion, or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.3 	Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers

The concomitant use of HARVONI and P-gp inducers may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Therefore, the use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^112X7t9C]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving remdesivir, is there an association between dose and time to bradycardia in those experiencing bradycardic events?

Findings

In this cohort study, among 188 patients receiving remdesivir who had bradycardia, the most substantial decrease in heart rate occurred within 24 hours of the loading dose. The median time to minimum heart rate was 60.7 hours after remdesivir administration.

Meaning

In this study, bradycardia in patients receiving remdesivir was seen during the infusion and after 1 or more doses; however, these findings are limited because a large proportion of patients had cardiac risk factors and/or severe COVID-19.

### Current position of gliclazide and sulfonylureas in the contemporary treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^111toS7d]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Different selectivity for SUR1 (β cell type), SUR2A (myocardial), and SUR2B (vascular smooth muscle) receptors expressed by individual SUs. Gliclazide and glipizide specifically bind and block channels containing SUR1 (β cell type), but not SUR2 (cardiac, smooth muscle types). Glibenclamide (abolishes ischemic preconditioning via blocking cardiac myocyte KATP channels) and glimepiride (no effect on cardiac myocyte KATP channels or ischemic preconditioning) can nonspecifically bind and block both types of SUR1- and SUR2-containing channels and carry the potential to mediate effects both at the level of heart and smooth muscles.

SUs also inhibit glucagon secretion from pancreatic α cells via direct stimulation of somatostatin release through a similar mechanism as well as with the paracrine effect of increased insulin. In this way, they provide glycemic control by increasing insulin release, by decreasing the hepatic glucose output via decreased glucagon release, and by reducing the hepatic uptake and the metabolic clearance rate of insulin.

SUs in Diabetes Treatment

The glucose-lowering efficacy of SUs (mean HbA1c reduction of 1.0–1.5%) is similar to metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and better than newer agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (mean HbA1c reduction of 0.5–1.0%) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (mean HbA1c reduction of 0.4–0.9%).

Newer generation SUs (glimepiride and gliclazide MR) are considered effective and safe as second-line agents in patients with metformin failure, and also as first-line agents if used in combination with lifestyle modification and metformin in patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 7.5%. They also offer glucose-lowering efficacy with minimal side effects, when used as dual or triple therapy in combination with other antidiabetic agents.

Notably, all SUs are not similar in terms of their efficacies, adverse effects, and tolerability. Newer generation SUs such as gliclazide MR offer more favorable efficacy and safety profiles. However, clinical utility of SUs and their place in diabetes treatment are being surpassed by newer, more expensive therapies; however, SUs are valuable treatment option for many patients with T2D, particularly in the resource-limited settings.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hemolytic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Approximately 2,800 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with glimepiride in the controlled clinical trials. In these trials, approximately 1,700 patients were treated with glimepiride for at least 1 year. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with glimepiride were hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea.

Table 1 summarizes adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials, whether or not considered to be possibly or probably related to study medication. Treatment duration ranged from 13 weeks to 12 months. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% among glimepiride-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo.

Hypoglycemia

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3-week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4% for glimepiride 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated.

### Comparative safety of sulfonylureas and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia [^117NmxBc]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between individual antidiabetic sulfonylureas and outpatient-originating sudden cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia (SCA/VA).

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 1999–2010 U.S. Medicaid claims from five large states. Exposures were determined by incident use of glyburide, glimepiride, or glipizide. Glipizide served as the reference exposure, as its effects are believed to be highly pancreas specific. Outcomes were ascertained by a validated ICD-9-based algorithm indicative of SCA/VA (positive predictive value ∼85%). Potential confounding was addressed by adjustment for multinomial high-dimensional propensity scores included as continuous variables in a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Of sulfonylurea users under study (N = 519,272), 60.3% were female and 34.9% non-Hispanic Caucasian, and the median age was 58.0 years. In 176,889 person-years of sulfonylurea exposure, we identified 632 SCA/VA events (50.5% were immediately fatal) for a crude incidence rate of 3.6 per 1,000 person-years. Compared with glipizide, propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios for SCA/VA were 0.82 (95% CI 0.69–0.98) for glyburide and 1.10 (0.89–1.36) for glimepiride. Numerous secondary analyses showed a very similar effect estimate for glyburide; yet, not all CIs excluded the null.

Conclusions

Glyburide may be associated with a lower risk of SCA/VA than glipizide, consistent with a very small clinical trial suggesting that glyburide may reduce ventricular tachycardia and isolated ventricular premature complexes. This potential benefit must be contextualized by considering putative effects of different sulfonylureas on other cardiovascular end points, cerebrovascular end points, all-cause death, and hypoglycemia.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^112rUrzG]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — arrhythmic and drug-induced mechanisms — Bradycardia from subsidiary pacemaker sites can present with slow rates (25–40 b.p.m.) and "predisposes to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially of the torsade de pointes type". Syncope or near-syncope occurs at the onset of paroxysmal tachycardia before vascular compensation develops, and several drugs can cause brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including QT‑prolonging agents across antiarrhythmics, vasodilators, psychotropics, antimicrobials, and non‑sedating antihistamines. Syncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is caused by drugs prolonging the QT interval, being particularly frequent in long QT syndrome. Under‑reporting is substantial, with only 1% of adverse drug reactions reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride [^113aswuA]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.5	Hepatic Effects

Pioglitazone

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets can be used with caution.

### Glimepiride [^112siPys]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk

Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.

Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions

Neonates of women with gestational diabetes who are treated with sulfonylureas during pregnancy may be at increased risk for neonatal intensive care admission and may develop respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and be large for gestational age. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia, lasting 4–10 days, has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery and has been reported with the use of agents with a prolonged half-life. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypoglycemia and respiratory distress and manage accordingly.

Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period

Due to reports of prolonged severe hypoglycemia in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery, glimepiride tablets should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions).

Data

Animal data

In animal studies, there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in fetal deaths occurred in rats and rabbits at glimepiride doses 50 times (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). This fetotoxicity was observed only at doses inducing maternal hypoglycemia and is believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glimepiride, as has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas.

Insulin secretagogues

Sulfonylureas

The sulfonylureas are the oldest and most widely prescribed oral anti-diabetic agents. They bind to receptors on adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP) in the pancreatic β-cells, causing depolarization of the cell membrane and subsequent calcium-mediated exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. First-generation sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide and chlorpropamide are no longer used due to high incidence of adverse reactions. Second-generation agents include glipizide, glibenclamide (also known as glyburide in United States) and gliclazide. Sulfonylurea monotherapy reduces HbA1c by 1–2%, but weight gain is almost inevitable. In the UKPDS, patients randomized to sulfonylureas gained a mean of 5.3 kg over 6 years. Glimepiride, a third-generation agent, has at least therapeutic equivalence to the second-generation agents, but is less associated with both weight gain and hypoglycemia, and may have lesser undesirable effects on myocardial preconditioning due to its selectivity to pancreatic K ATP.

We report the case of a patient with a history of addiction and abuse of alprazolam and hydrocodone who developed sinus bradycardia after being started on oral methadone for detoxification. The potential of methadone to cause side effects similar to verapamil must be considered in any patient taking methadone.

10 OVERDOSAGE

An overdosage of glimepiride, as with other sulfonylureas, can produce severe hypoglycemia. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can be treated with oral glucose. Severe hypoglycemic reactions constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. Severe hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurological impairment can be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose. Continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

End-Organ Benefits

Cardiac

Independent of other risk factors, people with diabetes are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular diseases compared to those without diabetes, so the issue of the cardiac benefit of any antidiabetes drug is of paramount importance. Despite more than half a century of clinical use, concerns about their cardiac safety continue to haunt SUs. This is partly because the extensive literature available on their association with cardiovascular events is not only inconsistent but also lacks any conclusive evidence of harm associated with their use as second-line agents. While the cardiac safety profile of SU use from the ADVANCE study and the cardiovascular outcome trial data (CVOT) from the CAROLINA trial were, at best, encouraging from the perspective of most practitioners, the influx of more promising cardioprotective evidence for newcomers such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) receptor agonists will substantially influence future therapeutic choices, especially for T2D patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease. Still, it has been demonstrated that newer-generation SUs, such as glimepiride in the CAROLINA study and gliclazide MR in ADVANCE, are CV safe and are not associated with an increased CV risk. Among elderly (> 75 years) T2D patients, glycemic management with a SU remains an option, but it should be dispensed with great caution given the elevated risk of adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia, its questionable cardiac safety, and renal impairment. However, in circumstances where affordability and availability are important issues, it is still clinically useful to know which of the widely used and less-expensive medications, including SUs, can achieve glycemic targets with a low risk of adverse outcomes.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of glipizide PO:
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the risk of increased cardiovascular mortality observed with tolbutamide may also apply to other sulfonylureas.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients at risk for hypoglycemia, including elderly patients, concomitant use of other hypoglycemic medications or alcohol, patients with renal, hepatic, adrenal, or pituitary impairment, malnutrition, calorie deficit, or after severe or prolonged exercise. Reduce the starting dose to 2.5 mg daily in elderly patients and in patients with hepatic impairment or receiving other hypoglycemic agents.

### Glimepiride (glimepiride 3 mg) [^1134D45o]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypoglycemia

All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, can cause severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death.

Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing glimepiride doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other anti-diabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested.

Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes.

5.3 Hemolytic Anemia

Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a non-sulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) [^111bRYTX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2	Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered SOVALDI:

Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia
Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking SOVALDI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting SOVALDI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.3	Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers

Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI. The use of rifampin and St. John's wort with SOVALDI is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Sulfonylureas in the current practice of type 2 diabetes management: are they all the same? Consensus from the gulf cooperation council (GCC) countries advisory board on sulfonylureas [^113dPy8z]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The Thiazolidinediones Or Sulfonylureas and Cardiovascular Accidents Intervention Trial (TOSCA. IT) is the only major trial to have assessed the CVOT from using older diabetes drugs as second-line agents to metformin in T2D individuals with mild-to-moderate cardiovascular risk. This large-scale study with a follow-up period of almost 5 years involved more than 3000 T2D patients who were randomly assigned to receive either pioglitazone or a SU (gliclazide, glimepiride, or glibenclamide). According to the results of TOSCA. IT, the pioglitazone and SU groups did not differ significantly in fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, nor in all-cause mortality. Aside from this lack of difference between the treatment groups, the study had a high dropout rate and, as such, the generalizability of the results of the study should be interpreted with caution. It is worth noting, however, that the authors reported that pioglitazone was superior to SUs in providing cardiovascular protection to those who were either free from evident cardiovascular disease or were in the early stages of diabetes.

With respect to providing a lower cardiac risk, studies of SU drugs have consistently found in favor of the newer-generation SUs such as gliclazide and glimepiride, but not all, proving that physicians should still consider differences in cardioprotection when selecting a SU. In fact, several early studies noted poor mortality outcomes when using SUs in combination with metformin, as well as an increased risk of cancer. Nevertheless, in a systematic review and network meta-analysis of controlled studies reporting the risk of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, or myocardial infarction (MI), later-generation SUs such as glimepiride and gliclazide were associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause and CV mortality compared to glibenclamide, whereas glibenclamide was associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmias, at least when compared to glipizide, and may be associated with a reduced risk of ventricular tachycardia and isolated ventricular premature complexes. Still, among all SUs, gliclazide has been associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular-related mortality (followed by glimepiride), as well as the lowest risk of severe hypoglycemia.

### Partial inhibition of insulin secretion results in glucose intolerance but not hyperglucagonemia [^1142RFHu]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Despite partially inhibited insulin secretion and higher plasma glucose levels following the mixed meal after diazoxide, compared with after placebo, plasma glucagon concentrations were the same. Similarly, despite decreased insulin secretion and higher plasma glucose levels following the sulfonylurea glimepiride after diazoxide, compared with placebo, plasma glucagon concentrations declined similarly. (Glucose was infused intravenously to prevent hypoglycemia after glimepiride ingestion, but the glucose infusion rates with diazoxide were ∼50% of those with placebo.) In an earlier study, partial inhibition of insulin secretion with diazoxide also raised postabsorptive plasma glucose concentrations but not postabsorptive plasma glucagon concentrations.

These findings do not exclude an inhibitory effect of β-cell secretion on α-cell glucagon secretion, but suggest that that the effect is not as potent as other factors. A greater degree of inhibition of insulin secretion might have resulted in both hyperglycemia and hyperglucagonemia after the meal and after glimepiride (as observed in individuals with absolute endogenous insulin deficiency), but that was not demonstrated in this study of mild insulin deficiency.

Among the weaknesses of this study is that only partial inhibition of insulin secretion was accomplished with the dose of diazoxide that was used. However, diazoxide is a nonselective K ATP channel agonist, and its dosing is therefore limited by hypotension. The dose of 6.0 mg/kg used in this study approximates the maximum tolerable single dose; indeed, heart rates were slightly higher and blood pressures were slightly lower after diazoxide administration. The latter undoubtedly resulted in sympathetic neural activation, as evidenced by a small but statistically significant increase in the plasma norepinephrine concentration. That did not alter basal insulin or C-peptide levels but may have contributed to the partial suppression of insulin secretion after the meal and after glimepiride. Notably, however, there was no increase in the plasma concentration of the adrenomedullary hormone epinephrine.

### Efficacy and safety comparison of liraglutide, glimepiride, and placebo, all in combination with metformin, in type 2 diabetes: the LEAD (liraglutide effect and action in diabetes)-2 study [^113Wxqq3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — The efficacy and safety of adding liraglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) to metformin were compared with addition of placebo or glimepiride to metformin in subjects previously treated with oral antidiabetes (OAD) therapy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In this 26-week, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial, 1,091 subjects were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1:2) to once-daily liraglutide (either 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg/day injected subcutaneously), to placebo, or to glimepiride (4 mg once daily). All treatments were in combination therapy with metformin (1g twice daily). Enrolled subjects (aged 25–79 years) had type 2 diabetes, A1C of 7–11% (previous OAD monotherapy for ≥ 3 months) or 7–10% (previous OAD combination therapy for ≥ 3 months), and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m².

RESULTS — A1C values were significantly reduced in all liraglutide groups versus the placebo group (P < 0.0001) with mean decreases of 1.0% for 1.8 mg liraglutide, 1.2 mg liraglutide, and glimepiride and 0.7% for 0.6 mg liraglutide and an increase of 0.1% for placebo. Body weight decreased in all liraglutide groups (1.8–2.8 kg) compared with an increase in the glimepiride group (1.0 kg; P < 0.0001). The incidence of minor hypoglycemia with liraglutide (∼3%) was comparable to that with placebo but less than that with glimepiride (17%; P < 0.001). Nausea was reported by 11–19% of the liraglutide-treated subjects versus 3–4% in the placebo and glimepiride groups. The incidence of nausea declined over time.

CONCLUSIONS — In subjects with type 2 diabetes, once-daily liraglutide induced similar glycemic control, reduced body weight, and lowered the occurrence of hypoglycemia compared with glimepiride, when both had background therapy of metformin.

### Significance of alectinib-induced bradycardia: rhythm and reversibility matter more than rate [^115oQKcv]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, it may be most practical to regularly assess patients on alectinib for symptoms of symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (eg, light-headedness, dizziness, exercise intolerance, presyncope, and syncope) rather than meticulously follow heart rates. Pruis et alobserved that bradycardia, including asymptomatic bradycardia, was the most common reason for dose reduction of alectinib. However, whether dose reductions for asymptomatic bradycardia are warranted is debatable. Equally, when interventions such as pacemaker insertion are considered, the reversibility of a potential drug-induced bradycardia with dose modification also has to be considered. Although central nervous system coverage could be lessened at lower doses of alectinib, systemic efficacy of the drug is likely to be well maintained across several alectinib dose reductions. Other potential interventions to consider would also include drug substitution (given all of the licensed ALK TKI options). Evidence of reversibility of bradycardia on dose reduction or drug replacement was not documented in this trial, but in clinical experience (D.R.C.) reversibility of drug effects with dose modification or drug discontinuation is the norm. In many ways, a dialogue between the patient, oncologist, and cardio-oncologist may be the approach that is most in order in the setting of drug-induced bradycardia to manage fears and expectations and to discuss intervention vs explanation and observation as the best approach for any given patient moving forward.

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^1141nXPV]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

While cardiovascular events have been described from World Health Organization and FDA adverse event reporting system databases, and several individual case reports have described bradycardia associated with remdesivir within 2 to 5 days of treatment, the FACT Pharmacovigilance Project is one of the only large multicenter cohorts with HR data at each administration of remdesivir. Of the case reports that provided HR, 2 reported daily HR, and 1 case report of a single patient provided multiple HR values. A small, single-center prospective study found a significant decrease in diurnal HR of patients treated with remdesivir compared with controls at days 4 and 5 of treatment. A small, single-center retrospective study found a significantly higher incidence of bradycardia after treatment day 3 of those treated with remdesivir. Although minimum HR was not specifically provided in these prior reports, our data of mean minimum HR (Figure 2 A) are congruent with these reports and may indicate accumulation of GS-441524 or other cardioactive metabolites.

Due to variability in the frequency of documented vital signs across sites and levels of care, we chose time to first bradycardic episode and time to minimum HR as targets for time-to-event analysis. Although detailed vital sign trends are often not available in case reports of bradycardia following remdesivir, bradycardia was noted in several case reports after the second to fourth remdesivir dose in 19 cases including 5 cases in children. Three cases reported bradycardia within 24 hours of the 200-mg loading dose. In a single-center retrospective cohort of 473 patients, the incidence of bradycardia was higher after the third to fifth doses than after the first 2 doses. We found a median time to the first bradycardic episode of 23.4 hours. It is possible that in previous reports in the literature bradycardia was not noted until it was more pronounced. Still, a substantial number of patients had their time to first bradycardic episode in doses 2 to 5. The time to the first bradycardic episode was significantly shorter for patients aged 65 years or older. The reasons for this are unclear and may be multifactorial. While remdesivir is relatively quickly converted to active metabolites, GS-441524 is primarily eliminated in the urine. Decreased kidney clearance could result in accumulation of this metabolite and potentially explain this observed difference.

### Current position of gliclazide and sulfonylureas in the contemporary treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^115CjHEb]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, in a population-based cohort study with 17,604 sulfonylurea initiators, the use of nonspecific long-acting sulfonylureas (glyburide and glimepiride) was not associated with an increased risk of AMI, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, or all-cause mortality, when evaluated with respect to pancreas-specific, short-acting sulfonylureas (tolbutamide, gliclazide, and glipizide, as reference group), contradicting the previous studies that emphasized the clinical implications of the lack of pancreas specificity of certain sulfonylureas.

In a systematic review of studies on the SUs and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VA), SUs as a class were found to be associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia versus DPP-4 inhibitors [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.52, 95% CI 1.27–1.80] and of VA versus metformin (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10–2.13). However, two studies with gliclazide-specific data in the review revealed inconclusive results for the risk of VA with gliclazide relative to glyburide due to wide 95% CIs (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.60–2.30), and a reduced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest risk with SUs compared with metformin with gliclazide having a lower risk than glimepiride (ORadj 0.5, 95% CI 0.3–0.9). In a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 18 studies on the mortality risk among SUs, gliclazide was associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.45–0.84] and all-cause mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53–0.79) compared with glibenclamide and others. Hence, as associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular-related mortality (followed by glimepiride), as well as the lowest risk of severe hypoglycemia among all SUs, the relative safety of a gliclazide makes it a preferred SU among the SUs.

3 RESULTS

The CONSORT flow chart of the study is provided in Figure 1. One hundred and five patients were screened, while 43 of these were excluded owing to screening criteria (n = 35), declining to participate (n = 3) or other reasons (n = 5). Subsequently, 62 patients were randomized to liraglutide (n = 33) vs glimepiride (n = 29). There were none lost to follow‐up; however, three patients withdrew their consent (Figure 1). For technical reasons (eg undetectable QRS segments in all three leads, high frequencies of ectopic complexes and distortions), another six patients were excluded from the per‐protocol analysis. Finally, 29 patients in the liraglutide group and 24 in the glimepiride group made up the final analysis (per‐protocol). Sensitivity analysis (ITT analysis) was also carried out for our end‐points.

### Significance of alectinib-induced bradycardia: rhythm and reversibility matter more than rate [^113VdxzR]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Targeted therapy is 1 of the cornerstones of contemporary treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, present in 3% to 7% of NSCLC patients, are available. The first-generation ALK TKI crizotinib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and showed dramatic activity in the majority of patients; however, its duration of benefit was limited. A series of second-generation ALK TKIs (alectinib, certinib, and brigatinib) were subsequently licensed for use post-crizotinib, which demonstrated activity against some crizotinib-induced ALK resistance mutations and also had better central nervous system penetration to help treat central nervous system spread of the disease. All of these drugs eventually also acquired first-line licenses, effectively displacing crizotinib as the initial ALK-directed therapy of choice. Because of its status as the first well-tolerated, highly effective next-generation ALK TKI licensed in the treatment-naive setting, alectinib is the dominant initial drug prescribed in many countries. Lorlatinib represents a so-called third-generation ALK TKI with a license for use after several second-generation inhibitors and in the first-line setting, although its first-line use has not been without issue given its prominent metabolic and neurologic side effect profile.

ALK inhibitors are typically well tolerated from a cardiac standpoint. ALK rearrangements occur across a wide age range of patients, with a bias toward younger patients with little or no smoking history. As such, concomitant cardiac pathology is relatively rare in these patients at diagnosis. In phase 3 clinical trials of ALK TKIs, the potential cardiac adverse events reported were bradycardia, QT prolongation, and edema with varying incidence. For alectinib, bradycardia was reported in 1% to 30%, QT prolongation in 0% to 3%, and edema in 6% to 9% of patients. Cirne et alconducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials of ALK inhibitors and reported the pooled incidence of bradycardia was 8% with a mean follow-up of 1.26 years. There was no apparent difference in the risk of bradycardia among first-, second-, and third-generation inhibitors.

Conclusions

In our cohort study, bradycardia following remdesivir infusion was observed directly after the infusion and throughout the course of treatment. Serious AEs requiring an intervention were rare. Further observational studies are needed to document the incidence of remdesivir-associated bradycardia and the relative risk for potentially vulnerable subgroups. Given the widespread use of remdesivir in COVID-19, practitioners should be aware of the potential for delayed-onset or sustained bradycardia. Most patients with bradycardia continued remdesivir therapy and had a good outcome.

5.2	Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with HARVONI. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered HARVONI:

Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia
Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking HARVONI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting HARVONI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.3 	Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers

The concomitant use of HARVONI and P-gp inducers may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Therefore, the use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Glimepiride [^115hYcBN]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of glimepiride PO (also known as Amaryl):
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the increased cardiovascular mortality risk observed with tolbutamide may also apply to other sulfonylureas.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients at risk for hypoglycemia, including elderly patients, concomitant use of other hypoglycemic medications or alcohol, patients with renal, hepatic, adrenal, or pituitary impairment, malnutrition, calorie deficit, or after severe or prolonged exercise. Reduce the starting dose to 2.5 mg daily in elderly patients and in patients with hepatic impairment or receiving other hypoglycemic agents.
- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as glimepiride has been associated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.
- **Hemolytic anemia**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

Dissecting therapeutic benefits from adverse effects

Proximity helps us understand relationships between drugs and diseases and discover novel associations. We first highlight several potential repurposing candidates predicted by proximity among unknown drug-disease pairs. One such candidate is nicotine, a drug originally indicated for ulcerative colitis, which is closer to AD (zᴄ = −1.2) than its original indication. Indeed, nicotine has recently been argued to improve cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment, a symptom that often precedes Alzheimer's dementia. Not surprisingly, the closest pathways to nicotine are acetylcholine-related pathways such as 'acetylcholine binding and downstream events', 'highly calcium permeable postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors' and 'presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors', closely related to the pathways proximal to donepezil, the AD drug above.

We also find that glimepiride and tolbutamide, two T2D drugs that lower blood glucose by increasing the secretion of insulin, are proximal to cardiac arrhythmia (zᴄ = −3.6 and zᴄ = −2.3, respectively). However, these drugs have recently been suggested to induce adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, network-based proximity does not always imply that the drug will improve the corresponding disease. To the contrary, some drugs may even induce the disease phenotype by perturbing the functions of the proteins in the proximity of the disease module. To distinguish between a novel treatment and a potential adverse effect, we check the proximity of these drugs to the protein sets predicted to induce the side effects. The proteins inducing a given side effect are predicted based on whether they appear significantly as the targets of drugs with the side effect compared with the targets of drugs without the side effect(Methods section). Although glimepiride and tolbutamide are proximal to the cardiac arrhythmia disease proteins in the network, they are also proximal to the proteins inducing arrhythmia (and, respectively, Supplementary Data 1). In line with earlier findings, proximity indicates that their use by patients with cardiovascular problems requires caution.

### Bradycardia due to donepezil in adults: systematic analysis of FDA adverse event reporting system [^111C8Ue2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bradycardia is a physiological condition characterized by a decrease in heart rate and is a side effect of many drug classes. Bradycardia has been reported as an adverse event for patients receiving donepezil for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.

Objective

The purpose of the paper is to systematically investigate the association between the occurrence of bradycardia in adults and the usage of donepezil using clinical data derived from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.

Methods

The risk of bradycardia in patients who only took donepezil was compared with those of patients who only took over-the-counter medications, multiple arrhythmia drugs, or other medications for AD treatment. In addition, this study sought to determine if this heightened bradycardia risk was influenced by sex, age, and dosage.

Results

The results indicated that there was a significant greater likelihood of reporting bradycardia in patients administered donepezil than most of the drugs investigated. There was no significant association between age or the dosage of donepezil and the likelihood of reporting bradycardia. However, males were found to be more likely than females to report bradycardia as an adverse event. Tumor necrosis factor inhibition and the stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase were proposed to be the primary mechanism of actions which confer elevated bradycardia risk when using donepezil.

Conclusion

These findings identified strong association between the usage of donepezil and bradycardia in adults as well as provided insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms that induce bradycardia by donepezil.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hemolytic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Approximately 2,800 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with glimepiride in the controlled clinical trials. In these trials, approximately 1,700 patients were treated with glimepiride for at least 1 year. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with glimepiride were hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea.

Table 1 summarizes adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials, whether or not considered to be possibly or probably related to study medication. Treatment duration ranged from 13 weeks to 12 months. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% among glimepiride-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo.

*Glimepiride doses ranged from 1–16 mg administered daily

†Insufficient information to determine whether any of the accidental injury events were associated with hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3-week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4% for glimepiride 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated.

This article has reviewed the emerging side-effect profiles of second-generation antipsychotic medications. Although these medications have favorable extrapyramidal side-effect profiles, clinicians must be aware of their propensity to cause weight gain, glucose and lipid abnormalities, and cardiac and sexual side effects. If clinicians are proactive about warning patients about these side effects and appropriately monitoring them, further morbidity and mortality may be prevented in this patient population. Initial choices of medication should be made based on the relative side-effect profiles in light of a particular patient's medical status. In the future, new treatments may be developed, with even fewer side effects.
