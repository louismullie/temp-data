Vitamin d

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of vitamin D's metabolism, measurement, thresholds, extraskeletal effects, and pragmatic supplementation guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology and activation pathways. Then, I should verify the best biomarker and assay issues. Next, I will examine how deficiency is defined across authorities and why thresholds differ. After that, I need to appraise extraskeletal evidence and why RCTs often fail to confirm observational signals. Then, I should translate this into population-specific recommendations, including who benefits from empiric supplementation and who should be tested. Finally, I will consider dosing forms, safety, and special populations, and close with a concise clinical takeaway that aligns with current guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology and activation cascade, because if I misstate the pathway, downstream clinical reasoning will be shaky. Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol via UVB, while D2 is plant-derived; both are hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D, calcitriol], the active hormone that binds the vitamin D receptor and regulates calcium–phosphate homeostasis and gene expression across many tissues, with extrarenal 1α-hydroxylase enabling local autocrine/paracrine effects in numerous cell types.

> Wait, let me verify the biomarker question before I anchor any thresholds. Total serum 25(OH)D is the accepted marker of vitamin D status because it reflects both cutaneous synthesis and intake and has a longer half-life of about 2–3 weeks, whereas 1,25(OH)2D is tightly regulated, short-lived, and not a reliable indicator of stores; however, assay variability and lack of standardization complicate interpretation and meta-analyses, so I need to be cautious about comparing across studies and laboratories [^114xwr92] [^111Pgz2L] [^117VCote].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "optimal" levels; I should double-check how different authorities set cut points. The IOM/NAM concluded that 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) meets the needs of at least 97.5% of the population for skeletal outcomes under minimal sun exposure, whereas the Endocrine Society historically favored ≥ 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) to ensure no individual has adverse skeletal outcomes; importantly, the 2024 Endocrine Society prevention guideline no longer endorses a universal 30 ng/mL target and emphasizes outcome-specific evidence rather than fixed thresholds, reflecting evolving RCT data and assay limitations [^112X488E] [^114xwr92] [^11535HZz].

> I need to check the extraskeletal landscape carefully, because observational associations are abundant but causality remains uncertain. Preclinical and observational data link low 25(OH)D to higher risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, infections, and mortality, and vitamin D signaling can regulate roughly 3% of the genome, supporting biological plausibility; however, large RCTs like VITAL, D-Health, ViDA, FIND, and D2d have largely failed to show broad primary prevention benefits in generally replete populations, though signals for cancer mortality reduction and immune-related outcomes have emerged in subgroup or meta-analytic explorations, and MR studies suggest modest causal effects on some outcomes while being limited by small genetic effects and linear assumptions [^116fiStm] [^111o2AnS] [^116iFrFV] [^113KukXJ] [^116Joi8e].

> Hmm, wait a minute, why do RCTs often fail when observational studies look so compelling? I should confirm the key design limitations. Many contemporary trials enrolled participants with baseline 25(OH)D near or above 30 ng/mL, allowed background DRI-level intake, used heterogeneous doses and schedules, and were underpowered for subgroup analyses by baseline status; this creates a "ceiling effect" and dilution bias, masking potential benefits in deficient individuals, which is why post hoc and meta-analytic signals in the deficient stratum are biologically credible but still hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^114yJPbG] [^113UqxEs] [^116Q4h2v].

> Next, I should review who actually benefits from empiric supplementation, and I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidelines. The 2024 Endocrine Society prevention guideline suggests empiric vitamin D for children and adolescents 1–18 years to prevent rickets and potentially reduce respiratory infections, for adults ≥ 75 years due to potential mortality benefit, for pregnancy to lower risks such as preeclampsia and preterm birth, and for high-risk prediabetes to reduce progression to diabetes; for nonpregnant adults older than 50 years when supplementation is indicated, daily dosing is preferred over intermittent high-dose boluses, and routine screening is not recommended in the absence of established indications [^116sT4h1] [^11535HZz].

> I should confirm who warrants targeted testing rather than screening. Individuals with conditions that affect absorption, metabolism, or adherence, those on medications that alter vitamin D metabolism, those with recurrent low-trauma fractures or osteomalacia, and those with chronic liver or kidney disease are reasonable candidates for 25(OH)D testing; conversely, the USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to support routine screening of asymptomatic adults, reinforcing a targeted approach rather than population screening [^111UJRQk] [^114xwr92].

> Let me think about dosing forms and schedules, and I should verify comparative potency. Cholecalciferol (D3) is generally preferred for supplementation due to higher and more sustained increases in 25(OH)D than ergocalciferol (D2), with daily dosing yielding more stable levels than intermittent boluses; calcifediol can be considered in select contexts with faster and more predictable absorption, while calcitriol is reserved for specific disorders of impaired 1α-hydroxylation or as pharmacologic therapy, not for routine repletion [^11639dQb] [^114hqviD] [^113fT4tP].

> I should double-check safety and practical dosing ranges. For most adults without specific indications, intakes of 600–800 IU/day align with DRIs and typically maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL, whereas 1500–2000 IU/day is often needed to reliably achieve and sustain > 30 ng/mL in those who are insufficient; intakes up to 4000 IU/day are generally within the tolerable upper intake level for chronic use, and intermittent very high-dose boluses may increase fall risk in older adults, so daily regimens are favored when feasible [^112X488E] [^114Hfpqn] [^111HyF5g].

> But wait, what about special populations where the benefit–risk calculus shifts? In obesity, lower circulating 25(OH)D due to sequestration and higher clearance may necessitate higher doses to achieve the same serum level, and guidelines call for trials specifically in obesity to define targets and dosing; in chronic kidney disease, impaired 1α-hydroxylation justifies active vitamin D analogs for mineral metabolism control while nutritional repletion with cholecalciferol addresses substrate deficiency; in infants, 400 IU/day is standard to prevent rickets, with maternal high-dose strategies as a conditional alternative when infant drops are not acceptable [^114Krxua] [^112Q65i2] [^112sVwNY].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical message to ensure internal consistency. Vitamin D is essential for skeletal health, and maintaining at least 20 ng/mL is evidence-based for population-level bone outcomes; beyond bone, biological plausibility and observational data are strong, but causality for most extraskeletal outcomes remains unproven in large, well-conducted RCTs, likely due to replete baselines and design limitations; therefore, a targeted strategy of empiric supplementation for defined groups, avoidance of routine screening, preference for daily D3, and attention to deficiency risk factors offers the best alignment of evidence, safety, and cost-effectiveness at present [^112X488E] [^116sT4h1] [^114xwr92].

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble hormone that maintains calcium and phosphate homeostasis, supporting bone health and neuromuscular function [^1167bapt]. It is produced in the skin via UVB exposure and obtained from diet or supplements; **25(OH)D is the main circulating biomarker** of status [^111Pgz2L]. Deficiency is common worldwide and linked to rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and fractures; evidence for extraskeletal benefits is mixed, with strong support for immune modulation and possible roles in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic health, though causality remains uncertain [^116fiStm] [^116iFrFV]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults; **target 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL for bone health**, and typical supplementation is 600–800 IU/day, with higher needs in older adults, people with obesity, or those with limited sun exposure [^111UJRQk] [^112X488E] [^114L9QtN].

---

## Physiological role and metabolism

Vitamin D exists as D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol); both are converted in the liver to 25(OH)D and then in the kidney to 1,25(OH)2D, the active form that regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone mineralization, and neuromuscular function [^1167Q1RY]. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is widely expressed, enabling **genomic and non-genomic effects** across many tissues [^1167bapt].

---

## Sources of vitamin D

Vitamin D is obtained through three main routes: **cutaneous synthesis** — the skin produces vitamin D3 during UVB exposure (wavelengths 290–315 nm), with efficiency influenced by latitude, season, time of day, skin pigmentation, age, and sunscreen use; **dietary sources** — fatty fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks, fortified foods (milk, cereals, some orange juice), and mushrooms exposed to UV light provide vitamin D; and **supplements** — available as D2 or D3, with D3 generally more effective at raising and maintaining 25(OH)D levels.

---

## Measurement of vitamin D status

Serum 25(OH)D is the **most reliable biomarker** of vitamin D status, reflecting both cutaneous synthesis and intake; it has a half-life of 2–3 weeks [^111Pgz2L]. Assay variability and lack of standardization can complicate interpretation, underscoring the need for standardized methods [^117VCote].

---

## Deficiency and insufficiency

Vitamin D deficiency is typically defined as **25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)**; insufficiency is 20–29 ng/mL (50–74 nmol/L) [^116Joi8e]. Deficiency is common globally, especially in older adults, people with obesity, individuals with dark skin, those with limited sun exposure, and patients with chronic illnesses [^116pPHVn] [^1117GQRA].

---

## Health consequences of deficiency

- **Bone health**: Deficiency causes rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and contributes to osteoporosis and fractures [^114Krxua].
- **Muscle function**: Deficiency impairs muscle strength and balance, increasing fall risk [^1163Tpwm].
- **Immune function**: Low status is associated with increased infection risk and immune dysregulation [^111o2AnS].
- **Chronic diseases**: Observational links exist with higher risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders, but causality remains uncertain [^116fiStm] [^116iFrFV].

---

## Benefits of vitamin D supplementation

Supplementation **prevents rickets and osteomalacia** and reduces fractures in older adults, particularly when combined with calcium [^116sT4h1] [^114aveQL]. Evidence for extraskeletal benefits is mixed; some trials suggest reduced cancer mortality, improved immune function, and lower risks of respiratory infections, but large RCTs often show neutral results in replete populations [^116iFrFV] [^113UqxEs].

---

## Recommended intake and supplementation guidelines

| **Population** | **Recommended intake (iu/day)** |
|-|-|
| Infants (0–12 months) | 400 IU |
| Children and adolescents (1–18 years) | 600 IU |
| Adults (19–70 years) | 600 IU |
| Older adults (> 70 years) | 800 IU |
| Pregnant and lactating women | 600 IU |

---

Higher intakes (800–2,000 IU/day) may be needed for people with obesity, dark skin, limited sun exposure, or malabsorption; routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk] [^114Hfpqn].

---

## Risks and side effects of supplementation

Excess intake can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment; chronic high doses (> 4,000 IU/day) increase risk of adverse effects. Monitoring is advised for high-dose regimens or vulnerable patients [^113pqMPU].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Older adults**: Higher needs due to reduced cutaneous synthesis and absorption; supplementation reduces falls and fractures [^112X488E].
- **People with obesity**: Lower circulating 25(OH)D due to sequestration in adipose tissue; higher doses may be required [^114Krxua].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Impaired 1α-hydroxylation; active vitamin D analogs may be needed [^114zxSHh].
- **Pregnancy**: Adequate status supports maternal and fetal bone health and may reduce pregnancy complications [^116sT4h1].

---

## Current research and controversies

Controversies include optimal 25(OH)D targets, the role of vitamin D in COVID-19, and the effectiveness of bolus dosing; ongoing research aims to clarify dosing, thresholds, and outcome-specific benefits [^112L9yHM] [^116sT4h1].

---

Vitamin D is essential for bone health and neuromuscular function, with potential immune and chronic disease benefits; **maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL** through sun exposure, diet, and supplementation as needed, with intake tailored to age, risk, and baseline status [^112X488E].

### The role of vitamin D in reducing cancer risk and progression [^111W9PYo]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2014). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is not really a vitamin but the precursor to the potent steroid hormone calcitriol, which has widespread actions throughout the body. Calcitriol regulates numerous cellular pathways that could have a role in determining cancer risk and prognosis. Although epidemiological and early clinical trials are inconsistent, and randomized control trials in humans do not yet exist to conclusively support a beneficial role for vitamin D, accumulating results from preclinical and some clinical studies strongly suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing cancer and that avoiding deficiency and adding vitamin D supplements might be an economical and safe way to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer prognosis and outcome.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^117VCote]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the VDR has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of the evaluation of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international societies and guidelines can differ due to the different approaches used, including clinical perspectives (level of cutoff at which no individual has an undesirable outcome) or public health perspectives (level of cutoff at which 97.5% of individuals do not have an undesirable outcome). Another critical issue is the lack of an accepted laboratory test assay standardization, and this prevents a proper interpretation of data reported by different studies, resulting in enabling rational data pooling and implementation of meta-analyses focused on vitamin D influence in various clinical outcomes of interest. Thus, 25(OH)D laboratory assays should be monitored in their performance through external quality assessment plans providing target reference values from standardized measurement procedures.

### Unexpected actions of vitamin D: new perspectives on the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity [^113Zv6t9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Knowledge about the ability of vitamin D to function outside its established role in skeletal homeostasis is not a new phenomenon. Nonclassical immunomodulatory and antiproliferative responses triggered by active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were first reported more than a quarter of a century ago. It is only in recent years, however, that there has been a significant improvement in our understanding of how these nonclassical effects of vitamin D can influence the pathophysiology and possible prevention of human disease. Three particular strands of evidence have been prominent: firstly, population studies have revised our interpretation of normal vitamin D status in humans, suggesting, in turn, that vitamin D insufficiency is a clinical problem of global proportions; secondly, epidemiology has linked vitamin D status with disease susceptibility and/or mortality; and, thirdly, expression of the machinery required to synthesize 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in normal human tissue seems to be much more widespread than originally thought. Collectively, these observations suggest that nonclassical metabolism and response to vitamin D might have a significant role in human physiology beyond skeletal and calcium homeostasis. Specific examples of this will be detailed in the current Review, with particular emphasis on the immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D.

### Clinical review: the role of the parent compound vitamin D with respect to metabolism and function: why clinical dose intervals can affect clinical outcomes [^112735xf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

There is no doubt that vitamin D must be activated to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to achieve full biological activity or that many tissues participate in this activation process-be it endocrine or autocrine. We believe that not only is 25-hydroxyvitamin D important to tissue delivery for this activation process, but also that intact vitamin D has a pivotal role in this process.

Objective

In this review, evidence on the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system is presented and discussed in relation to vitamin D-binding protein affinity, circulating half-lives, and enzymatic transformations of vitamin D metabolites, and how these affect biological action in any given tissue.

Conclusions

Circulating vitamin D, the parent compound, likely plays an important physiological role with respect to the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system, as a substrate in many tissues, not originally thought to be important. Based on emerging data from the laboratory, clinical trials, and data on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D amassed during many decades, it is likely that for the optimal functioning of these systems, significant vitamin D should be available on a daily basis to ensure stable circulating concentrations, implying that variation in vitamin D dosing schedules could have profound effects on the outcomes of clinical trials because of the short circulating half-life of intact vitamin D.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^111SH2XV]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

### Biology and mechanisms of action of the vitamin D hormone [^1167bapt]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The central role of hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1,25(OH) 2 D 3] is to regulate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis via actions in intestine, kidney, and bone. These and other actions in many cell types not involved in mineral metabolism are mediated by the vitamin D receptor. Recent studies using genome-wide scale techniques have extended fundamental ideas regarding vitamin D-mediated control of gene expression while simultaneously revealing a series of new concepts. This article summarizes the current view of the biological actions of the vitamin D hormone and focuses on new concepts that drive the understanding of the mechanisms through which vitamin D operates.

### Vitamin D: the iceberg nutrient [^114zxSHh]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The understanding of vitamin D's role in human health has recently expanded. It is now recognized as more than a hormone activated in the kidney only for calcium homeostasis. It is metabolized and used by virtually every cell in the body. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a deficit in their kidney production of 1,25(OH)(2)D and have classically been treated with calcitriol or its active analogues. Despite often having lower systemic levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D, patients with chronic kidney disease retain the capability of extra renal production of 1,25(OH)(2)D. This has far reaching implications for their health. This review examines clinical trials and observations in 3 areas that impact chronic kidney disease patients. Cancer, cardiovascular disease and infections are responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. We will discuss vitamin D's role in these disease states with a focus on the chronic kidney disease patient.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^116fiStm]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Because of the broad range of putative actions, there is much less consensus about the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D. Biochemical and genetic data clearly demonstrate that the vitamin D endocrine system could regulate, usually in a coherent fashion, a very large number of genes (∼3% of all genes). Evidently that includes mostly genes not related to calcium or bone homeostasis. Animal data largely confirm a coherent action at the cellular, tissue, or total-body level of the vitamin D endocrine system on cell proliferation, cell differentiation, the immune, muscular, cardiovascular, and other systems. These preclinical observations were made either in situations of total absence of vitamin D (action) or by exposure to supraphysiologic concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2 D or its analogs. A wealth of human cross-sectional and long-term prospective studies have linked a poor vitamin D status with a variety of human diseases as predicted on the basis of the preclinical data, including higher risk of cancer, infections, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors and events, and muscle dysfunction and falls. This has generated an intense interest and even irrational enthusiasm about the possible health effects of vitamin D supplements. Most governmental and scientific societies are more prudent and await further proof of causality before formulating optimal thresholds for serum 25OHD or optimal dosages beyond what is needed for skeletal effects. The proof of causality ultimately has to come from RCTs, but the recent introduction of MR studies has opened up a new strategy.

### Introduction to vitamin D symposium, March 14, 2008 [^1165r14U]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

A large body of work in diverse clinical and scientific areas has accumulated that supports a role for vitamin D in multiple organ systems and physiologic and molecular processes. The vitamin D receptor is distributed ubiquitously, and by binding with its receptor, vitamin D initiates a series of events that can affect cellular proliferation and differentiation, inflammation, the immune system, and the endocrine system, including the renin-angiotensin system, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism.

### Vitamin D and child health: part 2 (extraskeletal and other aspects) [^117GVNaM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

### Vitamin D and health in the 21st century: bone and beyond. executive summary [^11437sGW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is unique, in terms of its metabolism and physiologic features and the human reliance on both endogenous production (activation through exposure to ultraviolet light) and exogenous sources (diet, primarily fortified foods) to meet biological requirements. Recent evidence has indicated a reemergence of vitamin D-deficient rickets and an alarming prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (ie, low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) in particular segments of the US population. Furthermore, evidence has emerged implicating vitamin D status in a range of adverse health conditions, including cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a conference organized by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements was held to explore current knowledge and to develop a research agenda to address the range of issues associated with vitamin D and health during the life cycle. These proceedings contain presentations about 1) existing data on vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, 2) the current state of knowledge regarding the biological functions of vitamin D, 3) the strength of evidence supporting reconsideration of current policies regarding vitamin D intake, 4) gaps in understanding of the factors affecting and current options for improving vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, and 5) research needs to address gaps in knowledge regarding vitamin D assessment, biological features, and requirements. This executive summary provides an overview of the conference and its conclusions.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### The role of vitamin D in cancer prevention and treatment [^115cPni9]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Considerable data described in the first part of this review suggest that there is a role for vitamin D in cancer therapy and prevention. Although the preclinical data are persuasive and the epidemiologic data intriguing, no well-designed clinical trial of optimal administration of vitamin D as a cancer therapy has ever been conducted. Had there been the opportunity and insight to develop calcitriol as any other cancer drug, the following studies would have been completed: 1. Definition of the MTD. 2. Definition of a phase II dose, as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic agents. 3. Studies to define a biologically optimal dose. 4. Phase II (probably randomized phase II) studies of calcitriol alone and chemotherapy ± calcitriol. 5. Then, randomized phase III trials would be conducted and designed such that the only variable was the administration of calcitriol. Prerequisites 1 to 5 have not been completed for calcitriol. Preclinical data provide considerable rationale for continued development of vitamin D analogue-based cancer therapies. However, design of future studies should be informed by good clinical trials design principles and the mistakes of the past not repeated. Such studies may finally provide compelling data to prove whether or not there is a role for vitamin D analogues in cancer therapy.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Vitamin D and asthma [^115YsnB3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

asthma is a disease that continues to carry a significant health burden on humanity. Vitamin D is thought to play a role in many chronic diseases as it may possess immunomodulatory properties. This article will review the role of vitamin D regulation on the immune system and its potential implication in the pathophysiology of asthma.

Recent Findings

vitamin D receptors are present on many cells in the body, specifically peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the balance of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the immune system. Studies have suggested that prenatal vitamin D intake has an effect on childhood wheezing and asthma. Additionally, vitamin D may play a role in asthma exacerbations, and recent evidence also suggests its importance in steroid resistant asthma.

Summary

vitamin D has a complex role on the immune system and its regulation of various aspects of immunity has allowed speculation on its potential role in asthma. However, the net effect of vitamin D on the immune system and its role in asthma still remains unanswered. More research needs to address the diagnostic and therapeutic implications vitamin D may have in the future of asthma management.

### Blood biomarkers of vitamin D status [^111Pgz2L]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

In the past quarter century, more than 50 metabolites of vitamin D have been described. To date, only a few of these have been quantified in blood, but this has widened our understanding of the pathologic role that altered vitamin D metabolism plays in the development of diseases of calcium homeostasis. Currently, awareness is growing of the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in the general population in association with an increased risk of several diseases. However, for many researchers, it is not clear which vitamin D metabolites should be quantified and what the information gained from such an analysis tells us. Only 2 metabolites, namely, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], have received the greatest attention. Of these, the need for measuring serum 1,25(OH)2D is limited, and this metabolite should therefore not be considered as part of the standard vitamin D testing regimen. On the other hand, serum 25(OH)D provides the single best assessment of vitamin D status and thus should be the only vitamin D assay typically performed. Currently, numerous formats exist for measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This article reviews the currently available methods for serum 25(OH)D quantitation and considers important issues such as whether both the D2 and the D3 forms of the vitamin should be assayed, whether total or free concentrations are most important, and what measures should be taken to ensure the fidelity of the measurements.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Vitamin D and child health part 1 (skeletal aspects) [^1174bRGV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable clinical and academic interest in vitamin D as a consequence of a number of developments over the past decade. This was initially related to a recognised resurgence of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children in the UK and other countries. The potential importance of maternal vitamin D status on bone mass in early childhood and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peak bone mass has been the subject of much research. An additional development has been the recognition that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and what level should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review consists of two parts, the first focuses on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D, while the second will review some of the potential extraskeletal aspects, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

### The nonskeletal effects of vitamin D: an endocrine society scientific statement [^115QghEB]. Endocrine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Significant controversy has emerged over the last decade concerning the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal tissues. The demonstration that the vitamin D receptor is expressed in virtually all cells of the body and the growing body of observational data supporting a relationship of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases have led to widespread utilization of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention and treatment of numerous disorders. In this paper, we review both the basic and clinical aspects of vitamin D in relation to nonskeletal organ systems. We begin by focusing on the molecular aspects of vitamin D, primarily by examining the structure and function of the vitamin D receptor. This is followed by a systematic review according to tissue type of the inherent biological plausibility, the strength of the observational data, and the levels of evidence that support or refute an association between vitamin D levels or supplementation and maternal/child health as well as various disease states. Although observational studies support a strong case for an association between vitamin D and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neoplastic, and metabolic disorders, there remains a paucity of large-scale and long-term randomized clinical trials. Thus, at this time, more studies are needed to definitively conclude that vitamin D can offer preventive and therapeutic benefits across a wide range of physiological states and chronic nonskeletal disorders.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^112guEFx]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. There is a multitude of causes of vitamin D deficiency, but the major cause has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by the Institute of Medicine and other health agencies. It is likely that our hunter gatherer fore-fathers being exposed to sunlight on a daily basis were making several thousand IU of vitamin D a day. The fact that 100 IU of vitamin D prevented overt signs of rickets led to the false security that ingesting twice this amount was more than adequate to satisfy the body's vitamin D requirement. Although this may be true for preventing overt skeletal deformities associated with rickets, there is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. The likely reason is that essentially every tissue and cell in the body has a VDR and thus, to have enough vitamin D to satisfy all of these cellular requirements, the blood level of 25(OH)D needs to be above 30 ng/mL. It has been estimated that for every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested that the blood level of 25(OH)D increases by 1 ng/mL. Thus to theoretically achieve a blood level above 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 3000 IU of vitamin D a day. There is evidence, however, that when the blood levels of 25(OH)D are less than 15 ng/mL, the body is able to more efficiently use vitamin D to raise the blood level to about 20 ng/mL. To raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 100 IU of vitamin D for every 1-ng increase; therefore to increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D a day for adults. There is a great need to significantly increase the recommended adequate intakes of vitamin D. All neonates during the first year of life should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D, and increasing it to 1000 IU/d may provide additional health benefits. Children 1 year and older should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D as recently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but they should consider increasing intake up to 2000 IU/d derive maximum health benefits from vitamin D. Prepubertal and teenage girls who received 2000 IU of vitamin D per day for a year showed improvement in their musculoskeletal health with no untoward toxicity. All adults should be taking 2000 IU of vitamin D per day. A recent study reported that adults who took 50,000 IU of vitamin D once every 2 weeks, which is equivalent to taking 3000 IU of vitamin D a day, for up to 6 years was effective in maintaining blood levels of 25(OH)D of between 40 and 60 ng/mL without any toxicity. There is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake, with the exception of acquired disorders such as granulomatous diseases including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, as well as some lymphomas with activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)2D3 in an unregulated fashion.

### Asthma, allergy and respiratory infections: the vitamin D hypothesis [^114pc8Hh]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

The recent discovery that every tissue in the human body has vitamin D receptors and that vitamin D has pleiotropic effects has prompted an increased interest in this hormone. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread and on the increase. There is no consensus on the serum vitamin D levels to consider appropriate for global health, the cutoffs for its deficiency, or the doses to use for its supplementation. Vitamin D seems to correlate closely with host reactions against various respiratory infections. Epidemiological studies have shown that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of upper and lower respiratory infections in children and a shortage of vitamin D may contribute to asthmatic patients' symptoms and morbidity rates. There are studies highlighting associations between childhood asthma, fetal lung and/or immune development, and maternal vitamin D intake. An insufficiency of this vitamin also seems to be implicated in the onset of childhood atopy and food allergies. The hypothesis is that vitamin D could have a central role in these pathological situations and that it may represent a novel preventive and/or therapeutic strategy. This article reviews and discusses published data on the relationship between vitamin D and asthma and allergy, emphasizing the need for controlled, prospective studies on vitamin D supplementation to clarify whether it has a role in the prevention of and treatment for asthma and allergic conditions.

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^113pqMPU]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Because the numerous epidemiological and experimental data indicate the beneficial role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancers, clinical use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs has been investigated. However, hypercalcemia, the major toxic effect of vitamin D, has strongly limited its clinical applications. Moreover, accumulating data suggest that cancer cells employ several mechanisms that reduce cellular calcitriol levels, as well as diminish its function to protect themselves from the antitumorigenic effects of vitamin D. Thus, understanding how vitamin D metabolism and signaling are dysregulated in cancer will help develop efficient therapeutic strategies to overcome such limitations of using vitamin D or its analogs for clinical purpose.

In this review, we provide an overview of vitamin D metabolic pathways and summarize antitumorigenic functions and mechanisms of vitamin D. In addition, we discuss how vitamin D metabolism and function are dysregulated in cancer to promote resistance to the antitumorigenic effect of vitamin D. Finally, we discuss future directions to overcome the limitations of and improve vitamin D-based cancer therapy.

### Evidence-based policy on dietary calcium and vitamin D [^1167np1J]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D makes a positive contribution by grounding its recommendations on the available evidence base. The committee does not substantially change recommended dietary intakes for calcium and modestly increases those for vitamin D based on the need for a median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40 nmol/L. They do not support the suggestion that all adults should have levels > 75 nmol/L. The committee concludes that current evidence does not support nonskeletal benefits for vitamin D or calcium, and notes that higher intakes of both could have adverse health consequences. The present authors are generally in agreement with these conclusions, with some caveats regarding the evidence base used. However, we believe that the central role of sunlight exposure in determining vitamin D status needs to be explicitly reflected in public policy in this area.

### Why the IOM recommendations for vitamin D are deficient [^116s7MJA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail in a major way on logic, on science, and on effective public health guidance. Moreover, by failing to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach constitutes precisely the wrong model for development of nutritional policy.

### From vitamin D to hormone D: fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system essential for good health [^111Mq8q3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

New knowledge of the biological and clinical importance of the steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and its receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has resulted in significant contributions to good bone health. However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases. Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health. Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D(3), as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least 9-fold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid). Now, research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) initiates the physiologic responses of ≥ 36 cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3,) researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in ≥ 10 extrarenal organs. This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, including its potential for contributions to good health in 5 physiologic arenas in which investigators have clearly documented new biological actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D(3) intake (defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations) should be reevaluated, taking into account the contributions to good health that all 36 VDR target organs can provide.

### Vitamin D and respiratory health [^11313PxD]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is now known to be of physiological importance outside of bone health and calcium homeostasis, and there is mounting evidence that it plays a beneficial role in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of diseases. In this brief review the known effects of vitamin D on immune function are described in relation to respiratory health. Vitamin D appears capable of inhibiting pulmonary inflammatory responses while enhancing innate defence mechanisms against respiratory pathogens. Population-based studies showing an association between circulating vitamin D levels and lung function provide strong justification for randomized controlled clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with respiratory diseases to assess both efficacy and optimal dosage.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^113ucDoM]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

A causal role of vitamin D for bone health is well established, as vitamin D deficiency is the cause of most cases of rickets and osteomalacia. Vitamin D also plays a major role in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy, and its deficiency can accelerate bone loss and osteoporosis of the elderly. Preclinical data suggest that severe vitamin D deficiency may have extraskeletal effects. Many observational studies also link a poor vitamin D status to a wide variety of extraskeletal diseases. However, cause and effect have not been confirmed, and therefore the optimal vitamin D intake or optimal levels of the major circulating metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) to achieve clinically detectable nonskeletal effects are not known.

The origin, transport, metabolism, and action of vitamin D have many similarities with those of iodide/thyroid hormones. Therefore, we compare both endocrine systems in Table 1. Vitamin D is either of dietary origin or can be synthesized in the skin under the influence of UV-B light. The dietary intake of vitamin D (mostly D 3 and minimal amounts of D 2) is usually low. Similarly, iodide intake is variable and depends on geography and dietary habits. For both systems, a complex system allows first the storage of precursor molecules in tissues (Table 1), followed by secretion of a prohormone in the blood where it is bound to specific transport proteins. Thereafter, the hormone precursors (25OHD and T 4, respectively) can be activated into the hormone [1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) and T 3, respectively] or inactived into other metabolites [initially mainly 24R,25(OH) 2 D and reverse T 3, respectively, but followed later by many other metabolites]. The active hormones have a high affinity for their respective nuclear receptors [vitamin D receptor (VDR) and thyroid hormone receptor] but much lower affinity for their serum transport proteins, thereby favoring the selective nuclear uptake of the hormones whereas the precursor preferentially remains in the bloodstream. The essential aspects of vitamin D metabolism and action are presented in Fig. 1. 25OHD can enter the renal tubuli as free [not bound to the vitamin D–binding protein (DBP) or not bound to proteins in general] via the bloodstream or as a complex with DBP by uptake mediated by megalin/cubulin after filtration in the glomerulus. Most other cells only have access to free 25OHD except maybe for a few cells with low expression of megalin (placenta and parathyroid cells). Therefore, free 25OHD and the extrarenal expression of CYP2B1 define the local production of 1,25(OH) 2 D outside the kidney. Only kidney-produced 1,25(OH) 2 D can be exported to the bloodstream. Free 1,25(OH) 2 D then can gain access to the target tissues, activate the VDR, and thereby regulate gene transcription. A very large number of genes (∼3% of the human genome) are under the direct or indirect control of the active hormones, suggesting a broad spectrum of activities (Table 1). 1,25(OH) 2 D may also activate nongenomic pathways either by binding to the VDR or another receptor located in lipid rafts in caveolae, thereby transiently regulating ion channel activity (especially chloride and calcium channels), kinases, and phosphatases. The biological consequences of VDR activation are well understood and described in greater detail in this review. The biological implications of nongenomic actions for tissue or whole-body physiology are poorly understood. We mention two examples. First, the in vivo administration of a bolus of 1,25(OH) 2 D can rapidly and transiently increase intestinal calcium absorption in chicks. Second, the absence of FAM57B2, a membrane receptor for 24R,25(OH) 2 D, results in a transient delay in fracture healing, similar to the same phenotype as found in cyp24a1 -deficient mice. We will survey the well-documented and potential benefits of vitamin D and the risks associated with vitamin D deficiency with the goal of identifying a vitamin D status that is effective and safe in protecting health globally. First, we summarize data related to metabolic bone diseases and thereafter summarize the present state of the art regarding the possible extraskeletal actions of the vitamin D endocrine system. Throughout this review, preclinical data are briefly summarized, whereas human data are discussed in somewhat greater detail. Observational studies are briefly summarized whereas we focus more on Mendelian randomization (MR) trials and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses. Indeed, apart from an ongoing discussion about the relative value of observational vs RCTs, most governmental authorities consider RCTs the most convincing way to demonstrate the role of vitamin D in health. There is increasing attention to the use of MR studies to evaluate the lifelong consequences of genetically predisposed lower or higher serum 25OHD concentrations and health outcomes.

Vitamin D Metabolism and Mechanism of Action

Metabolism

Vitamin D 3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D 2 and D 3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D 3 23) hydroxy forms 24,25(OH) 2 D 2/3, 23,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 2/3 (or 1,23,25(OH) 3 D 3). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH) 2 D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

### The effects of vitamin D deficiency in athletes [^113qbPsm]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D acts to maintain calcium and phosphate homeostasis within the body. It is now estimated that 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient. This problem is particularly important to athletes of all ages, as vitamin D plays a significant role in bone health, immune function, and physical performance. In the deficient state, the athlete may be at an increased risk for potential problems such as stress fractures, respiratory infections, and muscle injuries. The purpose of this article is to examine vitamin D deficiency and review its relationship to the athlete.

### Genome-wide association study of circulating vitamin D levels [^115Fs2uw]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The primary form of circulating vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], is a modifiable quantitative trait associated with multiple medical outcomes, including osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, selected malignancies, and especially colorectal cancer, with rickets being the most common expression of severe clinical vitamin D deficiency in children. The concentration of 25(OH)D in blood, which reflects endogenous generation through ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure as well as exogenous dietary and supplemental vitamin D intake, is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status. Following metabolic activation to 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] through multiple hydroxylation steps, vitamin D has pleiotropic effects in addition to its traditional role in calcium homeostasis; for example, vitamin D receptor response elements directly or indirectly influence cell cycling and proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

### Vitamin D binding protein polymorphisms significantly impact vitamin D status in children [^112JN8Hx]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The meanings of vitD "sufficiency" or "deficiency" are still controversial. If referring solely to circulating 25-D concentrations associated with the endocrine role of vitD, then serum calcium and PTH concentration, bone density, and growth are likely good clinical correlates of deficiency. Even most current studies addressing the relationship of free or bioavailable vitD metabolites to VDBP genetic diversity are solely focused on this endocrine role of vitD (e.g. are African-Americans truly vitD deficient with low circulating 25-D if they have high bone density?). However, a large body of research over the past few decades has now elucidated hundreds of other genes and physiologic processes affected by vitD, many of which are associated with subtle, homeostatic regulation that could potentially influence life-long health, and are much more difficult to correlate to simple clinical/pathological measurements. This accumulated research is what primarily led the Endocrine Society to distinguish between deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency in circulating 25-D. Although the official recommendation of sufficiency in that report was for circulating 25-D of ≥ 75 nmol/L, even a range of 100–150 nmol/L (40–60 ng/ml) was considered safe and would likely guarantee full sufficiency in most children and adults.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Bone metabolism-an underappreciated player [^114Krxua]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The uptake of key nutrients of bone, including vitamin D and calcium, affects bone mass. Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that plays a vital role in maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis and calcium absorption. Vitamin D affects bone metabolism and metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and NAFLD. While vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is mainly produced from the skin by sunlight exposure, the synthesis of vitamin D3 varies by various factors such as age and season. Vitamin D also regulates non-skeletal tissues such as adipocytes, and adipocytes are a main vitamin D storage site. Individuals with obesity have lower levels of vitamin D in the circulation due to increased clearance of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency leads to decreased calcium absorption, secondary hyperparathyroidism, high bone turnover, bone loss, bone fractures, and mineralization defects. Severe vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD is still inconclusive and the optimal levels of vitamin D may differ by disease status or the levels of obesity of individuals. There are many other nutrient factors affecting bone and energy metabolism (reviewed in ref.), which are not discussed in this review.

### Vitamin D: effects on childhood health and disease [^111J2DAH]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is a key nutrient for both healthy children and those with chronic illnesses. Understanding its roles in health and disease has become one of the most important issues in the nutritional management of children. Formal guidelines related to nutrient requirements for vitamin D in healthy children, recommending dietary intakes of 400 IU per day for infants and 600 IU per day for children over 1 year of age, were released by the Institute of Medicine in November 2010. However, application of these guidelines to children with acute and chronic illnesses is less clear. In this Review, we consider major illness categories and specific examples of conditions in children that might be affected by vitamin D. This information can be used in developing both model systems of investigation and clinical trials of vitamin D in children with acute and chronic illnesses.

### Oxidative stress, type 2 diabetes and vitamin D: past, present and future [^1113syjg]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between potentially harmful free radicals and the body's mechanisms to efficiently detoxify them in favor of the free radicals. Consequently, excess free radicals can attack and damage a wide range of biomolecules including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Antioxidant mechanisms of the body are under the influence of genetic and environmental (including dietary) factors. Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic disorders around the world. A huge body of evidence indicates a role for oxidative stress in development of many human diseases including diabetes. In this article, the latest information on the possible links of oxidative stress with diabetes development, control and complications as well as the newest results of antioxidant supplementation trials is reviewed. In addition, the possible role of vitamin D, as a newly recognized antioxidant in diabetes is discussed. Finally, concluding remarks on pivotal issues and future studies are presented.

National guidance on the management of vitamin D

Unsurprisingly, this has led to controversy and confusion in the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to help will clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians and other practising clinicians containing key recommendations around
best way of estimating vitamin D status;
recommendations for vitamin D testing;
threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency;
treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on maintenance therapy;
guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance, and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of their patients.

Key points

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high world-wide, particularly in the elderly.
25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
Muscle weakness due to vitamin deficiency is reversible with vitamin D supplementation.
Recent National guidance has been published on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^11639dQb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

### Vitamin D and risk of cause specific death: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort and randomised intervention studies [^113KukXJ]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Possible explanations for findings

The inverse association between vitamin D and mortality can be explained by several different mechanisms. Firstly, activated vitamin D may influence a range of biological responses involved in cellular growth, proliferation, and apoptosis and immune system functions. Vitamin D receptors and the enzyme required for its activation are present in most human cells and tissues, indicating a major role for vitamin D in "non-skeletal" physiological processes. Secondly, approximately 3000 binding sites for the vitamin D receptor have been found throughout the human genome, indicating regulation of a very large number of genes (estimated to be about 3% of the human genome) either directly or indirectly responsive to vitamin D receptors. This, along with the potential adverse consequences of low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, such as coronary heart disease, cancer, and death, found in people with 25-hydroxyvitamin D related genetic variants, reinforces the importance of an endocrine system beyond extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Thirdly, the positive association between vitamin D concentrations and longer leucocyte telomere length, a potential determinant of age related disorders and overall longevity, emphasises the possible beneficial effects of vitamin D on healthy ageing and associated outcomes. Fourthly, as primary causes of vitamin D deficiency include insufficient exposure to sunlight, poor diet, increased adiposity, and reduced synthesis or absorption, a poor vitamin D status might essentially reflect suboptimal lifestyle and socioeconomic circumstances. These individual level factors may, in turn, influence risk for their potential roles on several established determinants of morbidity and mortality such as smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, and use of supplements. Although most of the studies included in this review controlled for these characteristics, and our pooled estimates were largely unchanged when they were further stratified by adjustment for standard socioeconomic factors, potential residual and unmeasured confounding by differences in diet, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status remains a concern. Such unaccounted confounding could partly explain the discrepancy of findings observed earlier between observational and interventional studies of other dietary factors. Finally, our study indicates that vitamin D is inversely and moderately associated with risk of death from coronary disease, lymphoma, cancers of the upper digestive tract, and respiratory disease. Although these associations require better characterisation in future larger studies, local expression of vitamin D receptors and systemic immunomodulatory roles of vitamin D have been proposed to explain them.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

Conclusions

The available scientific evidence supports a key role for calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health, providing a sound basis for DRIs. The evidence, however, is not yet compelling that either nutrient confers benefits for, or is causally related to, extraskeletal health outcomes. Moreover, existing evidence suggests that nearly all individuals meet their needs at intake levels (RDAs) provided in this report and, for vitamin D, at 25OHD levels of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) even under conditions of minimal sun exposure. Furthermore, higher levels have not been shown consistently to confer greater benefits, challenging the concept that "more is better". The Committee finds that the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in the North American population has been overestimated by some groups due to the use of inappropriate cut-points that greatly exceed the levels identified in this report. Serum concentrations of 25OHD above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) are not consistently associated with increased benefit, and risks have been identified for some outcomes at 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter). Additional research, including large-scale, randomized clinical trials, is needed. In the meantime, however, we believe that there is an urgent clinical and public health need for consensus cut-points for serum 25OHD inadequacy to avoid problems of both undertreatment and overtreatment.

### The role of baseline serum 25 (OH) D concentration for a potential personalized vitamin D supplementation [^111abPzu]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

There are many examples in clinical nutrition with individuals responding differently to a dietary intervention. Here, personalized nutritional recommendations could be targeted, tailoring interventions to address plurality in response. For this, we reconsidered two randomized controlled trials investigating whether two different supplementation doses of cholecalciferol resulted in an increased serum 25(OH)D concentration. Three different statistical methods were applied in order to identify participants who would enjoy an increased benefit from receiving a specific dose of cholecalciferol. We concluded that, for individuals with high baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations, only the high supplementation dose will lead to a substantial increase in the serum 25(OH)D concentration. The presented statistical methods can be adequately used for more individualized approaches.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^115HFQ27]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

This article summarizes the new 2011 report on dietary requirements for calcium and vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM). An IOM Committee charged with determining the population needs for these nutrients in North America conducted a comprehensive review of the evidence for both skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes. The Committee concluded that available scientific evidence supports a key role of calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health, consistent with a cause-and-effect relationship and providing a sound basis for determination of intake requirements. For extraskeletal outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders, the evidence was inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements. Randomized clinical trial evidence for extraskeletal outcomes was limited and generally uninformative. Based on bone health, Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs; covering requirements of ≥ 97.5% of the population) for calcium range from 700 to 1300 mg/d for life-stage groups at least 1 yr of age. For vitamin D, RDAs of 600 IU/d for ages 1–70 yr and 800 IU/d for ages 71 yr and older, corresponding to a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter), meet the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. RDAs for vitamin D were derived based on conditions of minimal sun exposure due to wide variability in vitamin D synthesis from ultraviolet light and the risks of skin cancer. Higher values were not consistently associated with greater benefit, and for some outcomes U-shaped associations were observed, with risks at both low and high levels. The Committee concluded that the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in North America has been overestimated. Urgent research and clinical priorities were identified, including reassessment of laboratory ranges for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, to avoid problems of both undertreatment and overtreatment.

Uncertainties and Future Research Needs

The Committee identified a large number of uncertainties surrounding the DRI values, as well as extensive research needs. A particular priority is rigorous, large-scale, randomized clinical trials to test the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal outcomes, as well as to identify threshold effects and possible adverse effects where present. Elucidating the biology of the diverse effects of vitamin D, as well as effects of sun exposure, adiposity, body composition, race/ethnicity, and genetic factors on these associations, is also of great importance.

Comparison Between the Vitamin D and Thyroid Endocrine Systems

Figure 1.
Metabolism and action of vitamin D and its metabolites, with special focus on renal and extrarenal production of 1,25(OH) 2 D and the genomic or nongenomic pathways of vitamin D action.

Indeed, serum 25OHD concentrations are under genetic control, and several large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have consistently identified a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around genes involved in vitamin D synthesis, metabolism, and transport, which alone or in combination modify serum 25OHD concentrations. Such data allow identifying subjects with genetically predisposed serum 25OHD significantly lower or higher than the mean of the population. Therefore, large-scale genetic studies can define whether such genetically predisposed lower serum 25OHD concentrations are linked to specific health outcomes, thereby avoiding the problem of reverse causation, residual confounding, or limited duration of observation or interventions. MR studies dealing with vitamin D status, however, are limited by the relatively low predicted differences in serum 25OHD (usually < 5% of total variation). Additionally, such studies evaluate only linear correlations and cannot detect effects above or below a certain threshold.

Finally, we present the major outstanding research questions. For the purpose of this review, we define vitamin deficiency by serum 25OHD < 50 nmol/L (or 20 ng/mL) and severe vitamin D deficiency by values < 30 nmol/L (or 12 ng/mL). A more extensive analysis of the assay methodology to estimate the vitamin D status and the definition of vitamin D status is discussed in other recent studies.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

### Determinants of vitamin D status: focus on genetic variations [^117Hu3Zr]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of vitamin D beyond its importance for bone health is under much debate. In this article, we review recent evidence for genetic influences on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and discuss the uses of this information and its importance for public health.

Recent Findings

Findings from large-scale genome-wide association meta-analyses on 25(OH)D confirmed the associations for loci nearby genes encoding vitamin D binding protein (GC, group component), 7-dehydrochlesterol reductase (DHCR7), 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), all influencing key sites for vitamin D metabolism. Findings from candidate gene studies have been inconsistent, with some implicating an association with 25(OH)D for loci near the gene encoding the hormonal vitamin D activation enzyme (CYP27B1).

Summary

The amount of variation in 25(OH)D explained by genetic determinants is small compared with environmental exposures. Information on genetic variants affecting 25(OH)D can be used as tools for Mendelian randomization analyses on vitamin D, and they provide some potential for the use as drug targets.

### Vitamin D and breast cancer [^113WfUua]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.

### Vitamin D across the lifecycle: physiology and biomarkers [^11317iFW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The field of vitamin D public health research has a pressing need to define sensitive and specific predictors of vitamin D status that can be used to determine whether an individual or population has a supply of vitamin D that is sufficient to meet requirements. The aim of this review is to highlight the considerations needed when evaluating evidence of the relations between vitamin D biomarkers and functional or health outcomes across the life cycle. It draws attention to the importance of distinguishing between biomarkers of supply, function, and outcome and of considering the many factors that could influence interpretation, such as life stage, ethnicity, body mass index, liver and kidney function, and dietary calcium and phosphorus intake. The vitamin D biomarkers that have shown the most utility to date are the plasma concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (supply), the plasma concentration of parathyroid hormone (function), and the presence or absence of rickets (outcome). However, a single biomarker of vitamin D status or threshold value is unlikely to be valid in all situations. The field therefore needs research to refine existing biomarkers or establish new indicators that take the many factors into account and to identify useful functional biomarkers of vitamin D status for infants, children, women of reproductive age, and specific ethnic groups. However, evidence using the biomarkers currently available shows that frank vitamin D deficiency is a major public health problem in many parts of the world that requires urgent attention.

### Official recommendations for vitamin D through the life stages in developed countries [^113yNH2n]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Inadequate vitamin D nutritional status is prevalent worldwide and has been associated with autoimmune disorders, heart disease, deadly cancers, insulin resistance, inflammation, neurological disorders, adverse outcomes in pregnancy, and increased risk for mortality. Expert recommendations for vitamin D intake differ between governmental agencies and practice guidelines from medical societies due to differences in the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. In addition, separate health promotion bodies also provide targeted recommendations for the prevention of specific disorders such as reducing risk for developing some cancers and autoimmune diseases. We review and provide perspectives regarding various recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM, United States) and Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN; United Kingdom), the World Health Organization, the Endocrine Society and other expert groups by life stage as a guide intended for clinician use.

### Vitamin D in systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases [^114ynzBH]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Lately, vitamin D has been linked with metabolic and immunological processes, which established its role as an essential component of human health preservation. Vitamin D has been defined as natural immune modulators, and upon activation of its receptors (VDRs), it regulates calcium metabolism, cellular growth, proliferation and apoptosis, and other immunological functions. Epidemiological data underline a strong correlation between poor vitamin D status and higher risk for chronic inflammatory illnesses of various etiologies, including autoimmune diseases. Epidemiological, genetic, and basic studies indicated a potential role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of certain systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. These studies demonstrate correlation between low vitamin D and prevalence of diseases. In addition, VDRs' polymorphisms observed in some of these autoimmune diseases may further support a plausible pathogenic link. Notably, for some autoimmune disease, no correlation with vitamin D levels could be confirmed. Thus, in the current review we present the body of evidence regarding the plausible roles of vitamin D and VDR's polymorphism in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. We summarize the data regarding systemic (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) and organ-specific (i.e., multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis, etc.) autoimmune diseases, in which low level of vitamin D was found comparing to healthy subjects. In addition, we discuss the correlations between vitamin D levels and clinical manifestations and/or activity of diseases. In this context, we address the rational for vitamin D supplementation in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Further studies addressing the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects autoimmunity and the proper supplementation required are needed.

Birth to 12 months: human milk — role, composition, and vitamin D guidance are summarized as follows: there is near universal agreement that human milk is the preferred complete nutrition source for healthy full-term newborns and infants for the first 6 months of life, with continued breastfeeding recommended until age 12 months. Human milk is high in fat (45–55 percent of total calories), saturated fat, and cholesterol. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the AAP recommends supplementation with 400 international units per day (IU/d) for all children, and the new RDA for Vitamin D for those 1–70 years old is 600 IU/day. The evidence review identified possibly but not conclusively protective cardiovascular benefits of breastfeeding, including lower serum TC levels and decreased carotid intima-media thickness in adulthood and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, while in infancy mean TC was higher in breastfed versus formula-fed infants but this difference disappeared in childhood and adolescence; among adults, the TC level of those who had been breastfed as infants was lower than that of those who had been formula fed.

### Vitamin D: importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis [^113qJMQH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to put into perspective the many health benefits of vitamin D and the role of vitamin D deficiency in increasing the risk of many common and serious diseases, including some common cancers, type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Numerous epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sunlight, which enhances the production of vitamin D(3) in the skin, is important in preventing many chronic diseases. Because very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, sunlight supplies most of our vitamin D requirement. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the metabolite that should be measured in the blood to determine vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in infants who are solely breastfed and who do not receive vitamin D supplementation and in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities. Vitamin D deficiency is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. A new dietary source of vitamin D is orange juice fortified with vitamin D. Studies in both human and animal models add strength to the hypothesis that the unrecognized epidemic of vitamin D deficiency worldwide is a contributing factor of many chronic debilitating diseases. Greater awareness of the insidious consequences of vitamin D deficiency is needed. Annual measurement of serum 25(OH)D is a reasonable approach to monitoring for vitamin D deficiency. The recommended adequate intakes for vitamin D are inadequate, and, in the absence of exposure to sunlight, a minimum of 1000 IU vitamin D/d is required to maintain a healthy concentration of 25(OH)D in the blood.

### Health effects of vitamin D supplementation: lessons learned from randomized controlled trials and mendelian randomization studies [^116iFrFV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and many cellular processes. Although vitamin D supplements are widely recommended for community-dwelling adults, definitive data on whether these supplements benefit clinically important skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes have been conflicting. Although observational studies on effects of vitamin D on musculoskeletal and extraskeletal outcomes may be confounded by reverse causation, randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies can help to elucidate causation. In this review, we summarize the recent findings from large RCTs and/or MR studies of vitamin D on bone health and risk of fractures, falls, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, disorders of the immune system, multiple sclerosis, and mortality in community-dwelling adults. The primary analyses indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not decrease bone loss, fractures, falls, cancer incidence, hypertension, or cardiovascular risk in generally healthy populations. Large RCTs and meta-analyses suggest an effect of supplemental vitamin D on cancer mortality. The existence of extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D supplementations are best documented for the immune system especially in people with poor vitamin D status, autoimmune diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce all-cause mortality. These findings, in mostly vitamin D-replete populations, do not apply to older adults in residential communities or adults with vitamin D deficiency or osteoporosis. The focus of vitamin D supplementation should shift from widespread use in generally healthy populations to targeted vitamin D supplementation in select individuals, good nutritional approaches, and elimination of vitamin D deficiency globally. © 2023 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

Mortality

If low vitamin D status has such broad-ranging effects on so many (extraskeletal) tissues as described above, it would certainly increase the risk of a variety of diseases and thus ultimately increase mortality risks. No preclinical data exist on the relationship between longevity and vitamin D status. Many observational studies, as described above, associate a poor vitamin D status with nearly all major human diseases, and therefore it would not be surprising that a poor vitamin D status would be associated with increased mortality risk. Indeed, most observational studies found higher mortality rates in persons with the lowest vitamin D quartiles or quintiles in European and US populations, with the highest mortality rates found in subjects with serum 25OHD < 50 to 60 nmol/L. These very large studies also raised concerns about a U-shaped mortality curve, which suggests a slightly increased mortality rate in participants with the higher serum 25OHD levels. However, subsequent recalibration of serum 25OHD determinations decreased the number of NHANES participants with high serum 25OHD [> 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL)], so that the apparent increased mortality in the two high serum 25OHD groups disappeared. A meta-analysis of eight prospective studies on > 2600 participants (50 to 79 years of age) demonstrated a consistently higher overall mortality rate in participants with the lowest serum 25OHD concentrations (usually well below 50 nmol/L). This observation included subjects living in different areas of the world (United States, Europe, and Japan). Surprisingly, the Leiden longevity study found that the offspring of nonagenarians (age > 90 years) with at least one other nonagenarian in the family had lower (not higher as expected) serum 25OHD levels.

### Vitamin D status in gastrointestinal and liver disease [^114HyB1U]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to report on the vitamin D status and its relationship with bone health in individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disorders. In addition, recommendations regarding replacement and maintenance of optimal vitamin D stores, as well as the state of knowledge regarding its effect on the disease through its actions on the immune system, will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

The scientific community has revised upward the serum levels of vitamin D considered optimal, and doses of vitamin D much larger than those currently recommended may be needed to maintain these levels, especially in individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disorders. The relationship between vitamin D and bone health in this population is controversial. The role of vitamin D in the regulation of the immune system continues to be elucidated.

Summary

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disease. Although replacement and supplementation guidelines have not been well defined, practitioners should aim for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 32 ng/ml. The contribution of vitamin D to the bone health of these individuals and its role in altering disease course through its actions on the immune system remain to be elucidated.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

Extraskeletal Outcomes

Putative extraskeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 4. There are many preclinical data on the extraskeletal effects of the vitamin D endocrine system, including gene regulation, cellular function, and in vivo animal studies. Indeed, about 3% of the mammalian genome is under some control of vitamin D, and most cells express VDR or can synthesize the active hormone 1,25(OH) 2 D locally. Observational data largely align with these data as poor vitamin D status is associated with many human diseases. To complete the observational data, many large-scale trials that evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on several extraskeletal health outcomes have been carried out recently, including the large VITAL (USA) and D-Health (Australia) studies, as well as the ViDA (New Zealand), FIND (Finland), and the D2d (USA) trials (Table 3). Smaller scale studies, such as the Calgary and the DO-Health (Switzerland), provide additional data. Moreover, there are now good genetic data on the prediction of serum 25(OH)D, which resulted in about 100 MR studies.

Such impairments result in lower quality of life and higher mortality, and can even increase acute COVID-19 severity and long COVID risk. Clear boxes with dashed outlines refer to the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency; dark boxes refer to the negative extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D: roles in renal and cardiovascular protection [^114vSosP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Great progress has been made in recent years in understanding the expanding roles of the vitamin D endocrine system beyond calcemic regulation, including pathophysiological actions in the kidney and the cardiovascular system. The purpose of this review is to update the recent advance regarding the effects of vitamin D and its analogs on the renal and cardiovascular system.

Recent Findings

Vitamin D deficiency is not only widely associated with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease in humans, but may also accelerate the disease progression. Dysregulation of vitamin D metabolism caused by renal insufficiency contributes to the low vitamin D status. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated impressive therapeutic outcome with low-calcemic vitamin D analogs in renal and cardiovascular disease. The mechanism underlying the renal and cardiovascular protection involves regulation of multiple signaling pathways by vitamin D including nuclear factor κB, Wnt/β-catenin and the renin-angiotensin system.

Summary

The renal and cardiovascular protective activity of vitamin D revealed in recent studies has profound clinical implications. Nutritional correction of vitamin D deficiency and treatment with vitamin D analogs could be therapeutic options for renal and cardiovascular problems. New vitamin D analogs with better renal and cardiovascular therapeutic efficacy are highly desired. More randomized trials are needed to address these issues.

### IOM committee members respond to endocrine society vitamin D guideline [^113736uM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

### Optimal vitamin D status: a critical analysis on the basis of evidence-based medicine [^114aveQL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Public health authorities around the world recommend widely variable supplementation strategies for adults, whereas several professional organizations, including The Endocrine Society, recommend higher supplementation.

Methods

We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health.

Conclusions

The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies. However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The greatest risk for cancer, infections, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels below 20 ng/mL. There is ample evidence from RCTs that calcium and bone homeostasis, estimated from serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH, calcium absorption, or bone mass, can be normalized by 25OHD levels above 20 ng/mL. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation (800 IU/d) in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20%. Such a dose will bring serum levels of 25OHD above 20 ng/mL in nearly all postmenopausal women. Based on calculations of the metabolic clearance of 25OHD, a daily intake of 500–700 IU of vitamin D3 is sufficient to maintain serum 25OHD levels of 20 ng/mL. Therefore, the recommendations for a daily intake of 1500–2000 IU/d or serum 25OHD levels of 30 ng or higher for all adults or elderly subjects, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Task Force, are premature. Fortunately, ongoing RCTs will help to guide us to solve this important public health question.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on assisted reproduction technology (ART) outcomes and underlying biological mechanisms: protocol of a randomized clinical controlled trial. the "supplementation of vitamin D and reproductive outcome" (SUNDRO) study [^113wyy2y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D plays an important role in human physiology and pathology. The activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) may regulate directly and/or indirectly the expression of a very large number of genes (0.5–5% of the total human genome). Accordingly, vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to increase the risk of several diseases including cancers, auto-immune diseases, infections and pregnancy complications.

In recent years, a role of vitamin D has been also postulated in reproductive health. VDR is expressed in the ovary, the endometrium and the myometrium. Moreover, vitamin D has been shown to influence female fertility potential in animals and humans. In vitro fertilization (IVF) success was demonstrated to be higher in women with appropriate reserves of vitamin D. In a recent contribution from our group, we detected an adjusted odds ratio (a-OR) (adjusted for age, ethnicity, BMI, parity, duration of infertility, number of retrieved oocytes, number of transferred embryos, and study period) of 2.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23–3.77] for clinical pregnancy rate in women with vitamin D > 20 ng/ml compared to those with vitamin D < 20 ng/ml. A similar figure was observed when considering the implantation rate. Of note, this beneficial effect was even more evident when using a threshold of 30 ng/ml. The large body of evidence available in animal models and data from in vitro studies in women strongly favour a causal relation, but evidence from RCTs is required to definitely support a role for vitamin D in influencing the chances of pregnancy. To date, only a small RCT has been published and no benefits emerged. However, the study was insufficiently powered to draw definite conclusions (in total 117 women). Moreover, only women scheduled for frozen embryo transfer were included.

### Vitamin D receptor signaling and cancer [^111Vdsqd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS AND SUMMARY

Enthusiasm remains for exploiting vitamin D signaling in cancer systems. This partly reflects that the biology is now very well-understood, that the toxicities associated with vitamin D compounds are easily monitored and managed and that in an era of high dimensional biological data it is possible to measure and dissect the actions of VDR signaling in very great detail. It seems likely that efforts will continue to exploit vitamin D compounds in the clinical setting, and it may well be that by exploiting tools to very accurately measure tumor type and burden will allow vitamin D-centered therapies to be applied with great precision. It seems likely that among the actions of VDR, the immunomodulatory capacity may ultimately be the ones that are most advantageous in cancer therapies.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117GQRA]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is reported worldwideand has been associated with non-communicable and infectious diseases. Africa has a high burden of infectious diseases, and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is increasing. A 2014 report by WHO estimates that the burden of non-communicable diseases will overtake that of communicable diseases in Africa by 2030, a trend that has been attributed to lifestyle changes related to rapid urbanisation. Individuals of African ancestry living in temperate regions have a poorer vitamin D status than do other ethnicities, which has been associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers observed among African–American people. The presence of vitamin D receptors in most tissues and cells and the regulation of more than 200 human genes by vitamin D suggest that vitamin D could have diverse roles in maintaining health.

Measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is widely accepted as a proxy for vitamin D status. However, no consensus has been reached on the definition of low vitamin D status. Rickets and osteomalacia are associated with severe vitamin D deficiency, characterised by very low concentrations of 25(OH)D, whereas extraskeletal diseases have been associated with more modest vitamin D insufficiency. Rickets and osteomalacia caused by vitamin D deficiency are considered unlikely at concentrations higher than 25 nmol/L or 30 nmol/L, and the US National Academy of Medicine (formerly called the Institute of Medicine) recommends 25(OH)D concentrations of higher than 50 nmol/L for optimum bone health. The US Endocrine Society recommends a concentration of higher than 75 nmol/L to reduce the risk of various non-communicable and infectious diseases.

### Vitamin D pathway-related gene polymorphisms and their association with metabolic diseases: a literature review [^111kDmuH]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin and a secosteroid prohormone that plays a crucial role in bone mineralization through the absorption and regulation of calcium and phosphate levels. The vitamin D endocrine system regulates calcium homoeostasis and a range of physiological functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, immune function, inflammation, and apoptosis. A broad spectrum of diseases has been related to vitamin D deficiency and research, to date, suggests that vitamin D deficiency is a marker of ill health with effective connection to all-cause mortality, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular risk, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, and some types of cancer. However, causality is yet to be proven for any disease that is associated with vitamin D deficiency.

Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) is the natural form of vitamin D and the body can synthesise it in the skin in response to the sunlight exposure. Ultraviolet-B (UVB) (290–315 nm wavelength) skin irradiation initiates the photochemical conversion of 7DHC (provitamin D 3) to previtamin D 3 by breaking the 9,10 carbon-carbon bond, which is then quickly thermally isomerized to vitamin D 3. Diet is another source of vitamin D 3, which can be obtained from animal foods such as oily fish, egg yolk, liver, butter, fortified milk and cheese. Vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) originates from conversion of a plant sterol, ergosterol, and is solely obtained from the diet which includes plant-sourced foods such as yeast and mushrooms. Vitamin D 3 has a superior bioavailability than vitamin D 2; nonetheless, they both go through the same metabolic pathway to produce the active hormonal forms. Vitamin D is biologically inert and has to undergo hydroxylation twice before it can perform its physiological functions. Vitamin D binding protein (DBP/GC) is the key transport protein, which binds over 85% of the circulating 25(OH)D and vitamin D metabolites, and it transports these metabolites to target cells. In the liver, vitamin D (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol) is converted by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) into 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol, which is the primary circulating form of vitamin D. Subsequently, the kidney, acting as an endocrine gland, converts 25(OH)D by the action of the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase (CYB27B1) to the active hormonal form 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2 D], also known as calcitriol, which then binds to VDR and regulates calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism (Fig. 1). The VDR, a member of the nuclear receptor family, is a receptor specific to vitamin D through which vitamin D exerts its function, and it has been discovered in a multitude of cell membranes of tissues that have no musculoskeletal function; this implies the involvement of vitamin D in various extra-skeletal biological functions.

Sources of vitamin D and cutaneous synthesis — "Most circulating vitamin D is synthesized from skin exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation", and "Vitamin D synthesis by the skin is the main source of this prohormone for most people", with forms distinguished because "Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is plant derived, whereas vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by animals". Mechanistically, "7-Dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D) is a relatively rigid, 4-ringed structure" in epidermal membranes and "Exposure to UV-B in the wavelengths of 290 to 315 nm initiates the synthesis of vitamin D", after which "Previtamin D isomerizes to vitamin D and then is transferred to extracellular space and dermal capillaries, where it binds with vitamin D–binding protein (DBP)". The complex is "transported to the liver for 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)-D (calcidiol)", with subsequent renal steps whereby "25(OH)-D is released into the circulation and transported to the kidney bound to DBP for 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2-D and for 24-hydroxylation to 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [24,25(OH)2-D]", noting that "1,25(OH)2-D (calcitriol) is the active form of vitamin D" and that "Nuclear receptors for 1,25(OH)2-D are present in > 30 tissues".

### How deficient are vitamin D deficient critically ill patients? [^113KWZgD]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among critically ill patients and may be associated with adverse outcomes. Failure of conventional vitamin D supplementation in correcting deficiency has called for studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a high-dose regime in critically ill patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation that corrects a deficient state effectively and safely allows for intervention studies to be undertaken to determine the impact of vitamin D on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

### The role of baseline serum 25 (OH) D concentration for a potential personalized vitamin D supplementation [^116fcj12]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

This study aimed to investigate effects of vitamin D supplementation, by a three-armed trial over 20 weeks. The three intervention groups were: placebo, supplementation of 1600 IU/day vitamin D (which corresponds to 40 µg/day, as given in), and supplementation of 3.200 IU/day (in: 80 µg/day). The design of this study was therefore a purely between-groups design. The focus of this study was on the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on glucose metabolism. For this, 71 pre-diabetic individuals were recruited, above the age of 60, both male and female, exhibiting evidence of disturbed glucose homeostasis but no type 2 diabetes, and with a body mass index between 25 and 35. An additional inclusion criterion was a baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration of below 30.4 ng/ml (in as 75 nmol/L), measured from venous blood samples.

Unlike in the article where the vitamin D dosage are given in µg/day, we convert them here in IU/day so that they are presented consistently throughout this article (one µg/day corresponds to 40 IU/day). Moreover, unlike in the article where the concentrations are given in nmol/L, we convert them here in ng/ml so that they are presented consistently throughout this article, too (conversion of the nmol/L concentrations in to ng/ml concentrations dividing by 2.5).

### Vitamin D in head and neck cancer: a systematic review [^117Mnyk2]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recent GLOBOCAN report on cancer burden worldwide estimates that there is a steady increase in the incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC). Besides the well-known causative factors such as smoking, heavy drinking, and human papillomavirus behind this increase, several others have been suggested but remain inadequately investigated. More research is therefore needed to identify novel preventive and treatment measures.

Recent research has suggested a role for vitamin D in HNC. Ingested vitamin D undergoes two hydroxylation steps to become the active metabolite. Pre-vitamin D is also synthesized in the skin from dehydrocholesterol by UV radiation. Vitamin D is then converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25(OH)D), or calcifediol. This precursor of active vitamin D undergoes another hydroxylation step in the kidneys to become the active form of vitamin D, 1alpha-25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D), or calcitriol. Calcitriol is the hormonal form of vitamin D and functions systemically via the vitamin D receptor (VDR), present in various tissues and cells. Vitamin D has long been recognized as having an important role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and in maintaining bone health. Active vitamin D promotes calcium absorption from the digestive tract and reabsorption in the kidneys. Calcium is released from the bones through parathyroid hormone regulation. In recent decades, however, both VDRs and 1alpha-hydroxylase have been found in several other tissues beyond those traditionally associated with vitamin D metabolism, suggesting a more versatile role in whole body homeostasis.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes". It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention", and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined", considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### Questions about vitamin D for primary care practice: input from an NIH conference [^117Ji7U5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is considerable consumer and physician interest in vitamin D as a possible therapeutic agent for a range of clinical conditions and, despite mixed evidence, the interest does not appear to lessen. Some clinicians believe that consumption of vitamin D is inadequate and, in turn, advocate vitamin D supplementation to increase serum levels of the nutrient. However, evidence concerning the role of vitamin D in health and disease is conflicting, and primary care physicians have little time to sort through the data and may find it difficult to advise their patients. To better understand the challenges that primary care physicians face regarding vitamin D, and to help inform those who provide guidance for clinical decision-making, the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, with co-sponsorship from other federal health agencies, held a conference titled Vitamin D: Moving Toward Evidence-based Decision Making in Primary Care in December 2014. More than 20 invited presenters and panelists considered laboratory methods for measuring vitamin D status, discussed how clinical studies of vitamin D should be evaluated and used in developing recommendations, noted the role of values and preferences in clinical decision-making, debated the current science related to at-risk groups, and described emerging data about health risks of excessive intakes of vitamin D. Eight questions about vitamin D stem from the Conference presentations as well as other expert sources.

### The impact of vitamin D pathway genetic variation and circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D on cancer outcome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vgGNc]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Three aspects further strengthen the case for understanding the associations between vitamin D and cancer outcomes: first, cancer incidence and mortality are increasing; second, vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide among otherwise healthy individuals, and particularly among cancer patients, and third, vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor; based on the studies that report an association between vitamin D deficiency and poorer cancers outcomes. Unsurprisingly, it has been proposed that vitamin D may have potential value as an adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent, particularly since vitamin D supplements are cheap, safe and readily available.

Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the role of vitamin D on cancer progression and survival. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the literature that examines the associations between cancer outcomes and genetic factors involved in the vitamin D pathway, in addition to circulating 25OHD concentration. Focus on vitamin D-related genetic variation allowed us to partially mitigate against potential confounding or reverse causation, biases that typically limit implications of findings from observational vitamin D studies.

### Vitamin D-update for the pediatric rheumatologists [^1134S6vL]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Calcidiol (25(OH)D) is then transported through the bloodstream, bound to vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), to the proximal tubule of the kidney, where it is hydroxylated at the 1α-position to form the final biologically active form of D hormone named calcitriol (1α,25(OH)2D), by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). Activity of this enzyme is increased by parathyroid hormone (PTH) secreted by the parathyroid gland, which is the pivotal activator of CYP27B1 in proximal tubule cells and decreases with aging. Thereafter, the synthesized calcitriol becomes the real D hormone with full biological activity similar to other steroid hormones. The D hormone increases intestinal calcium absorption and mobilizes calcium from the skeleton while calcium level in blood regulates PTH secretion and CYP27B1 activity. These activities are clear examples of endocrine regulation due to D hormone production.

D hormone biological activity

For many years it was believed that regulation of calcium homeostasis within the body with a positive influence on bone turnover were the only crucial roles of this hormone. These roles were why it was considered to be a vitamin critical for bone health. This tenet remains correct, but it is now understood that all monocyte-macrophage derived cells, including those present in many tissues and various epithelia, are able to express 1α-hydroxylase and to synthesize calcitriol locally, if there is a availability of the 25(OH)D substrate. Synthetized D hormone can act on cells and in the tissues in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and the synthesized D-hormone (calcitriol) serves as connection between extracellular stimuli and genomic response of the cells.

It is recognized that 1α,25(OH)2D has high affinity to bind vitamin D receptor (VDR) due to the presence of an OH group at the 1α position. The VDR gene shows its highest expression in tissues with high metabolic activity, such as kidneys, bone and gut, but has low to moderate expression in nearly all other human tissues. VDR, when bound to hormone, heterodimerizes with the retinoic acid-X-receptor (RXR) and this complex binds to the vitamin D responsive element (VDRE) acting as a transcriptional factor to enhance or repress gene transcription.

### Vitamin D and the skin [^1148z7Qv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin D was originally discovered as a factor that regulates calcium and bone metabolism. Recent advances in investigation have shown that vitamin D also functions as a regulator of cellular growth and differentiation in various tissues. The skin is not an exception from such effects of vitamin D; it is regarded as a site of its activation and action. Evidence has accumulated showing that the active form of vitamin D and its analogs suppress growth and stimulate the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. In psoriatic lesions, epidermal keratinocytes exhibit hyper-proliferation and impaired differentiation triggered by inflammation. Therefore, it is quite reasonable that vitamin D is effective on psoriasis. Indeed, within the past decade, analogs of vitamin D3 have been used as topical therapy for psoriasis. In this review, we summarize the fundamental features of vitamin D and the development of vitamin D therapy for psoriasis. Clinical application to other skin diseases and the future of vitamin D therapy in dermatology are also discussed.

### Targeted metabolomics profiling in pregnancy associated with vitamin D deficiency [^117Bcb1o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which mainly exists in the human body in two forms, vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 accounts for 90 − 95% of the total vitamin D. Vitamin D is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver and kidneys, and then participate in biological processes in vivo. The role of vitamin D is mainly reflected in the following aspects: promote the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines, maintain bone health; enhance muscle strength and improve muscle endurance; promote immune function and reduce the risk of infection; reduce the risk of diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Vitamin D is speculated to play a role in female reproductive function, since many reproductive organs such as uterus, ovary and placenta express vitamin D receptors. Besides, vitamin D is an immunomodulator, which help to promote immune tolerance pregnancy. Therefore, vitamin D may have an effect on reproductive function and maternal outcomes. Various studies have evaluated the relationship between vitamin D and human fertility. To evaluate the role of vitamin D intake and serum levels on conception of clinical pregnancy and live birth. The researchers prospectively assessed their vitamin D intake and supplements through surveys conducted at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 months. The results showed that couples who continued the use of recommended daily intake had a higher chance of getting pregnant. Those women with adequate levels of 25(OH)D have a higher pregnancy rate. Multiple studies have shown that infertile women with higher levels of 25(OH)D in plasma and/or follicular fluid are more likely to become pregnant after reproductive assistance procedures such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Other studies have no conclusive results. As for egg donation therapy, donor women with 25(OH)D levels below 20ng/mL have a lower pregnancy rate than donor women with 25(OH)D levels above 30ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency is common in pregnancy, however, its effects has not been fully elucidated. Some animal experiments show that impaired fertility and decreased ovarian function are associated with vitamin D deficiency. But, the studies investigating vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women are still lacking.

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^115w2Hgj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The known unknowns

The optimum range for vitamin D and what level to aim for?

In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report based on examination of data by a group of experts. They estimated that a vitamin D level of 50 nmol/L or higher was adequate for good bone health, and a level < 50 was considered a vitamin D deficiency.

In 2011, the Endocrine Society issued a report urging a much higher minimum blood level of vitamin D. The society's clinical practice guideline was developed by experts in the field assigned to a Vitamin D Task Force, and based on all the evidence they recommended a minimum vitamin D level of 75 nmol/L and, because of the vagaries of some of the assays, levels between 100 and 150 nmol/L to guarantee sufficiency for both children and adults. These reference ranges are determined by levels of vitamin D that achieve maximal parathyroid hormone suppression. However, this method for identifying the optimal level of vitamin D remains controversial; the relationship between serum 25 hydroxy-D and parathyroid hormone is inconsistent, and no clear threshold defining "sufficiency" has been established.

These recommendations from the Endocrine Society pertain to patients at risk of complications related to vitamin D deficiency, while those from the IOM on the other hand relate to healthy individuals.

Interestingly, although low levels of vitamin D have been associated with higher mortality and poor health outcomes, high levels may not be beneficial and could even be harmful. The first reports of a U-shaped or reverse J-shaped relationship were for prostate cancer. Subsequently, this has been shown in other groups including with all-cause mortality.

Importantly, based on level of risk there is unlikely to be one single optimum level. For patients at high risk of poor bone health or colorectal cancer, accepting the potential risks of higher 25 hydroxy-D levels may be warranted to gain maximum possible benefits. In addition to variation in the optimum level between individuals, the optimum level for different cellular functions and target actions within the same individual may be different; for example the bone health target may differ from that required for immune function.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### Report on the vitamin D status of adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease and its significance for bone health and disease [^1139C7Kv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a hormone responsible for calcium homeostasis and essential for bone mineralization throughout the lifespan. Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among healthy adults and children, especially in the northern hemisphere, and a link between this condition and suboptimal bone health. Moreover, maintenance of what are today considered optimal vitamin D stores has not been achieved throughout the year with currently recommended daily intake for vitamin D. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is even higher among adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a situation that may be caused by malabsorption and gastrointestinal losses through an inflamed intestine, among other factors. In children with IBD, existing reports of vitamin D status are scarce. The relationship between vitamin D status and bone health, although well-established in healthy adults and children, has been controversial among adults and children with IBD, and the reasons for this have not been investigated to date. Studies in animal models of colitis and in vitro human studies support a role of vitamin D in the regulation of the immune system of the gut and the potential of vitamin D and its derivatives as therapeutic adjuncts in the treatment of IBD. This role of vitamin D has not been investigated with translational studies to date. Currently, there are no guidelines for monitoring vitamin D status, treating hypovitaminosis D, and maintaining optimal vitamin D stores in patients with IBD. These tasks may prove particularly difficult because of malabsorption and gastrointestinal losses that are associated with IBD.

Before the event, participants reviewed available studies on their assigned topic, drafted a related abstract, and presented their findings at the time of the conference. Relevant literature that became available since was also discussed within the panel and updated accordingly.

Consensus

Before the event, the drafted abstracts had been merged to prepare a preliminary document. After the conference presentations, in-depth discussions in open sessions led to consensus. The document was subsequently modified according to discussions and up-to-date literature inclusion.

Conclusions

There is quite consistent evidence for an association between low 25 OH vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and poor COVID-19 outcomes, despite heterogeneous publications of variable quality. However, the low vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients might also reflect reverse causality. Vitamin D supplementation might have a positive role in COVID-19 prevention. The evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 complications is conflicting. Conclusive statements regarding the beneficial effect of vitamin D in this context await high-quality, randomized controlled trials.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^114hqviD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11535HZz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — screening and thresholds state that the Society no longer endorses the target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and no longer endorses specific 25(OH)D levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency; the panel did not find clinical trial evidence supporting distinct 25(OH)D thresholds tied to outcome-specific benefits. The guideline also suggests against routine 25(OH)D screening (in the absence of well-established indications), including in adults and children with obesity, in adults and children with dark complexions, and during pregnancy.

### Hypothesized pathways for the association of vitamin D status and insulin sensitivity with resting energy expenditure: a cross sectional mediation analysis in Australian adults of European ancestry [^112Qgohc]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The potential role of vitamin D in the regulation of body weight in humans has been reviewed, with animal and cellular models suggesting a role for the vitamin in energy balance. However, the precise mechanisms underpinning the influence of the vitamin on human energy expenditure are yet to be confirmed. The present analysis was based on the hypothesis that insulin sensitivity (IS)/insulin resistance (IR) may mediate the association of vitamin D status (25OHD) on resting energy expenditure (REE). We observed a partial negative mediation of IS/IR on the positive relationship between higher vitamin D status and increased REE. The magnitude of this mediation indicated that any projected increases in REE following vitamin D supplementation, would be significantly dampened by concomitant improvements in IS or reductions in IR (Table 2).

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D) is the major active form of the vitamin, and exerts its effects via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Global VDR null mice, when compared to wild type mice, displayed a lower body weight even on a high fat diet. This arose from a greater energy expenditure and an upregulation of uncoupling proteins (UCP) in adipose tissue. Another pathway for increased energy expenditure in VDR null mice could involve the higher bile acid pool seen in these animals. Interestingly, targeted over expression of VDR in adipose tissue of mice, led to a higher body weight and specifically greater fat mass. There was no change in food intake in these animals, but energy expenditure was reduced, partly from a suppression of UCP. Further, cellular models of research indicate that treatment with 1,25(OH) 2 D suppressed UCP expression in primary cultures of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Extrapolating outcomes from animal models to humans is not straightforward, and the discrepancies are not easily understood. Currently, human studies that have addressed this area are few in number, and present their own issues. For example, a cross sectional study from Iran reported that 25OHD was positively related to REE/kg body weight. Besides the manner of expression of REE, those authors further adjusted REE/kg weight for fat free mass and other covariates, which makes interpretation difficult. Another cross sectional study from the same country, where ~80% of the participants had 25OHD < 30 nmol/L, reported no relationship between 25OHD and REE adjusted for several covariates including a measure of IR. There are three supplementation studies to date in the literature. A 1-week intervention found no effect on energy metabolism or substrate utilization, following vitamin D supplementation. A longer 6-month trial was conducted on individuals with vitamin D deficiency and type 2 diabetes, where the supplementation followed a bolus dose regimen. The vitamin D supplemented group showed a small but significant decrease in absolute REE, but that data was not adjusted for any change in body composition over the trial period. In addition, the authors reported that insulin sensitivity, as measured by the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique, was not different. An acknowledged limitation of that study was a steady decrease in 25OHD over time. By trial completion at 6 months, the final status had a mean (SD) of 54 (9.2) nmol/l. There is a growing view that a threshold level of 25OHD > 75 nmol/L, is required for non-skeletal effects of the vitamin. Vitamin D replete individuals (baseline 94 nmol/L) assigned to a treatment group, increased their 25OHD by ~30 nmol/L but showed no difference in their raised REE compared to the placebo group (baseline ~74 nmol/L) who showed a decline in their status. Indirect evidence in humans comes from the close relationship of mitochondrial oxygen affinity with REE, and that mitochondrial oxidative function of skeletal muscle improved with vitamin D supplementation. Overall, consistent direct human evidence in support or against the hypothesis is lacking, and so future research is required to test the paradigm generated here.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? a cross-sectional study [^116BS3aW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vitamin D plays a critical role in the prevention and management of osteoporosis. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the most effective vitamin D supplementation strategies for maintaining optimal bone mineral density (BMD) levels in adults. This study sought to establish the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and total BMD in a substantial population sample.

Methods

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the 2011–2018 cycles, encompassing 11,375 adult participants, were analyzed. The primary variables of interest were serum 25(OH)D levels and BMD. A multivariable logistic regression model was utilized to account for relevant variables associated with these correlations.

Results

A U-shaped relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and BMD was observed. In males, a significant positive association was identified for 25(OH)D levels below 84.8 nmol/L (p < 0.0001), while levels above this threshold showed no significant correlation (p = 0.3377). In females, those with 25(OH)D levels below 31.4 nmol/L exhibited a significant positive association with BMD (p = 0.0010), but this association weakened and became marginally significant above this threshold (p = 0.0650).

Conclusions

For adult males, the optimal serum 25(OH)D level is 84.8 nmol/L, beyond which higher levels do not lead to increased BMD. A deficiency threshold for adult females should be above 31.4 nmol/L, as lower 25(OH)D levels are not conducive to BMD. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin D levels for bone health in both genders.

### Vitamin D and cancer-NCI… [^1167SsYH]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

What is vitamin D. Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble hormones and prohormones that help the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth. These nutrients also perform many other important functions in the body, including reducing inflammation and controlling cell growth, as well as influencing neuromuscular and immune function and glucose metabolism. People obtain vitamin D by making it naturally in sun-exposed skin and by consuming it in foods. The form that is made in skin is vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol. This form is also abundant in some foods, including fatty fish, fish liver oil, liver, and eggs. Another form, vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, is found in some plants and fungi. Vitamin D supplements may contain either form.

Both cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are converted in the body to calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D. It works by binding to the vitamin D receptor that is found in many tissues and cell types in the body. Most people get at least some vitamin D through sunlight exposure, but they also obtain it from their diet and from supplements. Most of the vitamin D that people obtain from their diet comes from foods fortified with vitamin D, such as milk, juices, and breakfast cereals, and by eating the few foods that are rich in it.
- For those between 1 and 70 years of age, including women who are pregnant or lactating, the recommended dietary allowance is 15 micrograms per day. Because 1 μg is equivalent to 40 International Units, this RDA can also be expressed as 600 IU per day.

In experimental studies of cancer cells and of tumors in rodents, vitamin D has been found to have several biological activities that might slow or prevent the development of cancer, including promoting cellular differentiation, decreasing cancer cell growth, stimulating cell death, reducing tumor blood vessel formation, and decreasing tumor progression and metastasis. Vitamin D was also found to suppress a type of immune cell that normally prevents the immune system from responding strongly to cancer.

### La vitamina D y el Cáncer-national cancer institute… [^116TnvRS]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

¿Qué es la vitamina D. La vitamina D consta de hormonas solubles en grasas y prohormonas que nos ayudan a usar el calcio y el fósforo para tener huesos y dientes fuertes. Estos nutrientes también cumplen muchas otras funciones importantes en el cuerpo. Por ejemplo, reducen la inflamación, controlan el crecimiento celular e influyen en el funcionamiento inmunitario y neuromuscular, así como en el metabolismo de la glucosa. Las personas obtienen vitamina D en forma natural cuando exponen la piel al sol y consumen alimentos. En la piel, se produce en forma de vitamina D3, que también se llama colecalciferol. Esta forma también abunda en algunos alimentos, como el pescado azul, el aceite de hígado de pescado, el hígado y los huevos. La vitamina D2, que también se llama ergocalciferol, es otra forma presente en algunas plantas y hongos.

Los suplementos de vitamina D contienen alguna de estas formas. La mayoría de las personas obtienen al menos algo de vitamina D por la exposición a la luz solar, pero también la consiguen de la alimentación y los suplementos. La mayor parte de la vitamina D que las personas consumen proviene de alimentos enriquecidos con vitamina D, como la leche, los jugos y los cereales para el desayuno, y de los pocos alimentos ricos en esta vitamina. En los estudios experimentales de células cancerosas y de tumores en roedores, se descubrió que varias actividades biológicas de la vitamina D podrían demorar o prevenir la formación del cáncer, incluso promover la diferenciación celular, disminuir la multiplicación de las células cancerosas, estimular la muerte celular, reducir la formación de vasos sanguíneos tumorales, y demorar la progresión del tumor y la metástasis. Riesgo de cáncer.

En los estudios observacionales se examinaron distintas ubicaciones de cáncer en el cuerpo para buscar posibles asociaciones al riesgo según la concentración de vitamina D. Las concentraciones más altas de vitamina D se asociaron en forma sistemática con una disminución del riesgo de cáncer colorrectal y, en menor medida, del cáncer de vejiga.

### Vitamin D and breastfeeding… [^112sVwNY]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Vitamin D supports healthy bone development. It helps prevent rickets, a condition that causes weak or deformed bones. Learn more about vitamin D considerations for breastfed infants. Do infants get enough vitamin D from breast milk. No. Breast milk alone does not provide infants with enough vitamin D. Shortly after birth, most breastfed infants will need an additional source of vitamin D through a supplement. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that breastfed and partially breastfed infants receive 400 International Units of vitamin D daily beginning in the first few days of life. Families who do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should discuss the risks and benefits of maternal high-dose supplements with a health care provider. Why are breastfed infants at risk for vitamin D deficiency.

The risk for vitamin D deficiency increases when there is limited exposure to sunlight or when an infant is not consuming an adequate amount of vitamin D. Other factors that decrease the amount of vitamin D a person can make from sunlight include:

- Living at high latitudes, particularly during winter.
- High levels of air pollution.
- Dense cloud covering.
- The degree to which clothing covers the skin.
- Use of sunscreen.
- Darker skin types. Because adequate sunshine exposure varies and sunshine exposure may increase the risk of skin cancer, vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants.

### Pharmacologic therapy for vitamin D deficiency… [^113fT4tP]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best treatment regimen for vitamin D deficiency. Evidence-Based Answer Cholecalciferol for optimal musculoskeletal and metabolic health. 1 However, a report from the Institute of Medicine states that a level greater than 20 ng per mL is sufficient. 2 Exposure to sunlight corrects some deficiencies, but adequate dosing depends on latitude, skin pigmentation, and age.

1. 4 At 30 days, vitamin D levels in the cholecalciferol group increased by
47. 8 ± 7. 3 ng per mL compared with
17. 34 ± 4. 78 ng per mL in the ergocalciferol group.

ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION In the same RCT of 32 vitamin D–deficient participants who received 300, 000 IU of cholecalciferol, oral administration increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels by 47. 8 ±
7. 3 ng per mL compared with 15. 9 ±
11. 3 ng per mL with intramuscular cholecalciferol administration are needed to reach and maintain serum levels greater than 30 ng per mL. A second RCT of 338 older adults receiving cumulative doses equivalent to 600 IU of cholecalciferol per day for more than four months found that mean serum vitamin D levels were greatest with daily dosing compared with weekly and monthly dosing.
