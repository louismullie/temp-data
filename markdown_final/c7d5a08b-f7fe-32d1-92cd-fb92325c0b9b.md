## Question

Management of skull fracture without cerebral hemorrhage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of skull fracture without cerebral hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities and imaging strategy. Next, I will examine adult versus pediatric pathways, including disposition and observation. After that, I need to check special fracture types and complications that change management. Finally, I will integrate follow-up, safety netting, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and risk stratification. Skull fracture without cerebral hemorrhage typically refers to an isolated, linear, non-depressed skull fracture with no intracranial bleeding on CT, which carries a very low risk of neurosurgical intervention or deterioration, especially in children, whereas depressed, open, or basilar skull fractures carry higher risks and different management implications [^113h7HXB] [^115FHjfp] [^114h5iew].

> I need to ensure the initial assessment is structured around airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status, with particular attention to GCS, pupillary findings, focal deficits, and signs of basilar skull fracture such as Battle's sign, raccoon eyes, hemotympanum, or CSF otorrhea/rhinorrhea, because these findings shift risk and imaging decisions substantially [^115eX78j] [^116k3yeX].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy. Wait, let me verify the role of skull radiographs. Contemporary practice favors head CT as first-line for suspected intracranial injury or when risk factors are present, and skull radiographs are generally discouraged because they miss intracranial pathology and do not change management when CT is available, particularly in children [^111cQVFm] [^111y2i5w]. For adults, validated decision rules such as the Canadian CT Head Rule guide when CT is indicated based on high- and medium-risk features, and S100B can be considered in select low-risk scenarios to avoid unnecessary CT [^115eX78j] [^116k3yeX].

> For pediatric patients, I should confirm that PECARN-based risk stratification is applied. Children with GCS 15, no palpable skull fracture, and no signs of basilar skull fracture may be observed for 4–6 hours and discharged without imaging if they remain asymptomatic, whereas those with concerning features should undergo CT and consideration of admission or extended observation [^114pE8Ui] [^116mPmF3]. Hold on, I should verify the disposition data: multiple pediatric series show that neurologically intact children with isolated linear skull fractures can be safely discharged after brief ED observation, with extremely low rates of deterioration and no need for routine repeat imaging or neurosurgical intervention [^115FHjfp] [^111rjv3M] [^112JgnEe].

> For adults, I should double-check disposition thresholds. Adults with isolated linear skull fractures, GCS 15, no anticoagulation, and no concerning features can generally be discharged with reliable follow-up, whereas those with GCS 13–14, anticoagulation, suspected basilar or depressed fracture, or other high-risk features warrant CT and at least 24 hours of observation, with repeat CT if neurologic status deteriorates [^116k3yeX] [^112sQ8k2]. But wait, what if the patient is on antiplatelet therapy? The Scandinavian guidance notes that while antiplatelet use increases risk, its predictive value is modest and routine CT for all such patients is not recommended; individualized decisions are prudent, especially if other risk factors coexist [^116k3yeX].

> I will now examine special fracture types that change management. Depressed skull fractures, particularly open/compound, generally require surgical elevation if depression exceeds the thickness of the adjacent skull, with early debridement and antibiotics to reduce infection risk; nonoperative management is reserved for carefully selected closed, non-contaminated cases without dural violation or cosmetic deformity [^114h5iew] [^113dWS6h]. Basilar skull fractures carry risks of CSF leak, meningitis, and cranial nerve injury; antibiotics are not indicated for CSF leak alone, and patients should be counseled on strict head elevation, avoidance of nose blowing, and close follow-up for persistent leak or recurrent meningitis, with ENT/neurosurgery involvement if leaks persist beyond about a week [^112v3raz] [^115kPKiA]. Hold on, I should verify vascular considerations: fractures crossing venous sinuses or involving the carotid canal increase risk of venous sinus thrombosis or carotid injury; CTV or CTA is indicated when clinical deterioration occurs or when the fracture pattern suggests sinus/carotid involvement, and management must balance bleeding risk against thrombosis risk on a case-by-case basis [^114TeJqn] [^115j5KAb] [^111oqQkJ].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific issues. Growing skull fractures are rare but important complications in young children with linear fractures; they present with progressive scalp bulging and neurologic deficits and require surgical repair, so caregivers should be educated to return for new swelling or developmental concerns [^113HY4es]. I should also confirm abuse considerations: in infants and young children, isolated linear fractures can occur with unintentional trauma, but complex, bilateral, or unexplained fractures should prompt evaluation for abusive head trauma with appropriate imaging and skeletal surveys per abuse protocols [^1148ky1y] [^112WzdTw].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting. Routine repeat CT is not indicated for isolated, non-depressed linear skull fractures without new symptoms; patients and families should receive clear return precautions for worsening headache, repeated vomiting, seizures, focal deficits, fever, clear nasal/ear discharge, or declining consciousness, with explicit instructions for 24–48 hour follow-up in children and timely access to care for adults [^115FHjfp] [^111rjv3M]. I need to ensure documentation includes mechanism, exam, imaging findings, disposition rationale, and follow-up plan, and that communication with the primary care provider is arranged.

> I should double-check the decision algorithm to keep it concise and safe. If the patient has a non-depressed, linear skull fracture without intracranial hemorrhage, is neurologically intact with GCS 15, has no anticoagulation or high-risk features, and has reliable follow-up, discharge with brief observation and clear return precautions is appropriate; if any high-risk feature is present or the patient is unreliable, obtain CT, observe for 24 hours, and escalate care if deterioration occurs; if the fracture is depressed, open, or basilar, involve neurosurgery early and tailor imaging to suspected complications such as sinus or vascular injury [^115FHjfp] [^116k3yeX] [^114h5iew] [^114TeJqn].

> Finally, I need to ensure the strength of evidence is transparent. The pediatric safety of ED discharge for isolated linear skull fractures is supported by systematic reviews and multiple series showing near-zero rates of neurosurgical intervention and deterioration, though much of the literature is observational and consensus-based; adult guidance relies on guideline synthesis and decision rules with moderate-quality evidence, and local protocols should reflect institutional resources and patient populations [^113h7HXB] [^115FHjfp] [^116k3yeX] [^115eX78j].

For skull fractures without cerebral hemorrhage, **most patients do not require neurosurgical intervention** [^113h7HXB] and can be managed conservatively with observation, analgesia, and discharge with clear return precautions if neurologically intact and reliable [^115FHjfp]. Hospitalization is indicated for **depressed, open, or basilar skull fractures**, neurologic symptoms, or high-risk features (e.g. anticoagulation, unreliable follow-up) [^116k3yeX] [^115eX78j]. Routine repeat CT is not needed unless clinical deterioration occurs [^112sQ8k2]. Educate caregivers on warning signs and arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks.

---

## Clinical assessment and initial management

- **Airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs)**: Ensure hemodynamic stability and adequate oxygenation [^111gtYwx].

- **Neurological examination**: Assess Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupillary response, and focal deficits [^111gtYwx].

- **History**: Document mechanism, loss of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, and anticoagulant use [^116k3yeX].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for the following scenarios:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Depressed, open, or basilar skull fractures | Higher risk of complications, including infection and CSF leak [^114h5iew] [^115kPKiA] |
| Neurological symptoms (e.g. seizures, focal deficits, altered consciousness) | Risk of delayed intracranial complications [^116k3yeX] |
| High-risk features (e.g. anticoagulation, unreliable follow-up) | Increased risk of bleeding and poor adherence to follow-up [^116k3yeX] [^112sQ8k2] |

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management includes:

- **Observation**: Monitor for neurological changes, headache, vomiting, or seizures [^116tCtjf].

- **Analgesia**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control.

- **Antiemetics**: For nausea or vomiting.

- **Patient education**: Provide clear return precautions and symptoms warranting immediate medical attention [^111rjv3M].

---

## Role of repeat imaging

Routine repeat CT is **not indicated** unless clinical deterioration occurs [^112sQ8k2]. Repeat imaging is warranted if neurological symptoms develop or if the patient is on anticoagulation therapy [^112sQ8k2].

---

## Follow-up care

Arrange follow-up within **1–2 weeks** to assess healing and screen for complications. Educate caregivers on warning signs — such as persistent headache, vomiting, seizures, or behavioral changes — and advise avoiding contact sports or activities with high risk of head injury until cleared by a physician.

---

## Potential complications

Although rare, **complications** can occur:

- **Growing skull fracture**: Particularly in children under 2 years old [^notfound].

- **CSF leak**: Associated with basilar skull fractures [^115kPKiA].

- **Infection**: Risk increases with open or depressed fractures [^113dWS6h].

- **Seizures**: More common with depressed fractures or dural penetration [^115ZW7rf].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric patients

Children with isolated, linear skull fractures and a normal neurological exam can often be discharged after a brief observation period (4–6 hours) if reliable follow-up is assured [^114pE8Ui] [^115FHjfp]. Hospitalization is indicated for **young infants, unreliable caregivers, or suspected non-accidental trauma** [^116tCtjf] [^1148ky1y].

---

## Summary of management algorithm

- **Stable, neurologically intact patients**: Discharge with clear return precautions and follow-up in 1–2 weeks [^115FHjfp].

- **High-risk features or neurological symptoms**: Hospitalize, observe, and manage conservatively unless deterioration occurs [^116k3yeX].

- **Depressed, open, or basilar fractures**: Neurosurgical consultation and inpatient management [^114h5iew].

---

Skull fractures without cerebral hemorrhage are **typically managed conservatively**, with hospitalization reserved for high-risk features or neurological symptoms. Routine repeat imaging is unnecessary unless clinical deterioration occurs, and follow-up should be arranged to monitor for complications.

Study Objective

Most studies of children with isolated skull fractures have been relatively small, and rare adverse outcomes may have been missed. Our aim is to quantify the frequency of short-term adverse outcomes of children with isolated skull fractures.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and gray literature were systematically searched to identify studies reporting on short-term adverse outcomes of children aged 18 years or younger with linear, nondisplaced, isolated skull fractures (ie, without traumatic intracranial injury on neuroimaging). Two investigators independently reviewed identified articles for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted relevant data. Our primary outcome was emergency neurosurgery or death. Secondary outcomes were hospitalization and new intracranial hemorrhage on repeated neuroimaging. Meta-analyses of pooled estimate of each outcome were conducted with random-effects models, and heterogeneity across studies was assessed.

Results

Of the 587 studies screened, the 21 that met our inclusion criteria included 6,646 children with isolated skull fractures. One child needed emergency neurosurgery and no children died (pooled estimate 0.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0% to 0.0%; I² = 0%). Of the 6,280 children with known emergency department disposition, 4,914 (83%; 95% CI 71% to 92%; I² = 99%) were hospitalized. Of the 569 children who underwent repeated neuroimaging, 6 had new evidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.0%; 95% CI 0.0% to 9.0%; I² = 77%); none required operative intervention.

Conclusion

Children with isolated skull fractures were at extremely low risk for emergency neurosurgery or death, but were frequently hospitalized. Clinically stable children with an isolated skull fracture may be considered for outpatient management in the absence of other clinical concerns.

Depressed skull fractures — operative versus nonoperative management: These injuries are "commonly surgically elevated if the depression is greater than the thickness of the adjacent skull, especially if located in a cosmetically important area like the forehead". "Open depressed skull fractures are usually treated surgically to prevent infection". However, "nonoperative management may be attempted in selected cases, limited to those without dural laceration, gross contamination, evidence of infection, or injury to the frontal sinus". "In most cases, depressed skull fractures over a dural venous sinus are not treated surgically because of the high risk for uncontrollable hemorrhage".

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^112sQ8k2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical question 2: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospital observation and/or a repeat head CT?'

(1) We suggest that all adult patients after head injury with GCS ≤ 13, clinical signs of depressed or basal skull fracture, anticoagulation therapy or coagulation disorder, post-traumatic seizure or focal neurological deficit should have a CT scan and be admitted to hospital for observation, irrespective of CT findings (low quality, weak recommendation).

The evidence was sparse and also of low quality due to study limitations (selection bias) and inconsistency in findings. The working group felt that it would not be good clinical practice to discharge patients with any of these risk factors, despite the low quality of evidence.

(2) We recommend that repeat CT scans should be performed in patients with neurological and/or GCS (≥ 2 points) deterioration (low quality, strong recommendation).

The evidence was of moderate quality and was downgraded due to serious limitations in study design and some inconsistency. Most of the evidence indicates that routine repeat CT of these patients with or without CT findings is unnecessary in the absence of clinical deterioration, specifically deterioration of GCS > 2 points and/or neurological status. A strong recommendation was chosen in spite of weak evidence due to the seriousness of the condition. Clinical aspects such as anticoagulation and persistent neurological findings were discussed but the working group could not reach consensus on a recommendation for follow-up scans in these patients.

### Impact of newly adopted guidelines for management of children with isolated skull fracture [^112emiyx]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

In an effort to standardize practices and reduce unnecessary hospital resource utilization, we implemented guidelines for management of patients with isolated skull fractures (ISF). We sought to examine the impact of these guidelines.

Methods

Patients with nondisplaced/depressed fracture of the skull vault without intracranial hemorrhage were prospectively enrolled from February 2010 to February 2014.

Results

Eighty-eight patients (median age = 10 months) were enrolled. Fall was the most common mechanism of injury (87%). The overall admission rate was 57%, representing an 18% decrease from that reported prior to guideline implementation (2003–2008; p = 0.001). Guideline criteria for admission included vomiting, abnormal neurologic exam, concern for abuse, and others. Forty-two percent of patients were admitted outside of the guideline, primarily because of young age (20%). Patients transferred from another hospital (36%) were more likely to be admitted, though the majority (63%) did not meet admission criteria. No ED-discharged patient returned for neurologic symptoms, and none reported significant ongoing symptoms on follow-up phone call.

Conclusions

Implementation of a new guideline for management of ISF resulted in a reduction of admissions without compromising patient safety. Young age remains a common concern for practitioners despite not being a criterion for admission. Interhospital transfer may be unnecessary in many cases.

### Changing paradigms in the management of 2184 patients with traumatic brain injury [^112oKWp1]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the change in trends in the management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at a level I trauma center and the utilization of resources as a result of this change in management.

Background

The management of TBI has been evolving with trends toward management of minimally injured patients with intracranial hemorrhage exclusively by trauma surgeons.

Methods

A 5-year (2009–2014) prospective database on all patients with TBI (skull fracture/intracranial hemorrhage on head computed tomography) presenting to a level I trauma center was analyzed for patient demographics, injuries, admission physiology, computed tomographic scan results, and hospital outcomes. These records were matched to the institutional registry and hospital financial database.

Results

A total of 2184 patients were included with median (interquartile range) Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 (12–15), and median (interquartile range) head-abbreviated injury scale score of 3 (2–4). The distribution of types and size of intracranial bleeds remained unchanged throughout the study period. The proportion of TBI managed exclusively by trauma surgeons increased significantly over the years from 6.8% to 40.1% (P < 0.001). Proportion of patients who received neurosurgical consultations (P < 0.001) and repeat head computed tomographic scans (P < 0.001), hospital length of stay (P = 0.028), and costs (P < 0.001) decreased significantly over time. The overall mortality rate (18.5%) and rate of intervention (14.1%) remained unchanged.

Conclusions

TBI patients can be selectively managed without initially involving neurosurgeons safely in a cost-effective manner, resulting in more effective use of precious resources.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^112YR239]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This recommendation may seem conflicting with recommendation 1, above. However, S100B is recommended as an option for reducing unnecessary CT scans in a subgroup of Mild head injury patients with low risk for intracranial complication and/or neurosurgical intervention.

(3) We recommend that adult patients after minimal and mild head injury with GCS 15 and without risk factors (loss of consciousness, repeated (≥ 2) vomiting, anticoagulation therapy or coagulation disorders, post-traumatic seizures, clinical signs of depressed or basal skull fracture, focal neurological deficits) can be discharged from the hospital without a CT scan (moderate quality, strong recommendation).

The evidence was initially of high quality but was downgraded due to limitations in study design (mostly selection bias), indirectness (outcomes were rarely reported) and impreciseness (different magnitudes of predictive power of risk factors between studies). The working group felt, however, that the large proportion of patients with head injury would fall into this category and that a CT policy in all these patients would not be health/economically viable considering the very low risk of intracranial injury, and even lower risk of neurosurgery, in this patient group. As previously discussed, older age and antiplatelet medication was again considered but rejected by the working group.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^112fVesZ]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Interfacility transfer — initial resuscitation in hospitals without neurosurgical care may be rationalized only with immediate transfer plans: Providing initial resuscitative care in hospitals without neurosurgical care may occasionally be rationalized in rural settings with long transport times; however, these hospitals need predefined air/ground transfer protocols and agreements in place to provide for the immediate transfer of patients to a center that has the continuous availability of resources and expertise to care for all aspects of TBI, and this is critical for patients with an abnormal neurological exam, displaced skull fracture, or significant intracranial injury such as a large subdural hematoma (SDH), epidural hematoma (EDH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).

### Diagnosis and treatment of fractured skulls… [^116UbfbR]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A newly awakened and much needed scientific interest in the study of fractured skulls and intracranial injuries is evidenced by the rapid increase in the literature on this subject in the past five years. It is clear to us that there are many imperfections in our knowledge of the basic pathologic and physiologic changes that are present in these cases, and only after these gaps in our knowledge have been filled shall we be able to interpret correctly many of the clinical phenomena observed daily in the wards. A much better understanding and correlation of fundamental facts are needed to put us on the right track. Each writer has his own classification, which varies with his concepts, and this results in much confusion and controversy and renders comparative work difficult, because one is never quite sure that one author is writing about exactly the same thing that another author has.

### A pediatric brain injury guideline allows safe management of traumatic brain injuries by trauma surgeons [^116QXGFz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We implemented a pediatric Brain Injury Guideline (pBIG) to stratify traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and allow management of less severe cases without repeat CT imaging or neurosurgical consultation. Injuries were classified as mild (pBIG1), moderate (pBIG2), severe (pBIG3) or isolated skull fracture (ISF) based on neurologic status, size and number of bleeds. We hypothesize that pediatric TBIs can be safely managed with this guideline.

Methods

Isolated TBIs (< 18 years) were queried from the Pediatric Trauma Registry after pBIG implementation from July 2021-March 2023. Datasets included age, injury specifics, repeat head CTs, neurosurgical consultations and interventions. Analysis was performed with Stata, with significance set at p < 0.05.

Results

A total of 139 children with a median age of 2.8 years were included. Skull fractures (113, 81%) and subdural hematomas (54, 39%) were the most common injuries. Repeat head CTs were obtained in 44 (32%) and neurosurgical consultation in 89 (64%). Overall guideline compliance was 83.5%, with best performance in the pBIG3 category (96%). One pBIG1 patient had increasing symptoms requiring upgrade, neurosurgical consultation and repeat head CT, but no intervention. Five children (3.6%; 4 isolated skull fracture, 1 pBIG3) had post-discharge ED visits and 1 (0.7%, ISF) had a post-discharge CT. Three (2.2%) children, all in the pBIG3 group, died from their TBIs.

Conclusions

Adherence to the algorithm was 83.5%, with the lowest compliance in the moderate TBI (pBIG2) category. This group had a high rate of neurosurgical consultation suggesting uneasiness with independent management of moderate injuries when compared to minor TBIs or isolated skull fracture. Outcomes with the use of the pBIG algorithm were otherwise acceptable.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^116k3yeX]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical question 1: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CT and which patients may be directly discharged?'

(1) We recommend that adult patients after mild and moderate head injury with GCS ≤ 14, loss of consciousness, repeated (≥ 2) vomiting, anticoagulant therapy or coagulation disorders, clinical signs of depressed or basal skull fracture, post-traumatic seizures or focal neurological deficits should have a CT scan (moderate quality, strong recommendation).

The evidence was initially of high quality but was downgraded due to limitations in study design (mostly selection bias), indirectness (outcomes were rarely reported) and impreciseness (different magnitudes of predictive power of risk factors between studies). However, the strength of the recommendation was view as strong by the working group, considering the seriousness of the complication and health/economic impact of missing a patient with a neurosurgical lesion. The working group also discussed older age (≥ 60 years and ≥ 65 years) as well as antiplatelet medication as risk factors of importance, partly due to the presence of these criteria in other guidelines and decision rules. However, the predictive ability was only moderate and these individual risk factors would lead to an unacceptable CT increase and so consensus was not to include these in our recommendation.

(2) We recommend that adult patients after mild head injury with GCS 14 and no risk factors (anticoagulant therapy or coagulation disorders, post-traumatic seizures, clinical signs of depressed or basal skull fracture, focal neurological deficits), or GCS 15 with loss of consciousness or repeated (≥ 2) vomiting and no other risk factors, be sampled for analysis of S100B if less than 6 h have elapsed following trauma. If S100B is less than 0.10 μg/l, the patient may be discharged without a CT (moderate quality, strong recommendation).

The evidence was initially of high quality but was downgraded due to study design (mostly selection bias) and indirectness (outcomes were rarely reported). However, studies consistently show that low S100B levels can be used to select patients who do not need a CT scan and, hence, may save valuable resources. Of the few missed patients in the literature, almost all are non-neurosurgical lesions. Some studies include risk factors such as GCS 13, anticoagulation and focal neurological deficits in the inclusion criteria. The working group, however, found these risk factors to be too predictive of intracranial injury.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^115JMyUx]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The evidence was initially of high quality, but downgraded due to limitations in study design (selection bias), indirectness (lack of description of outcome measures and follow-up) and inconsistency (large differences in prevalence of risk factors and likelihood ratios). There was no upgrading of the evidence level. The recommendation was perceived as strong when considering the relatively low prevalence of the predictive factors compared to the severe influence on patient outcome if the patients with ICI or a neurosurgical lesion were missed; (a), (b).

Suspicion or evidence of skull fracture was found to be a strong predictor for ICI, and especially high risk was found for evidence of depressed skull fractures and clinical signs of skull base fractures. A palpable fracture will automatically give a suspicion of depressed skull fracture. Linear skull fractures are generally not palpable, but might give rise to a scalp haematoma. The prevalence of linear fractures was relatively high and linear fractures are less predictive of intracranial injury compared to depressed or skull base fractures. The task force therefore chose to separate these according to their risks, such that patients with clinical evidence of depressed or skull base fractures are recommended for a CT and those with temporal scalp hematomas alone are recommended for observation, according to recommendation 5.
3 We recommend that children with (a) GCS score 14, (b) loss of consciousness for > 1 min after head trauma or (c) children with coagulation disorders or with anticoagulation therapy should be either admitted for in-hospital observation or have a head CT. (Evidence grade: very low, Recommendation: strong).

### Injuries from falling out of bed in infants under 1 year of age: a systematic review [^113MwArs]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Falls from beds are a leading cause of unintentional injuries in infants under 1 year of age. While most cases result in mild outcomes, the potential for severe injuries, such as skull fractures or intracranial haemorrhages, exists. Despite the prevalence of these incidents, no systematic review has focused specifically on injuries from bed falls in this specific age.

Objective

To evaluate the risk and severity of injuries caused by falls from beds in infants under 1 year of age through a systematic review.

Data Sources

We searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Lilacs Scielo for studies published between 1984 and December 2024.

Study Selection

We included observational studies that reported injuries from falls from beds in infants under 1 year.

Data Extraction

We extracted the relevant data from the included study details, recruitment setting, study design, sample size and outcome measures. We conducted a quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results

Out of 297 initially identified studies, three met inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 2034 infants under 1 year of age. Most falls resulted in minor or no injuries. Warrington et al reported < 1% of cases leading to concussion or fractures. Samuel et al identified two cases of intracranial haemorrhage and linear skull fractures without intervention. Kolulu et al observed significant injuries, including skull fractures and cerebral contusions, in 10.2% of infants.

Conclusions

Falls from beds are frequent in infants under 1 year, with most resulting in minor outcomes. However, serious injuries occur in around 5% of infants below 1-year old, emphasising the need for prevention strategies and clinical guidelines for managing post-fall assessments. Further research is required to refine understanding and improve prevention and management practices.

### Management of major vascular injury: open [^116AiKRq]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Major blood vessels are in proximity to other vital structures in the neck and base of skull. Infections and tumors of the head and neck can invade vascular structures. Vascular injuries can lead to massive hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, or stroke. Emergency and definitive management can be challenging.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^116tCtjf]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

During the consensus meeting, the length of in-hospital observation was discussed. The studies from the Q2 search mainly used an observation time of 12–24 hours, even after a normal head CT, but no evidence-based conclusions regarding the duration of in-hospital observation could be drawn from the studies. Consensus regarding a 24 h, 12 h and 6 h observation time, depending on the risk factors, was reached and added in the guidelines. There was a unanimous consensus that children with moderate head trauma and those in the mild, high-risk group, should be observed for at least 24 hours post trauma, regardless of a normal initial head CT, and that children with mild, medium-risk should be observed for at least 12 hours post trauma. The majority of children entering an ED after head injury will be in the mild, low-risk or minimal head trauma groups. After discussion among the working group and stakeholders, there was an agreement to lower the recommended observation time to at least 6 hours for the mild, low-risk group, taking into consideration the impact a longer observation time would have on the paediatric wards, as well as an increased economic impact.

There were divergent opinions regarding the early discharge of MHT patients with normal neurology if initial head CT is normal or without intracranial haemorrhage. The main concern was that this suggests early discharge for children who have had a posttraumatic seizure or have clinical signs of skull base fracture. Children presenting with posttraumatic seizures or skull base fractures are relatively rare, and are more often related to more severe head traumas. So far the evidence for early discharge of these children who also have a normal CT scan is still very weak. Some larger studies exclude patients with basilar skull base fractures, although there are some former studies suggesting discharge of these children from the ED. During the consensus discussion it was stated that according to good clinical practice, these children should not be discharged without proper in-hospital observation, as these clinical risk factors are relatively worrying, both to health care professionals and to patients/guardians. There was therefore a consensus that children with a mild, high-risk head trauma should be admitted for observation regardless of a normal head CT. The length of observation was kept to more than 24 h after the trauma, this still being a consensus decision in lack of better evidence.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^111zqkHb]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Decompressive craniectomy in severe traumatic brain injury — treatment of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation is central to management. The volume of the intracranial contents often increases after traumatic brain injury from hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and hydrocephalus, leading to herniation. An increase in volume within the rigid skull can increase ICP leading to a compartment syndrome which impedes or reverses the blood flow to the brain, and the ensuing cerebral ischemia can ultimately result in disability or death. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is the temporary removal of a large portion of skull used to treat ICP elevation; primary DC occurs when the bone flap is not replaced after an intracranial mass lesion is evacuated early after a head trauma, while secondary DC involves removal of the bone flap later in the patient's course to treat the elevation of ICP refractory to other treatments.

### The risk of deterioration in GCS13-15 patients with traumatic brain injury identified by computed tomography imaging: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115eYyvc]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA P protocol and is reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The review is registered with the PROSPERO prospective register of systematic reviews and (protocol is available at).

Inclusion criteria

Participants

Criteria were patients aged ≥ 12 years with an initial GCS of 13–15 with TBI identified by CT imaging. TBI included any traumatic extra-dural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, intra-cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, or skull fracture. Studies had to be conducted in the context of an emergency hospital attendance including a presentation to the ED or during admission to an inpatient ward.

Prognostic factors

Factors potentially affecting the risk for adverse outcomes were included in the analysis if they were patient factors present at admission including: demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, medication use, symptoms, other clinical features, or factors available from initial investigations.

Outcome measures

Primary outcomes were: death, neurosurgical intervention, or any other measure of clinical deterioration such that admission to a hospital was warranted. Secondary outcome was: progression of TBI on repeat CT imaging.

Types of study design

All studies, other than case studies, were included.

Search methods for study identification

Studies published before 1996 were excluded due to more liberal use of CT imaging to diagnose TBI after this date.

The following electronic databases were searched with results restricted to English language studies:

- **EMBASE (via OVID) searched 11/24/2016**: 1996 to 2016, week 47;
- **MEDLINE (R) (via OVID) searched 11/24/2016**: 1996 to November, week 3, 2016;
- **CINHAL plus (via EBSCO) searched 11/24/2016**: 1983 to 2016;
- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); The Cochrane Library,2016, all available dates. Accessed 11/24/2016.

The full search strategy is reported in Supplementary Table 1 (see online supplementary material at).

The reference and citation searches of several national guidelines, reports, and reviews included: NICE, SIGN, and Australian New South Wales (NSW) guidelines; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment of management strategies for minor head injury; the results of the World Health Organization (WHO) collaboration on prognosis in mild TBI; systematic reviews assessing prognostic factors in TBI; and systematic reviews assessing the utility of repeat CT imaging in minor head injury. All included studies' references and citations were searched.

### Routine neurosurgical consultation is not necessary in mild blunt traumatic brain injury [^116UFycP]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines provide indications for neurosurgical intervention in traumatic brain injury (TBI) with moderate or severe intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In TBI patients with less severe ICH, the utility of neurosurgical consultation remains unclear. We sought to determine if routine neurosurgical consultation is necessary for mild blunt TBI patients with ICH.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 500 consecutive blunt TBI patients aged 15 years or older with Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≥ 13 and ICH on initial head computed tomography admitted to a Level I trauma center over 28 months. Outcomes were neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy, craniectomy, ventriculostomy, or intracranial pressure monitor placement) and in-hospital mortality. Statistical significance was assessed at a p < 0.05.

Results

Of 500 patients, 49 (9.8%) underwent neurosurgical intervention. Neurosurgical intervention was more frequent in male patients (75.5% vs. 61.2%, p = 0.049), patients with higher head Abbreviated Injury Scale score (4.7 vs. 3.8, p < 0.0001), patients with an abnormal initial neurological examination (30.6% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.001), or patients with skull fracture (28.6% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.026) and was associated with higher mortality (8.2% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.010). Neurosurgical intervention was not associated with intoxication, preinjury antiplatelet/anticoagulation agents, or progression of ICH on second head computed tomography. Neurosurgical consultation was documented in 466 patients (93.2%). For patients without neurosurgical intervention, consultation did not change management.

Conclusion

Routine neurosurgical consultation for blunt TBI with ICH seems unnecessary, regardless of intoxication or preinjury antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. A more selective approach is warranted to decrease hospital charges and optimize use of neurosurgical consultation.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^114EJHyX]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation is central to the management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The volume of the intracranial contents often increases following TBI as a result of hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and hydrocephalus. This can lead to an injurious shift of the brain–termed herniation. Moreover, the increase in volume within the rigid skull can increase ICP leading to a compartment syndrome, which impedes or prevents the flow of blood to the brain. The ensuing cerebral ischemia can ultimately result in disability or death.

The temporary removal of a large portion of skull–termed decompressive craniectomy (DC)–has long been part of the neurosurgeon's armamentarium for treating ICP elevation resulting from TBI. Primary DC occurs when the bone flap is not replaced when an intracranial mass lesion is evacuated early after a head trauma. Secondary DC involves the removal of the bone flap later in the patient's course–typically to treat the elevation of ICP refractory to other treatments. Over the last century, the use of DC has been controversial. Technical aspects of the surgery, timing, and patient selection continue to be debated, and there has even been disagreement as to whether this procedure should be performed at all. There had been hope that the RESCUEicp (Trial of Decompressive Craniectomy for Traumatic Intracranial Hypertension) and DECRA (Decompressive Craniectomy in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) would provide definitive guidance as to if and how this technique should be employed. The results of these studies have defied simple interpretations, however; DC remains controversial despite the publication of these high-quality trials.

In the fourth edition of the Brain Trauma Foundation's Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury published in 2017, the lead chapter provided 2 level-IIA recommendations on the topic of DC. These recommendations served to update the first published clinical practice guidelines for DC provided in conjunction with the Brain Trauma Foundation's Guidelines for the Surgical Management of Traumatic Brain Injury published in 2006. Here, we present an update of the 2017 recommendations following the adjudication and consideration of the evidence provided by RESCUEicpas well as DECRA's recently published 12-mo outcome data. One of the previous recommendations was retained and 3 new level-IIA recommendations are now provided on this topic.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) management — urgent neurosurgical evaluation and transport/transfer criteria are specified: Neurosurgical evaluation must occur within 30 minutes of request for severe TBI (GCS < 9) with head CT evidence of intracranial trauma, moderate TBI (GCS 9–12) with head CT evidence of potential intracranial mass, or neurologic deficit due to potential spinal cord injury. Consider prehospital transport of patients meeting listed criteria to the most appropriate trauma center with neurosurgical capability when any of the following are present: GCS motor score < 6, skull deformity or suspected skull fracture, signs of basilar skull fracture, penetrating head injury, or caregiver-reported change from baseline behavior in an infant/child following injury. Consider transferring patients meeting listed criteria to a trauma center with neurotrauma expertise, where available, for significant intracranial injury (e.g., large SDH, EDH, IPH, IVH), displaced skull fracture, or suspected TBI (GCS score ≤ 15) with moderate to severe extracranial anatomic injuries and/or inability to monitor for neurological deterioration when intracranial injury is present or suspected.

### Clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of traumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [^111oqQkJ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is abnormal clotting in one or more cerebral veins or sinuses following trauma. Its clinical significance is uncertain. Management is challenging because patients are at increased risk for bleeding. Limited studies exist on traumatic CVST.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of trauma patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center between January 2014 and October 2023. Main objectives were to assess the following: (1) CVST prevalence, overall and according to head injury severity; (2) characteristics of trauma patients with CVST; and (3) management and outcomes of CVST patients.

Results

On admission, all CVST patients (n = 170) had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and an intracranial hemorrhage, and all except one had a skull fracture. Prevalence of CVST was 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8–1.0) in the overall trauma patient population (n = 18,569), 2.1% (95% CI, 1.9–2.5) in patients with TBI (n = 7,920), and 4.8% (95% CI, 4.0–5.8) in patients with severe TBI (modified head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, ≥ 4; n = 2,035). Twenty-eight patients with CVST died (16.5%), usually shortly after admission. The majority of patients (n = 100) with CVST were treated with standard venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylactic dose of anticoagulant while in hospital. During median follow-up of 3 months, none of the patients treated with standard VTE prophylactic dose of anticoagulant developed a symptomatic CVST-related adverse event (death, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage). One patient (1.0%) had asymptomatic CVST-related stroke, three patients (3.0%) developed asymptomatic CVST extension, and 3 patients (3.0%) developed a gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulant.

Conclusion

Traumatic CVST prevalence increases with head trauma severity and is unlikely to develop in the absence of skull fracture. Patients treated with standard VTE prophylactic doses of anticoagulants had favorable outcomes with minimal CVST-related complications during hospitalization. Longer-term data are needed to better evaluate traumatic CVST prognosis.

Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) — risk stratification, thresholds, and accuracy: Clinically important brain injury (CIBI) was defined as any acute intracranial finding revealed on CT that would normally require admission to the hospital and neurologic follow-up, and in neurologically intact patients, clinically unimportant lesions included solitary contusions less than 5 mm, localized subarachnoid blood less than 1 mm thick, smear subdural hematomas less than 4 mm thick, isolated pneumocephaly, or closed depressed skull fractures not through the inner table. A set of 7 questions stratified as high-risk and medium-risk factors was developed; the high-risk factors were 100% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 100%) and 68.7% specific (95% CI 67% to 70%) for predicting the need for neurologic intervention, which would have required only 32.2% of patients to undergo CT, while the medium-risk factors were 98.4% sensitive (95% CI 96% to 99%) and 49.6% specific (95% CI 48% to 51%) for predicting CIBI, which would have required only 54.3% of patients to undergo CT. The authors concluded that CT in minor head injury is indicated in patients with 1 of 5 high-risk factors, ie, failure to reach a GCS score of 15 within 2 hours of injury, suspected open skull fracture, a sign of basal skull fracture, vomiting more than once, or age greater than 64 years.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^111ZJj21]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The task force decided a priori to make an attempt to keep the guidelines applicable to the complete patient spectrum within EDs, that is, to ensure that all adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury can be managed according to the guidelines.

Certain assumptions were also made a priori concerning aspects of management that were deemed unnecessary for critical review. The task force all agreed that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be considered in these guidelines concerning initial management and that in-hospital observation, instead of CT, would be regarded only as a secondary management option. The use of plain skull films was addressed and rejected in the previous guidelines. Additionally, we chose not to consider later aspects of management, such as detection and treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) and chronic subdural hematomas. We also agreed that all pathological findings on head CT should lead to hospital admission. Finally, we would not address the surgical or medical management of intracranial complications.

The task force was unclear concerning the selection of patients for CT scanning or discharge, following minimal, mild and moderate head injuries. We were also unclear concerning which patients, irrespective of initial CT scan results, should have hospital admission for clinical observation, a repeat CT scan, or both. Therefore, consensus was achieved to address two important clinical questions that would require systematic review of evidence and would form the basis of the updated guidelines, shown below.

Clinical question 1: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CT and which patients may be directly discharged?'.

Clinical question 2: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospital observation and/or a repeat head CT?'.

Emergency assessment

Patients sometimes require emergency treatment, even after apparently minor injuries. The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines outline clinical red flags, providing guidance about when this is necessary (see box 2 for NICE guidelines regarding acute CT imaging after TBI). The acute hospital management of TBI has recently been reviewed in Practical Neurology and we will not discuss this further here.

### Clinical algorithm and resource use in the management of children with minor head trauma [^115D9Bqp]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

There are no clear guidelines for the management of minor head injury, including the use of skull x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the head. This is reflected in clinical practice by a wide variability in imaging study use and by the fact that some patients are discharged home from the emergency room (ER), whereas others are admitted to the hospital with or without a period of observation before admission. To address this issue, we proposed and applied a new protocol for minor head injury at our institution.

Methods

Between January 2004 and December 2005, 417 patients presented to the emergency department at our institution with minor head injury. All of them had fallen from less than 1 m. Every chart was retrospectively evaluated, and pertinent data were extracted.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 9.8 months (2 weeks to 32 months). One hundred fifty-three had a skull x-ray, and 13 had a CT scan of the head. Of the 153 patients who had a skull x-ray, only 15 had a skull fracture. Of these 15 patients, 3 also had a CT scan of the head that confirmed the diagnosis of skull fracture. Of the 13 CT scans that were done, only these 3 were positive. Eleven patients were kept in the ER for 6 hours for close observation, and 5 of these were eventually admitted. Overall, 8 patients were admitted to the hospital for observation. Of these 8 patients, 7 had a skull x-ray, from which 5 were positive. Only 2 of the admitted patients had a CT scan, and they were both positive for a skull fracture. One of the CT also demonstrated a subdural hematoma along with subarachnoid hemorrhage. These 2 patients also had a positive skull x-ray. None of the patients that were admitted had headaches or neurologic impairments. The mean age of the patients admitted was 3.8 months (2 weeks to 12 months). The mean hospital stay was 1.2 days (1–3 days).

Conclusion

Only 10% of the skull x-rays and CT scans were positive for a skull fracture, which led to an admission in half of these patients. The other half was mainly discharged from ER after being observed. Several patients underwent a skull x-ray that we feel was not necessary in the management of their minor head injury. For those who had a head CT scan, only one revealed additional information and none of them had an impact on the final management. Observation in the ER could have been reasonable for most cases.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — surgical management considerations: A significant number of children presenting with AHT require surgical intervention. In a 5-year review of children presenting to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, 58 of 213 children with AHT required surgical intervention. Unfortunately, no evidence-based guidelines exist to guide the selection of surgical strategies for the management of the patient with AHT. Skull fractures and epidural hemorrhage: Literature-based guidance regarding the management of depressed skull fractures and epidural hemorrhage is limited, and the Brain Trauma Foundation sponsored a "rigorous literature-based" review to provide recommendations for the surgical management of patients with post-traumatic intracranial mass lesions. Subdural hemorrhage: Fluid collections are common in the subdural space of children who have experienced AHT.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^113d48KG]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Definitions

Head trauma is defined as any physical hit or blow towards the head, which may or may not lead to an injury of the underlying brain. We consider a traumatic brain injury (TBI) to be a possible consequence of the traumatic event towards the head. The severity of head trauma was defined according to a modification of the HISS classification, similar to the definitions in the revised Scandinavian adult head injury guidelines. In this modified classification, moderate head trauma was defined as GCS scores of 9 to13 on admission, mild head trauma represented patients with an initial GCS score of 14 to 15, with or without neurological deficits, and minimal head trauma with GCS score of 15 and no other risk factors. Risk factors are considered to be any symptom or condition specified in the guidelines as a predictive factor of intracranial complication after the head trauma. Severe head trauma (GCS score ≤ 8) was not included in the guidelines, since these patients are managed using a different protocol and always receive both immediate head CT and in-hospital admission due to a high risk of intracranial injury. Neurological deficit was defined as any focal deficit or pathological finding in the clinical neurological examination, e.g. paresis of the extremities, cranial nerve affection, anisocoria, ataxia or aphasia.

The definition of children was predefined as any person below the age of 18 years. The search criteria included synonyms for "children" and were not limited by any specific age range.

"CT findings" were defined as any traumatic finding on head CT, including linear skull fractures. The CT findings group was added since it was not always possible to separate linear non-depressed skull fractures from the statistical data given in the study.

Intracranial injury (ICI) was pre-defined as any intracranial pathology on head CT, such as intracerebral haematomas, epidural and subdural haematomas, traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, pneumocephalus, depressed skull fracture and presence of skull base fracture, except isolated linear non-depressed skull fractures. Neurosurgical intervention was defined as any neurosurgical procedure for cranial or intracranial injury within the first week following trauma, but also included neurointensive care measures as not all ICIs are subjected to neurosurgery.

### Unnecessary scans lead to unnecessary Re-scans: evaluating clinical management of low and intermediate risk pediatric traumatic brain injuries [^114KVqiQ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) guidelines provide an algorithm to select patients with mild head trauma at highest risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) in whom computed tomography (CT) would facilitate management. Failure to follow PECARN criteria exposes children to unnecessary radiation and contributes to increasing hospital costs, length of stay, and parental anxiety. We sought to evaluate the subsequent allocation of resources to low and intermediate risk group patients who underwent an initial Head CT - which was not indicated by PECARN guidelines but which identified cranial or intracranial injury.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of children ≤ 16 years old with head injury (GCS ≥ 14) between 2016 and 2021. Children with neurological deficits, penetrating head trauma, anticoagulation, or non-accidental trauma were excluded. Demographics, imaging results, PECARN risk category, and need for neurosurgical intervention were collected.

Results

There were 70 low risk patients who had positive findings on CT, however none demonstrated clinically significant progression on repeat imaging that necessitated medical or surgical intervention. Of 319 intermediate risk patients with evidence of skull fracture or intracranial injury on CT, only one required intervention. The decision to intervene was made based on clinical changes and was not influenced by repeat imaging.

Discussion

Despite PECARN guidelines, cross-sectional imaging remains overused. Identification of small foci of clinically non-actionable intracranial bleeding in patients who do not meet initial PECARN criteria frequently prompts further cross-sectional imaging without benefit. This suggests that routine interval imaging may not be necessary in the neurologically stable child with low-risk injury.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^111cQVFm]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patient-important outcomes (neurosurgery, ICI and "CT findings") were rated according to GRADE methodology as having a "critical" or an "important" level of outcome importance. Both ICI and neurosurgical intervention were assigned a level of "critical patient-important outcome". The group "CT findings" was assigned a non-critical but still important level of outcome importance, thus weighted slightly less in the assessment of relevant risk factors and recommendations.

A priori assumptions and decisions

The task force decided that the initial head CT would be considered the method of choice for acute diagnosis of intracranial complications following head injury. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not considered to be useful in initial management, mainly due to the lack of availability, as well as current practical issues, of acute MRI in the Scandinavian countries in present clinical care. Although MRI is generally better at detecting intracranial injuries, the duration of MRI is much longer and requires full co-operation from the child. An acute MRI is less time consuming, but the quality is presently similar to a CT in detecting intracranial pathology, however, with a higher risk of missing a skull fracture.

The use of skull radiographs as an initial method of diagnosing skull fractures before considering a head CT or observation was discussed within the task force and working group but unanimously rejected to be included in the guidelines. Former studies have recommended skull radiography in otherwise asymptomatic infants with a head trauma and scalp haematoma in order to find a skull fracture. In these patients, a CT would be indicated, as the risk of intracranial injury is higher when a skull fracture is present. However, skull radiographs are no longer used in the Scandinavian countries as the primary radiologic investigation as they do not reflect intracranial injury with sufficient sensitivity or specificity. Also, recent data show that isolated skull fractures, in children who are otherwise neurologically intact following head trauma, have little impact on patient outcome.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^1161F6np]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence based on Q2 studies 8–12 was initially considered of high quality, but downgraded due to impreciseness and indirectness. All five studies included a total of 14,486 children with MHT, primarily GCS score 14 to 15, although two studies also included some with GCS score 9 to 13. Although not consequently specified, we could assume that none of the patients included in these studies had focal neurological deficits. We therefore conclude and suggest that patients with GCS scores of 14 to 15 and no neurological deficits and without any pathological findings on CT related to the trauma can be discharged. Three out of five studies included patients with a normal CT only, one study concluded that the finding of a skull base fracture on CT might imply a high risk of the child requiring a longer observation time (> 24 h) than provided in their observation unit and in the last study, although it included patients with basilar skull fractures, there were not enough data to draw conclusions about early discharge when there is no intracranial injury in the presence of a basilar skull fracture. This latter issue was discussed in the consensus part before finalisation of the guidelines (see Guidelines).

Abusive head trauma — key points for recognition include that on emergency department (ED) presentation, the history is frequently an unknown mechanism or one not consistent with the degree of observed injury. "Occult symptoms" of abusive head trauma (AHT) include unexplained emesis, macrocephaly, seizure, or loss of consciousness; recognize these as possible sequelae of AHT. Common radiographic findings in patients with AHT include subdural hematoma, hypoxic-ischemic changes, and cerebral edema. Skull fractures can result from either unintentional injury or AHT, and findings more consistent with an unintentional etiology include unilateral, linear skull fracture without associated intracranial injury.

### Big for small: validating brain injury guidelines in pediatric traumatic brain injury [^113pvNLD]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Brain injury guidelines (BIG) were developed to reduce overutilization of neurosurgical consultation (NC) as well as computed tomography (CT) imaging. Currently, BIG have been successfully applied to adult populations, but the value of implementing these guidelines among pediatric patients remains unassessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the established BIG (BIG-1 category) for managing pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) without NC (no-NC).

Methods

We prospectively implemented the BIG-1 category (normal neurologic examination, ICH ≤ 4 mm limited to one location, no skull fracture) to identify pediatric TBI patients (age, ≤ 21 years) that were to be managed no-NC. Propensity score matching was performed to match these no-NC patients to a similar cohort of patients managed with NC before the implementation of BIG in a 1:1 ratio for demographics, severity of injury, and type as well as size of ICH. Our primary outcome measure was need for neurosurgical intervention.

Results

A total of 405 pediatric TBI patients were enrolled, of which 160 (NC, 80; no-NC, 80) were propensity score matched. The mean age was 9.03 ± 7.47 years, 62.1% (n = 85) were male, the median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (13–15), and the median head Abbreviated Injury Scale score was 2 (2–3). A subanalysis based on stratifying patients by age groups showed a decreased in the use of repeat head CT (p = 0.02) in the no-NC group, with no difference in progression (p = 0.34) and the need for neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.9) compared with the NC group.

Conclusion

The BIG can be safely and effectively implemented in pediatric TBI patients. Reducing repeat head CT in pediatric patients has long-term sequelae. Likewise, adhering to the guidelines helps in reducing radiation exposure across all age groups.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^111YozTe]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are limitations to this study. The poor quality of the evidence is of major concern mainly due to selection as well as verification bias. Some studies excluded patients with LOC and others included patients with pre-specified symptoms only. The majority of studies excluded patients with bleeding disorders and penetrating injuries. Some older studies performed skull radiography on subsets of patients with suspected skull fractures. CT was only performed if the x-ray showed a fracture. The largest study in our material, by Kupperman et al with a primary endpoint of clinically important TBI, has naturally had a large impact on these guidelines as it includes more than 42,000 children and the study quality is exceptionally good. Since the commencement of the guideline process in 2013, there have been several subanalyses from the same PECARN cohort. These studies analyse the different symptoms (headache, presence of scalp haematoma, and vomiting) as possible predictive risk factor for ciTBI, and confirm the results of these guidelines. Isolated headache, isolated vomiting, and isolated LOC in children with MHT were considered to indicate a considerably lower risk of ciTBI, and the authors suggest that these children could be observed in the ED without an initial CT scan. These studies will be included for consideration in the next update of these guidelines.

Although the recommendations are based on evidence, there are elements based on consensus in the final guidelines. The invited stakeholders have the largest expertise and interest in paediatric head trauma in Scandinavia and were therefore essential to the consensus process. We chose not to perform a meta-analysis due to obvious heterogeneous data and the questionable value of the summarised values in these cases. We followed the GRADE methodology for guideline development as this also gave us the possibility of considering other aspects, such as health economic issues and the Scandinavian setting, other than the level of evidence. This methodology was judged as the most feasible considering the Scandinavian target population.

### Management of isolated skull fractures in pediatric patients: a systematic review [^115FHjfp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Isolated skull fractures (ISFs) in children are one of the most common emergency department injuries. Recent studies suggest these children may be safely discharged following ED evaluation with little risk of delayed neurological compromise. The aim of this study was to propose an evidence-based protocol for the management of ISF in children in an effort to reduce medically unnecessary hospital admissions.

Methods

Using PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases, a literature search using the search terms (pediatric OR child) AND skull fracture AND (isolated OR linear) was performed. Three hundred forty-three abstracts were identified and screened based on the inclusion criteria: (1) linear, nondepressed ISF; (2) no evidence of intracranial injury; (3) age 18 years or younger; and (4) data on patient outcomes and management. Data including age, Glasgow Coma Scale score on arrival, repeat imaging, admission rates, need for neurosurgical intervention, and patient outcome were collected. Two authors reviewed each study for data extraction and quality assessment.

Results

Fourteen articles met the eligibility criteria. Data including admission rates, outcomes, and necessity of neurosurgical intervention were analyzed. Admission rates ranged from 56.8% to 100%; however, only 8 of more than 5000 patients developed new imaging findings after admission, all of which were nonsurgical. Only 1 patient required neurosurgical intervention for a finding evident upon initial evaluation.

Conclusions

Pediatric ISF patients with a presenting Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 who are neurologically intact and tolerating feeds without concern for nonaccidental trauma or an unstable social environment can safely be discharged following ED evaluation to a responsible caregiver.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^1131Wi7k]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Following round 2, consensus was not reached for points 7, 8, and 9. The task force revised the recommendation for point 7 and it was made more specific in regard to which patients could be discharged after a normal head CT. Improvements of the written discharge information and observation schedule were also made according to earlier discussions at the consensus meeting (Additional file 8: Table S8).

A third Delphi round was therefore performed by e-mail in early spring 2015. Ratings were made for points 7–9 and consensus was reached for all three points (Additional file 9: Table S9).

The final evidence-based recommendations are presented below. For clinical question 1: "Which paediatric patients with head trauma need a head CT and which may be directly discharged?"
We recommend that all children with an ED admission GCS score 13 or below after head trauma should have a head CT scan. (Evidence grade: very low, Recommendation: strong).

The evidence was initially of moderate quality but downgraded due to limitations in study design (mainly selection bias towards a more severely injured patient group), indirectness and inconsistency (large differences between the prevalence of risk factors and likelihood ratios). The evidence level was upgraded due to a large effect of one of the studies for the important outcome of ICI. The strength of the recommendation was, however, by the task force perceived as strong, when considering the seriousness of the potential intracranial complication and the health economic impact of missing a patient with a neurosurgical lesion.
2 We recommend that children with (a) neurological deficit related to the trauma, (b) post traumatic seizure, or (c) clinical signs of skull base or depressed skull fracture should have a head CT scan. (Evidence grade: very low, Recommendation: strong).

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111ZLXnJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with mild head trauma will have no intracranial pathology and can be safely discharged home. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of these patients will have clinically significant findings on computed tomography imaging and up to 1% may require neurosurgical intervention. The revised Scandinavian Head Trauma Guidelines provide an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to assist physicians in determining which patients presenting with minimal, mild or moderate blunt head injury are at higher risk for intracranial pathology and thus require neuroimaging and hospital admission. Striking a balance between health care costs and risk of morbidity remains an ongoing challenge and we will present our concerns with this useful, but conservative management algorithm.

Posttraumatic seizures (PTS) — definitions and epidemiology indicate PTSs are early within 7 days of injury or late beyond 8 days of recovery, with risk factors including lesion location, cerebral contusions, retained bone and metal fragments, depressed skull fracture, focal neurologic deficits, loss of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) greater than 10, severity of injury, length of posttraumatic amnesia, subdural or epidural hematoma, penetrating injury, and age. Infants and children have lower seizure thresholds, and electrographic seizures detected by continuous electroencephalogram recording after severe TBI are higher in children than adults, occurring in up to 70% of cases.

### Small change, BIG impact: proposal of the brain injury guidelines for kids (kBIG) [^112camdh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The adult Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) stratify patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage into one of three risk categories and supports management of lower risk traumatic brain injury (TBI) with minimal resources. While the BIG have been widely adopted by adult trauma centers, application to pediatric populations remains unvalidated. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of BIG in a pediatric trauma population and develop adapted criteria based on injury patterns that may be unique to children with TBI.

Methods

BIG was applied to a retrospective cohort of pediatric TBI patients, defined as < 18 years old with skull fracture or intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan, from January 2018 to April 2024. Misclassification of BIG was defined as patients categorized as low- or moderate-risk who required neurosurgical intervention. Based on the performance of BIG, modifications were made to derive a pediatric-specific guideline, BIG for Kids (kBIG).

Results

1894 patients were analyzed. The misclassification rate of BIG 1 and 2 was 0% and 1.4%, respectively. We derived kBIG, with modifications to the categorization of minor skull fracture, epidural hematoma, neurologic exam and injury mechanism, which improved the misclassification rate of kBIG 2 to 0.8% and maintained a rate of 0% for all low-risk patients.

Conclusions

We propose BIG for Kids, a modified version of the adult BIG for the management of TBI in pediatric patients. The kBIG was conservatively designed to ensure safety and to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure and resource utilization.

### Management of skull fractures in children less than 1 year of age [^115S6C6p]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Management of skull fracture (SF) in pediatric patients varies from observation in the emergency department (ED) to floor admission. Since 2010, a protocol for admitting children with SF specifically to the trauma service was implemented at our institution. The purpose of our study was to review the management of children with SF younger than 1 year of age.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all patients between 0 and 1year of age seen in our ED for a SF was done from 2010 to 2013.

Results

A total of 180 patients with a mean age of 4.5months (1day-12months) were identified. Of these, 131 patients (73%) were admitted. Mean length of stay was 1.6days. Admitted patients had more depressed (21 vs. 8%) and diastatic (43 vs. 14%) fractures. Fifty-seven children had intracranial hemorrhages (32%) but only 8 patients required non-emergent surgery for depressed fractures. Admission to the trauma service increased from none to 76% with phone follow-ups increasing from 12% to 91%.

Conclusions

Instituting a protocol allowed a safer management of patients with SF. Moreover, we argue that asymptomatic infants with isolated SF can be safely discharged home after brief observation in the ED.

### Observation for isolated traumatic skull fractures in the pediatric population: unnecessary and costly [^111T1mR6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt head trauma accounts for a majority of pediatric trauma admissions. There is a growing subset of these patients with isolated skull fractures, but little evidence guiding their management. We hypothesized that inpatient neurological observation for pediatric patients with isolated skull fractures and normal neurological examinations is unnecessary and costly.

Methods

We performed a single center 10year retrospective review of all head traumas with isolated traumatic skull fractures and normal neurological examination. Exclusion criteria included: penetrating head trauma, depressed fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, skull base fracture, pneumocephalus, and poly-trauma. In each patient, we analyzed: age, fracture location, loss of consciousness, injury mechanism, Emergency Department (ED) disposition, need for repeat imaging, hospital costs, intracranial hemorrhage, and surgical intervention.

Results

Seventy-one patients presented to our ED with acute isolated skull fractures, 56% were male and 44% were female. Their ages ranged from 1week to 12.4years old. The minority (22.5%) of patients were discharged from the ED following evaluation, whereas 77.5% were admitted for neurological observation. None of the patients required neurosurgical intervention. Age was not associated with repeat imaging or inpatient observation (p = 0.7474, p = 0.9670). No patients underwent repeat head imaging during their index admission. Repeat imaging was obtained in three previously admitted patients who returned to the ED. Cost analysis revealed a significant difference in total hospital costs between the groups, with an average increase in charges of $4,291.50 for admitted patients (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Pediatric isolated skull fractures are low risk conditions with a low likelihood of complications. Further studies are necessary to change clinical practice, but our research indicates that these patients can be discharged safely from the ED without inpatient observation. This change in practice, additionally, would allow for huge health care dollar savings.

### Neuroimaging for neurovascular complications of traumatic brain injury [^1131R3wu]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Delayed intracranial hemorrhage is the most common clinical manifestation with an average time of presentation from trauma of approximately 21 days. Bleeding can occur in the subarachnoid space, intraparenchymal, intraventricular or subdural and have a reported mortality rate as high as 50%. A different, dangerous presentation is massive epistaxis, which occurs when the aneurysm ruptures into the sphenoid sinus.

A histological categorization of traumatic aneurysms includes false, true or mixed lesions. False aneurysms are the most common. They are characterized by the disruption of all three layers of the vessel wall, surrounded by a contained hematoma; the development of a false lumen creates the aneurysmal dilatation. True aneurysms are characterized by an intact adventitia with disruption of the intima and variable involvement of the internal elastic layer and of the tunica media. Mixed aneurysms start as true aneurysms but they then undergo rupture with a containing hematoma with false lumen formation. This classification has little clinical implication. Larson classified traumatic aneurysms in proximal (vertebrobasilar, infraclinoid carotid artery and supraclinoid carotid artery aneurysms) and distal to the circle of Willis (subcortical and cortical aneurysms), an anatomical classification that can reflect different mechanisms of aneurysm formation.

Infraclinoid and basilar aneurysms are commonly related to skull base fractures, while in the supraclinoid segment mechanisms include impact with anterior clinoid process or stretching of this relatively more mobile segment of the artery.

The formation of subcortical and cortical aneurysms can be related to the impact of the vessel against the relatively rigid dural reflections (falx cerebri and tentorium) and to depressed skull fractures.

Clinical presentation also varies with anatomical location, in particular infraclinoid carotid artery aneurysms can present with cranial nerve palsies, carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) or massive epistaxis. However, clinical management does not necessarily follow the current Guidelines for aneurysmal SAH (aSAH), despite blood pressure management and hemodynamic management to minimize bleeding are key factors in this context. The clinical management of traumatic SAH differs from the aSAH, as the pathophysiology, the risk of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia are different. For instance, blood pressure management and targets, prophylactic use of nimodipine are not well established in traumatic SAH.

### Risk factors for TBI and guidelines for requesting CT scan after pediatric head trauma… [^116mPmF3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

We filtered the radiological reports labeled as abnormal related to trauma in the database and extracted their results and conclusion. They reported the presence of fractures, classified as facial bones, skull vault, skull base, suture disjunction or upper cervical spine, their location, association with ICH, and the number of distinct fracture types. Radiologists reported the presence of pneumocephalus, subfalcine, temporal and central herniations, cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, and diffuse axonal lesions. age; GCS of 14 or less; clinical signs for basal skull fracture or depressed skull fracture or nonfrontal scalp hematoma; loss of consciousness; vomiting; severe trauma mechanism; significant cephalalgia; abnormal behavior according to parents; and clinical alterations. 4, 5, 8 After retrospectively applying the algorithms, they reported their conclusions categorized as recommended HCT, in-hospital follow-up, or discharge.

Skull vault fractures were mostly simple and linear, with a depressed skull fracture in 48 of 322 patients. The same-side and opposite-side ICHs were reported in 158 of 322 and 23 of 322 patients with skull vault fractures, respectively. The incidences of skull vault and skull base fractures slightly increased as GCS score decreased, with 190 of 3211 skull vault fractures and 66 of 3211 skull base fractures in patients with a GCS of 15 compared 40 of 432 skull vault fractures and 20 of 432 skull base fractures in patients with a GCS less than 15. In our series, the multivariable odds for ICH were
2. 54 in the presence of ECH, 9. 32 in the presence of cranial base fracture,
19. 2 in the presence of UCS fracture, and 35. 6 in the presence of cranial vault fracture.

Furthermore, presenting an ECH increased the risk of fracture by 32. Moreover, when neither ECH nor fracture was found on HCT, the odds for presenting ICH was divided by nearly 30.

### Reassessment: neuroimaging in the emergency patient presenting with seizure (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112tgnvS]. Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging in emergency seizure — definition of management-changing findings states that the criterion for a change in clinical management included the discovery of a new structural lesion or performing surgery based on the abnormal imaging findings; abnormalities counted as leading to a change in acute or urgent management included traumatic brain injury including depressed skull fracture, subdural hematomas, nontraumatic bleeding including from arteriovenous malformations and other types of cerebral hemorrhages, cerebrovascular accidents, tumors, brain abscesses, cysticercosis, obstructive hydrocephalus and shunt malfunction, Aicardi syndrome, Miller-Diecker syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and CNS toxoplasmosis. Since questions 1 to 4 are related to patient care, structural lesions that may have been unrelated to the seizure were not excluded, whereas potentially epileptogenic lesions such as hippocampal sclerosis or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors not leading to an acute or urgent change in management were not included.

### Mild traumatic brain injury [^113v85M6]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is among the most frequent neurological disorders. Of all TBIs 90% are considered mild with an annual incidence of 100–300/100.000. Intracranial complications of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) are infrequent (10%), requiring neurosurgical intervention in a minority of cases (1%), but potentially life-threatening (case fatality rate 0,1%). Hence, a true health management problem exists because of the need to exclude the small chance of a life threatening complication in large numbers of individual patients. The 2002 EFNS guidelines used a best evidence approach based on the literature until 2001 to guide initial management with respect to indications for CT, hospital admission, observation and follow up of MTBI patients. This updated EFNS guideline version for initial management inMTBI proposes a more selectively strategy for CT when major (dangerous mechanism, GCS < 15, 2 points deterioration on the GCS, clinical signs of (basal) skull fracture, vomiting, anticoagulation therapy, post traumatic seizure) or minor (age, loss of consciousness, persistent anterograde amnesia, focal deficit, skull contusion, deterioration on the GCS) risk factors are present based on published decision rules with a high level of evidence. In addition clinical decision rules for CT now exist for children as well. Since 2001 recommendations, although with a lower level of evidence, have been published for clinical in hospital observation to prevent and treat other potential threads to the patient including behavioral disturbances (amnesia, confusion and agitation) and infection.

### CT of skull base fractures: classification systems, complications, and management [^115kPKiA]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

As advances in prehospital and early hospital care improve survival of the head-injured patient, radiologists are increasingly charged with understanding the myriad skull base fracture management implications conferred by CT. Successfully parlaying knowledge of skull base anatomy and fracture patterns into precise actionable clinical recommendations is a challenging task. The authors aim to provide a pragmatic overview of CT for skull base fractures within the broader context of diagnostic and treatment planning algorithms. Laterobasal, frontobasal, and posterior basal fracture patterns are emphasized. CT often plays a complementary, supportive, or confirmatory role in management of skull base fractures in conjunction with results of physical examination, laboratory testing, and neurosensory evaluation. CT provides prognostic information about short- and long-term risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, encephalocele, meningitis, facial nerve paralysis, hearing and vision loss, cholesteatoma, vascular injuries, and various cranial nerve palsies and syndromes. The radiologist should leverage understanding of specific strengths and limitations of CT to anticipate next steps in the skull base fracture management plan. Additional imaging is warranted to clarify ambiguity (particularly for potential sources of CSF leak); in other cases, clinical and CT criteria alone are sufficient to determine the need for intervention and the choice of surgical approach. The radiologist should be able to envision stepping into a multidisciplinary planning discussion and engaging neurotologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, neurointerventionalists, and facial reconstructive surgeons to help synthesize an optimal management plan after reviewing the skull base CT findings at hand.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^1124hpZy]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management in abusive head trauma — A significant number of children presenting with AHT require surgical intervention; in a 5-year review at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, 58 of 213 children with AHT required surgical intervention. Unfortunately, no evidence-based guidelines exist to guide the selection of surgical strategies, and case series and pathology-specific literature can guide providers. For skull fractures and epidural hemorrhage, literature-based guidance is limited; a Brain Trauma Foundation rigorous literature-based review provided indications for elevation of open and closed fractures and evacuation of epidural hemorrhage based on size and neurologic status. Subdural hemorrhage fluid collections are common in the subdural space of children who have experienced AHT.

### Improving hospital quality and cost in nonoperative TBI… [^113vEw8h]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures were patients with repeated computed tomography of the head and neurosurgical consultations. Secondary outcome measures were findings of progression of intracranial hemorrhage on repeated computed tomographic scans, neurosurgical intervention, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, and hospital costs per patient. These consultations, however, rarely alter the course of treatment of patients who present with normal neurological examination findings and miniscule intracranial hemorrhage. 8 In an effort to standardize the need for neurosurgical consultation and repeated CT scans of the head in patients with TBI, our institute formulated the Brain Injury Guidelines5 based on a retrospective analysis of nearly 3000 patients with TBI who presented to our level I trauma center.

details regarding antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy; intubation; loss of consciousness; findings from an initial CT scan of the head; reasons for and findings from an RHCT; neurosurgical consultation; neurosurgical intervention details; hospital and ICU length of stay; discharge disposition; GCS score at discharge; and in-hospital mortality rate. The 30-day readmission rate was assessed by reviewing electronic medical records for hospital admissions within 30 days of the initial discharge. The Injury Severity Score and head Abbreviated Injury Scale score were obtained from the trauma registry. The BIG 2 category was composed of moderately injured patients with a nondisplaced skull fracture and/or a localized ICH of 5 to 7 mm. Patients who were categorized as BIG 3 had a severe head injury, and the optimal therapeutic plan for these patients consisted of hospitalization, neurosurgical consultation, and a follow-up RHCT scan.

In terms of findings on the initial CT scan of the head, subdural hematoma followed by subarachnoid hemorrhage were the most common types of ICH in the study population. A total of 491 patients had a skull fracture, of which 290 had a displaced skull fracture. There was no difference in the type of ICH before and after implementation of BIG. Table 3 highlights the findings of the initial CT scan of the head in the study population.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^117NutbM]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Seizure prophylaxis in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) — definitions, incidence, risk factors, and evidence — is summarized as follows: post-traumatic seizures (PTS) are classified as early when they occur within 7 days of injury or late when they occur after 7 days following injury, and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is defined as recurrent seizures more than 7 days following injury. In patients with severe TBI, the rate of clinical PTS may be as high as 12%, while subclinical seizures detected on electroencephalography may be as high as 20% to 25%. Risk factors for early PTS include a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≤ 10, immediate seizures, post-traumatic amnesia lasting longer than 30 minutes, linear or depressed skull fracture, penetrating head injury, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematoma, cortical contusion, age ≤ 65 years, or chronic alcoholism. Those most at risk for PTE include severe TBI and early PTS prior to discharge, acute intracerebral hematoma or cortical contusion, posttraumatic amnesia lasting longer than 24 hours, age > 65 years, or premorbid history of depression. Seizure prophylaxis for PTS refers to administering anticonvulsants following TBI to prevent seizures, and the available comparative studies are insufficient to support a recommendation for or against the use of levetiracetam over another.

Benefits of MMM

This case illustrates how MMM allows for the integration of different modalities (ICP, ABP), yielding otherwise hidden, clinically relevant metrics (e.g. PRx, LLR). Additionally, this case illustrates how MMM could support clinical decision making and personalization of treatment by providing insight into relevant pathophysiological mechanisms. Without the additional information derived, the origin of the red solid line pattern could not have been identified, and it would have been unclear whether CPP could be used to improve cerebrovascular reactivity and consequently ICP.

Case 2: MMM in significant systemic hypoxia

A 25-year-old male presented with TBI following accidental fall out of the rear passenger window of a moving vehicle at 20 mph. The patient was intubated at the scene with a GCS of 8 (E1V1M6). An initial CT scan of the head revealed a frontotemporal contusion and a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in addition to a parieto-temporal and base skull fractures (Fig. 11 A). No extracranial injuries were identified. Given the severity of the injuries, ICP monitoring was initiated.

### Imaging of head trauma: pearls and pitfalls [^113aMh4c]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality and significantly impacts the patients' quality of life and socioeconomic status. It can be classified into primary and secondary injuries. Primary injury occurs at the time of the initial head trauma, such as skull fracture, extra-axial hemorrhage, brain contusion, and diffuse axonal injury. Secondary injury develops later as complications such as diffuse cerebral edema, brain herniation, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This article describes the indication for imaging, imaging modalities, recommended imaging protocols, and imaging findings of primary and secondary injuries, including pitfalls of each pathology.

### Comparison of predictive tools for management of paediatric mild TBI: a prospective cohort study [^115YEQd9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Data used to classify diagnostic tests were prospectively recorded by the enrolling physician (or by a nurse if the patient was discharged without a physician's evaluation) at the time of the ED visit. Outcome data was collected by site investigators more than one-month post-trauma through review of medical records. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) findings were documented as reported by the on-call radiologist at each participating site, who was unaware of study enrolment. In Scandinavia, pathological CT findings are routinely assessed by a neurosurgeon and, if needed, by a neuroradiologist at a tertiary hospital.

We evaluated multiple clinical practice guidelines and decision rules, with tool specific risk factors and outcomes prospectively documented: CATCH, CATCH2, CHALICE, PECARN (< 2 years), PECARN (≥ 2 years), SNC16, PREDICT (< 2 years), PREDICT (≥ 2 years), and NICE23. Definitions used for variable coding, as well as the decision trees guiding management recommendations, are described in the protocol (Supplementary Tables S2–S6). For guidelines that use age-based dichotomisation (PECARN and PREDICT), results are presented separately for the < 2-year and ≥ 2-year groups.

For each predictive tool, a "positive" test was defined as having one or more rule-specific risk factors. In predictive tools with varying levels of risk factors, we also present analyses based solely on high-risk criteria as Supplementary Data. In addition to each predictive tool's primary and secondary endpoints, we evaluated the outcomes "neurosurgery" and "significant cCT findings". Neurosurgery was defined as any neurosurgical procedure or intervention (including neurointensive care with sedation, intubation, and controlled ventilation for non-surgical injuries, such as diffuse axonal injury) within one week of the trauma. Significant cCT findings were defined as any trauma-related intracranial injury detected on CT (< 1-week post-trauma), including intracranial haemorrhages and cerebral contusions, but excluding linear skull fractures. Patients with isolated, non-depressed, linear fractures were not included in the comparative outcome as these patients do not require immediate intervention, although clinical follow-up may be suitable due to risk for development of growing skull fracture or cognitive issues.

### Evolution of traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage captured with CT imaging: report of a case and the role of serial CT scans [^116cKUAi]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Delayed enlargement of a traumatic cerebral contusion can occur subsequent to an initial CT scan, and this can lead to neurological deterioration, brain herniation, and death. Herein, we describe the case of a 76-year-old male who experienced an intracerebral hemorrhage subsequent to a fall and whose injury worsened over time. We summarize the current recommendations in the literature for when to initiate follow-up imaging in patients with traumatic head injury, the risk factors for progression, and the role of close clinical monitoring and serial imaging in managing such patients. Finally, we illustrate how these recommendations were applied in our case.

Injury patterns and baseline characteristics (model 1) predictive of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with acute head injury remaining in the final model by stepwise analysis

Among the eight indications for CT of the brain in patients with acute head injury, three differed significantly between those with and without ICH: GCS score of 13 to 14 after observation, open skull or base of skull fracture, and age 60 years or older (table 3). There were two significant predictors of ICH according to model 2: GCS score of 13 to 14 after 2 hours of observation and open skull or base of skull fracture, with adjusted OR (95% CI) of 11.77 (1.32 to 104.96) and 5.88 (1.08 to 31.99) according to multivariate logistic regression analysis, as shown in table 4. In the combination model (model 3), only GCS score of 13 to 14 after 2 hours of observation and open skull or base of skull fracture remained significant. The adjusted OR (95% CI) of these two factors was 18.10 (1.91 to 171.29) and 8.24 (1.33 to 50.75) according to multivariate logistic regression analysis (table 5).

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^112v3raz]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic skull fractures and perioperative prophylaxis — avoid the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for traumatic skull-based fractures with CSF leaks or pneumocephalus; in patients with open or penetrating skull fractures, consider treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics with high blood-brain barrier penetration for a maximum of 3 days. Surgical debridement and irrigation are recommended as the standard of care, with perioperative antibiotics for not more than 24 hours. For surgical prophylaxis, cefazolin is the drug of choice for patients without methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus unless the patient has a documented severe beta lactam allergy, with clindamycin or vancomycin as appropriate alternatives for those with a severe allergy to beta lactams; clarify any antibiotic allergy preoperatively and select the antimicrobial agent and dosing using published guidelines with pharmacist consultation.

### Validation of the scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in adults [^113ZB8GS]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

SNC guidelines and head injury severity

CT scans were positive (CT+) for traumatic abnormalities in 36/662 patients (5%). Eight patients showed cerebral contusions, six had traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, four had subdural hematomas, two had petechial hemorrhage/shear injury, one had cerebral edema, one had a linear skull fracture, and one had an epidural hematoma. The remaining 13 patients had a combination of intracranial traumatic abnormalities. No patients in the cohort needed neurosurgical intervention and none died as a result of the TBI.

Eight subjects were classified by SNC as moderate TBI, 119 as high-risk mTBI, 12 as medium-risk mTBI, 430 as low-risk mTBI, and 93 as minimal TBI (Table 3). The prevalence of CT+ was highest in the moderate TBI group (25%) and lowest in the minimal TBI group (0%). Compared to the minimal TBI group, the CT+ prevalence was significantly higher in the moderate TBI (P = 0.006), in the high-risk mTBI group (P = 0.003), in the medium-risk mTBI group (P = 0.012), and in low-risk mTBI group (P = 0.021; Fig. 3). The CT+ prevalence in the moderate TBI group (25%) was higher than the low-risk mTBI group (5%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The CT+ prevalence in the medium-risk mTBI (17%) was higher than that of the high-risk mTBI (8%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

### Clinical characteristics and mortality of neurocritical care patients with post-traumatic cerebral venous outflow compromise [^115j5KAb]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause venous outflow compromise (VOC). - This is most commonly due to dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) or extraluminal compression from a depressed skull fracture or a hematoma. Cerebral computed tomography venography (CTV) is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice. The main indication for CTV in the context of TBI is the presence of a skull fracture crossing a dural venous sinus or involving the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In addition, an unexplained clinical deterioration or rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) after head injury may warrant investigation with CTV once other causes have been excluded.

Although the natural history of nontraumatic VOC is well characterized, there is less evidence on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with post-traumatic VOC. Moreover, treatments typically used for nontraumatic DVST, such as anticoagulation, may not be appropriate in trauma patients because of the risk of exacerbating preexisting hemorrhage. In this study, we aimed to:
Determine the prevalence of post-traumatic VOC in at-risk TBI patients in our neurocritical care unit (NCCU),
Assess the effect of post-traumatic VOC on short-term and long-term mortality, and
Examine our practice of managing these patients.

For select pediatric patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15, no palpable skull fracture, and no findings concerning for basilar skull fracture, a brief period of observation (4 to 6 hours) may obviate the need for neuroimaging even in the presence of 1 or 2 PECARN predictors of clinically important traumatic brain injury.

### Protocolized management of isolated linear skull fractures at a level 1 pediatric trauma center [^112JgnEe]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Isolated linear skull fractures without intracranial findings rarely require urgent neurosurgical intervention. A multidisciplinary fracture management protocol based on antiemetic usage was implemented at our American College of Surgeons-verified level 1 pediatric trauma center on July 1, 2019. This study evaluated protocol safety and efficacy.

Methods

Children younger than 18 years with an ICD-10 code for linear skull fracture without acute intracranial abnormality on head CT were compared before and after protocol implementation. The preprotocol cohort was defined as children who presented between July 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017; the postprotocol cohort was defined as those who presented between July 1, 2019, and July 1, 2020.

Results

The preprotocol and postprotocol cohorts included 162 and 82 children, respectively. Overall, 57% were male, and the median (interquartile range) age was 9.1 (4.8–25.0) months. The cohorts did not differ significantly in terms of sex (p = 0.1) or age (p = 0.8). Falls were the most common mechanism of injury (193 patients [79%]). After protocol implementation, there was a relative increase in patients who fell from a height > 3 feet (10% to 29%, p < 0.001) and those with no reported injury mechanism (12% to 16%, p < 0.001). The neurosurgery department was consulted for 86% and 44% of preprotocol and postprotocol cases, respectively (p < 0.001). Trauma consultations and consultations for abusive head trauma did not significantly change (p = 0.2 and p = 0.1, respectively). Admission rate significantly decreased (52% to 38%, p = 0.04), and the 72-hour emergency department revisit rate trended down but was not statistically significant (2.8/year to 1/year, p = 0.2). No deaths occurred, and no inpatient neurosurgical procedures were performed.

Conclusions

Protocolization of isolated linear skull fracture management is safe and feasible at a high-volume level 1 pediatric trauma center. Neurosurgical consultation can be prioritized for select patients. Further investigation into criteria for admission, need for interfacility transfers, and healthcare costs is warranted.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^111ZkbHW]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aim of the study, target population

In the present report we aim to present evidence- and consensus-based guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children. The purpose of the proposed guidelines is to assist physicians in the initial management of children (< 18 years of age) with head trauma within the first 24 hours following trauma, particularly to determine those children who need a head CT and/or in-hospital observation and those who can be directly discharged from the ED. The guidelines exclude children with severe head trauma as defined below (see definitions). They are intended for use by physicians in the ED, including paediatric EDs and to some extent general practitioners; hence, with focus on physicians who are not experts in the field of head trauma management. The guidelines are not intended for nurses or non-medical professionals.

The primary goal of the study was to identify all paediatric patients in need of intervention, such as neurosurgical and/or intensive care or who have an intracranial injury (critical patient-important outcome), and secondarily, those paediatric patients with any traumatic intracranial injury, including skull fractures (important patient-important outcome) following minor and moderate head trauma.

### Fracture of the skull: analysis of one hundred and seventy-one proved cases… [^112SYN83]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinical methods now enable us to secure more accurate information than was formerly possible in cases in which fracture of the skull is suspected; but because of limitations in the roentgen-ray diagnosis, particularly in connection with fracture at the base of the skull, considerable confusion still exists. The problem of the fractured skull becomes more clearly defined if when such a group of cases is analyzed instances are excluded in which a fracture is not definitely proved to exist. The complexity caused by associated injuries to the brain must be borne in mind. It is not unlikely that the experience of other clinicians, obtained when they apply such restrictions, will be similar to our own in finding that the number of cases in which a skull fracture may be actually demonstrated is overrated. Care must be taken to exclude doubtful cases if the problem is to be simplified, even though. RAND CW, NIELSEN JM.

### Improving hospital quality and costs in nonoperative traumatic brain injury: the role of acute care surgeons [^114dEyUw]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The role of acute care surgeons is evolving; however, no guidelines exist for the selective treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) exclusively by acute care surgeons. We implemented the Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) for managing TBI at our institution on March 1, 2012.

Objective

To compare the outcomes in patients with TBI before and after implementation of the BIG protocol.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a 2-year analysis of our prospectively maintained database of all patients with TBI (findings of skull fracture and/or intracranial hemorrhage on an initial computed tomographic scan of the head) who presented to our level I trauma center. The pre-BIG group included patients with TBI from March 1, 2011, through February 29, 2012, and the post-BIG group included patients from July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2013.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measures were patients with repeated computed tomography of the head and neurosurgical consultations. Secondary outcome measures were findings of progression of intracranial hemorrhage on repeated computed tomographic scans, neurosurgical intervention, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, and hospital costs per patient.

Results

A total of 796 patients (415 in the pre-BIG group and 381 in the post-BIG group) were included. There was a significant reduction (19.0%) in the rate of neurosurgical consultation (post-BIG group, 273 patients [71.7%]; pre-BIG group, 376 [90.6%]; P < .001), repeated computed tomography of the head (post-BIG group, 255 patients [66.9%]; pre-BIG group, 381 patients [91.8%]; P < .001), hospital (post-BIG group, 330 [86.6%]; pre-BIG group, 398 [95.9%]; P < .001) and intensive care unit admission (post-BIG group, 202 [53.0%]; pre-BIG group, 257 [61.9%]; P = 0.01), hospital length of stay (post-BIG group, 5.4 [4.5] days; pre-BIG group, 6.1 [4.8] days; P = 0.03), and hospital costs per patient ($4772 per patient; P = 0.03) with implementation of BIG. There was no difference in the in-hospital mortality rate (post-BIG group, 62 patients [16.3%]; pre-BIG group, 69 patients [16.6%]; P = 0.89), progression of intracranial hemorrhage on repeated scans (post-BIG group, 41 patients [10.8%]; pre-BIG group, 59 patients [14.2%]; P = 0.14), neurosurgical intervention (post-BIG group, 61 patients [16.0%]; pre-BIG group, 59 patients [14.2%]; P = 0.48), and 30-day readmission rate (post-BIG group, 31 patients [8.1%]; pre-BIG group, 37 patients [8.9%]; P = 0.69) after implementation of BIG.

Conclusions and Relevance

Implementation of BIG is safe and cost-effective. BIG defines the management of TBI without the need for neurosurgical consultation and unnecessary imaging. Establishing a national, multi-institutional study implementing the BIG protocol is warranted.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^114HGN11]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

For the first clinical question, we included studies reporting patients with admission/initial GCS scores ≥ 9 and that included one or more predictive risk factors for the reference standards of CT findings, intracranial injury (ICI) and/or neurosurgical intervention. We decided a priori to only include studies where information concerning true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) could be extracted. This information would be necessary to fully appreciate the possible clinical effect and role of a risk factor, allowing consideration of other effects than the positive predictive power. Studies reporting less than 50 patients were excluded. Definitions for risk factors were defined a priori.

For the second clinical question, we included studies reporting patients with admission/initial GCS scores ≥ 9 with an initial CT scan (normal or abnormal) and contained information regarding clinical characteristics that were associated with a positive or worsening repeat CT scan, ICI and/or neurosurgical intervention within 1 week following trauma.

CT findings were defined as any traumatic finding on head CT. ICI was defined as any intracranial (isolated non-depressed cranial fractures not included) traumatic finding on CT. Also, since not all patients can be subjected to CT, absence of ICI was defined as relevant and robust clinical follow-up suggestive of normal neurological functioning (with the exception of classical PCS symptoms). The decision to consider any CT findings and ICI as separate reference standards was due to the difference in clinical importance of these measures. This approach should also stratify reference standards in a more homogenous selection compared to a combined definition. Finally, neurosurgical intervention was defined as any neurosurgical procedure for a cranial or intracranial injury within the first week following trauma. Medical treatment for elevated intracranial pressure, within the first week following trauma, was also included in this group since some patients with diffuse brain injury cannot be managed surgically.

### Elevated skull fractures: an institutional experience and individual participant data meta-analysis [^116Aaui4]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevated skull fracture (ESF) is a rare but potentially life-threatening type of skull fracture. The literature on this topic is relatively sparse. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis of all the patients reported in the literature with ESFs with respect to their clinical management to better inform practice. On 20th of January 2023, we conducted a systematic search of literature to find all published cases of ESF. We also conducted a retrospective review of ESF cases from our institution. The data collection and analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After screening, 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 104 individual patients were included in the meta-analysis, with a median age of 24 years and 85.7% of whom were males. 11 patients (11.2%) had an unfavorable outcome while 37 (35.2%) had one or more complications. We found that GCS on admission is an independent predictor of poor outcome in ESF (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.605 (1.110–2.315), p value = 0.012). Regarding complications, dural injury (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 66.667 (7.407–500.00), p value < 0.001) and multiple bone involvement (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 6.849 (2.127–22.222), p value = 0.001) were independent predictors of complication. ESFs represent a rare yet consequential form of cranial injury, carrying potentially life-threatening implications if not promptly addressed. In this study, we present the meta-analysis of outcomes and complications within this patient cohort, offering a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature on this pathology. However, further investigation is imperative to provide higher-quality evidence and address lingering uncertainties in the classification and management of ESFs.

Management and clinical outcomes

Only 8 (1.9%) patients in the pre-PECARN group and 7 (0.7%) in the post-PECARN group were diagnosed with ciTBI (p = 0.09). Among patients that had CT imaging, only 8 (8.7%) pre- and 13 (7.5%) post-PECARN had positive findings on CT (p = 0.73). Nevertheless, significantly more written discharge instructions specifically related to head trauma were given post-PECARN rules implementation (51.0% vs 44.0%, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in the number of neurology and neurosurgery consults (6.6% vs 4.4%, p = 0.09), ED length of stay (75.2 ± 76.6 vs 69.3 ± 68.1 min, p = 0.18), nor in patient disposition (96.8% vs 92.4% discharged home, p = 0.66) between pre- and post-PECARN groups (Table 2).

### Neurologically intact children with an isolated skull fracture may be safely discharged after brief observation [^111rjv3M]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The management of children presenting with an isolated skull fracture (ISF) posttrauma is highly variable. We sought to estimate the risk of neurologic deterioration in children with a Glasgow coma score (GCS) 15 and ISF to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions.

Methods

A retrospective review at a level I pediatric trauma referral center was conducted for patients with ISF on head computed tomography from 2003 to 2008. Patients were excluded for injury greater than 24 hours prior, GCS less than 15, intracranial pathology, significant fracture depression, or complex fractures involving facial bones or skull base.

Results

A total of 235 patients were identified with an ISF. The median age was 11 months, with falls accounting for 87% of the injuries. One hundred seventy-seven patients were admitted, and 58 patients were discharged from the emergency department after a period of observation (median, 3.3 hours). Median length of stay for those admitted to the hospital was 18.2 hours. One patient developed vomiting following overnight observation and a repeat computed tomography scan demonstrated a small extra-axial hematoma that required no intervention. The mean total costs for patients discharged from the emergency department were $291 vs $1447 for those admitted for observation (P < .001).

Conclusion

Patients with a presenting GCS of 15 and an ISF can be safely discharged from the emergency department after a short period of observation if they are asymptomatic and have a reliable social environment. This could result in significant savings by eliminating inpatient costs.

### Pediatric blunt cerebrovascular injuries: approach and management [^112KqoD6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The low incidence of blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) reported in pediatric studies (< 1%) might be related to an underreporting due to both the absence of current screening guidelines and the use of inadequate imaging techniques. This research is a review of the literature limited to the last 5 years (2017–2022) about the approach and management of BCVI in pediatrics. The strongest predictors for BCVI were the presence of basal skull fracture, cervical spine fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 8, mandible fracture, and injury severity score more than 15. Vertebral artery injuries had the highest associated stroke rate of any injury type at 27.6% (vs 20.1% in carotid injury). The sensitivity of the well-established screening guidelines of BCVI varies when applied to the pediatric population (Utah score - 36%, 17%, Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guideline - 17%, and Denver criteria - 2%). A recent metaanalysis of 8 studies comparing early computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) to digital subtraction angiography for BCVI detection in adult trauma patients demonstrated high variability in the sensitivity and specificity of CTA across centers. Overall, CTA was found to have a high specificity but low sensitivity for BCVI. The role of antithrombotic as well as the type and duration of therapy remain controversial. Studies suggest that systemic heparinization and antiplatelet therapy are equally effective.

### Should pediatric patients with isolated skull fractures be admitted, transferred, or discharged from the emergency department, and what are the economic consequences? Original series, systematic review of the literature, and a proposed admission protocol [^112AN3Se]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric head trauma is a common reason for emergency department (ED) referrals. Skull fractures are the most common imaging findings in the setting of pediatric trauma. Ample literature negates the necessity of hospitalization for neurologically intact children with isolated skull fractures (ISFs) and when nonaccidental injuries (NAIs) are not suspected. Despite this evidence, in many centers these children are still admitted for observation. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of children admitted with ISFs. A literature review of studies of children with ISFs was also performed. The objective of this study was to assess the necessity of admission of children with ISF.

Methods

A retrospective single-center analysis was performed, based on the electronic referral database of a tertiary pediatric hospital. Pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with a linear skull fracture on CT were included. Patients with additional traumatic intracranial findings on imaging (bleeding, pneumocephalus, edema, etc.) were excluded, as were patients with depressed, open, or displaced fractures. A systematic literature review of the Medline and PubMed databases was performed.

Results

Two hundred fifty-eight children met the criteria between 2019 and 2022. Eighty-one percent sustained a fall. Other mechanisms of injury included blunt-force trauma and road accidents, and 10.5% had an unclear mechanism. Most children had parietal fractures (56.3%), followed by occipital fractures and others. Sixteen percent suffered from chronic illnesses. No cases of growing skull fractures were noted. None of the children needed neurosurgical intervention. Moreover, none needed a follow-up CT scan. Three patients were transferred from a first-tier hospital to the authors' institution, none because of neurosurgical concerns. Other than these 3 patients, all other children were admitted to a pediatric ward for 24-hour observation and subsequently discharged. NAI was highly suspected in 7.1% of children (3/42) suffering from chronic illnesses as opposed to 1.4% (3/216) of healthy children. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.056). The literature review yielded 680 papers. After screening for relevance, language, etc., 8 original series with 5823 patients remained. One patient (0.017%) was operated on, but probably not for ISF. The cost difference between discharge from the ED and admission ranged between $520 and $4291 (US dollars). None of the children discharged from the ED returned for hospitalization.

Conclusions

In this original cohort, none of the children had a change in management following their admission. None needed neurosurgical intervention. In children with linear ISFs, a short ED observation should be considered, followed by discharge based on neurological status. A proposed ED discharge protocol is presented.

### Artificial intelligence application in skull bone fracture with segmentation approach [^111TDfFq]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Emergency departments manage a substantial volume of traumatic brain injury cases, often presenting with concurrent intracranial hemorrhages and skull fractures. Despite considerable research dedicated to applying deep learning to intracranial hemorrhages, studies into AI (artificial intelligence) applications for diagnosing skull fractures remain relatively limited. Skull fractures may lead to critical complications such as intracranial and orbital injuries, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, cranial nerve palsies, and vascular injuries. However, the inherent complexity of multiple fractures complicates the image interpretation. AI models have shown remarkable accuracy and augmented diagnostic precision across various medical fields.

Earlier research indicates that segmentation for skull fracture detection exhibits superior sensitivity (recall) and specificity compared to object detection. However, a significant portion of AI research related to skull fractures has excluded pediatric and post-craniectomy patient. To our knowledge, no preceding studies have conducted a comparative analysis of the diagnostic duration within the scope of skull fractures.

In this study, we aim to evaluate an AI model designed to conduct binary classification of skull fractures as well as provides a graphic segmentation mask that clearly outlines the fracture lines. Pediatric and post-operative individuals were not excluded from our training dataset. Moreover, we have undertaken an analysis of the diagnostic duration to further understand its implications.

Management

All included patients were treated according to the management protocol endorsed by our neurosurgery department, and in agreement with the management guide lines reported in literature which included the following: (1) primary survey to ensure patent airway, intact breathing ability, and adequate blood circulation; (2) complete history: age; sex; mood of trauma (road traffic accident (RTA), fall from height (FFH), assault or direct trauma; clinical presentations (loss of consciousness (LOC), headache, vomiting, amnesia, seizures); (3) thorough general examination to detect other traumatic injuries and co-morbidities; (4) full neurological assessment (GCS score; severity of head injury including mild (GCS 13–15), moderate (GCS 9–12) or severe (GCS 4–8); pupillary responses and neurological deficits); (5) type of skull fracture either a compound DSF (opened skin wound directly over the fracture) or a simple DSF (with either closed skin or with opened skin wound away from the fracture); (6) routine laboratory investigations (complete blood picture, coagulation profile, liver and kidney function tests, random blood sugar, virology markers; (7) CT scan of the brain and skull bones to detect (side, location, size of the skull defect and associated intracranial pathologies).

Dehydrating measures, cerebro-protective agents were given in certain cases. Broad spectrum antibiotics and anti-convulsive drugs were started preoperatively for all cases. Surgical decision was taken by the neurosurgeon consultant on-duty. All surgical lesions were treated under general anesthesia (GA) with standard surgical procedures.

Surgical approach

The surgical approach was either through the same wound or with slight expansion. The elevated depressed bone fragments were washed with diluted hydrogen peroxide for 15 min and the surgical field was also irrigated of with diluted hydrogen peroxide. Actually in our emergency operating room we did not have the facilities of mini-plates to fix bone fragments together. Also, we consider that making holes in the sitting of multiple bone chips can be time consuming. Hence, we used vicryl 0 to make a net through edges of the galea then bone fragments were replaced and fixed using this net. Figure 1 illustrates the intraoperative images using our management protocol for a case suffering DSF combined with extradural hematoma (EDH). Lastly, debridement of the wound margins was done followed by skin closure with subgaleal drain.

The mortality and morbidity associated with traumatic head injury in children is staggering, and the cumulative effect of such on the pediatric and general populations is propagated through related health care measures and subsequent socioeconomic burden. The majority of deaths due to trauma in children are caused by brain injury. This article reviews the evaluation and management of scalp injuries in the pediatric patient. The second portion addresses skull fractures, the specter of child abuse, management of acute fracture, and the phenomenon of growing skull fractures.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^112WzdTw]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) neuroimaging — head CT is the initial imaging study that can identify skull fractures, intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema, and mass effect/intracranial shift, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) better demonstrates brain tissue changes and distinguishes extra-axial fluid collections and the age and extent of subdural hematoma. Neuroimaging findings for AHT-related subdural hematoma (SDH) include SDH without an associated skull fracture, more chronic appearing hematoma, areas with blood of multiple apparent ages, and hypoxic-ischemic changes with cerebral edema associated with AHT.

### Factors associated with receipt of intracranial pressure monitoring in older adults with traumatic brain injury [^114Lo2VJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) include intracranial pressure monitoring (ICPM), yet very little is known about ICPM in older adults. Our objectives were to characterize the utilization of ICPM in older adults and identify factors associated with ICPM in those who met the BTF guidelines.

Methods

We analyzed data from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Geriatric TBI Study, a registry study conducted among individuals with isolated, CT-confirmed TBI across 45 trauma centers. The analysis was restricted to those aged ≥ 60. Independent factors associated with ICPM for those who did and did not meet the BTF guidelines were identified using logistic regression.

Results

Our sample was composed of 2303 patients, of whom 66 (2.9%) underwent ICPM. Relative to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15, GCS score of 9 to 12 (OR 10.2; 95% CI 4.3 to 24.4) and GCS score of < 9 (OR 15.0; 95% CI 7.2 to 31.1), intraventricular hemorrhage (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.83), skull fractures (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.0 to 6.6), CT worsening (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.8 to 5.9), and neurosurgical interventions (OR 3.8; 95% CI 2.1 to 7.0) were significantly associated with ICPM. Restricting to those who met the BTF guidelines, only 43 of 240 (18%) underwent ICPM. Factors independently associated with ICPM included intraparenchymal hemorrhage (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 4.7), skull fractures (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.9 to 8.2), and neurosurgical interventions (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.7 to 7.2).

Discussion

Worsening GCS, intraparenchymal/intraventricular hemorrhage, and skull fractures were associated with ICPM among older adults with TBI, yet utilization of ICPM remains low, especially among those meeting the BTF guidelines, and potential benefits remain unclear. This study highlights the need for better understanding of factors that influence compliance with BTF guidelines and the risks versus benefits of ICPM in this population.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^114UHEVL]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach to management of the traumatically injured patient remains the cornerstone of optimal patient care, and we have made an effort to formulate this guideline in a manner that is widely applicable to a variety of settings in clinical practice. As the volume and level of evidence in this field accumulates, the current state-of-the-art as reflected in this guideline will need to evolve accordingly.

Initial imaging — CT performance and acquisition parameters: Head CT is the cornerstone of acute imaging in TBI because of its high sensitivity and specificity for identifying acute intracranial injury, can be obtained rapidly with total image acquisition time < 5 seconds using modern multi-slice scanners, has no contraindications when performed without contrast unlike MRI, and recommended acquisition includes axial, coronal, and sagittal images with 2.0 mm to 3.75 mm slice thickness plus 0.5 mm to 1.25 mm bone-algorithm images to improve visibility of craniofacial fractures.

### Current research progress in cranioplasty and related repair materials [^115DEwTS]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Skull defect is a common and challenging clinical problem in the field of neurosurgery, which can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as brain trauma, brain tumor resection, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, cerebral edema, skull fracture, or infection. Skull defect not only weakens the protection of brain tissue, increasing the risk of potential neurological deficits and seizures, but also seriously affects the patient's appearance and quality of life. Therefore, from the patient's perspective, the repair of skull defects is often driven by the dual needs of aesthetics and functional recovery. This review deeply explores the history, pathophysiology, indications, and complications of cranioplasty through an extensive literature search. In addition, we will also analyze the research progress of traditional and new biomaterials currently used in cranial repair. Specifically, we will delve into recent research on emerging technologies and cranial bone regeneration, providing valuable references for future clinical practice and research.

Imaging for suspected child abuse — key points emphasize that a brain CT without IV contrast is the best initial examination for detecting intracranial hemorrhage and skull fractures caused by AHT in children with neurological impairment, while brain MRI is more sensitive for brain parenchymal and cervical spine injuries and early small hemorrhages may be inconspicuous. Complete radiographic skeletal surveys with 22 separate views must be performed on all children under the age of 2 years when a suspicion of abuse exists, and a limited follow-up skeletal survey performed 2 weeks after the initial survey helps identify occult acute fractures and clarify questionable findings.

### Surgical management of depressed cranial fractures [^113dWS6h]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Indications

Patients with open (compound) cranial fractures depressed greater than the thickness of the cranium should undergo operative intervention to prevent infection. Patients with open (compound) depressed cranial fractures may be treated nonoperatively if there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of dural penetration, significant intracranial hematoma, depression greater than 1 cm, frontal sinus involvement, gross cosmetic deformity, wound infection, pneumocephalus, or gross wound contamination. Nonoperative management of closed (simple) depressed cranial fractures is a treatment option.

Timing

Early operation is recommended to reduce the incidence of infection.

Methods

Elevation and debridement is recommended as the surgical method of choice. Primary bone fragment replacement is a surgical option in the absence of wound infection at the time of surgery. All management strategies for open (compound) depressed fractures should include antibiotics.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® head Trauma: 2021 update [^115q3Lbs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Head trauma (ie, head injury) is a significant public health concern and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. Neuroimaging plays an important role in the management of head and brain injury, which can be separated into acute (0–7 days), subacute (< 3 months), then chronic (> 3 months) phases. Over 75% of acute head trauma is classified as mild, of which over 75% have a normal Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, therefore clinical practice guidelines universally recommend selective CT scanning in this patient population, which is often based on clinical decision rules. While CT is considered the first-line imaging modality for suspected intracranial injury, MRI is useful when there are persistent neurologic deficits that remain unexplained after CT, especially in the subacute or chronic phase. Regardless of time frame, head trauma with suspected vascular injury or suspected cerebrospinal fluid leak should also be evaluated with CT angiography or thin-section CT imaging of the skull base, respectively. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^115mNfnP]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During the last 15 years, the use of computed tomography (CT) scans in mild head trauma has dramatically increased. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of this patient population will have intracranial pathology on CT and that fewer than 1% will require neurosurgical intervention. The need to identify these patients from the majority of patients that will have no intracranial pathology must be balanced against both health care costs and patient risk of exposure to ionizing radiation. Unden and colleagues have conducted an extensive literature search and consensus panel to readdress the question of which patients require a CT head after minimal, mild or moderate head trauma and proposed an algorithm that will encompass most of these adult patients, including those on anticoagulation therapy. They have also provided disposition guidelines to address which patients need admission to hospital, including monitoring routines, and which can be safely discharged.

### Avoiding skull radiographs in infants with suspected inflicted injury who also undergo head CT: "a no-brainer? " [^111y2i5w]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to insufficient evidence upon which to base a change in practice at the time, the recently updated guidelines for the investigation of SPA (like the previous edition) recommend performing AP and lateral SXR as part of the initial skeletal survey, even if head CT is performed. Guideline 35 states that, '3D surface reconstructed images employing bone and soft tissue windows should be undertaken for better appreciation of skull fractures and associated scalp soft tissue injuries. This does not replace the need for AP and lateral skull radiographs, which provide complementary information'. Previous thinking has been that although SXR provide no information with regard to intracranial injury, they may help with the identification of skull fractures, particularly linear fractures occurring in the plane of the head CT slice which may not be readily identifiable. In our study, there were no fractures on SXR that were not also visualised on head CT. Thus, SXR confer no diagnostic benefit when head CT with 3D reconstructions are available: removing AP and lateral SXR from the initial skeletal survey when a head CT is going to be or has been performed would reduce radiation dose and distress to the patient, in addition to saving time. There is also the additional benefit of being able to identify intracranial pathology which would not be evident on SXR and may be clinically silent until the patient deteriorates, such as intracranial haemorrhage. In the 21 cases where a fracture was identified, 7 also had either a subdural or extradural haematoma (Table 1).

In the imaging investigation of SPA, it is recommended that all children below 1 year of age have head CT, whilst a head CT examination is only recommended if there are clinical features of neurological injury (external evidence of head trauma, abnormal neurological signs and symptoms, or haemorrhagic retinopathy) in children aged between 1 and 2 years. Currently, both groups of children will have AP and lateral SXR performed as part of their initial skeletal survey. Given the results of our study, we recommend that head CT should replace SXR in the imaging investigation of SPA in children under the age of 1 year and those over 1 year of age who present with neurological injury. Until further evidence is available, for those children over the age of 1 year without abnormal neurological signs and symptoms, we recommend that the national guidance should be followed and that SXR should continue to be employed as part of the initial skeletal survey unless head CT has been, or is going to be, performed.

### Risk factors for neurosurgical intervention within 48 hours of admission for patients with mild traumatic brain injury and isolated subdural hematoma [^112tHwnm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to identify demographic, clinical, and radiographic risk factors for neurosurgical intervention within 48 hours of admission in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and isolated subdural hematoma.

Methods

The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all trauma patients admitted to 6 level I/II trauma centers who met the following criteria: admitted between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, age ≥ 18 years, ICD-10 diagnosis code for isolated subdural hematoma, available initial head imaging, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13–15, and arrival at the hospital within 48 hours of injury. Patients were excluded for skull fracture, non-subdural hematoma, and absence of neurosurgical consultation. The study outcome was neurosurgical intervention within 48 hours of hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression with backward selection examined 30 demographic, clinical, and radiographic risk factors for neurosurgery.

Results

In total, 1333 patients were included, of whom 117 (8.8%) received a neurosurgical intervention. When only demographic and clinical variables were considered, sex, mechanism of injury, and hours from injury to initial head imaging were significant covariates (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] [95% CI] 0.70 [0.65–0.75]). When only radiographic risk factors were considered, only maximum hemorrhage thickness (in mm) and midline shift (in mm) were independent risk factors for the outcome (AUROC 0.95 [0.92–0.97]). When all demographic, clinical, and radiographic variables were considered together, advanced directive, Injury Severity Score, midline shift, and maximum hemorrhage thickness were identified as significant risk factors for neurosurgical intervention within 48 hours of hospital admission (AUROC 0.95 [0.94–0.97]).

Conclusions

In the setting of mild traumatic brain injury with isolated subdural hematoma, radiographic risk factors were shown to be stronger than demographic and clinical variables in understanding future risk of neurosurgical intervention. These final radiographic risk factors should be considered in the creation of future prediction models and used to increase the efficiency of existing management guidelines.

### Nondepressed linear skull fractures in children younger than 2 years: is computed tomography always necessary? [^112diot8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current recommendations are that young children with a skull fracture following head injury undergo computed tomography (CT) examination of their head to exclude significant intracranial injury. Recent reports, however, have raised concern that radiation exposure from CT scanning may cause malignancies.

Objective

To estimate the proportion of children with nondisplaced linear skull fractures who have clinically significant intracranial injury.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients younger than 2 years who presented to an emergency department and received a diagnosis of skull fracture.

Results

Ninety-two patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study; all had a head CT scan performed. None suffered a clinically significant intracranial injury.

Conclusion

Observation, rather than CT, may be a reasonable management option for head-injured children younger than 2 years who have a nondisplaced linear skull fracture on plain radiography but no clinical signs of intracranial injury.

### Functional short-term outcomes and mortality in children with severe traumatic brain injury: comparing decompressive craniectomy and medical management [^113fY9Ur]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Description of the cohort

Out of 352,899 patients reported to the TraumaRegister DGU during the study period, 11,000 were children, of which 2507 met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). More than 90% of patients were treated in a Level 1 trauma center and male sex prevailed (Table 1). DC was performed in 402 (16.0%) patients. Patients undergoing DC did not differ with regard to age (Fig. 2), but suffered more severe head injury, had higher ISS, lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) values, and longer ICU and hospital stays compared with medical management (Table 1). In patients with AIS head 5, the findings on ISS and GCS were inverted, with lower ISS and higher GCS values in patients receiving DC (Table 2).
