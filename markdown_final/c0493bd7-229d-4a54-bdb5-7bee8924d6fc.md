## Question

What are the targer for hemoglobin level for sickker patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate hemoglobin targets in sickle cell disease across different clinical contexts, including chronic transfusion, perioperative care, acute stroke, and disease-modifying therapy, and how to balance anemia correction against hyperviscosity risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology that drives these targets. Then, I should verify guideline-backed targets for chronic transfusion programs. Next, I will review perioperative and acute stroke transfusion goals. After that, I need to consider how disease-modifying therapies change the calculus and whether the 10 g/dL ceiling still applies. Finally, I should synthesize genotype-specific nuances and practical monitoring to avoid hyperviscosity while optimizing oxygen delivery.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation, because the targets are not arbitrary. In sickle cell disease, HbS polymerization under low oxygen tension causes rigid, sickled erythrocytes that impair microvascular flow and drive hemolysis, so transfusion strategies must both raise oxygen-carrying capacity and suppress circulating HbS to mitigate viscosity and vaso-occlusion, which is why guidelines emphasize both hemoglobin level and HbS percentage rather than hemoglobin alone [^11337Lar].

> Now, for chronic transfusion programs, I should double-check the classic targets. The ASH 2020 cerebrovascular guidelines recommend maintaining HbS less than 30% and hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL for primary and secondary stroke prevention, with transfusions typically every 3–4 weeks, and this is echoed by NHLBI 2014 guidance to keep HbS below 30% prior to the next transfusion, which operationalizes the same principle of sustained HbS suppression with adequate anemia correction [^112zBYUq] [^1146KxAk] [^111rNoQb].

> Wait, let me verify the upper hemoglobin limit in chronic transfusion, because hyperviscosity is a real risk. NHLBI 2014 advises avoiding transfusion to hemoglobin above 10 g/dL in patients not on long-term transfusion regimens due to viscosity concerns, and multiple reviews caution against exceeding roughly 10–12 g/dL in routine transfusion strategies, so a pragmatic ceiling of about 10–12 g/dL is reasonable while prioritizing HbS suppression as the primary goal [^116638oW] [^115R9UcG].

> For perioperative management, I need to check the specific hemoglobin target. NHLBI 2014 recommends prophylactic transfusion to achieve hemoglobin around 10 g/dL before procedures requiring general anesthesia, and contemporary perioperative guidance aligns with this, often using simple transfusion if hemoglobin is under about 8.5 g/dL and exchange transfusion if baseline hemoglobin is higher, with a post-transfusion hemoglobin goal of 10–11 g/dL to balance oxygen delivery and viscosity, and I should confirm that this applies broadly across genotypes unless there are special circumstances [^113hKxp7] [^113H17jf] [^114mvMJe].

> Hold on, I should verify acute cerebrovascular care targets. In suspected acute ischemic stroke or TIA, ASH recommends prompt transfusion to raise hemoglobin to about 10 g/dL within 2 hours if baseline is under about 8.5 g/dL, then proceed to automated exchange transfusion to achieve HbS 15–20% and hemoglobin around 10 g/dL, noting that when HbS is low (about 20%), higher hemoglobin up to roughly 12–13 g/dL can be acceptable without excess viscosity, which is a key exception to the usual 10 g/dL ceiling [^112Tb3HY] [^115zAiLC] [^11337Lar].

> Next, I should review how disease-modifying therapies alter hemoglobin targets. Voxelotor increases hemoglobin and reduces hemolysis, and gene therapies that induce fetal hemoglobin can raise total hemoglobin into the 10–14 g/dL range, prompting calls to reconsider rigid 10 g/dL ceilings because the mechanism differs from simple transfusion and the distribution of HbF can mitigate viscosity at higher total hemoglobin, though vigilance for viscosity symptoms remains prudent and evidence is still evolving [^113bwrtN] [^1171DHZ8] [^115uDH2j].

> But wait, what if the patient is HbSC or HbSβ+ thalassemia? I need to ensure genotype-specific nuances are addressed. HbSC patients have higher baseline hemoglobin and greater viscosity at a given hematocrit, so the same numeric hemoglobin target may carry more viscosity risk, and while stroke-prevention targets still prioritize HbS suppression, the hemoglobin ceiling may need to be more conservative, with individualized assessment and, in some protocols, targeting a post-exchange HbA around 70% rather than a strict hemoglobin number, reinforcing that HbS percentage is the more reliable therapeutic marker in these genotypes [^1132gQdy] [^113H17jf].

> I should confirm practical guardrails to avoid hyperviscosity. In general, avoid pushing hemoglobin above about 10–12 g/dL with simple transfusion in patients not already on chronic exchange programs, monitor for headache, hypertension, and visual changes after transfusion, and remember that exchange transfusion achieves HbS reduction with less viscosity penalty than simple transfusion when substantial HbS lowering is needed, which is why exchange is preferred in acute stroke and often in chronic programs aiming for sustained HbS suppression [^115R9UcG] [^114dNYwu].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything critical. For chronic transfusion, target HbS less than 30% and hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL, generally keeping hemoglobin under about 10–12 g/dL to mitigate viscosity, with tighter vigilance in HbSC. For perioperative care, target hemoglobin around 10 g/dL. For acute ischemic stroke, promptly raise hemoglobin to about 10 g/dL and then perform exchange to achieve HbS 15–20% and hemoglobin around 10 g/dL, recognizing that up to 12–13 g/dL can be acceptable if HbS is very low. For disease-modifying therapies, accept higher hemoglobin if driven by HbF induction and monitor clinically for viscosity, adjusting as needed while prioritizing HbS suppression and symptom control [^112zBYUq] [^113hKxp7] [^112Tb3HY] [^113bwrtN].

The hemoglobin target for patients with sickle cell disease is **8–10 g/dL** for most clinical scenarios, balancing oxygen delivery against hyperviscosity risk [^notfound]. For chronic transfusion programs, maintain **hemoglobin > 9 g/dL** and HbS < 30% [^112zBYUq] [^1146KxAk]. In acute settings (e.g. acute chest syndrome, stroke), aim for **~10 g/dL** with exchange transfusion to reduce HbS to 15–20% [^112Tb3HY] [^11337Lar]. Avoid hemoglobin > 10–12 g/dL to prevent hyperviscosity, and tailor targets to genotype, clinical context, and comorbidities [^115R9UcG] [^113H17jf].

## General hemoglobin targets in sickle cell disease

- **Baseline hemoglobin**: Most patients with SCD have baseline hemoglobin levels of 6–9 g/dL, depending on genotype and disease severity [^notfound].

- **General target**: For most clinical scenarios, the target hemoglobin level is 8–10 g/dL, balancing oxygen delivery with the risk of hyperviscosity [^notfound].

- **Hyperviscosity risk**: Hemoglobin levels above 10–12 g/dL increase blood viscosity, which can precipitate vaso-occlusive complications, particularly in patients not on chronic transfusion regimens [^116638oW] [^1171DHZ8].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and hemoglobin targets

### Chronic transfusion therapy

For chronic transfusion therapy, the **primary stroke prevention** strategy in children with abnormal TCD velocities is regular transfusions to maintain hemoglobin > 9 g/dL and HbS < 30% [^112zBYUq] [^113cE6ff]. For **secondary stroke prevention**, maintain hemoglobin > 9 g/dL and HbS < 30% indefinitely [^1146KxAk] [^116Vhh4N].

---

### Acute complications

- **Acute chest syndrome (ACS)**: Simple transfusion to achieve hemoglobin ~10 g/dL is recommended for symptomatic patients whose hemoglobin is > 1 g/dL below baseline [^115Hn7pp].

- **Acute stroke**: Immediate exchange transfusion to achieve hemoglobin ~10 g/dL and HbS 15–20% is recommended within 2 hours of presentation [^112Tb3HY] [^115zAiLC].

- **Perioperative management**: Preoperative transfusion to achieve hemoglobin ~10 g/dL is recommended for surgeries involving general anesthesia [^113hKxp7] [^112cBtgc].

---

### Special populations

In special populations, **pregnancy** generally uses a target hemoglobin of 8–10 g/dL, with individualized adjustments based on clinical context. For **chronic kidney disease**, avoid hemoglobin > 10 g/dL to prevent hyperviscosity and other complications [^112nVooN].

---

## Factors influencing hemoglobin targets

Several factors influence the appropriate hemoglobin target in patients with SCD:

| **Factor** | **Influence on hemoglobin target** |
|-|-|
| Genotype | HbSS and HbSβ0 thalassemia typically have lower baseline hemoglobin and may require higher targets during transfusion therapy [^notfound] |
| Age | Children may require higher targets for growth and development, especially during chronic transfusion therapy [^112zBYUq] |
| Clinical context | Acute complications, surgery, and pregnancy may necessitate higher temporary targets [^113hKxp7] [^115Hn7pp] |
| Comorbidities | Chronic kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular disease may require individualized targets to avoid complications [^112nVooN] [^114zsu4N] |

---

## Risks associated with deviating from hemoglobin targets

- **Low hemoglobin**: Increased risk of anemia-related complications, including fatigue, growth impairment, and organ dysfunction [^113F2svR].

- **High hemoglobin**: Increased risk of hyperviscosity, vaso-occlusive crises, stroke, and alloimmunization [^116638oW] [^115R9UcG].

- **Iron overload**: Chronic transfusions can lead to iron overload, necessitating careful monitoring and chelation therapy [^111whY3h].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **ASH 2020 guidelines**: Recommend maintaining hemoglobin > 9 g/dL and HbS < 30% for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with abnormal TCD velocities or prior stroke [^112zBYUq] [^1146KxAk].

- **NHLBI 2014 guidelines**: Recommend preoperative transfusion to achieve hemoglobin ~10 g/dL and maintaining HbS < 30% during chronic transfusion therapy [^113hKxp7] [^111whY3h].

- **ASH 2020 transfusion guidelines**: Emphasize individualized transfusion targets based on clinical context, genotype, and patient-specific factors [^113H17jf].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

Recent advances include **gene therapy** approaches (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of BCL11A) that induce fetal hemoglobin, potentially allowing higher hemoglobin targets without increasing viscosity [^1113CPR9] [^115dmzLD]. Agents such as voxelotor and pyruvate kinase activators increase hemoglobin and may shift targets upward in selected patients [^113bwrtN]. Ongoing studies are evaluating optimal hemoglobin targets with these therapies [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General target**: 8–10 g/dL for most clinical scenarios.

- **Chronic transfusion**: Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL and HbS < 30%.

- **Acute complications**: Hemoglobin ~10 g/dL with exchange transfusion to reduce HbS to 15–20%.

- **Avoid**: Hemoglobin > 10–12 g/dL to prevent hyperviscosity.

- **Individualize**: Based on genotype, age, clinical context, and comorbidities.

---

The hemoglobin target for patients with sickle cell disease is **8–10 g/dL**, with adjustments for clinical context. Chronic transfusion programs aim for **> 9 g/dL** with HbS < 30%, while acute complications may require ~10 g/dL with exchange transfusion. Avoid levels > 10–12 g/dL to prevent hyperviscosity, and tailor targets to genotype, age, and comorbidities.

Limitations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses

The quality of RCTs pooled by systematic reviews and meta-analyses are generally appraised through tools designed to assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence. These tools focus on important elements in the conduct of RCTs such as concealed allocation, blinding, random allocation, selective reporting, statistical inconsistency (or heterogeneity), imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.

While these domains are important in the general context of reviewing RCTs, we identified key clinical differences in the RCTs comparing transfusion strategies. Some, including variability in the study setting, variability in the patient population, and variability in the timing of the outcome measure, apply to all systematic reviews. Four, however, are unique to this topic: (1) haemoglobin thresholds selected for transfusion, (2) the absolute difference of pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentrations, (3) time to randomisation (resulting in transfusion administered prior to randomisation), and (4) comparable transfusion dosing regimens.

### The wider perspective: barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low-and middle-income countries [^112PTcjs]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

The ASH recommends automated red cell exchange (RCE) for stroke and severe ACS in SCD. Automated RCE reduces the HbS level more rapidly, and in a more predictable manner, as compared to simple transfusion. Automated RCE is also euvolemic: with modern instrumentation, the patient's RBCs are removed, and donor RBCs are returned in a continuous manner, thus minimizing the risk of fluid overload (patients with SCD are at risk of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory failure). Furthermore, iron accumulation and hyperviscosity can be controlled through the adjustment of target parameters. Nonetheless, automated RCE remains the exception in LMICs. Barriers to its wider adoption include the need for specialized equipment, skilled personnel (i.e. with specialized training in apheresis), adequate vascular access (potentially necessitating central venous access) and a requirement for a greater number of RBCs as compared to other RBC transfusion modalities (e.g. 4–10 units of RBCs for RCE as compared to 1–3 units for an adult undergoing simple transfusion). As such, the British Society of Haematology recommends that all hospitals that treat patients with SCD should have the capability to perform manual exchange, asserting that this may be life‐saving in emergent situations. However, automated RCE remains the preferred approach. Manual exchange is enormously labour intensive, inefficient and — arguably — not amenable to high throughput treatment of large numbers of patients with SCD. Furthermore, acceptance of suboptimal practices impedes progress towards the standard of care.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common, severe genetic blood disorder. Current pharmacotherapies are partially effective and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with immune toxicities. Genome editing of patient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to reactivate fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in erythroid progeny offers an alternative potentially curative approach to treat SCD. Although the FDA released guidelines for evaluating genome editing risks, it remains unclear how best to approach pre-clinical assessment of genome-edited cell products. Here, we describe rigorous pre-clinical development of a therapeutic γ-globin gene promoter editing strategy that supported an investigational new drug application cleared by the FDA. We compared γ-globin promoter and BCL11A enhancer targets, identified a potent HbF-inducing lead candidate, and tested our approach in mobilized CD34 + hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) from SCD patients. We observed efficient editing, HbF induction to predicted therapeutic levels, and reduced sickling. With single-cell analyses, we defined the heterogeneity of HbF induction and HBG1/HBG2 transcription. With CHANGE-seq for sensitive and unbiased off-target discovery followed by targeted sequencing, we did not detect off-target activity in edited HSPCs. Our study provides a blueprint for translating new ex vivo HSC genome editing strategies toward clinical trials for treating SCD and other blood disorders.

### Measures to reduce red cell use in patients with sickle cell disease requiring red cell exchange during a blood shortage [^111Xjxu4]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created major disruptions in health care delivery, including a severe blood shortage. The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.

Baseline HbF levels dictate final HbF levels

There is a wide variation in baseline HbF levels in patients with SCD and even in the general population, reflecting the influence of various genetic polymorphisms on the regulation of this locus. Even if a molecular targeted therapy produces similar rates of increase in HbF% (the percentage of total hemoglobin that is HbF) in all patients, the final HbF% will be dictated by the level at which HbF% began. Moreover, in clinical trials we have conducted with DNMT1-depleting decitabine, we have noticed a slightly lower slope to the rate of increase in HbF% in SCD patients with lower HbF% at baseline. Fortunately and importantly, however, HbF induced by this epigenetic strategy was well-distributed among RBC, and the rates of increase of HbF-enriched RBC (F-cells) was actually higher in patients with low F-cells at baseline.,

At some time-point after starting therapy, F-cells entering the circulation are matched by a similar number of F-cells leaving the circulation, producing plateaus in HbF% and F-cell%.

PREOPERATIVE TRANSFUSIONS

Background

In general, the goal of transfusing red blood cells preoperatively in patient with SCD is to increase hemoglobin, decrease the percent of HbS, and suppress erythropoiesis. Unlike in the general population, the need for transfusion is really geared toward decreasing HbS% and less about concerns about blood loss and anemia.

In 1995, Vichinsky et alpublished a large prospective study involving 551 patients and 604 operations. Patients were randomized to receive the "aggressive" regimen aimed at a preoperative hemoglobin goal of 10 g/dL and HbS% < 30, or "conservative" regimen aimed at a hemoglobin goal of 10 g/dL without a HbS% goal. Patients received HbSS-negative blood and leukorerduced blood if there was a history of prior febrile transfusion reaction. The study found no significant differences in intraoperative serious blood loss, postoperative ACS, or postoperative painful crisis in the aggressive versus conservative transfusion treatment groups. The investigators did, however, find a significant increase in new alloantibody formation and hemolytic transfusion reactions in the aggressive transfusion arm.

### Iron metabolism in sickle cell disease patients undergoing chronic red blood cell exchange: a delicate homeostasis in balance [^1116M9f5]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited haemoglobinopathy associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Automated red blood cell exchange (aRCE) plays a key role in managing SCD, eliciting both therapeutic and prophylactic effects. The ideal post-apheresis Ht target for chronic aRCE treatment is not yet unanimously recognized, as well as iron homeostasis can be different among patients. Ross et al. reported their experience on the chronic management of SCD patients undergoing aRCE with a final post-exchange Ht higher than the value commonly adopted, analysing red blood cell transfusion requirements and iron-related outcomes in the study population.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: what's new? [^114dNYwu]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

RCE with or without IHD for chronically transfused patients with SCD (recommendation 7)

The 2020 ASH SCD transfusion support guidelines suggested red cell exchange (RCE) over simple transfusion for patients requiring chronic transfusion therapy as it minimizes iron accumulation and can improve maintenance of the target HbS percentage. Isovolemic hemodilution (IHD) RCE is a procedure available in which, before the RCE, the patient undergoes an RBC depletion with concurrent volume replacement with normal saline or 5% albumin. The intent of IHD-RCE, also known as depletion exchange, is to decrease the number of RBC units needed to attain the target HbS percentage. The ASH guideline panel was unable to provide a recommendation for IHD-RCE vs conventional RCE because of a lack of evidence suggesting the impact of IHD-RCE on RBC unit utilization was superior. Since the 2020 ASH guidelines were finalized, a French study of 50 patients reported a 16% reduction of RBC units when comparing IHD-RCE to standard RCE (average requirement decreased from 13 to 11 units). All patients underwent IHD-RCE every 2 months to maintain the HbS < 50% and unit savings were calculated from the RBC unit number required by the instrument software to perform standard RCE. RBC unit savings may occur with IHD-RCE when patients require large volume procedures, but studies are needed to determine blood unit utilization for patients who require RCE to maintain the HbS < 30%. In addition, the 2020 ASH guidelines panel highlighted a need for further studies evaluating the safety of IHD-RCE in patients with chronically transfused SCD. Since its report, a single institution study reported on the incidence of RCE adverse events and found no association between the use of IHD-RCE and procedural adverse events. Despite this report, more investigation is needed to determine long-term impact of IHD-RCE compared with conventional RCE on neurologic outcomes.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^115xWogU]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

4.6 Specificity vs biology

We tend to think in terms of "sickle specific" pathology. Is there such a thing? Clearly, there are unique (RBC sickling) plus other (hemolysis) disease‐causing inputs. Nonetheless, what we observe are, for the most part, "pre‐programmed" and understood patterns of tissue responses to injury. Are we taking full advantage of the vast trove of data residing within the general biomedical literature?

4.7 Pain vs severity

Therapeutics testing has emphasized interventional benefit for inferred markers of pain perception, the most challenging endpoint that could be devised. While pain frequency may correlate with mortality, 19 this proves neither that pain causes mortality nor that treating pain will benefit mortality. Can we develop a more robust definition of severity that is both pathobiologically meaningful and quantifiable?

4.8 Challenge: Extant biomarker data are inadequate

An operational definition of robustness would rely, at least in part, on measured biomarkers. Unfortunately, biomarker data collected to date in SCA are of limited value because measurements usually have been obtained at a single time point, without stringent remoteness from acute influences, and often in subjects already experiencing a complication of interest.

Such associations can, with equal plausibility, be a measure of: (a) the activity level of a core pathogenic process; or (b) simple presence — but not cause — of the complication; or (c) concurrent presence of additional, but unrelated, complications — that may be known or unknown; or (d) adaptive or maladaptive responses that are not pathogenic; or (e) adaptive or maladaptive responses that do contribute to pathogenesis; or (f) fortuitous occurrence. This ambiguity does not foster utility.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease — secondary prevention after ischemic stroke: For children with HbSS or HbSβº thalassemia and a history of prior ischemic stroke, the ASH guideline panel recommends blood transfusion goals for secondary stroke prevention of increasing the hemoglobin above 9 g/dL at all times and maintaining the HbS level at < 30% of total hemoglobin until the time of the next transfusion. For adults and children with SCD, moyamoya syndrome, and a history of stroke or TIA, the ASH guideline panel suggests evaluation for revascularization surgery in addition to regular blood transfusion therapy.

Regarding medical management for sickle cell disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute complications, acute chest syndrome, NHLBI 2014 guidelines recommend to give simple blood transfusion (10 mL/kg of RBCs) to persons with symptomatic ACS whose hemoglobin concentration is > 1.0 g/dL below baseline; if baseline hemoglobin is ≥ 9 g/dL, simple blood transfusion may not be required.

Red blood cell intrinsic targets

The emerging disease-modifying approaches to SCD that target intrinsic characteristics of RBC are outlined in Online Supplementary Table S1 and discussed below.

Targeting HbS polymerization through the induction of HbF

Several recently developed agents aim to reduce deoxy-HbS polymerization, the root cause of SCD pathology, through delayed deoxygenation of HbS, reduced intracellular HbS concentration (via cellular hydration), or induction of the anti-sickling HbF. Hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor with HbF-inducing properties, is the paradigmatic HbF-inducing agent and was the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults and children with SCD. Hydroxyurea induces HbF and increases RBC volume, thereby reducing the likelihood of HbS polymerization. Hydroxyurea also decreases neutrophil and platelet counts and increases plasma nitric oxide levels, and is overall associated with decreased morbidity and improved mortality. The 2014 NHLBI guidelines state that hydroxyurea therapy should be initiated in adults with severe SCD, especially when quality of life is affected, and offered as a prophylactic treatment in young children with sickle cell anemia. Novel studies assessing the benefits of hydroxyurea are evaluating individualized pharmacokinetic-based dosing strategies (NCT03789591), the safety and feasibility of adding hydroxyurea to simple transfusions for stroke prevention (NCT03644953), and using patient navigators to reduce barriers to availability and non-adherence (NCT02197845).

### A phase 1 / 2 trial of HQK-1001, an oral fetal globin inducer, in sickle cell disease [^112WMZGg]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Therapeutics which reduce the pathology in sickle cell syndromes are needed, particularly noncytotoxic therapeutics. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α₂ γ₂) is established as a major regulator of disease severity; increased HbF levels correlate with milder clinical courses and improved survival. Accordingly, sodium dimethylbutyrate (HQK-1001), an orally-bioavailable, promoter-targeted fetal globin gene-inducing agent, was evaluated in a randomized, blinded, dose-ranging Phase I/II trial in 24 adult patients with HbSS or S/β thalassemia, to determine safety and tolerability of three escalating dose levels. The study therapeutic was administered once daily for two 6-week cycles, with a two-week interim dose holiday. Twenty-one patients completed the study. Five patients received study drug at 10 or 20 mg/kg doses, seven patients received study drug at 30 mg/kg/dose, and 4 patients received placebo. HQK-1001 was well-tolerated with no unexpected drug-related adverse events; a dose-limiting toxicity was not identified. Plasma drug levels were sustained above targeted levels for 24 hr. Increases in HbF above baseline were observed particularly with 30 mg/kg/day doses; in five of seven treated patients, a mean absolute increase in HbF of 0.2 g/dl and a mean increase in total hemoglobin (Hgb) of 0.83 g/dl above baseline were observed, whereas no increases occurred in placebo-treated controls. These findings of favorable PK profiles, tolerability, early rises in HbF, and total Hgb indicate that trials of longer duration appear warranted to more definitively evaluate the therapeutic potential of HQK-1001 in sickle cell disease.

### A scientific renaissance: novel drugs in sickle cell disease [^114r5VgQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

We have entered an era of exploding interest in therapeutics for sickle cell disease. The expansion in our understanding of sickle cell disease pathophysiology has enhanced the range of potential therapeutic targets. From induction of fetal hemoglobin to antiadhesion molecules, we are potentially on the cusp of making life-altering modifications for individuals with sickle cell disease. This disease population cannot afford to let the current momentum wane. Studies exploring combinations of therapies affecting multiple steps in the pathophysiology and exploring novel and clinically relevant outcomes are incumbent.

Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in sickle cell disease with chronic kidney disease — conclusions and research needs indicate that there is very low certainty evidence for a net health benefit relative to patient-important outcomes, that combination therapy is justified based on the allowance for more aggressive dosing of hydroxyurea and the safety profile of combination therapy, and that additional research is needed including studies to identify appropriate ESA dosing and risks/benefits, trials to examine synergistic effects of ESAs with hydroxyurea on hemoglobin level and patient-important outcomes, and studies to determine hemoglobin thresholds for initiating, continuing, and holding ESA administration when combined with hydroxyurea.

### Don't administer packed red blood cells in a young healthy… [^112fTavQ]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

The hemoglobin transfusion threshold used in multiple studies has varied from 6. 0 to
10. 0 g/dL. The optimal hemoglobin/hematocrit criterion for transfusion remains controversial in several clinical settings. Nevertheless, compared with higher hemoglobin thresholds, a lower hemoglobin threshold is associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of hospital stay. Hospital mortality remains lower in patients randomized to a lower hemoglobin threshold for transfusion versus those randomized to a higher hemoglobin threshold. The decision to transfuse should be based on a combination of both clinical and hemodynamic parameters.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin S percent threshold to prevent severe pain events: a secondary analysis of the SIT trial [^114WYa8i]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

As a secondary analysis of the SIT trial with a sample size of 90 participants, our results need confirming in a prospective trial to determine the optimal maximum Hb S level to prevent recurrent severe vaso-occlusive pain. However, our results provide preliminary evidence that the maximum Hb S percent threshold for primary and secondary prevention of strokes may not be the same as for preventing acute pain episodes requiring hospitalization. A significant limitation is that 83% of the participants did not have any serious vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization, indicating that pain events occur at relatively low frequency in children receiving regular transfusions.

In this secondary analysis of the SIT trial, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, for the first time that regular RBC transfusions to achieve a mean Hb S level < 30% were as effective as a mean Hb S level ≥ 30% in decreasing the incidence rate of severe acute vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization. The 95% confidence intervals are wide for the pain incidence, suggesting that the lower threshold of < 30% may be beneficial or the higher threshold < 50% may be of no benefit (supplemental Material). Given the broad confidence intervals, the Hb S < 30% may be beneficial in decreasing severe acute vaso-occlusive pain event incidence rate. Thus, for patients started on regular blood transfusions to decrease their severe vaso-occlusive pain incidence rate, we would start with a goal of a maximum Hb S level of < 50%. If the participant has a beneficial effect with a concomitant decrease in the severe acute vaso-occlusive pain event incidence rate, we will not lower the therapeutic goal of the Hb S to < 30%; however, if the patient had no significant change in the severe acute vaso-occlusive pain event incidence rate after 3 to 6 months, we would decrease the threshold to a maximum level of < 30%. Our results only apply to secondary prevention of acute vaso-occlusive pain events in children with sickle cell disease.

### Recommendations on RBC transfusion support in children with hematologic and oncologic diagnoses from the pediatric critical care transfusion and anemia expertise initiative [^117ACCuu]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To present the recommendations and supporting evidence for RBC transfusions in critically ill children with hematologic and oncologic disease from the Pediatric Critical Care Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative.

Design

Consensus conference series of international, multidisciplinary experts in RBC transfusion management of critically ill children.

Methods

The panel of 38 experts developed evidence-based and, when evidence was lacking, expert-based clinical recommendations and research priorities for RBC transfusions in critically ill children. The hematologic/oncologic subgroup included seven experts. Electronic searches were conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from 1980 to May 2017. Agreement was obtained using the Research and Development/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method.

Results

The hematologic/oncologic subgroup developed 14 recommendations (seven clinical, seven research); all achieved greater than 80% agreement. In patients with sickle cell disease, Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative recommends: 1) RBC transfusion to achieve a target hemoglobin concentration of 10g/dL rather than hemoglobin of less than 30% prior to surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia and 2) exchange transfusion over simple (nonexchange) transfusion if the child's condition is deteriorating (based on clinical judgment), otherwise a simple, nonexchange RBC transfusion is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations on transfusion thresholds for patients with sickle cell disease prior to minor procedures, with acute stroke or with pulmonary hypertension. For patients with oncologic disease or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, a hemoglobin concentration of 7–8g/dL is recommended. Due to lack of evidence, research is needed to clarify the appropriate transfusion thresholds in these patients.

Conclusions

Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative developed specific pediatric recommendations regarding RBC transfusion management in critically ill children with sickle cell disease, oncologic disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant and recommendations to help guide future research priorities.

Sickle cell disease consensus conclusions — care gaps and aims are summarized: sickle cell disease is a historically neglected condition, which has resulted in limitations in evidence generation to produce care standards, while most children with SCD in high-resource settings now live to adulthood, fragmented or inconsistent screening and limited treatment and management lead to greater morbidity, the need for consistent follow-up and long-term care engagement with an SCD specialist is clear but the implementation is lacking and quality assurance has not been performed, and using a modified Delphi method these clinician-led consensus statements facilitate more rapid development and dissemination of recommendations, with continued disparities requiring collaboration and research to improve outcomes for all individuals living with SCD.

### Genetic reversal of the globin switch concurrently modulates both fetal and sickle hemoglobin and reduces red cell sickling [^112XTTHo]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Genetic targeting of BCL11A leads to a large induction of HbF determined in single RBCs

Untransfused BCL shmiR subjects experienced an increase in overall fetal hemoglobin content to a median of 27.9% (Table 1) thus accounting for ~30% of the total cell hemoglobin content. HbF mass was quantified in individual RBCs using a recently developed flow cytometry protocol, and these measurements showed that the HbF response was driven by an increase in the fraction of RBCs with ≥ 10 pg HbF (Fig. 1a). HbF content in BCL shmiR stabilized ~6 months after treatment. Among Untransfused BCL shmiR subjects, a median of 50% of RBCs contained a minimum of 10 pg of HbF as compared to a median of 43% in HU-High Responders (p = 0.1, Fig. 1b). The 10 pg threshold has been postulated as a therapeutic goalbecause it would reduce polymerization tendency in RBCs with MCHC ~ 33 g/dL when exposed to oxygen tension high enough such that > 50% of the hemoglobin is saturated. Higher levels of HbF would typically be required when MCHC is higher or oxygen tension is lower. Polymerization in a cell is exquisitely sensitive to the intracellular HbS concentration, making HbS concentration a better predictor of cell sickling than HbS mass. RBCs with high HbF content will typically have lower levels of HbS and the HbS may be less likely to polymerize at a given oxygen concentration due to the anti-polymerization characteristics of HbF. We, therefore, compared the fractions of RBCs with HbS% above a specified threshold of 70% in the two cohorts. This fraction was inferred from the proportion of RBCs with HbF content lower than 30% of total MCH ignoring the minor hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) fraction. Figure 1c shows that the Untransfused BCL shmiR subjects had fewer RBCs with high HbS% than subjects in the HU-treated cohort (p < 0.004). To define this cellular-scale difference more precisely, we next compared the Untransfused BCL shmiR cohort to HU patients who had achieved blood HbF% > 20 (HU High Responders). Compared to this HU High Responders cohort with similar HbF content (median HbF = 27.0% for HU High Responders vs. median HbF = 27.9% for Untransfused BCL shmiR, p = 0.25), the Untransfused BCL shmiR patients had fewer RBCs with more than 70% HbS (Fig. 1c), consistent with the expected effects of reversal of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch.

Discussion

We report single-cell measurements of HbF, HbS, and oxygen-dependent Hb polymer and find that post-transcriptional silencing of BCL11A using a lentivirus vector expressing a shmiR reverses the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch and induces RBCs in patients that have increased HbF content and lowered HbS content. Untransfused BCL shmiR subjects have higher HbF content per F cell and more RBCs that are protected from polymerization and sickling at low physiologic oxygen tension than RBCs from a cohort of highly responsive hydroxyurea-treated patients who achieved similar levels of total HbF%. Across the range of total blood HbF% found in the Untransfused BCL shmiR cohort, we find evidence that HbF%-per-F-cell is higher in Untransfused BCL shmiR subjects, and more RBCs are protected from polymerization at low physiologic oxygen tensions.

This study focuses on the cellular and molecular consequences of the reversal of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch. While the early safety and clinical outcomes have been reported, the analysis reported here compared the cellular and molecular effects of treatment to those for HU in a cohort highly responsive to that treatment. The mechanism of action of HU has been hypothesized to involve differential effects on CFUe and BFUe which express significantly different levels of HbF, but is not fully defined, and further studies with RNA sequence analysis or other molecular data are needed to determine to what extent it acts via reversal of the fetal to adult switch. Since many patients with effective HbF induction on HU continue to experience vaso-occlusive events – and since the polymerization of deoxygenated Hb in sickle cells is highly dependent on HbS concentration, the combinatorial effect of increasing the HbF content while coordinately decreasing HbS content by targeting the physiologic switch is noteworthy and suggests the value of a direct comparison of the clinical courses of patients treated with gene therapy targeting BCL11A and patients treated with HU who are optimally responsive to HU with adjustment for other potential confounders including patient age, gender, and genotype.

### Sickle cell anaemia therapy in 2025 [^116KrwS8]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients might also benefit from developing other oral agents to increase fetal haemoglobin, as noted in a recent commentary in Science, accompanying the report of a potential new relevant epigenetic pathway. We now understand that such agents are only likely to be efficacious if they can achieve fairly pan‐cellular levels of fetal haemoglobin, above about 25% of red cell haemoglobin species, at acceptably safe dosing. Studies of other ways to directly improve the flow of sickle haemoglobin polymer‐containing cells in the microcirculation would also seem to deserve high priority. Continued primary attention to the many other abnormal phenomena that can be detected in the blood of sickle cell patients may be much less likely to result in the strong therapeutic results that are more related to interfering with the primary pathophysiological mechanisms.

Indeed, use of pain, that is, vaso‐occlusive crises (VOC's), as the prime or even only parameter for judging success of an agent for approval as a medication, in contrast to measures of organ damage or mortality itself has not been validated. First, persistence of pain has been noted even in individuals apparently genetically 'cured' of their disease. Second, it is not clear that various clinical attributes always track together or that lowering the frequency or duration of VOC's will correct many of the other serious manifestations of this disease. Further studies on the relationships among these disease manifestations — stroke, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, renal failure, etc. — with VOCs are also very much needed in developing new therapeutic regimens. The results of such studies may suggest that multiple therapies be used in combination for any one patient or at different times in their lifespan.

Lastly, and perhaps also most relevant to current academic studies of many diseases, it is clear that improvements in stem cell therapies and gene therapies are occurring rapidly, especially with new tools such as CRISPR, and will ultimately change the very nature of many medical treatments, especially among genetic diseases. However, these are currently all very difficult and expensive approaches, whose long‐term safety, clinical durability and general applicability will take, even after all the work of the last several decades, many more years to clarify. The research community should balance emphasis on these long‐term 'curative' approaches with focus on treatments that are likely to be applicable in the very near future for a much larger fraction of patients even in resource‐rich countries, if not the world, as current estimates for sickle cell births are close to 500 000 per year.

### Transfusion management in sickle cell disease [^113DrgnE]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most commonly inherited hemoglobinopathy in the United States. Blood transfusion is a critical part of the multidisciplinary approach necessary in the management of SCD; however, blood transfusions are not without complications. The successful use of transfusion as a treatment strategy in SCD requires the critical review and knowledge of transfusion methods, generally accepted indications, clinical situations in which transfusion generally is not considered, the selection of blood products, and strategies to prevent transfusion-related complications.

### Correction of the sickle cell disease mutation in human hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells [^112AexLE]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a single point mutation in the seventh codon of the β-globin gene. Site-specific correction of the sickle mutation in hematopoietic stem cells would allow for permanent production of normal red blood cells. Using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to flank the sickle mutation, we demonstrate efficient targeted cleavage at the β-globin locus with minimal off-target modification. By co-delivering a homologous donor template (either an integrase-defective lentiviral vector or a DNA oligonucleotide), high levels of gene modification were achieved in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Modified cells maintained their ability to engraft NOD/SCID/IL2rγ(null) mice and to produce cells from multiple lineages, although with a reduction in the modification levels relative to the in vitro samples. Importantly, ZFN-driven gene correction in CD34(+) cells from the bone marrow of patients with SCD resulted in the production of wild-type hemoglobin tetramers.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that leads to significant lifetime morbidity and early mortality. An enhanced understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease has elucidated novel therapeutic targets for which new therapies are in development. In order to increase the therapeutic landscape, it has been important to identify the blood vessel and more specifically the endothelium as the target organ in this complex disease. Through this lens, we present a review of new anti-adhesion therapies for SCD in development. The long-term promise of multimodal therapies for SCD is finally on the horizon.

### Management of the dialysis patient with sickle cell disease [^112nVooN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

While patients with sickle cell disease currently constitute a very small minority of the US dialysis population (0.1%), there is anticipated growth of this group as the life expectancy of those with sickle cell disease (SCD) increases. SCD patients suffer a high burden of morbidity, which is enhanced by the presence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of SCD and the basic tenets of its management with focus on the dialysis patient with SCD. Anemia in dialysis patients with SCD is a unique challenge. The hemoglobin target in SCD dialysis patients with ESRD should not exceed 10 g/dl. SCD patients, and particularly those on dialysis, are likely to be poorly responsive to erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy and might be at increased risk for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) with ESA. Iron chelation and hydroyxurea therapy require special considerations and modifications in dialysis patients with SCD. There are theoretical advantages to both hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in SCD patients. With HD, there is a secure vascular access available for both standard and exchange blood transfusion in patients who need them. With PD, the absence of an acute rise in hematocrit with ultrafiltration (UF) might offer lower risk of VOC. During VOC, reduction in UF goals should be considered but administration of intravenous fluids should be reserved only for clear cases of volume depletion. Finally, renal transplantation appears to confer a survival advantage to dialysis in SCD patients and should be pursued when possible.

Chronic transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease — mechanistic effects and targets: Chronic scheduled transfusion of packed red blood cells is effective in reducing most complications of SCD by decreasing both the burden of sickle erythrocytes and the hemolytic rate. The HbS level can be reduced to less than 50% within weeks by simple transfusions or within hours by erythrocytapheresis, and a goal hemoglobin concentration of 10–12 g/dl is often attainable via chronic transfusion therapy. The guideline reports a systematic review to identify studies pertinent to management decisions for patients who have SCD and either RHC-confirmed PH or an increased risk for mortality (i.e. TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s or NT-pro-BNP ≥ 160 pg/ml).

Sickle cell disease — acute ischemic neurologic deficit transfusion strategy specifies immediate hemoglobin augmentation and exchange. For children and adults presenting with a focal neurological deficit suggestive of an ischemic event, including a TIA, increasing the hemoglobin level with a red blood cell transfusion is stated as the best option to improve oxygen delivery to the brain. If the hemoglobin level is less than ~8.5 g/dL, the panel recommends increasing the hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL with a simple transfusion within 2 hours after presentation, and after the hemoglobin has reached ~10.0 g/dL with simple transfusion or if the baseline hemoglobin level is greater than ~8.5 g/dL, the panel recommends an automated-exchange red blood cell transfusion (apheresis). The relationship between hemoglobin and oxygen delivery notes that the maximal hemoglobin (Hbmax) to deliver oxygen transport in sickle cell patients is 10 to 11 g/dL and that when the HbS level is low (∼20%), a higher hemoglobin level (such as 13 g/dL) may be beneficial; red cell apheresis can rapidly lower the HbS to levels that maximize oxygen delivery.

### Red blood cell transfusion-AABB guidelines… [^115p6CqZ]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective To provide recommendations for use of red blood cell transfusion in adults and children. Evidence Review Standards for trustworthy guidelines were followed, including using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods, managing conflicts of interest, and making values and preferences explicit. Evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials was reviewed. Findings For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL. For pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds. For most patient populations, results provided moderate quality evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes.

Recommendation 1: for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL. In accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most trials, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7. 5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for those undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Recommendation 2: for hospitalized adult patients with hematologic and oncologic disorders, the panel suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL.

Recommendation 3: for critically ill children and those at risk of critical illness who are hemodynamically stable and without a hemoglobinopathy, cyanotic cardiac condition, or severe hypoxemia, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL. Recommendation 4: for hemodynamically stable children with congenital heart disease, the international panel suggests a transfusion threshold that is based on the cardiac abnormality and stage of surgical repair: 7 g/dL, 9 g/dL, or 7 to 9 g/dL.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^1153nkV6]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transfusion remains a central intervention for sickle cell disease (SCD), with most patients receiving one or more transfusions by adulthood. Prospective, randomized clinical trials support transfusion for primary and secondary stroke prevention, but for many other indications, treatment is based on expert consensus. Guidelines on transfusion management for SCD are limited by availability of welldesigned studies. Thus, many recommendations are based on low or moderate quality evidence or expert consensus, as well as the balance of benefits and harm for any given intervention. While transfusion therapy reduces SCD-associated morbidity and mortality, attention to prevention and management of alloimmunization, hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload is critical.

Regular blood transfusion programs — implementation and recommendation strength: Despite no randomized trial directly comparing regular transfusion targets, the panel made a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence for children meeting HbS level < 30% and minimum hemoglobin > 9.0 g/dL, citing large differences in stroke rates favoring transfusion over hydroxyurea and no treatment for secondary prevention. Family and logistical burdens are highlighted, with transfusions typically monthly and often requiring 2 visits, and the panel, including 2 patient representatives, stated that family preferences and the inconvenience and financial resources associated with regular transfusion should be considered.

### In vivo measurement of RBC survival in patients with sickle cell disease before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^113SeN7s]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Improved but continued hemolysis is described in other clinical gene therapy studies, and may vary in trials that target HbF induction based on F cell and HbF percentage. HbF induction is the primary target in gene editing trials to date given the protective antisickling property of HbFand the ability to easily target genes that regulate HbF expression. The blood concentration of HbF, or the number of cells with detectable HbF (F-cells), is not representative, however, of the amount of HbF per cell. The distribution of HbF can vary such that a proportion of F-cells have insufficient concentrations of HbF to inhibit HbS polymerization.F-cells are measured by flow cytometry and can detect cells with around 6 pg of HbF, but deoxyHbS polymerization is prevented at physiologic venous and capillary O₂ saturations of 40% to 70% when HbF/F cell is 9 to 12 pg. When HbF levels are ∼30%, as is commonly seen in patients with HbS-hereditary persistence of HbF, the number of protected cells approaches 70% and a longer delay time is observed. However, when HbF levels fall < 30%, the distribution of HbF per F cell can vary greatly even if the mean HbF is constant. Unlike the heterocellular distribution and variable clinical response observed with HU, HbF induction after gene editing is more likely to be pancellular when editing efficiencies are high and engraftment is achieved after myeloablation. If the distribution is heterocellular and patients continue to have hemolysis and/or vaso-occlusive events after HbF gene editing, combination treatment with drugs that might broaden the distribution of F cells or increase the amount of HbF in unprotected F cells with HbF < 10 pg per cell, such as with HU, might be the most appropriate therapy to allow sustained, protective HbF induction. The goal, however, should be to maximize HbF per F cell after editing rather than relying on mean HbF or F-cell percentage as a target outcome measure because it erroneously assumes that all F cells contain the same amount of HbF. Biotin labeling after gene therapy is a feasible method to answer questions surrounding RBC lifespan after genetic modification of HSCs, including if the therapy results in pancellular or heterocellular distribution of therapeutic protein and, if heterocellular, what threshold will have an adequate reduction in sickling after deoxygenation to reverse clinical phenotype.

### Sickle cell anemia: targeting the role of fetal hemoglobin in therapy [^114C5iKZ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anemia results from the single amino acid substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the beta-chain owing to a nucleotide defect that causes the production of abnormal beta-chains in hemoglobin S. Abnormal hemoglobin chains form polymers in the deoxygenated state, leading to the characteristic sickle cells. The polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S accounts for the pathologic changes in sickle cell disease. The main-stay of therapy in sickle cell disease aims to reduce the amount of sickled hemoglobin present through the prevention of polymerization and reversal of this process. One way of discouraging polymerization is to increase the level of fetal hemoglobin, which because of its high oxygen affinity, does not participate in the polymerization process. Fetal hemoglobin production may be induced pharmacologically or by the use of gene therapy and genetic engineering techniques.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^115R9UcG]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Goals of transfusion

Red cell transfusion improves oxygen-carrying capacity and symptoms of anemia. For SCD, it may be used to increase a patient's hematocrit and/or to reduce endogenous production of red cells containing hemoglobin S (HbS). Episodic transfusions are used for preoperative preparation or treatment of acute complications. Chronic transfusion therapy is utilized when the goal is to sustain a lower HbS level, such as for primary or secondary stroke prevention. A standard goal is to maintain HbS levels ≤ 30% or to raise the hemoglobin to 10–12 g/dL depending on the transfusion indication. Raising the hemoglobin to levels greater than 10–12 g/dL is generally avoided to limit the risk of hyperviscosity.

### Oxygen-dependent flow of sickle trait blood as an in vitro therapeutic benchmark for sickle cell disease treatments [^111NDk8P]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Although homozygous sickle cell disease is often clinically severe, the corresponding heterozygous state, sickle cell trait, is almost completely benign despite the fact that there is only a modest difference in sickle hemoglobin levels between the two conditions. In both conditions, hypoxia can lead to polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, changes in red cell mechanical properties, and impaired blood flow. Here, we test the hypothesis that differences in the oxygen-dependent rheological properties in the two conditions might help explain the difference in clinical phenotypes. We use a microfluidic platform that permits quantification of blood rheology under defined oxygen conditions in physiologically sized microchannels and under physiologic shear rates. We find that, even with its lower sickle hemoglobin concentration, sickle trait blood apparent viscosity increases with decreasing oxygen tension and may stop flowing under completely anoxic conditions, though far less readily than the homozygous condition. Sickle cell trait blood flow becomes impaired at significantly lower oxygen tension than sickle cell disease. We also demonstrate how sickle cell trait can serve as a benchmark for sickle cell disease therapies. We characterize the rheological effects of exchange transfusion therapy by mixing sickle blood with nonsickle blood and quantifying the transfusion targets for sickle hemoglobin composition below which the rheological response resembles sickle trait. These studies quantify the differences in blood flow phenotypes of sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait, and they provide a potentially powerful new benchmark for evaluating putative therapies in vitro.

### Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: an overview of cochrane reviews [^111Xy4x5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.

Methods

We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.

Main Results

We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short- or long-term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease-modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long-term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals). In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low-quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event. Short-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low- to low-quality evidence)In people undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low-quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very-low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low- to moderate-quality evidence)In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long-term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate-quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low-quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low-quality evidence). In children and adolescents already receiving long-term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long-term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low-quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very-low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no difference in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence)In pregnant women, long-term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low-quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related complications or transfusion reactions (very-low quality evidence).RBC transfusion versus disease-modifying agents (hydroxyurea) (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence)For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease-modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very-low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence). Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very-low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence). Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low-quality evidence)In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides support from two high-quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population. This overview highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD-related serious adverse events and quality of life.

### Changing the clinical paradigm of hydroxyurea treatment for sickle cell anemia through precision medicine [^116ZCUnc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common and devastating inherited blood disorder, affecting millions of people across the world. Without treatment, SCA results in tremendous morbidity and early mortality. Hydroxyurea is the primary and most well-established pharmacologic therapy with proven benefits to ameliorate the clinical course of SCA, primarily due to its ability to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which prevents sickling of red blood cells. The optimal induction of HbF depends upon selection and maintenance of the proper dose that maximizes benefits and minimizes toxicity. Due to the significant interpatient variability in hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dosing, most patients treated with hydroxyurea receive suboptimal doses and have only modest treatment responses. Recognizing this variability, using a precision medicine approach, we developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized dosing model for children with SCA, designed to optimize the hydroxyurea dose and clinical response. We utilize novel laboratory methods and a sparse sampling strategy requiring only 10 μL of blood collected 15 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes after a test dose. We use Bayesian adaptive control to estimate hydroxyurea exposure and to select an individual, optimal starting dose. This dosing model has resulted in HbF responses > 30–40%, levels beyond what is achieved with traditional weight-based dosing and trial and error dose escalation. This hydroxyurea dosing strategy, if widely implemented, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm of hydroxyurea therapy and improve outcomes for the millions of patients with SCA across the world.

### An integrated therapeutic approach to sickle cell disease management beyond infancy [^116LVKQC]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydroxyurea, the first approved drug for sickle cell disease, decreases sickle hemoglobin polymerization by inducing fetal hemoglobin. Its effects in young children are excellent; responses in adults are variable and not curative. The goal of pharmacotherapy should not be disease "moderation" but reducing morbidity and mortality by diminishing both hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive events. This is best done by preventing sickle hemoglobin polymerization; if anti-polymerization treatment is insufficient, agents disrupting pathophysiologic pathways "downstream" of the sickle hemoglobin polymer should be added. We recommend that all patients should be started first on maximal doses of hydroxyurea. When the clinical and hematologic response to hydroxyurea is insufficient, as it is almost always in adults, we favor adding voxelotor, a hemoglobin-oxygen affinity-shifting agent that, likely in a pancellular distribution, decreases sickle hemoglobin polymerization. The P-selectin inhibitor crizanlizumab reduces sickle cell-endothelial interactions and can be used in patients with continued vaso-occlusive events. There is no physiologic reason that all three drugs could not be combined when the response to monotherapy or dual-drug therapy is poor. Drug therapy must be considered in the context of possibly "curative" cellular therapeutics and if needed, exchange transfusion programs.

### Revisiting anemia in sickle cell disease and finding the balance with therapeutic approaches [^113F2svR]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemolytic anemia and intermittent acute pain episodes are the 2 hallmark characteristics of sickle cell disease (SCD). Anemia in SCD not only signals a reduction of red cell mass and oxygen delivery, but also ongoing red cell breakdown and release of cell-free hemoglobin, which together contribute to a number of pathophysiological responses and play a key role in the pathogenesis of cumulative multiorgan damage. However, although anemia is clearly associated with many detrimental outcomes, it may also have an advantage in SCD in lowering risks of potential viscosity-related complications. Until recently, clinical drug development for SCD has predominantly targeted a reduction in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises as an endpoint, but increasingly, more attention is being directed toward addressing the contribution of chronic anemia to poor outcomes in SCD. This article aims to explore the complex pathophysiology and mechanisms of anemia in SCD, as well as the need to balance the benefits of raising hemoglobin levels with the potential risks of increasing blood viscosity, in the context of the current therapeutic landscape for anemia in SCD.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^112fU3sc]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

This is an exciting era of therapeutics development for sickle cell anemia (SCA). Yet, most resources have been focused upon single agents intended to target HbS polymerization or biology far along the pathobiologic vector. We suggest that, in between, there exists a "missing middle" that resides at the nexus of three opportunities: applying a multi‐agent regimen; using drugs already deployed in human general medicine; and strategically targeting a point of pathobiological vulnerability. In essence, we view this therapeutic space as one offering preventative benefit by targeting the sickle risk state rather than events.

We here develop this concept and describe a three‐drug example. Then, we address the practical challenges that face this approach, regardless of the targets or drugs one might favor. Our comments do reflect the belief that therapeutics development efforts should include agents that will be accessible to not only the ~15% of SCA patients who live in wealthier countries but also the ~85% who do not. 1 To us this means agents having as many as possible of the characteristics listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of an ideal drug for global application in SCA

Of course, this excludes emerging approaches dependent upon infusion and/or cell transfer and/or gene manipulation. We certainly do not argue that development of such advanced therapeutics be curtailed. Rather, we suggest that it only makes sense to concurrently devote resources to develop alternative approaches that would be better positioned for global application.

### Pyruvate kinase activators: targeting red cell metabolism in sickle cell disease [^117541Px]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization, red blood cell (RBC) sickling, chronic anemia, and vaso-occlusion are core to sickle cell disease (SCD) pathophysiology. Pyruvate kinase (PK) activators are a novel class of drugs that target RBC metabolism by reducing the buildup of the glycolytic intermediate 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) and increasing production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Lower 2,3-DPG level is associated with an increase in oxygen affinity and reduction in HbS polymerization, while increased RBC ATP may improve RBC membrane integrity and survival. There are currently 3 PK activators in clinical development for SCD: mitapivat (AG-348), etavopivat (FT-4202), and the second-generation molecule AG-946. Preclinical and clinical data from these 3 molecules demonstrate the ability of PK activators to lower 2,3-DPG levels and increase ATP levels in animal models and patients with SCD, as well as influence a number of potential pathways in SCD, including hemoglobin oxygen affinity, RBC sickling, RBC deformability, RBC hydration, inflammation, oxidative stress, hypercoagulability, and adhesion. Furthermore, early-phase clinical trials of mitapivat and etavopivat have demonstrated the safety and tolerability of PK activators in patients with SCD, and phase 2/3 trials for both drugs are ongoing. Additional considerations for this novel therapeutic approach include the balance between increasing hemoglobin oxygen affinity and tissue oxygen delivery, the cost and accessibility of these drugs, and the potential of multimodal therapy with existing and novel therapies targeting different disease mechanisms in SCD.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^113bwrtN]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The potential benefits of raising haemoglobin (Hb) in patients with haemolytic anaemia have been well established for sickle cell disease (SCD). Low Hb levels and increased intravascular haemolysis in patients with SCD are associated with increased risk of end‐organ damage, including cerebral vascular disease, kidney disease, pulmonary vasculopathy and early mortality. For the past several decades, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, hydroxycarbamide and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were used to increase Hb levels and treat other SCD‐related complications. Voxelotor, a recently approved treatment for patients with SCD, has been also shown to raise Hb in patients and improve markers of haemolysis. However, treatment with these therapies may cause some patients' Hb levels to exceed 100 g/l, raising concern about whole‐blood viscosity‐related complications. Anecdotal case reports have reported complications in patients with Hb exceeding 100 g/l when receiving transfusions for acute complications. As a result, treatment guidelines recommend avoiding increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l in patients receiving a RBC transfusion. However, the 100 g/l Hb threshold alone may not accurately reflect the risk of viscosity‐related complications with disease‐modifying therapies. The mechanisms whereby these therapies improve Hb levels differ substantially from that of RBC transfusion. Therefore, there is a need to revisit Hb treatment goals with disease‐modifying therapies.

### Knowledge insufficient: the management of haemoglobin SC disease [^1132gQdy]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although haemoglobin SC (HbSC) accounts for 30% of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States and United Kingdom, evidence-based guidelines for genotype specific management are lacking. The unique pathology of HbSC disease is complex, characterized by erythrocyte dehydration, intracellular sickling and increased blood viscosity. The evaluation and treatment of patients with HbSC is largely inferred from studies of SCD consisting mostly of haemoglobin SS (HbSS) patients. These studies are underpowered to allow definitive conclusions about HbSC. We review the pathophysiology of HbSC disease, including known and potential differences between HbSS and HbSC, and highlight knowledge gaps in HbSC disease management. Clinical and translational research is needed to develop targeted treatments and to validate management recommendations for efficacy, safety and impact on quality of life for people with HbSC.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in children and adults [^11337Lar]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — postapheresis targets and thresholds for exchange transfusion emphasize HbS percentage and hemoglobin limits to optimize oxygen delivery while avoiding viscosity-related complications. Evidence suggests that oxygen delivery to the brain in SCD is dependent not only on the total hemoglobin concentration, but also on the percentage of HbS, and the goal of red blood cell exchange with apheresis is to lower HbS while preventing an excessive rise in hemoglobin. Thresholds for postapheresis HbS percentage and hemoglobin level are typically set at 15% to 20% and 10 g/dL, respectively, and the HbS level of 15% to 20% allows a threshold of < 30% HbS to persist for ~4 weeks. When the HbS level is < 20%, the total hemoglobin level can generally be > 10 g/dL, up to ~12 to 13 g/dL, without concern for viscosity-related complications. When the hemoglobin level is < 5.0 g/dL, a simple transfusion to increase the total hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL may be required, and generally, red blood cell exchange with apheresis is not recommended for patients with SCD and hemoglobin levels < 5.0 g/dL.

### Understanding a transfusion plan | Thalassemia… [^1166oX39]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key facts about β thalassemia
- β thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder.
- People with β thalassemia cannot make enough of a protein called globin, an important part of the hemoglobin that is contained inside red blood cells.
- When not enough hemoglobin is made, there are fewer red blood cells in the bloodstream, so less oxygen reaches the organs and tissues that need it. This condition is called anemia. Target hemoglobin level The target hemoglobin level is the level that most people with β thalassemia need to ensure normal growth and puberty, to prevent fatigue, and to avoid problems with their spleen. For people receiving regular transfusions, the healthcare provider will monitor hemoglobin levels before each transfusion to make sure it does not fall below the target level. Healthcare providers may refer to this target hemoglobin level as the target. pretransfusion hemoglobin level.

In general, for the two types of beta thalassemia below, the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level is
- 9. 5–10. 5 g/dL for people with β thalassemia major
- 9. 0–10. 0 g/dL for people with hemoglobin E. Did you know. grams per deciliter, written g/dL. Timing of transfusions The transfusion plan also includes a schedule of how often the regular transfusions should occur. This schedule helps maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level and prevent complications for most people with β thalassemia. In general, regular transfusions take place
- Every 3 weeks in most older children and adults with β thalassemia major
- Every 4 weeks in younger children with β thalassemia major and most people with HbE β thalassemia. Additional considerations Healthcare providers also consider these questions when developing a transfusion plan for people with β thalassemia:

- Is their spleen intact.
- How much do they weigh.
- Do they have congestive heart failure.
- Are they severely fatigued.
- Do they have bone pain.
- Do they have pulmonary hypertension.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^116MJbEu]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

5 AN ACTION PLAN

Addressing these challenges will require leadership by the sickle field itself, as finding solutions will require motivation, expertise, investment and effort. Further, before we can persuade potential funders that this approach is rational and possible, as a field we need to persuade ourselves. We offer the following suggestions.

5.1 Prevailing perspectives

The three challenges we began with could be approached via educational opportunities. Our field's journal(s) could solicit scholarly essays on the risk state concept per se and on ways it could be defined, identified and quantified. Our society meetings could include educational fora that compare and contrast pathobiology of a SCA feature vs its analogue in general medicine (and do so vis à vis therapeutics). Published essays and scientific fora could suggest and defend clinical definitions of severity that are not dependent upon perception of pain perception.

5.2 Define the steady state

Our funding agencies should support stand‐alone studies designed to expose the character of the steady state. The necessary data can only derive from longitudinally measuring candidate biomarkers for any given subject, over sufficient time to establish ranges, relationships, reliability, and redundancies. This is necessary if biomarkers are to be used for defining and measuring the robustness of core pathobiology.

5.3 Establish a definition of core pathobiology "robustness"

Our societies and funding agencies could co‐sponsor a "think tank" on this topic. Deliberations should be recurring, data‐based, thoroughly rationalized, include multiple perspectives, and involve experts from other fields. Work product could include: prioritizing biological processes as targets, in terms of their contributions to core pathophysiology; identifying the best available bio‐physiological measures (including beyond blood sampling) obtainable in humans; and identifying parameters most likely to quantify specific process activity levels. While admittedly unlikely that a consensus would be achieved, the deliberations could be disseminated via publication and by dedicated fora at national meetings. This would foster awareness and discussion and perhaps provide guidance.

5.4 Consider risks vs benefits of drug options

Availability of vetted guidance could only be helpful. A working‐group with multi‐disciplinary expertise (including pharmacology) could perhaps generate vetted risk‐to‐benefit estimates for candidate drugs applied in the sickle context. Society meetings could include joint research‐clinical sessions structured to foster discussions about applicability of emerging research data. Such efforts could ease apprehensions.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: what's new? [^1162TBc6]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines for transfusion support for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD)included recommendations on specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload. The ASH Guideline Monitoring Expert Working Group conducted an updated literature search that did not identify new studies that would change the current recommendations.

No randomized control trials or systematic reviews that would impact the current recommendations were identified. However, since publication, additional therapeutics for SCD that could impact clinical transfusion practice have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or reported.
1 Voxelotor (Oxbryta): Hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization inhibitor that was shown in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants with SCD to significantly increase hemoglobin levels and reduce markers of hemolysis. For recommendation 3, which addresses immunosuppressive therapy for patients with SCD with a history of multiple or life-threatening DHTRs, one should consider voxelotor as a preventive maintenance therapy to improve the baseline hemoglobin of patients at high risk of DHTR if red cell transfusion is required.
2 Tocilizumab (Actemra): Monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor. Case reports have described individuals with DHTRs who have shown marked improvement after targeted anti–IL-6 receptor therapy, suggesting that blockade of macrophage activation may be an effective treatment strategy for ongoing DHTR. Tocilizumab could be added as a potential therapeutic strategy to recommendation 4 that suggests immunosuppressive therapy (IV immunoglobulin, steroids, rituximab, and/or eculizumab) over no immunosuppressive therapy in patients with SCD with a DHTR and ongoing hyperhemolysis.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a critical component of care for patients with SCD. Despite improvements to optimize RBC antigen matching, minimize iron overload, and to transfuse judiciously, individuals with SCD may still experience adverse effects. As this issue of Blood Advances describes, the ASH 2020 Guidelines for Management of Sickle Cell Disease: Transfusion Supportcontinue to be relevant, without sufficient new data to recommend revision or retirement. Several recently approved therapeutics provide alternatives or adjunctive therapy related to the ASH recommendations for transfusion support, and there are multiple ongoing efforts and studies relevant to SCD and transfusion therapy which we summarize here.

### An evaluation of exagamglogene autotemcel for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia [^111d6Wmc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy followed by beta-thalassemia. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was the only curative approach. Based on the Crispr-Cas9-technology enabling targeting specific genes of interest, fetal hemoglobin which is normally shut-off after birth can be switched on and sufficient levels can alleviate symptoms in sickle cell disease and avoid transfusions in beta-thalassemia. Two first-in-human clinical studies in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia aiming to increase the level of fetal hemoglobin by using Crispr-Cas9 to modify autologous hematopoietic stem cells in patients aged 12–35years have proved safety and efficacy and have shown promising clinical outcomes.

Areas Covered

The paper summarizes the outcome of the results of the two recently published clinical studies and compares them with the other available curative approaches.

Expert Opinion

Based on the currently available safety and efficacy data of the two published clinical results on gene therapy with Crispr-Cas9 modified autologous stem cells (exagamglogene autotemcel), it can be anticipated that this approach will add significantly to the therapeutic options for patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia and can be considered for all patientsabove12years of age independent of a suitable allogeneic stem cell donor.

### A road map for uniform, comprehensive long-term follow-up after curative therapy for sickle cell disease [^114AeiWq]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of allogeneic transplant and autologous gene modification transplant therapies seek to eradicate sickle hemoglobin and the consequent hemolysis, vasculopathy, functional compromise, morbidity and mortality. As these modalities are used in parallel, it is important to be able to define the spectrum and stability of correction, long-term effects, and the pros and cons of each modality. A comparison between interventions that will be sought by providers and patients undergoing intervention require uniform assessments that evaluate disease-related and intervention-related effects for informed decision-making. This expert summary provides a pathway to functional evaluations with timing recommendations, provides broad management guidelines, and touches upon ongoing research efforts in the field. The roadmap of long-term follow-up can help clinicians and researchers choose assessments and time them in comparable fashion between the various transformative therapy efforts.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^114mvMJe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In summary, perioperative planning is critical to reduce risks of surgery in patients with SCD. Preoperatively, careful consideration with regard to timing of surgery, rate and type of IV fluid, and operating room temperature can help decrease the need for prolonged NPO times, risk of underhydration or overhydration with IV fluids, and potential risks of VOE precipitation or volume overload (Figure 3). Patients with SCD and VTE are managed the same as the general population with regard to holding anticoagulation before the procedure, and prompt resumption of anticoagulation (or VTE prophylaxis for those without current VTE disease) is important given the increased risk of postprocedural VTE risk in this population. Intraoperatively, general knowledge of the anesthetic plan and its associated risks aid in planning for possible postprocedure complications, such as hypotension or rebound pain.

Figure 3.
Sickle cell disease-specific perioperative checklist. Adapted from the work by Sanders et al.

Preoperative transfusion is recommended for all patients with SCD who are undergoing surgery that either requires general anesthesia or any moderate anesthesia lasting > 1 hour. This evidence-based recommendation is aimed mainly at reducing the high-mortality postprocedure risk of ACS. Preoperative transfusion should be done on an individualized basis, taking into account the patient's SCD genotype and disease severity, history of antibodies and/or transfusion reactions, risk of surgery, and baseline hemoglobin levels. Extra time may need to be allotted for potential extended phenotyping matching in those patients with a history of alloimmunization, and the associated time it takes to receive matched RBC units for those patients. Preoperative transfusion planning should always be done in conjunction with the patient's primary hematologist to assist with determining whether the patient would benefit from simple or partial exchange transfusion and what hemoglobin level to target posttransfusion.

### Targeting sickle cell disease root-cause pathophysiology with small molecules [^1139tKR1]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

The complex, frequently devastating, multi-organ pathophysiology of sickle cell disease has a single root cause: polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin. A logical approach to disease modification is, therefore, to interdict this root cause. Ideally, such interdiction would utilize small molecules that are practical and accessible for worldwide application. Two types of such small molecule strategies are actively being evaluated in the clinic. The first strategy intends to shift red blood cell precursor hemoglobin manufacturing away from sickle hemoglobin and towards fetal hemoglobin, which inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization by a number of mechanisms. The second strategy intends to chemically modify sickle hemoglobin directly in order to inhibit its polymerization. Important lessons have been learnt from the pre-clinical and clinical evaluations to date. Open questions remain, but this review summarizes the valuable experience and knowledge already gained, which can guide ongoing and future efforts for molecular mechanism-based, practical and accessible disease modification of sickle cell disease.

### HbA2: biology, clinical relevance and a possible target for ameliorating sickle cell disease [^114AX1p8]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA2, a tetramer of α- and δ-globin chains, provides a diagnostic clue to the presence of β-thalassaemia trait. This minor haemoglobin, which forms about 2–3% of the total, has no known physiological role, but has the interesting property of preventing polymerization of deoxy-sickle haemoglobin. If it were possible to increase the level of HbA2 sufficiently it could have a benefit in sickle cell disease similar to that of foetal haemoglobin. Moreover, HbA2 is present in all erythrocytes, an advantage not found with foetal haemoglobin, which is heterocellularly expressed. The molecular basis of HbA2 gene (HBD) expression is partially understood, and with new molecular tools, it might be possible to induce levels of HbA2 that could be clinically important. However, high concentrations of this positively charged haemoglobin might damage the erythrocyte membrane; also, the reciprocal relationship of δ- and γ-globin gene (HBD and HBG1/2, respectively) expression might negate any benefit of increasing transcription of the former.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin S percent threshold to prevent severe pain events: a secondary analysis of the SIT trial [^112NqLbP]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The 2020 American Society of Hematology guidelines suggested the use of blood transfusion therapy after all other measures to decrease the incidence rates of vaso-occlusive pain events have failed. However, unlike regular blood transfusion therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention, for which the goal is hemoglobin (Hb) S level ≤ 30%, no optimal Hb S threshold has been established to attenuate the severe acute vaso-occlusive pain event incidence rate. The goal of achieving a Hb S < 30% is based on the strategy for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia via blood transfusion therapy. The American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell diseasesuggested the use of blood transfusion therapy for decreasing acute vaso-occlusive pain events only when other methods such as hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, and crizanlizumab have proven unsuccessful. Despite these recommendations, no Hb S percentage goal threshold was established.

### 2015 clinical trials update in sickle cell anemia [^11296n8n]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Polymerization of HbS and cell sickling are the prime pathophysiological events in sickle cell disease (SCD). Over the last 30 years, a substantial understanding at the molecular level has been acquired on how a single amino acid change in the structure of the beta chain of hemoglobin leads to the explosive growth of the HbS polymer and the associated changes in red cell morphology. O2 tension and intracellular HbS concentration are the primary molecular drivers of this process, and are obvious targets for developing new therapies. However, polymerization and sickling are driving a complex network of associated cellular changes inside and outside of the erythrocyte, which become essential components of the inflammatory vasculopathy and result in a large range of potential acute and chronic organ damages. In these areas, a multitude of new targets for therapeutic developments have emerged, with several ongoing or planned new therapeutic interventions. This review outlines the key points of SCD pathophysiology as they relate to the development of new therapies, both at the pre-clinical and clinical levels.

### Don't routinely transfuse patients with sickle cell disease for… [^1113s6we]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with sickle cell disease are especially vulnerable to potential harms from unnecessary red blood cell transfusion. In particular, they experience an increased risk of alloimmunization to minor blood group antigens and a high risk of iron overload from repeated transfusions. Patients with the most severe genotypes of sickle cell disease with baseline hemoglobin values in the 7 to 10 g/dL range can usually tolerate further temporary reductions in Hb without developing symptoms of anemia. Many patients with sickle cell disease receive intravenous fluids to improve hydration when hospitalized for management of pain crisis, which may contribute to a decrease in hemoglobin by 1 to 2 g/dL. Routine administration of red blood cells in this setting should be avoided. Moreover, there is no evidence that transfusion reduces pain due to vaso-occlusive crises.

For a discussion of when transfusion is indicated in sickle cell disease, readers are referred to recent evidence-based guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^1171DHZ8]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end-organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease-modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole-blood viscosity-related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.

Methods

Relevant literature was identified through various mechanisms, including using search terms 'sickle cell disease' and 'novel treatments' in MEDLINE, reviewing recent abstracts presented at the American Society of Hematology annual meetings, and examining recent, relevant reviews by others in the field. Trials actively recruiting pediatric or adult patients with SCD, and which included subjects aged 18 years or older, as of February 15, 2019 were also evaluated through. Upon review of each result, we excluded those trials involving gene modification, including stem cell transplant, gene addition, correction, or editing. As we outline in Online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, we broke down what we thought were novel and important treatments into two groups - those characterized by targeting the abnormal HbS and damaged sickle RBC (i.e. intrinsic to the RBC, including formation of deoxy-HbS and its polymerization in a dehydrated sickle RBC) (Figure 1) and those targeting sequelae downstream from the red cell (i.e. extrinsic to the RBC, including abnormal endothelial and cellular adhesion, vascular tone, other blood components, and inflammation) (Figure 2).

The figure illustrates the therapeutic targets within the red cell precursor [DNA, and the sickle red blood cell (RBC), HbS, e.g. voxelator, and polymer formation], which are most likely to modify sickle cell disease and to affect more than a single downstream sequelae (pain, inflammation, vasculopathy, so forth).

### CRISPR-cas9 gene editing for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia [^115dmzLD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are severe monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses γ-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer. Approximately 80% of the alleles at this locus were modified, with no evidence of off-target editing. After undergoing myeloablation, two patients - one with TDT and the other with SCD - received autologous CD34+ cells edited with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the same BCL11A enhancer. More than a year later, both patients had high levels of allelic editing in bone marrow and blood, increases in fetal hemoglobin that were distributed pancellularly, transfusion independence, and (in the patient with SCD) elimination of vaso-occlusive episodes.

### Combinatorial targeting of epigenome-modifying enzymes with decitabine and RN-1 synergistically increases HbF [^112k1Kk4]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the β-globin genethat triggers polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Approximately 100 000 patients with SCD in the United States and millions worldwidesuffer from chronic hemolytic anemia, painful crises, multisystem organ damage, and reduced life expectancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be curative, but most of the patients do not have a suitable donor. Advanced gene editing technologies also offer the possibility of a cure, but the likelihood that these strategies can be mobilized to treat large number of patients residing in low-income countries is remote. A pharmacological treatment to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF [α 2 γ 2]) as a therapy for SCD has been a long sought goal because increased levels of HbF inhibit the polymerization of HbS, and are associated with reduced symptoms and increased lifespan in patients with SCD. Therefore, the development of an orally available, easily administered drug regimen that increases HbF to high levels and maximizes its distribution throughout the erythrocyte population should be pursued.

### Chronic transfusion practice for children with sickle cell anaemia and stroke [^114vwxm7]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic transfusions to maintain haemoglobin S (HbS) ≤ 30% are the mainstay of treatment for children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and previous stroke. This HbS target is often hard to maintain, however, and values achieved in current practice are unknown. In preparation for the Phase III Stroke With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) trial, we collected data on 295 children with SCA and stroke who received transfusions at 23 institutions. The overall average pre-transfusion %HbS was 35 ± 11% (institutional range 22–51%). Receiving scheduled transfusions on time was the most predictive variable for maintaining HbS at the ≤ 30% goal.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease — regular transfusion for abnormal TCD in high-income settings: For children with HbSS or HbSβº thalassemia (ages 2–16 years) who have abnormal TCD velocities and live in a high-income setting, the ASH guideline panel recommends regular blood transfusion for at least a year (vs no transfusion) with the goal of keeping maximum HbS levels below 30% and maintaining hemoglobin levels > 9.0 g/dL; in these settings, regular blood transfusion therapy is typically every 3–4 weeks to maintain the maximum HbS level < 30% and the hemoglobin level ≥ 9.0 g/dL. For children who have compound heterozygous SCD other than HbSC in a high-income setting, the ASH guideline panel suggests regular blood transfusion for at least a year (vs no transfusion), with the goal of keeping maximum HbS levels below 30% to reduce the risk of stroke.

Importance

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

Objective

To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

Evidence Review

Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

Findings

Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.

Blood pressure management in adults with sickle cell disease — The panel states the balance of benefits vs harms favors the intervention targeting a blood pressure goal of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg, and the overall certainty in the evidence was considered to be moderate based on indirect evidence from the general population for outcomes related to intensive vs standard blood pressure targets. The panel determined that there is very low certainty of evidence for a net health benefit related to patient-important outcomes associated with maintaining a blood pressure of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg in adults with SCD, and also felt that there was no compelling reason that blood pressure goals should be different for individuals with SCD vs the general population. The panel identified research needs including studies to define treatment thresholds and targets, implementation studies to evaluate adherence to guidelines, and prospective studies on the natural history of blood pressure changes and mechanisms underlying blood pressure regulation in children and adults with SCD.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: what's new? [^116hR6oz]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The purpose of the 2020 guidelines was to provide evidence-based recommendations for RBC transfusion support in patients with SCD. Because high-quality evidence was not uniformly available for each transfusion topic, the panel's goal was to provide clinical decision support for shared decision-making by patients and clinicians based on the available evidence. Ongoing clinical trials studying chronic transfusion therapy for pregnant women with SCD, or adults with SCD and pulmonary arterial hypertension (SCD and CardiovAscular Risk–RBC Exchange trial [SCD-CARRE]), will guide future recommendations. As new therapeutics are approved and ongoing clinical trials provide new evidence, guideline monitoring will continue to incorporate new management approaches and highlight top research priorities.

### Successes and challenges in clinical gene therapy [^114F7SpZ]. Gene Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease and β- and α-thalassemia, are important disease targets for gene therapy as these disorders are more common than the IEI and metabolic disorders. For β-thalassemia, lentiviral vectors have been developed expressing β-globin genes that supplement the deficient endogenous β-globin production. The published trials of one lentiviral vector for β-thalassemia showed high rates of improvement in red blood cell production, to allow transfusion therapy to be stopped for most treated patients. This is the treatment for β-thalassemia HSGCT (Zynteglo™) that was recently approved by the U.S. FDA, mentioned above.

Most gene therapy approaches for sickle cell disease are based on the clinical observation that expression of increased amounts of fetal hemoglobin moderate the severity of sickle cell disease, attributed to the ability of fetal hemoglobin to slow the rate of aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin S. The γ-globin chain of fetal hemoglobin has a specific amino acid (Q87) that is responsible for interference with HbS aggregation. Lentiviral vectors expressing "anti-sickling genes" (γ-globin transgene or β-globin substituted with the Q87 amino acid from γ-globin) that impede aggregation of sickle hemoglobin have been shown to have clinical benefits, with significant reduction in acute complications of sickle cell disease. Other approaches used a short hairpin RNA to reduce the mRNA for the repressor of γ-globin expression, BCL11a, inducing high levels of fetal globin production and greatly reducing acute sickle complications. CRISPR/Cas9 is being used to disrupt the erythroid enhancer element for the BCL11a gene to induce increased γ-globin production and to facilitate correction of the sickle cell-causing mutation in the HBB S gene by homology-directed repair. Base-editing trials advancing to the clinic will be used to either eliminate the BCL11a-binding sites at the γ-globin genes and thereby induce fetal globin; or to convert the codon containing the sickle cell-causing mutation to one encoding an amino acid that does not cause sickling.

Opportunities

There are many more inherited blood cell diseases for which lentiviral vector gene therapies are being developed, including additional IEI, α-thalassemia, storage and metabolic disorders. Gene editing technologies are advancing at break-neck speed, with nuclease-mediated editing (zing finger nucleases, TALENS, CRISPR/Cas9) being followed by base editing, prime editing and more to come. The ability to make precise edits in endogenous genes should confer more physiological expression of genes needed for safe and effective HSCGT.

### Autologous gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies: from bench to patient's bedside [^116sQv3k]. Molecular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic diseases, with an estimated 7% of the worldwide population being carriers who have at least one DNA variant that results in defective hemoglobin synthesis. Annually, approximately 60,000 people are diagnosed with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and 500,000 infants are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) around the world.

Both TDT and SCD are the result of mutations in the hemoglobin β subunit gene (HBB), which is located on chromosome 11. β-Thalassemia can result from any of approximately 350 mutations (i.e. substitutions, minor deletions or insertions, or rare gross deletions) in either HBB or its flanking, non-coding regions. The heterogeneity of potential HBB mutations, which can lead to either the complete absence of β-globin (denoted β 0) or a reduction in β-globin synthesis (denoted β +), explains the range of clinical severity seen in patients with β-thalassemia and associated morbidities. Abnormal production of β-globin causes an excess of unstable α-globin to accumulate in erythroid cells, leading to both ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis, which manifests clinically in severe anemia (Figure 1). Those patients with TDT, who are generally either homozygous or compound heterozygous for β 0 or severe β +, require life-long red blood cell transfusions for survival. In contrast with β-thalassemia, SCD is caused by a single amino acid change at position 6 in the β-chain wherein a glutamic acid is replaced with valine leading to the production of the aberrant sickle hemoglobin (also known as β s β s disease). Polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin in erythrocytes causes the deformation of the red blood cell into the characteristic sickle shape, leading to downstream complications of impaired blood flow in the microvasculature and hemolysis, with patients subsequently experiencing painful vaso-occlusive events, severe anemia, end-organ damage, and reduced life-expectancy (Figure 1). For patients with SCD, current treatment options primarily involve symptomatic pain management, red blood cell transfusion, and the use of hydroxyurea, which has been shown to reduce pain episodes and other SCD-related complications for some patients by raising the levels of fetal hemoglobin among other possible actions. Other treatment options for patients with TDT and SCD that have recently emerged include luspatercept, which has been shown to reduce ineffective erythropoiesis, resulting in lower transfusion need in patients with TDT, and voxelotor, which was shown to increase hemoglobin levels and reduce markers of hemolysis in patients with SCD. However, it is important to note that none of these therapies address the underlying biochemical cause of either disease nor do they fully ameliorate the clinical disease symptoms. Additionally, these therapies must be administered life-long to obtain a persistent therapeutic effect.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^113H17jf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

When to Consider Preoperative Transfusion

Currently, ASH does suggest transfusion over no preoperative transfusion in all patients with SCD undergoing surgery requiring general anesthesia and lasting > 1 hour, which is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty data. The guidelines note that decision should be individualized based on genotype, risk of surgery, baseline hemoglobin, prior transfusion-related complications, and disease severity.

We, therefore, recommend exercising caution in patients with underlying SCD-related complications, especially underlying pulmonary disease or prior transfusion-related complications, given the increased risk of volume overload in this population. Preoperative transfusion needs should be made in consultation with a hematologist familiar with the management of people with SCD. At our institutions, we approach each patient individually, taking into account their SCD genotype, risk level of surgery, baseline total hemoglobin, complications with prior transfusion, known blood antigens, and SCD disease severity. All patients receive leukoreduced, nonsickle trait blood as is recommended by ASH. Additionally, patients receive ABO and Rh-antigen matched blood. Patients with known antibodies should receive extending matching based on phenotype, which includes matching beyond ABO and Rh-antigens, such as Jka/Jkb, Fya/Fyb, and S/s antigens. Additionally, whenever possible, we recommend prophylactic extended phenotypic matching for patients without known antibodies if available, as is suggested by ASH for patients with SCD of all genotypes. However, in emergency settings, it is reasonable to give O ¯ blood, regardless of shelf-life and sickle trait status, if necessary.

Figure 2.
Preoperative transfusion management. In addition to the above transfusion parameters, we additionally recommend that all patients receive leukoreduced, nonsickle trait blood. All patients should also receive ABO and Rh-antigen-matched blood, and patients with known antibodies should receive extended matching based on their phenotype.

When transfusing preoperatively, we recommend simple transfusion if Hb < 8.5 g/dL for patients with all SCD genotypes, with a posttransfusion hemoglobin goal no > 11 g/dL to avoid the risk of hyperviscosity (Figure 2). We recommend exchange transfusion if total hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL, with a posttransfusion goal of 10 to 11 g/dL. We do not target a specific HbS% at our institutions for patients with HbSS (or HbS/β 0 -thalassemia) disease; however, we recommend a target HbA of 70% for patients with HbSC or HbS/β + -thalassemia disease.

### Whole blood viscosity and red blood cell adhesion: potential biomarkers for targeted and curative therapies in sickle cell disease [^111vDL5J]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The microfluidic assay described in this study holds promise as a translatable system that could be utilized for simultaneous assessment of WBV and RBC adhesion in a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios as clinically relevant biomarkers, and in assessment of emerging targeted and curative therapies that aim to improve blood rheology and cellular adhesion. 73, 74, 75, 76 For instance, WBV and RBC adhesion levels can be assessed before and after therapeutic interventions targeted at HCT augmentation, adhesion mitigation, and/or before and after curative therapies, in order to assess improvements in blood rheology and RBC properties with therapy.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only currently available, feasible, relatively accessible, and potentially curative strategy for patients with high‐risk SCD. 77, 78 However, only a small portion of patients (< 18%) have access to matched sibling donors. 79 Gene therapy, on the other hand, can repair the underlying cause of SCD, the mutated sickle beta‐globin gene, by altering hemoglobin composition within the RBC through ex vivo gene transfer into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. 80, 81 Close monitoring of WBV along with RBC adhesion properties after a curative therapy is essential to fully evaluate the impact of such treatments on patient outcomes. Particularly, it is likely that RBC heterogeneity will be typical immediately following a curative therapy, at which time, precise discernment of heterogeneity may be especially crucial. Based on our results, unmatched for sample HCT, we project that more normal RBCs and a more normal HCT post curative therapy will likely result in a rise in WBV. In parallel, HbSS‐containing whole blood has higher RBC adhesion than HbAA‐containing whole blood. 49 We project that WBV and RBC adhesion, as measured by our integrated microfluidic approach, will transition following curative therapy (low‐to‐high WBV and high‐to‐low RBC adhesion, post‐treatment).

### Automated red blood cell exchange with a post-procedure haematocrit targeted at 34% in the chronic management of sickle cell disease [^1128pwhA]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal targets for red blood cell exchange (RCE) are not well defined in the chronic management of sickle cell disease. We analysed transfusion requirements and iron-related outcomes in 101 patients on chronic RCE with a post-procedure haematocrit (Ht) targeted at 34%, which is higher than typically used. A majority were of HbSS/HbSβ0 genotype (n = 72) and enrolled for neurological complications (n = 53). Fifty patients had a positive Ht balance with RCE (> 2% mean increase from pre-procedure level), while 43 patients maintained a neutral balance. The first group required fewer red blood cell units/year (65 vs. 80, p < 0.001), but a significant proportion were iron overloaded based on R2* with liver MRI (32% vs. none performed) and prescription of iron chelation (52% vs. 0%, p < 0.001, after a median of 19months). The second group was more likely to receive iron supplementation (6% vs. 56%, p < 0.001). Chronic automated RCE with a post-procedure Ht targeted at 34% is not iron-neutral, and personalized Ht goals may be more appropriate in certain settings. This higher target should be compared with a lower Ht strategy in individuals with similar baseline red cell volumes to assess iron homeostasis and blood product requirements.

### Post-transcriptional genetic silencing ofto treat sickle cell disease [^114nbHZ9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, pain, and progressive organ damage. A high level of erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin (HbF) comprising α- and γ-globins may ameliorate these manifestations by mitigating sickle hemoglobin polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. BCL11A is a repressor of γ-globin expression and HbF production in adult erythrocytes. Its down-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for induction of HbF.

Methods

We enrolled patients with sickle cell disease in a single-center, open-label pilot study. The investigational therapy involved infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BCH-BB694 lentiviral vector, which encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting BCL11A mRNA embedded in a microRNA (shmiR), allowing erythroid lineage-specific knockdown. Patients were assessed for primary end points of engraftment and safety and for hematologic and clinical responses to treatment.

Results

As of October 2020, six patients had been followed for at least 6 months after receiving BCH-BB694 gene therapy; median follow-up was 18 months (range, 7 to 29). All patients had engraftment, and adverse events were consistent with effects of the preparative chemotherapy. All the patients who could be fully evaluated achieved robust and stable HbF induction (percentage HbF/(F+S) at most recent follow-up, 20.4 to 41.3%), with HbF broadly distributed in red cells (F-cells 58.9 to 93.6% of untransfused red cells) and HbF per F-cell of 9.0 to 18.6 pg per cell. Clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease were reduced or absent during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

This study validates BCL11A inhibition as an effective target for HbF induction and provides preliminary evidence that shmiR-based gene knockdown offers a favorable risk-benefit profile in sickle cell disease. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03282656).

### Management of patients with sickle cell disease using transfusion therapy: guidelines and complications [^114tTNSk]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy is a key component of comprehensive management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and has increased over time as a means of primary and secondary stroke prevention. RBC transfusions also prove to be lifesaving for many acute sickle cell-related complications. Although episodic and chronic transfusion therapy has significantly improved the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD, transfusions are not without adverse effects. This review addresses RBC transfusion methods, evidence-based and/or expert panel-based consensus on indications for chronic and episodic transfusion indications, and strategies to prevent and manage transfusion-related complications.

### Sickle cell disease: monitoring, current treatment, and therapeutics under development [^111iB7cg]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Screening and early detection of organ injury, as well as expanded use of red cell transfusion and hydroxyurea in children have changed best practices for clinical care in sickle cell disease. The current standard of care for children with sickle cell disease is discussed through a review of screening recommendations, disease monitoring, and approach to treatment. Novel pharmacologic agents under investigation in clinical trials are also reviewed.

### Fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia [^114JtvSQ]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can blunt the pathophysiology, temper the clinical course, and offer prospects for curative therapy of sickle cell disease. This review focuses on (1) HbF quantitative trait loci and the geography of β-globin gene haplotypes, especially those found in the Middle East; (2) how HbF might differentially impact the pathophysiology and many subphenotypes of sickle cell disease; (3) clinical implications of person-to-person variation in the distribution of HbF among HbF-containing erythrocytes; and (4) reactivation of HbF gene expression using both pharmacologic and cell-based therapeutic approaches. A confluence of detailed understanding of the molecular basis of HbF gene expression, coupled with the ability to precisely target by genomic editing most areas of the genome, is producing important preliminary therapeutic results that could provide new options for cell-based therapeutics with curative intent.

### CRISPR-cas9 editing of theandPromoters to treat sickle cell disease [^1113CPR9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is caused by a defect in the β-globin subunit of adult hemoglobin. Sickle hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions, producing deformed red cells that hemolyze and cause vaso-occlusion that results in progressive organ damage and early death. Elevated fetal hemoglobin levels in red cells protect against complications of sickle cell disease. OTQ923, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem- and progenitor-cell (HSPC) product, has a targeted disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 (γ-globin) gene promoters that increases fetal hemoglobin expression in red-cell progeny.

Methods

We performed a tiling CRISPR-Cas9 screen of the HBG1 and HBG2 promoters by electroporating CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors with Cas9 complexed with one of 72 guide RNAs, and we assessed the fraction of fetal hemoglobin-immunostaining erythroblasts (F cells) in erythroid-differentiated progeny. The gRNA resulting in the highest level of F cells (gRNA-68) was selected for clinical development. We enrolled participants with severe sickle cell disease in a multicenter, phase 1–2 clinical study to assess the safety and adverse-effect profile of OTQ923.

Results

In preclinical experiments, CD34+ HSPCs (obtained from healthy donors and persons with sickle cell disease) edited with CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNA-68 had sustained on-target editing with no off-target mutations and produced high levels of fetal hemoglobin after in vitro differentiation or xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice. In the study, three participants received autologous OTQ923 after myeloablative conditioning and were followed for 6 to 18 months. At the end of the follow-up period, all the participants had engraftment and stable induction of fetal hemoglobin (fetal hemoglobin as a percentage of total hemoglobin, 19.0 to 26.8%), with fetal hemoglobin broadly distributed in red cells (F cells as a percentage of red cells, 69.7 to 87.8%). Manifestations of sickle cell disease decreased during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 gene promoters was an effective strategy for induction of fetal hemoglobin. Infusion of autologous OTQ923 into three participants with severe sickle cell disease resulted in sustained induction of red-cell fetal hemoglobin and clinical improvement in disease severity.

### A prime editing strategy to rewrite the γ-globin promoters and reactivate fetal hemoglobin for sickle cell disease [^115ba6rs]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) reactivation is a promising therapy for β-hemoglobinopathies. We developed a prime-editing strategy that introduces multiple mutations in the fetal γ-globin promoters that are expected to increase their activity. We tested multiple targets and optimized a variety of parameters to achieve ~50% of precise edits in a hematopoietic cell line, with minimal off-targets effects. This work improved our understanding of the complex DNA repair mechanisms involved in prime editing. We tested this strategy in patients' hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Although the editing efficiency was variable amongst donors, erythroid clones carrying multiple mutations express a significantly higher γ-globin level compared to cells carrying individual mutations, confirming the potential therapeutic benefit of our combined strategy for patients with β-hemoglobinopathies.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^115uDH2j]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end‐organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease‐modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100 g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole‐blood viscosity‐related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.
