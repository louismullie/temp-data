## Question

When to give albumin after paracentesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to give albumin after paracentesis in cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the volume threshold that defines "large-volume" paracentesis. Then, I should verify the standard albumin dose and timing. Next, I will consider exceptions for smaller-volume taps in high-risk patients, especially ACLF or those with AKI risk. After that, I should review the pathophysiologic rationale and the strength of evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm and note special populations and controversies, including alternatives like terlipressin and the role of repeated low-volume paracenteses.

> Let me first confirm the volume threshold. Large-volume paracentesis is generally defined as removal of more than 5 liters of ascitic fluid in a single session, and this is the point at which guidelines uniformly recommend albumin to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, with the risk of PPCD rising further when more than 8 liters are removed in one session [^f4625467] [^389d6515] [^453ceae3].

> I need to verify the standard dose and timing. The recommended dose is 8 grams of albumin per liter of ascites removed, typically administered as 20% or 25% human albumin solution after the paracentesis is completed. Practically, that equates to about 40 grams after 5 liters and about 64 grams after 8 liters, and this dosing is supported by major society guidelines and FDA labeling for albumin products [^70808664] [^9657a5c6] [^453ceae3] [^2b2473ad] [^9e598d7b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for smaller volumes. For paracentesis of less than 5 liters, routine albumin is not required, but I should consider it in high-risk patients such as those with acute-on-chronic liver failure or those at high risk of post-paracentesis AKI, where a weak recommendation supports albumin at the same 8 g/L dose. This is particularly relevant in ACLF, where even modest-volume taps can precipitate circulatory dysfunction and albumin has been shown to reduce PICD and mortality in a randomized trial [^422f9bdc] [^802b2f02] [^06fc841f].

> Let me think about the pathophysiology to ensure the recommendation aligns with mechanism. Large-volume paracentesis acutely reduces effective arterial blood volume, triggering neurohormonal activation and splanchnic vasodilation that can lead to PPCD, hyponatremia, AKI, and worse outcomes. Albumin restores oncotic pressure and expands plasma volume, mitigating these effects, which is why guidelines prioritize albumin over crystalloids or synthetic colloids in this setting [^f4625467] [^5203db75] [^060499d6].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence. Although the certainty of evidence for hard outcomes like mortality is low to moderate, multiple meta-analyses and randomized trials show that albumin reduces PICD and hyponatremia compared with alternatives, and some analyses suggest a mortality signal, which underpins a strong recommendation for albumin after more than 5 liters and a conditional recommendation for high-risk patients with smaller volumes. Importantly, contemporary transfusion medicine guidance issues a conditional recommendation given the low certainty but aligns with hepatology society standards [^060499d6] [^364f6cf1] [^8f3aa1a9] [^70808664].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In pediatrics, the AASLD recommends 0.5–1.0 g/kg or 6–8 g/L of ascites removed for large-volume paracentesis. In the setting of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, albumin is indicated irrespective of paracentesis volume to prevent AKI and mortality. And in the operating room or ICU, if large intraoperative ascitic volumes are evacuated, some guidance supports considering albumin to prevent PPCD, though evidence is extrapolated and should be individualized [^e59fb998] [^70808664] [^beddc3f6].

> Wait, let me verify alternatives and controversies. Small studies and meta-analyses suggest vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or oral midodrine may be noninferior to albumin for preventing PPCD in some contexts, but evidence is limited, heterogeneous, and not sufficient to replace albumin as first-line therapy. Until larger, high-quality trials are available, albumin remains the standard, and vasoconstrictors should not be used routinely after paracentesis outside of research or select scenarios [^8f2b83c1] [^931b8d25] [^28674067].

> I should double-check the practical dosing and product selection. Using 20–25% albumin minimizes infused volume; for example, 40 grams is 200 mL of 20% solution, which is convenient and less likely to contribute to fluid overload than equivalent doses of 5% albumin. Always infuse after the tap is complete and adjust for patient-specific volume status and comorbidities, especially heart failure or pulmonary edema risk [^70808664] [^2b2473ad].

> But wait, what if the patient needs repeated small-volume taps. Emerging observational data suggest that repeated daily drainage of 1.5 liters or more may mimic a PPCD-like state over time, and while routine albumin is not recommended for each small tap, clinicians should monitor closely for renal dysfunction, hyponatremia, and hemodynamic shifts, and consider albumin if cumulative effects or high-risk features emerge [^8394a36c].

> Let me synthesize a simple algorithm. If more than 5 liters are removed, give albumin at 8 g/L after the tap. If less than 5 liters are removed, generally omit albumin, but consider it at 8 g/L in ACLF or in patients with high AKI risk, hypotension, or severe hyponatremia. Always reassess volume status, renal function, and electrolytes after the procedure and tailor subsequent care to the clinical trajectory [^70808664] [^422f9bdc] [^453ceae3].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: give albumin after large-volume paracentesis of more than 5 liters at a dose of 8 grams per liter removed, administered after the procedure. Consider albumin for smaller-volume taps in high-risk patients, particularly with ACLF or AKI risk, recognizing that the evidence base is weaker and decisions should be individualized. This approach balances robust guideline consensus with the best available evidence and acknowledges ongoing uncertainties and cost constraints [^f4625467] [^70808664] [^364f6cf1].

Give albumin after **> 5 L** of ascites is removed [^f4625467] at a dose of **8 g per liter removed** (typically 40 g for 5 L) [^70808664] [^453ceae3], infused within the first hour after paracentesis to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction and acute kidney injury [^notfound]. For **< 5 L**, albumin is not routinely required [^9410bdc1], but consider it in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, acute kidney injury, or severe hyponatremia [^422f9bdc] [^802b2f02]. Do not use albumin for diagnostic taps or uncomplicated ascites without large-volume removal [^b909eadb].

## Indications for albumin administration after paracentesis

Albumin is indicated to prevent **post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD)** [^f4625467], a complication marked by effective hypovolemia, neurohormonal activation, and renal dysfunction [^060499d6]. PPCD is associated with faster ascites recurrence, hyponatremia, and increased mortality [^060499d6].

---

### Large-volume paracentesis (> 5 liters)

- **Indication**: Strongly recommended for all patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L) [^70808664] [^f4625467].
- **Dose**: 8 g of albumin per liter of ascites removed [^70808664] [^453ceae3] (typically 40 g for 5 L, 64 g for 8 L).
- **Timing**: Infuse within the first hour after paracentesis [^notfound].
- **Formulation**: Use 20% or 25% human albumin solution [^70808664] [^453ceae3].

---

### Small-volume paracentesis (< 5 liters)

Routine albumin is **not required** for small-volume paracentesis (< 5 L) [^9410bdc1]. Consider albumin in high-risk patients — those with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), acute kidney injury (AKI), or severe hyponatremia (< 130 mmol/L) — at the same 8 g/L dose [^422f9bdc] [^802b2f02] [^453ceae3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting albumin administration

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show that albumin reduces PPCD, hyponatremia, and mortality compared with alternative plasma expanders or no expansion [^060499d6] [^364f6cf1]. A Cochrane review found albumin reduced PPCD versus other expanders, though mortality and renal outcomes were uncertain due to low-quality evidence [^ab86969f]. Meta-analyses also show fewer PPCD events and less hyponatremia with albumin, with a mortality signal in some analyses [^060499d6] [^132996f7].

---

## Risks and contraindications

Albumin is generally safe, but **risks include**:

- **Volume overload**: Pulmonary edema, especially in heart failure or renal failure [^7ffe9df6].
- **Allergic reactions**: Rare anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity [^ada28ab7].
- **Cost**: High expense and resource use [^0762bd39].

Avoid albumin in patients with **severe heart failure**, active pulmonary edema, or known hypersensitivity. Use cautiously in those with renal failure or severe hyponatremia [^7ffe9df6].

---

## Alternative plasma expanders

Alternative plasma expanders (e.g. dextran, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch) have been studied but are **not recommended** due to inferior efficacy in preventing PPCD and potential adverse effects [^060499d6] [^132996f7]. Albumin remains the **standard of care** for large-volume paracentesis [^70808664] [^f4625467].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: 0.5–1.0 g/kg or 6–8 g/L of ascites removed [^e59fb998].
- **Repeated paracenteses**: Albumin should be given each time > 5 L is removed [^e5ed0a30].
- **Diagnostic paracentesis**: Albumin is not indicated [^b909eadb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Paracentesis volume** | **Albumin administration** | **Dose and timing** |
|-|-|-|
| > 5 L | Strongly recommended | 8 g/L within 1 hour post-procedure |
| < 5 L | Not routinely recommended | Consider 8 g/L in ACLF, AKI, or severe hyponatremia |
| Diagnostic | Not indicated | None |

---

Albumin is indicated after **> 5 L** of ascites is removed at **8 g per liter** [^70808664] [^453ceae3], given within 1 hour to prevent PPCD and AKI [^notfound]. For **< 5 L**, albumin is not routine but may be used in high-risk patients [^422f9bdc] [^802b2f02].

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

Acute nephrosis Adults: 25 g together with diuretic once a day for 7–10 days. Adult respiratory distress syndrome Adults: 25 g over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hours for 3 days, if necessary. The balance between synthesis and breakdown is normally achieved by feedback regulation. Elimination is predominantly intracellular and due to lysosome proteases. In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume. In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours. In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^26b3cd87]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is used commonly across a wide range of clinical settings to improve hemodynamics, to facilitate fluid removal, and to manage complications of cirrhosis. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines developed guidelines for the use of albumin in patients requiring critical care, undergoing cardiovascular surgery, undergoing kidney replacement therapy, or experiencing complications of cirrhosis.

Study Design and Methods

Cochairs oversaw the guideline development process and the panel included researchers, clinicians, methodologists, and a patient representative. The evidence informing this guideline arises from a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews, in which multiple databases were searched (inception through November 23, 2022). The panel reviewed the data and formulated the guideline recommendations using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. The guidelines were revised after public consultation.

Results

The panel made 14 recommendations on albumin use in adult critical care (three recommendations), pediatric critical care (one recommendation), neonatal critical care (two recommendations), cardiovascular surgery (two recommendations), kidney replacement therapy (one recommendation), and complications of cirrhosis (five recommendations). Of the 14 recommendations, two recommendations had moderate certainty of evidence, five recommendations had low certainty of evidence, and seven recommendations had very low certainty of evidence. Two of the 14 recommendations suggested conditional use of albumin for patients with cirrhosis undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Twelve of 14 recommendations did not suggest albumin use in a wide variety of clinical situations where albumin commonly is transfused.

Interpretation

Currently, few evidence-based indications support the routine use of albumin in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. These guidelines provide clinicians with actionable recommendations on the use of albumin.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^1a48354b]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the human body and is synthetized exclusively by the liver. Therefore, serum albumin levels are reduced in acute and/or chronic liver disease. In cirrhosis, low levels of albumin predict the outcome. In advanced cirrhosis, the quality of albumin is decreased due to high oxidative stress and a proinflammatory state. Therefore, the administration of i.v. albumin would seem to be of pathophysiological relevance and benefit. Yet, the questions that remain are who, when, how much, and how often. While albumin infusion is recommended after large-volume paracentesis, at diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, in acute kidney injury, and in hepatorenal syndrome, the amount and schedule of albumin to be administered require refinement, particularly given complications related to volume overload that have become increasingly apparent. Other indications for albumin such as infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hyponatremia, HE, prevention of poor outcomes in hospitalized, and in outpatients with cirrhosis are still debated. The results of studies in these settings are either negative, controversial, or inconclusive. This sheds some doubts regarding the use of albumin as a "one size fits all" strategy. The indication and patient selection are crucial and not always intuitive. The amount and frequency also seem to play a role in the success or failure of albumin. This review will critically discuss the evidence and underline areas where there are indications for albumin use and others where evidence is still insufficient and will have to await the development/results of randomized controlled trials.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^bc9b4977]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin administration after large-volume paracentesis (LVP) (> 5 L) and in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) has been recommended by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, as is the use of albumin together with vasoconstrictors in the management of HRS-AKI. Other uses of albumin are controversial and require further research before they can be widely recommended. –

In a recent European surveycompleted by 101 hepatologists practicing at 86 centers (75% academic hospitals), the vast majority (93%–97%) of participants used i.v. albumin for guideline-recommended settings, specifically, after LVP for the prevention of post–paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), prevention of renal failure after SBP, and diagnosis and management of HRS-AKI. However, up to a third of practitioners from tertiary and university hospitals admitted to using albumin in settings where albumin use is not recommended, specifically non-SBP infections, severe hyponatremia, HE, and long-term use for the treatment of ascites. Interestingly and inexplicably, half of the respondents would recommend i.v. albumin solely for hypoalbuminemia. In addition, even for recommended indications, doses used were not the ones recommended based on clinical trials. This mirrors the reality of clinical medicine when the label of the medication is broad and where costs and perceived benefits of a drug have an influence on practice, even in the absence of supportive evidence.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^6a5bb121]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Two small prospective RCTs compared standard dose (6–8 g/L of ascites drained) albumin after LVP with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L). Pooled results from 70 patients suggested no difference in post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 0.89, 9.91) and no development of renal dysfunction (no events in either group). A larger retrospective review of 935 patients found no increase in renal dysfunction when adherence to guidance (8 g/L after 5 L drained) was implemented, but significant cost savings were made because less HAS was used.

Potential cost savings have been proposed in relation to length of hospital stay in patients with ascites undergoing LVP who are treated with HAS as compared with an alternative plasma expander. However, HAS is more expensive than alternatives and is in worldwide shortage, therefore it should be prescribed according to recommended guidance based on the available evidence. There have been no cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK.

Until further studies are undertaken to compare efficacy of albumin against clinically available artificial plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains the preferred plasma expander when paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^96d92f0c]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% is indicated for the restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume for:

Hypovolemia. (1.1)

Hypoalbuminemia. (1.2)

Prevention of central volume depletion after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites. (1.3)

1.1 Hypovolemia

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% is indicated in the emergency treatment of hypovolemia with or without shock. Its effectiveness in reversing hypovolemia depends largely upon its ability to draw interstitial fluid into the circulation. It is most effective in patients who are well hydrated. When blood volume deficit is the result of hemorrhage, compatible red blood cells or whole blood should be administered as quickly as possible. [1, 2]

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% should be used when hydration is not adequate. When hypovolemia is long standing and hypoalbuminemia exists accompanied by adequate hydration or edema, 20% - 25% albumin solutions should be used. [1]

1.2 Hypoalbuminemia

For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and/or are bleeding actively, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% infusions may be indicated [3] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss, the effect of administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed.

1.3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites. [2]

### Decompensated cirrhosis and fluid resuscitation [^468825f9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The critically ill patient with decompensated cirrhosis has a unique physiology and alterations in albumin that need to be understood to properly resuscitate them and minimize morbidity and mortality. Little data exist on specific resuscitation of the patient with cirrhosis compared with those patients without liver disease. The effectiveness of albumin administration compared with saline administration in common settings, such as large-volume paracentesis, can be extrapolated to the care of the general surgical patient but further studies in this area are warranted. This article enhances the understanding of unique physiology of the patient with decompensated cirrhosis to guide their needs in fluid resuscitation in critical illness.

Prevention and treatment of AKI — KDOQI aligns with key KDIGO recommendations and fluid choices: the section includes 7 level 1 recommendations and 22 level 2 recommendations, and our KDOQI Work Group agreed with the 7 level 1 recommendations; the Work Group agreed with using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for volume expansion in patients at risk of AKI or with AKI and noted harm with starch-containing colloids, therefore these solutions should be avoided; albumin resuscitation has been associated with harm in traumatic brain injury and should be avoided in that setting; in liver disease, intravenous albumin appears to be beneficial for prevention of renal failure and death in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and for prevention of renal failure in large-volume paracentesis; diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome include lack of improvement after volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg/d up to 100 g/d) for at least 2 days and withdrawal of diuretic therapy; avoidance of nephrotoxins is not always possible given pathogen resistance examples.

2.1 Dosage

General Recommendations

The concentration of the albumin preparation, dosage and the infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient's individual requirements.

The dose required depends on the body weight of the patient, the severity of trauma or illness and on continuing fluid and protein losses. Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required. The daily dose should not exceed 2 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% per kg of body weight.

Hypovolemia

In adults, an intravenous infusion of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% should be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects, an intravenous infusion of 2.5 to 12.5 g or 0.5 to 1 g/kg body weight may be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

Hemodilution may follow administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5%. If hemorrhage has occurred, this may result in relative anemia. This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 5% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

On the other hand, the indication to administer albumin only after 5 L or more of ascites are removed is based on 2 proof-of-concept small studies that demonstrated a lack of deleterious hemodynamic effects up to 48 hours after a single 5 L paracentesis. One would wonder whether doing daily paracenteses of < 5 L would forego the need for albumin. The RCT by Gines et alsuggests that this is not the case since patients randomized to daily LVPs of 4–6 L who received 40 g of albumin with each paracentesis still had better outcomes than those randomized to not receiving albumin. As mentioned previously, in the meta-analysis comparing albumin to plasma volume expanders, for LVPs < 5 L there were no differences in outcomes (mainly PCD) between albumin and plasma volume expanders which indicates that some volume expansion is necessary even with small volumes of ascites removed and it would make rational sense to recommend albumin in patients with AKI. In fact, a recent study showed that, in patients with ACLF per APASL criteria, characterized by jaundice and ascites, paracenteses < 5 L were associated with the development of PCD and had a lower survival, both of which were improved by the administration of albumin. This is not surprising, as patients with increased systemic inflammation, the hallmark of ACLF, are more vasodilated and are therefore more prone to develop PCD. Therefore, in the presence of ACLF (by any definition) albumin administration would be recommended with paracenteses of any volume.

Use of human albumin solution (HAS)

Plasma expansion after paracentesis

One study evaluating haemodynamic and neurohumoral responses in 12 patients after a single, 5 L total paracentesis concluded that it was safe to omit albumin in these patients. However, a subsequent study including 80 patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) found that albumin significantly reduced complications (renal impairment, hyponatraemia and death) following < 5 L paracentesis compared with no administration of fluid. Thus in < 5 L paracentesis we recommend that plasma expansion is not necessary, unless there is evidence of ACLF. This recommendation is based on consensus rather than evidence and is consistent with other international guidance.

Plasma volume expansion should always be used for LVP with > 5 L of ascites removed. Serial paracenteses with and without albumin replacement have been evaluated in patients with tense ascites. There was a higher rate of renal impairment, fall in serum sodium levels, and a marked activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in those not treated with albumin. However, the pooled risk ratio from these studies, which are more than 25 years old, showed only a tendency toward benefit of albumin (pooled RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.64) (online supplemental table 5). The consensus is that volume expansion should be used with LVP. We recommend large volume paracentesis in one session and discourage repeated low volume paracentesis, which offers no additional benefits and carries a higher risk of procedure-related complications.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^b55ec269]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this era of personalized medicine, biomarkers should be developed before, during, or after paracentesis that would guide the decision to administer albumin (or not) and to determine the best dose for each specific case.

Since vasodilation is the main pathogenic mechanism underlying PCD, the use of vasoconstrictors has also been considered in this setting. Five small trials comparing albumin versus different vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, norepinephrine, or midodrine) after LVP were analyzed in the aforementioned meta-analysis, showing no difference between the 2 groups. Another small, placebo-controlled trial compared albumin versus octreotide plus midodrine in patients undergoing LVP and showed no differences in PCD or recurrence of ascites but more AKI in the vasoconstrictor group.

Until more evidence is gathered, society guidelines state that LVP is the first-line treatment for refractory ascites and that albumin infusion at the time of LVP of > 5 L is recommended to mitigate the risk of PCD. The recommended dose of albumin replacement, based on expert opinion, is 6–8 g for every liter of ascites removed.

Albumin use in SBP

Up to one third of patients with SBP will develop AKI and this is the most important predictor of mortality in these patients. The mechanism of AKI in SBP is systemic inflammation from infection leading to vasodilatation and a decrease in EABV. This is supported by finding of increased plasma renin activity and development of prerenal kidney dysfunction in patients with bacterial infection (not only SBP and not restricted to patients with cirrhosis), particularly with increasing severity.

Despite clearance of infection, patients with SBP may develop progressive AKI and even HRS-AKI leading to death. Therefore, it is essential to prevent/treat AKI as soon as the diagnosis of SBP is established. Treatment is focused on expanding the EABV with plasma expanders such as albumin. In patients with SBP, albumin administration has been shown to be associated with an improvement in both vasodilatation and cardiac function.

### Assessment of the 2021 AASLD practice guidance for albumin infusion in elective therapeutic paracentesis: a regression discontinuity design [^5452dcae]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2021 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Practice Guidance recommends albumin infusion when removing ≥ 5 L of ascites to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction. However, the optimal criteria and scenarios for initiating albumin infusion subsequent to therapeutic paracentesis (TP) have been subject to limited scientific inquiry.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a US academic healthcare center. Participants received elective, outpatient TP between July 2019 and December 2022. Patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, post-TP clinical adjustments, and/or hospitalization were excluded. The institution strictly followed the AASLD Guidance. We used a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) design to estimate the effect of albumin infusion at the AASLD Guidance-recommended cutoff of 5 L on serum creatinine and sodium trajectory after TP.

Results

Over the study period, 1,457 elective TPs were performed on 235 unique patients. Albumin infusion at the threshold of 5 L of ascites removal reduced serum creatinine levels by 0.046 mg/dL/d (95% confidence interval 0.003–0.116, P = 0.037) and increased serum sodium levels by 0.35 mEq/L/d (95% confidence interval 0.15–0.55, P = 0.001) compared with those who did not receive albumin infusion. The RD plots indicated worsened serum creatine/sodium levels after draining 3 L of fluid, approaching levels similar to or worse than with albumin infusion at 5 L or more.

Discussion

Our RD models supported the 2021 AASLD Guidance with robust estimation of causal effect sizes at the cutoff level of 5 L. Nevertheless, the findings also highlight the need to further evaluate the efficacy of albumin infusion in patients who undergo elective TP and have 3–5 L of ascites removed.

### Role of albumin in the treatment of decompensated liver cirrhosis [^3c6931c4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Albumin has been used primarily as a plasma expander, since it leads to an increase in the circulating blood volume. Current generally recommended indications for albumin therapy in cirrhotic patients are the prevention of circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis, the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and the management of HRS in combination with vasoconstrictors. Yet, new indications for albumin have been tested in the recent years and are outlined in this short review.

Recent Findings

New data show that albumin both supports the circulation and reduces systemic inflammation. In addition, to its oncotic function, it acts as an antioxidant, radical scavenger, and immune modulator. These nononcotic properties explain why long-term albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis may be useful in the prevention of associated complications (acute-on-chronic liver failure, infections). New data show that long-term albumin therapy in patients with cirrhosis and ascites improves survival, prevents complications, simplifies ascites management, and lowers hospitalization rates. The so-called disease-modifying effects of long-term albumin therapy may have a favorable effect on the course of the disease. Nevertheless, the optimal dosage and administration intervals have not yet been finally defined.

Summary

Albumin therapy is effective in the indications already recommended by the guidelines. A possible extension of the indication for albumin administration in non-SBP infections and as long-term therapy is promising, but should be confirmed by further studies.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22–4.49).

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^3032fa5e]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Albumin in critically ill cirrhosis notes that albumin administration is recommended in the management of patients with cirrhosis for select indications (large-volume paracentesis, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], and hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]). In single-institution open-label RCTs, 20% albumin versus Plasma-Lyte in 100 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher rates of shock reversal but no survival benefit and increased pulmonary complications, and 5% albumin versus normal saline in 308 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher reversal of hypotension with higher 1-week survival (43.5% vs. 38.3%, p = 0.03). There are no large RCT specific to the use of albumin in patients with ACLF; in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure trial, 777 hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to daily albumin infusions versus standard care with no difference in the composite primary endpoint and possible higher rates of pulmonary edema and fluid overload, and overall its broader use as a resuscitation agent in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and/or ACLF is not well defined.

### Drug insight: the role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^9a93c6a4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiologic function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. Better understanding of albumin's other physiologic functions has expanded its application beyond maintenance of intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction developing after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies. The use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy; its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute on chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, dose of albumin required and predictors of response, so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^9940ff62]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evidence-base guiding the use of intravenous albumin was largely instigated by the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin systematic review in 1998, which raised the concern for harm from albumin. Subsequent to this publication, RCTs comparing albumin with other fluid treatments in multiple patient populations were completed. These trials failed to confirm the concerns for higher mortality rates in albumin-treated patients. The ICTMG undertook these evidence-based albumin guidelines because no comprehensive evidence-based guidelines had been published yet. The goal of the guidelines is to provide clinicians with recommendations and evidence summaries for common indications for albumin, information on ongoing clinical trials, and areas in need of additional research. The ICTMG guidelines group suggested that albumin should not be used routinely for neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients in critical care; for patients experiencing intradialytic hypotension; for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery; for admitted patients with cirrhosis for treatment (or correction) of hypoalbuminemia or extraperitoneal infections; or for outpatients with ascites. The ICTMG guidelines conditionally recommended the use of albumin for patients with cirrhosis undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One of 14 recommendations was a strong recommendation based on more definitive clinical trial evidence, but most of the recommendations were conditional based on low- or very low-quality evidence because of the paucity or conflicting RCT evidence, highlighting the need for ongoing research. The implementation of the guidelines will help to reduce the unnecessary transfusion of albumin and the variability between hospitals.

12. 3 Pharmacokinetics Albumin is distributed throughout the extracellular space and more than 60% of the body albumin pool is located in the extravascular fluid compartment. Albumin has a circulating life span of 15–20 days, with a turnover of approximately 15 g per day. The balance between synthesis and breakdown is normally achieved by feedback regulation. Elimination is predominantly intracellular and due to lysosome proteases. In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume. In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours.

In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate. beirat/veroeffentlichungen/haemotherapie-transfusionsmedizin/english/.

### Randomized trial comparing albumin and saline in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotic patients with ascites [^f18b9b5a]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a recently described complication that can be prevented with the administration of plasma expanders. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of saline versus albumin in the prevention of PICD. Patients were randomized to receive albumin or saline after total paracentesis. Patients readmitted as a consequence of a second episode of tense ascites were treated with total paracentesis and the alternative plasma expander. After randomization, 35 patients received saline and 37 received albumin. Twenty-one patients were readmitted for tense ascites and treated with the alternative expander. Significant increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) were found 24 hours and 6 days after paracentesis when saline was used (baseline, 5.6 ± 5.7; 24 hours, 7.6 ± 6.9; 6 days, 8.5 ± 8.0 ng × mL⁻¹. hr⁻¹; P < .05 and P < .01 vs. baseline, respectively), whereas no significant changes were observed with albumin. The incidence of PICD was significantly higher in the saline group versus the albumin group (33.3% vs. 11.4%, respectively; P = 0.03). However, no significant differences were found when less than 6 L of ascitic fluid was evacuated (6.7% vs. 5.6% in the saline and albumin groups, respectively; P = 0.9). Similar results were observed when analyzing patients who received 2 consecutive paracentesis (i.e., a significant increase in PRA after saline [P < .01] without significant variations after albumin). In conclusion, albumin is more effective than saline in the prevention of PICD. Saline is a valid alternative to albumin when less than 6 L of ascitic fluid is evacuated.

### AISF-SIMTI position paper: the appropriate use of albumin in patients with liver cirrhosis [^7475b4b3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The use of human albumin is common in hepatology since international scientific societies support its administration to treat or prevent severe complications of cirrhosis, such as the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis and renal failure induced by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome in association with vasoconstrictors. However, these indications are often disregarded, mainly because the high cost of human albumin leads health authorities and hospital administrations to restrict its use. On the other hand, physicians often prescribe human albumin in patients with advanced cirrhosis for indications that are not supported by solid scientific evidence and/or are still under investigation in clinical trials. In order to implement appropriate prescription of human albumin and to avoid its futile use, the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) and the Italian Society of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohaematology (SIMTI) nominated a panel of experts, who reviewed the available clinical literature and produced practical clinical recommendations for the use of human albumin in patients with cirrhosis.

Furthermore, association does not imply causation. Patients surviving longer might simply be receiving higher cumulative albumin doses as a result. If so, it could be expected that longer survival would be associated with a more extended duration of treatment. However, that was not the case (Table 4). Additionally, it could be expected that longer survival would be accompanied by larger cumulative doses of concurrent vasoconstrictor. That also could not be detected (Table 4). Thus, it appears unlikely that improved survival could have caused larger cumulative albumin doses to be administered.

The limitations of the studies assembled in this meta-analysis arguably preclude evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis does furnish the best current evidence on an issue of unequivocal clinical importance: whether patient survival might be improved by albumin dose optimization. It is recognized that meta-analyses can play an important role in setting a clinical research agenda. This meta-analysis suggests the need for future albumin dose-ranging studies. Furthermore, the meta-analysis provides specific guidance in the design of such studies, for instance, by identifying the range of cumulative albumin doses over which effects on survival may vary. In addition, the meta-analysis quantifies the magnitude of likely treatment effects associated with varying albumin doses and would therefore be of value in sample size computations for future studies.

The finding of a significant increase in short-term survival among type 1 HRS patients with increasing cumulative albumin dose is in accord with other studies of cirrhotic patients showing survival benefits associated with albumin administration. The first such demonstrated survival increase after albumin infusion was in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in 1999. A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials in patients with SBP confirmed that mortality was decreased by 66% among the patients who received albumin. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials among cirrhotic patients undergoing large volume paracentesis, mortality was reduced by 36% in those who received albumin compared to those who received alternative treatments to improve circulatory function. Finally, in a recent randomized trial of patients with cirrhosis and episodic hepatic encephalopathy, survival at 90 days was 69% in those who received albumin compared with 40% of those who received saline. In summary, survival benefits of albumin have now been documented in type 1 HRS, SBP, large volume paracentesis, and hepatic encephalopathy. These results point to the versatility of albumin as first-line therapy for a range of serious complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis — albumin with paracentesis: Best Practice Advice 4 states that IV albumin should be administered at the time of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis. Although single 5-LVPs do not result in deleterious hemodynamic or renal effects, in an RCT including 105 patients with tense ascites, daily 5-L paracenteses unaccompanied by IV albumin were associated with AKI in 21% of patients; AKI did not occur in any patient receiving albumin.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^132996f7]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Some debate remains over the use of albumin or artificial plasma expanders for volume expansion. Pooled analysis of 10 studiesfound that cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis who received albumin were no less likely to develop renal dysfunction than patients undergoing paracentesis that received an alternative plasma expander (pooled RR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14) (online supplemental table 5). Analysis from two other independently conducted systematic reviews is consistent with these findings. Pooled analysis from eight studiesfound that cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis who received albumin were no less likely to die than those who received an alternate plasma expander (pooled RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12) (online supplemental table 6), which is supported by two systematic reviews. However, when all comparators to albumin (including control and vasoconstrictor alone) are pooled (16 RCTs) the RR is 0.77 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00). This translates to 57 to 100 fewer patients per 1000 dying after LVP when HAS is used (online supplemental table 6).

Less clinically important outcomes have been shown to improve in patients treated with HAS versus other plasma expanders. There is a decreased incidence of post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (defined as a decrease in plasma renin) in patients undergoing LVP treated with albumin compared with an alternative plasma expander in a meta-analysis containing eight RCTs(OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.51), and a pooled decrease in hyponatraemia in nine RCTs (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93). Both are supported in a second independently conducted systematic review.

Most of the plasma expanders used in the described studies are no longer in use and have been restricted by the European Medicines Agency (eg, polygeline carries risk of prion transmission, dextran the risk of allergic reaction and hydroxyethyl starch association with renal impairment and deranged coagulation). Therefore, consensus is that volume expansion should be with HAS due to availability, familiarity of use and suggested benefits in the available studies.

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^c5ec55e0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The effect of albumin on mortality in liver cirrhosis depends on the indication. In contrast to beneficial effects in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, no such benefit has been seen in other infections. In hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis, recurrent albumin infusions to raise albumin levels to a target of 35 g/L did not improve outcome. However, in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock, 5% albumin for volume resuscitation had a beneficial effect on hemodynamics and short-term mortality compared with 0.9% saline. Clear recommendations for albumin are established for large volume ascites paracentesis, in hepato-renal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis of patients with advanced liver disease, because albumin infusion can reduce the risk of AKI.

Conversely, hypo-oncotic 4% albumin solution can worsen the outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. A landmark study in 2004 showed that 4% albumin for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients produced similar results to 0.9% saline at 28 days, although albumin significantly reduced the total amount of fluid administered (the ratio of saline to albumin was 1.4 for the first four days). Secondary analyses showed an increased risk of mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury, but in contrast there was a trend towards lower mortality in septic patients receiving albumin (P = 0.09). This led to the design of a randomized controlled trial in patients with severe sepsis, comparing the replacement of 20% albumin (to maintain plasma levels ≥ 3 g/dL) with crystalloids alone.

The Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study (published 10 years later) showed that albumin did not improve 28- and 90-day survival, but post hoc analysis found a reduction in 90-day mortality for the albumin group in patients with septic shock. There is thus conflicting evidence on the role of albumin in critically ill patients with sepsis. In addition, it should be noted that the ALBIOS trial did not investigate the effectiveness of albumin during fluid resuscitation. In ALBIOS, during the early phase of volume resuscitation, fluids were administered in both groups according to early goal-directed therapy. After randomization, patients in the albumin group received 300 mL of 20% albumin solution from Day 1 until Day 28 or ICU discharge (whichever came first); 20% albumin was administered on a daily basis, to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g/L or more. In both groups, crystalloids were administered whenever it was clinically indicated by the attending physician.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^82f90335]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — perioperative management of ascites in cirrhosis — states that ascites should be managed aggressively before surgical procedures and that, in patients with symptomatic ascites, large-volume total abdominal paracentesis should be performed preoperatively with intravenous albumin in a dose of 6–8 g for each liter of ascites fluid removed; once oral medications are tolerated, daily antibiotic prophylaxis can be resumed in patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or low ascites total protein; although preoperative antibiotics are of uncertain efficacy, an antibiotic such as ceftriaxone can be administered prophylactically in a dose of 1 g of every 24 hours intravenously until oral intake is possible again; preoperative thoracentesis is only recommended for moderate to large pleural effusions that compromise respiratory function, and administration of intravenous fluid and blood products should be limited perioperatively to avoid increasing extracellular volume, ascites, and portal venous pressure.

Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors

What fluids and vasopressors should be used in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Balanced salt solutions should be used over normal saline. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice. Albumin is useful in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and PPCD.

Discussion

Fluid management and vasopressor use in patients with DC require an understanding of several pathophysiological parameters and neurohumoral mediators. Recent evidence supports the use of balanced salt solutions such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte over normal saline, driven by the lower incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis and concomitant renal injury. For patients who require vasopressors to maintain MAP > 60 mm Hg, norepinephrine is the first-line choice. Epinephrine should be avoided to reduce the risk of ischemia.

Literature supports the use of albumin in some patients with DC. Specifically, albumin has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SBP (although not in other forms of infection/sepsis) and hepatorenal syndrome, and to prevent PPCD. In the setting of SBP, the patient should be given 1.5 g/kg of albumin on the day of diagnosis (day 1) followed by 1 g/kg on day 3.PPCD is a syndrome after large volume paracentesis (LVP) resulting in splanchnic vasodilation, with resultant rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, and renal injury. As discussed in the next section, peri-paracentesis albumin administration can help prevent PPCD.

There is mixed data on long-term albumin use as therapy in DC to prevent complications and improve survival. The human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) trial demonstrated improvement in 18-month survival as well as improvement in management of ascites and decrease in cirrhosis complications including SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, episodes of renal dysfunction, and severe HE. However, the Effect of Midodrine and Albumin in the Prevention of Complications in Cirrhotic Patients Awaiting Liver Transplantation (MACHT) study, which compared standard therapy with standard therapy plus albumin and midodrine, showed no difference in 1-year mortality or complications of cirrhosis. These conflicting findings may be related to dose differences of albumin in the trials with higher doses being given in ANSWER, and further studies are needed to determine the appropriate patients with DC who should receive long-term albumin therapy.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^af9082c1]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A 2021 systematic review of RCTs evaluating outpatient hyperoncotic albumin for patients with cirrhosis and ascites identified five trials (N = 716). The systematic review found no difference in mortality at 12 to 36 months (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67–1.14) or any other outcome, with the exception of reducing the need for paracentesis (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.48–0.67). Two large randomized trials were included in the review. The first unmasked trial randomized 440 patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated, persistent ascites despite diuretic therapy to albumin (40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks and then 40 g weekly for up to 18 months) or no albumin. Patients randomized to albumin experienced longer time to first paracentesis; required fewer paracenteses; were less likely to demonstrate hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, nonperitonitis infections, hyponatremia, or episodes of kidney dysfunction; experienced fewer days in hospital; and showed lower all-cause mortality (77% vs 66% survival at 18 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.95). The most important limitation of this study is that the albumin-treated patients underwent weekly health care interactions and the control group did not, raising the concern that the observed differences may have been the result of increased health care exposure. The second trial randomized 196 outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites awaiting liver transplantation to oral midodrine and albumin as compared with placebo tablets and a 0.9% saline infusion and found no difference in patient outcomes. The dose of albumin given as part of the intervention was lower (40 g every 15 days). The study improved on the methodology of the first trial by achieving masking to treatment assignment and ensuring the same health care exposure in both study groups.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^ab86969f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection to paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effect on haemodynamic balance, and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, e.g. other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma expander versus placebo, no intervention, or a different plasma expander in connection with paracentesis for ascites in people with cirrhosis. We considered quasi-randomised, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials only, for reports on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) using the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, based on the intention-to-treat principle, whenever possible. If the fixed-effect and random-effects models showed different results, then we made our conclusions based on the analysis with the highest P value (the more conservative result). We assessed risks of bias of the individual trials using predefined bias risk domains. We assessed the certainty of the evidence at an outcome level, using GRADE, and constructed 'Summary of Findings' tables for seven of our review outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 27 randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this review (24 published as full-text articles and 3 as abstracts). Five of the trials, with 271 participants, assessed plasma expanders (albumin in four trials and ascitic fluid in one trial) versus no plasma expander. The remaining 22 trials, with 1321 participants, assessed one type of plasma expander, i.e. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, polygeline, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus another type of plasma expander, i.e. albumin in 20 of these trials and polygeline in one trial. Twenty-five trials provided data for quantitative meta-analysis. According to the Child-Pugh classification, most participants were at an intermediate to advanced stage of liver disease in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were assessed as at overall high risk of bias. Ten trials seemed not to have been funded by industry; twelve trials were considered unclear about funding; and five trials were considered funded by industry or a for-profit institution. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion on mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.83; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.88; 181 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.27; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.40; 158 participants; 3 trials; very low certainty). Two of the trials stated that no serious adverse events occurred while the remaining trials did not report on this outcome. No trial reported data on health-related quality of life. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between experimental plasma expanders versus albumin on mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 1014 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty); serious adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 8.30; 118 participants; 2 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 1107 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48; 1083 participants; 16 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.85; 977 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty). We found no data on heath-related quality of life and refractory ascites.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not find any benefits or harms of plasma expanders versus no plasma expander or of one plasma expander such as polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus albumin on primary or secondary outcomes. The data originated from few, small, mostly short-term trials at high risks of systematic errors (bias) and high risks of random errors (play of chance). GRADE assessments concluded that the evidence was of very low certainty. Therefore, we can neither demonstrate or discard any benefit of plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion, and differences between one plasma expander versus another plasma expander. Larger trials at low risks of bias are needed to assess the role of plasma expanders in connection with paracentesis. Such trials should be conducted according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

### Use of albumin in the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. An independent verdict [^708e20db]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

The use of intravenous albumin in cirrhosis has been reactivated during the last two decades. During this period several investigations have shown that albumin (1) prevents circulatory dysfunction in patients with massive ascites treated by paracentesis, (2) prevents circulatory dysfunction and type-1 HRS and increases survival in patients with SBP, and (3) in association with vasoconstrictors normalizes circulatory function and serum creatinine and increases survival in patients with type-1 HRS. Indications 2 and 3 are clear. There is discussion, however, regarding indication number 1. Although no significant differences in survival have been observed in trials comparing patients treated by paracentesis with and without albumin, in none of these studies was survival an end-point of the trial. In contrast, there is evidence that paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction is associated with a bad outcome. In consequence, although further studies on this indication are clearly required, with the current data it is advisable to use albumin as a plasma expander in patients with massive ascites treated by paracentesis.

Key messages

- Cardiac index in cirrhotic patients with hepato-renal syndrome may be fluid-responsive despite normal central venous pressure and global end-diastolic volume.

- Intra-abdominal hypertension, caused by ascites, can be reduced by paracentesis, resulting in a net increase in renal perfusion pressure.

- After paracentesis, fluid substitution can be titrated to keep global end-diastolic volume constant, and creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium may increase.

- In cirrhotic intensive care patients with intra-abdominal hypertension caused by ascites resulting from fluid therapy, paracentesis is a safe procedure.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^8394a36c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Besides the increased incidence of clinical end points in patients with drainage of 1.5 L/d or more, we observed a significant decrease of serum sodium while leucocyte count and C-reactive protein increased in patients with taps of 1.5 L/d or more after 28 days, similar to patients undergoing LVP without albumin infusion. Interestingly, this was not the case in patients with daily drainage of 1.5 L/d or less. In the setting of LVP without albumin substitution, postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) occurs frequently and is most likely the result of effective blood volume reduction.PPCD is associated with AKI, hyponatremia, and decreased survival. Repeated low-volume paracentesis of 1.5 L/d or more might have led to a PPCD-like state over time and could explain the clinical observations in our cohort. Data about the potential associations of repeated low-volume drainage regarding an altered clinical course and the occurrence of PPCD are scarce, and it has been suggested that removal of less than 5 L ascites per drain does rarely lead to PPCD, at least in the setting of a single paracentesis. Thus, albumin infusion in these patients remains a matter of debate. However, PPCD has already been reported in patients with Alfapump, and our data indicate that complications occur with increasing drainage volumes, even in the setting of low-volume paracentesis. In our cohort, none of the patients received regular albumin infusion after drainage and albumin was only administered for other indications like SBP, AKI, or hyponatremia. Strikingly, albumin infusion can effectively prevent PPCD and is recommended after paracentesis of more than 5 L. Thus, it is tempting to estimate that albumin infusion could decrease complications in individuals with daily drains of 1.5 L/d or more. Treatment could be adapted in those who are in need of taps of 1.5 L/d or more. One could only drain less than 1.5 L/d and perform LVP every few weeks (via the device) with albumin infusion in an outpatient unit. However, this would contradict the idea of home-based therapy. Another potential option could be drainage of 1.5 L/d or more and infusion of albumin with the help of a dedicated care service, in the same manner as palliative patients receive infusions in a home-based care. Future studies might therefore investigate the association of albumin infusions, especially in those with higher daily drainage volumes.

Crystalloid versus Colloid

Whether colloids have a role in surgery has been debated and studied. Colloids, specifically hydroxyethyl starch solutions, initially held promise as a way to minimize overall volume of fluids administered, but have been shown to be nephrotoxic in the intensive care setting. – While the nephrotoxic effect was not replicated in surgical populations, strong evidence of coagulopathy, bleeding, and transfusionprompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland) to issue a black box warning in 2013 and the European Medicines Agency (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) to suspend marketing authorization in 2018. Widespread use of the synthetic colloid hydroxyethyl starch waned behind mounting evidence of potential clinical harm; however, whether this risk persists with human-derived albumin (the primary colloid replacement for hydroxyethyl starch) remained unresolved.

Albumin is routinely utilized in cardiac surgery to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and for volume replacement, although evidence supporting such practice is limited or conflicting. The randomized, double-blind, single-center Albumin in Cardiac Surgery (ALBICS) trial showed no difference in major adverse events (a composite including AKI) between cardiac surgery patients with albumin or lactated Ringer's solution use for cardiopulmonary bypass priming fluid and perioperative volume replacement, suggesting that routine use of albumin did not provide any benefit for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A recent meta-analysis confirmed this finding, leading to the conclusion that albumin should be used restrictively in cardiac surgery.

Data on the perioperative use of albumin is almost nonexistent outside of cardiac surgery. The Choosing Wisely in Anesthesiology Initiative stated that routine administration of colloid for volume resuscitation "without appropriate indication" is one of the top five "low-value" activities in the field of anesthesiology; however, it did not give guidance on when albumin might be indicated. Ongoing research seeks to better define populations that may derive benefit. Albumin may have a limited role in specific surgical populationsincluding hepatorenal syndrome, – spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or after paracentesis in liver failure patients. –

### Prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhosis: standard vs half albumin doses. A prospective, randomized, unblinded pilot study [^dd2cf344]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction is a well-known complication of large volume paracentesis. Albumin infusion (8g of albumin/L of ascites removed) is effective in preventing it, but high costs and scant availability limit its use.

Aim

To compare standard vs half albumin doses.

Methods

Seventy cirrhotic patients treated with large volume paracentesis were randomized to receive intravenous albumin as prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction: group 1 (35 patients) received 4g/L of ascites removed, group 2 (35 patients) received 8g/L of ascites removed.

Results

The incidence of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (14% vs 20% in group 1 and group 2, respectively; p = ns), hyponatremia (9% vs 6%, p = ns) and renal impairment (0% in both groups) on the 6th day from paracentesis was similar between the two groups. After 6 months of follow-up, rates of survival and of recurrence of ascites requiring large volume paracentesis were not different between the two groups.

Conclusions

This unblinded, randomized, pilot study suggests that treatment with half doses of albumin is effective in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and its related clinical complications in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites treated by large volume paracentesis. If confirmed, these results could support a significant costs reduction in the management of ascites in cirrhotic patients.

### The combination of octreotide and midodrine is not superior to albumin in preventing recurrence of ascites after large-volume paracentesis [^5bbe51d6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is the treatment of choice for patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. However, LVP can lead to postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), which is associated with faster ascites recurrence and renal failure. PCD results from vasodilatation, which reduces effective blood volume, and is prevented by intravenous administration of albumin. Vasoconstrictors could be used instead of albumin and, with longer use, prevent PCD and delay ascites recurrence.

Methods

We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare albumin with the vasoconstrictor combination of octreotide and midodrine in patients with refractory ascites who underwent LVP. Patients in the albumin group received a single intravenous dose of albumin at the time of LVP plus placebos for midodrine and octreotide (n = 13). Patients in the vasoconstrictor group received saline solution (as a placebo for albumin), 10 mg of oral midodrine (3 times/day), and a monthly 20-mg intramuscular injection of long-acting octreotide (n = 12). Patients were followed up until recurrence of ascites.

Results

The median times to recurrence of ascites were 10 days in the albumin group and 8 days in the vasoconstrictor group (P = 0.318). There were no significant differences in PCD between the albumin group (18%) and the vasoconstrictor group (25%, P = 0.574). When ascites recurred, serum levels of creatinine were higher in the vasoconstrictor group (1.2 vs 0.9 mg/dL in the albumin group; P = 0.051).

Conclusions

The combination of midodrine and octreotide after LVP is not superior to albumin in delaying recurrence of ascites or preventing PCD in patients with cirrhosis. Outcomes appear to be worse in patients given octreotide and midodrine. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00108355.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^4b20f5da]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Despite the common use of albumin during cardiovascular surgery, little evidence supports the use of albumin to improve patient outcomes. The largest study to date performed in 1,386 patients at a single center, Albumin in Cardiac Surgery, found increased morbidity when albumin was compared with Ringer's lactate. Albumin in Cardiac Surgery was performed predominantly in low-risk cardiac surgery, and therefore, its role in improving outcomes in high-risk cardiac surgery has yet to be studied (a 590-patient RCT is underway, Albumin in Cardiac Surgery Australia; Identifier, ACTRN12619001355167).

### Albumin in advanced liver diseases: the good and bad of a drug! [^ada28ab7]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, and it regulates diverse body functions. In patients with advanced and decompensated cirrhosis, serum albumin levels are low because of a reduction in the hepatocyte mass due to disease per se and multiple therapeutic interventions. Because of their oncotic and nononcotic properties, administration of human albumin solutions (HAS) have been found to be beneficial in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or who have hepatorenal syndrome or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Albumin also improves the functionality of the immune cells and mitigates the severity and risk of infections in advanced cirrhosis. Its long-term administration can modify the course of decompensated cirrhosis patients by reducing the onset of new complications, improving the quality of life, and probably providing survival benefits. There is, however, a need to rationalize the dose, duration, and frequency of albumin therapy in different liver diseases and stages of cirrhosis. In patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, potentially toxic oxidized isoforms of albumin increase substantially, especially human nonmercaptalbumin and 2, and nitrosoalbumin. The role of administration of HAS in such patients is unclear. Determining whether removal of the pathological and dysfunctional albumin forms in these patients by "albumin dialysis" is helpful, requires additional studies. Use of albumin is not without adverse events. These mainly include allergic and transfusion reactions, volume overload, antibody formation and coagulation derangements. Considering their cost, limited availability, need for a health care setting for their administration, and potential adverse effects, judicious use of HAS in liver diseases is advocated. There is a need for new albumin molecules and economic alternatives in hepatologic practice.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^8f2b83c1]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Vasoconstrictors after large-volume paracentesis (LVP): A meta-analysis including 5 small studies totaling 80 patients found no differences in PCD between albumin and vasoconstrictors; another small randomized trial comparing albumin with octreotide plus midodrine in 25 patients found no differences in PCD or recurrence of ascites but more AKI in the vasoconstrictor group; therefore, evidence is insufficient to recommend this strategy unless confirmed by larger trials with relevant outcomes such as AKI.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^0e60b9db]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It consists of compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages; median survival is more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. With each stage, there is progressive worsening of portal hypertension and the vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, resulting in a progressive decrease in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion. Vasoconstrictors reduce portal pressure via splanchnic vasoconstriction and are used in the management of variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin increases effective arterial blood volume and is used in the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is used in the reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis. Because a potent vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and because recent trials have explored use of IV albumin in other settings, it was considered that a best practice update would be relevant regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in the following 3 specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Some of the statements are unchanged from published guidelines because of lack of new evidence in the literature. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality and evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: After initial endoscopic hemostasis, vasoactive drugs should be continued for 2–5 days to prevent early rebleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Octreotide is the vasoactive drug of choice in the management of variceal hemorrhage based on its safety profile. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: IV albumin should be administered at the time of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: IV albumin may be considered in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Albumin should not be used in patients (hospitalized or not) with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Vasoconstrictors should not be used in the management of uncomplicated ascites, after large-volume paracentesis or in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: IV albumin is the volume expander of choice in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with AKI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vasoactive drugs (eg, terlipressin, norepinephrine, and combination of octreotide and midodrine) should be used in the treatment of HRS-AKI, but not in other forms of AKI in cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Terlipressin is the vasoactive drug of choice in the treatment of HRS-AKI and use of concurrent albumin can be considered when accounting for patient's volume status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Terlipressin treatment does not require intensive care unit monitoring and can be administered intravenously through a peripheral line. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Terlipressin use is contraindicated in patients with hypoxemia and in patients with ongoing coronary, peripheral, or mesenteric ischemia, and should be used with caution in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3. The benefits may not outweigh the risks in patients with serum creatinine > 5 mg/dL and in patients listed for transplantation with a Model for End-stage Liver Disease ≥ 35.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^453ceae3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) in refractory ascites — definition, role, and albumin dosing are as follows: LVP, arbitrarily defined as a paracentesis of > 5 L, has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of RA, and LVP is the first-line treatment for RA. Albumin infusion at the time of LVP of > 5 L is recommended to mitigate the risk of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD); the recommended dose of albumin replacement, based on expert opinion, is 6–8 g for every liter of ascites removed, with practical examples that after the fifth liter, approximately 40 g of albumin should be infused, and after 8 L removed, the amount of albumin given should be approximately 64 g. The risk of PPCD may increase with > 8 L of fluid evacuated in one single session, and a recent study showed that by limiting the LVP volume to < 8 L per session and providing a higher than recommended dose of albumin (9.0 ± 2.5 g per liter of ascites removed), renal function and survival may be better preserved over a mean period of 2 years despite the development of PPCD in 40% of patients. In patients with hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmol/L), and/or the presence of AKI, albumin infusion should be strongly considered for paracenteses of a smaller volume.

### Improving appropriate use of intravenous albumin: results of a single-centre audit and multifaceted intervention [^0762bd39]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous albumin is used in many clinical scenarios, either as an iso-oncotic (4–5%, 250–500 mL) or as a hyper-oncotic (20–25%, 100 mL) formulation. The iso-oncotic preparation is employed for volume expansion, and the hyper-oncotic formulation is used for restoration of oncotic pressureor mobilisation of fluid from extravascular spaces. Although used broadly in the hospitalised patient, albumin has only been shown in trials to have potential benefits in patients with complications of cirrhosis. Albumin reduces the incidence of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, although the impact on patient-important outcomes is less clear. Albumin appears to also reduce mortality and renal failure in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Albumin is also commonly employed in hepatorenal syndrome, although no randomised trials of albumin compared with no albumin have been conducted.

Outside of patients with complications of cirrhosis, large randomised trials have compared intravenous albumin with crystalloids in critical care patients, adult and paediatric patients with sepsis and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Collectively, these trials find patient-important outcomes with albumin no better than crystalloid but care markedly more expensive. More recent evidence also suggests that adverse consequences of albumin have been underappreciated, such as volume overload, anaphylaxis, more red cell transfusions and peripheral gangrene. These trials have called into question the common use of albumin in patients without cirrhosis.

Published audits of albumin usage from different countries have found that albumin is regularly prescribed for non-evidence-based indications and is generally over-prescribed. Albumin utilisation doubled in Ontario, Canada, between 2000 and 2017, with only 22% of orders being transfused to patients with cirrhosis. To mitigate unnecessary albumin usage and wastage, we undertook a single-centre, multifaceted quality improvement project to align albumin prescribing with published evidence.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^7ffe9df6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Management of HRS-AKI — prevention focuses on modifiable triggers and cautious albumin use, noting uncertain long-term benefit. Prevention measures include "avoidance of alcohol use, monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolytes when patients are on diuretics, albumin infusion with therapeutic paracentesis, administering antibiotics with episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and avoiding use of nonselective beta-blockers and nephrotoxic medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs". It is stated that "It is unclear whether long-term albumin infusion prevents HRS. Long-term albumin administration reduced the likelihood of developing HRS and improved 18-month survival in one study, but the results were not replicated in another study". Patients "may derive most benefit when the serum albumin is kept above 4 g/ dL", and clinicians should recognize that "Albumin infusion may be associated with volume overload and life-threatening pulmonary edema".

### Is the use of albumin of value in cirrhosis? The case not so in favour, or is there an alternative? [^c42703a8]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

A decreased effective arterial blood volume is the principal haemodynamic disturbance in cirrhosis, leading to activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone and the sympathetic nervous systems, sodium and water retention and renal impairment. Albumin is a plasma expander that could be used in clinical settings in cirrhosis in which plasma expansion would reverse some of the decreased effective arterial blood volume, or prevent its iatrogenic (i.e., paracenteses) or spontaneous worsening (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). However, apart from the issue of transmission of prion agents, which may become an important issue in clinical risk management of the use of albumin in the future, the problem with albumin is its expense. Every effort must thus be made to definitely prove albumin is always the best colloid for all clinical settings in cirrhosis. Further randomized trials are justified.

### Is the use of albumin of value in the treatment of ascites in cirrhosis? The case in favour [^50c141e7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis, ascites accumulates because of sodium retention, triggered by a reduction of the effective arterial blood volume, and imbalanced Starling forces in the splanchnic area due to portal hypertension and hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is the ideal plasma expander in this setting, since it ameliorates systemic and reneal haemodynamics, so reducing sodium retention, and increases oncotic pressure in the splanchnic compartment. In particular, albumin proved useful in patients treated with diuretics, as demonstrated by a randomised study performed at our Instituition in which 126 ascitic inpatients were treated according to a stepped-care diuretic regimen. In fact, patients receiving diuretics plus albumin (n = 63) had a higher cummulative rate of response (p < 0.05) and a shorter hospital stay (20 ± 1 versus 24 ± 2 days, p < 0.05) than those given diuretics alone. Treatment with albumin on an outpatient basis (25 g/week) resulted in a lower probability of developing ascites (p < 0.02 vs. patients not given albumin) and a lower probability of readmission (p < 0.02). Patients given albumin also had a better quality of life. As discussed in another article, evidence also supports the use of albumin in patients treated for paracentesis, as well as in patients with spontaneous peritonitis or hepatorenal syndrome.

### Effects of plasma expansion with albumin and paracentesis on haemodynamics and kidney function in critically ill cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective uncontrolled trial [^03a1998f]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study indicates that the expansion of central blood volume is possible even in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The ensuing circulatory changes are small, however, and renal effects were not visible with the amount of albumin solution used in our study. After paracentesis there was a marked decrease in IAP and RPP. Under substitution of albumin and fluids to maintain central blood volume, there was a simultaneous improvement of renal function that may be relevant in patients with end-stage liver disease.

### Albumin: pathophysiologic basis of its role in the treatment of cirrhosis and its complications [^5203db75]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of human serum albumin as a plasma expander in the 1940s, considerable research has allowed a better understanding of its biochemical properties and potential clinical benefits. Albumin has a complex structure, which is responsible for a variety of biological functions. In disease, the albumin molecule is susceptible to modifications that may alter its biological activity. During the last decades, different methods to measure albumin function have been developed. Recent studies have shown that not only albumin concentration but also albumin function is reduced in liver failure. This observation led to the concept of effective albumin concentration, which represents the fact that plasma albumin concentration does not reflect its function. Indeed, in liver disease albumin function is several times less than its concentration. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin infusion reduces mortality in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and improves outcome following large volume paracentesis. In combination with vasoconstrictors, albumin is useful in the management of patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Its role is being investigated in a large number of indications, which rely on its volume and nonvolume expansion functions such as stroke, severe sepsis, Alzheimer's disease, malaria, burns, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This review explores the above concepts, reviews the available evidence for the use of albumin in liver diseases, defines therapeutic limitations, and explores the challenges that should be addressed in future research.

### Effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients [^6d02a8fc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this trial we analyzed the effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients.

According to the results of our study, no relevant impairment of circulatory function was observed whereas renal function in terms of urine output improved following removal of ascites. Furthermore, paracentesis is related to immediate and sustained improvement of respiratory function. The median oxygenation ratio of all patients increased, whereas PaCO₂ remained stable after paracentesis.

Patients with tense ascites often display signs of circulatory dysfunction. Portal hypertension leads to vasodilatation of splanchnic vessels, leading to decreased peripheral resistance, decreased effective central blood volume with consequent arterial hypotension and hyperdynamic circulation. These changes finally result in activation of vasoconstrictor systems, the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, as well as increased levels of antidiuretic hormone, water retention and renal vasoconstriction, possibly ending in renal failure. Infusion of albumin is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) for large volume paracentesis (> 5 Liter), because intravenously administered albumin increases the effective arterial blood volume and improves serum sodium concentrations in patients with cirrhosis and severe hyponatremia. However, albumin does not interfere with the main mechanisms of ascites formation and therefore only prevents complications of paracentesis rather than prevents the recurrence of ascites.

### Albumin infusion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^060499d6]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Albumin infusion reduces the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction among patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites, as compared with no treatment. Treatment alternatives to albumin, such as artificial colloids and vasoconstrictors, have been widely investigated. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether morbidity and mortality differ between patients receiving albumin versus alternative treatments. The meta-analysis included randomized trials evaluating albumin infusion in patients with tense ascites. Primary endpoints were postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction, hyponatremia, and mortality. Eligible trials were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic and abstract databases and the Cochrane Library. Results were quantitatively combined under a fixed-effects model. Seventeen trials with 1,225 total patients were included. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. Compared with alternative treatments, albumin reduced the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.55). Significant reductions in that complication by albumin were also shown in subgroup analyses versus each of the other volume expanders tested (e.g., dextran, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch, and hypertonic saline). The occurrence of hyponatremia was also decreased by albumin, compared with alternative treatments (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39–0.87). In addition, mortality was lower in patients receiving albumin than alternative treatments (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41–0.98).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis provides evidence that albumin reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with tense ascites undergoing large-volume paracentesis, as compared with alternative treatments investigated thus far.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^783b7f0c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure with overall risks cited around 1‐2%. We aimed to focus on risks associated with post‐paracentesis AKI and bleeding as the most studied complications. We did not investigate the incidence of other complications given low rate of occurrence (one perforation in our cohort), and we typically utilize surgical glue prophylactically to minimize ascites and anasarca leak, which would affect overall incidence.

Prior studies have shown that there is a 5%–10% risk of developing AKI with increased risk associated with higher MELD score and younger age. Our study identified a similar risk of AKI (10%–12%) and found an association with a higher MELD‐Na score but no association with respect to age. It has previously been found that there is a 1.24x risk for each liter of fluid drained, but we did not find any correlation between volume removed and AKI. We did find that patients with clinical deterioration as an indication for paracentesis were at higher risk of developing AKI post‐paracentesis. Although we did not collect data regarding IV albumin administration, a strength of this study is that our institution strictly follows the AASLD guidelines for albumin administration, which is further reinforced by our MPS postprocedure. Our findings support that paracentesis, regardless of volume, is well tolerated by the kidneys when guideline‐recommended albumin repletion is used, but clinicians should weigh the risk of AKI against the symptomatic relief provided by therapeutic paracentesis in the clinically deteriorating patient.

Serious hemorrhagic complications of paracentesis have been seen both with LVP and diagnostic paracentesis and are categorized into three groups: abdominal wall hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and hemoperitoneum. Mallory and Schaefer evaluated 242 diagnostic abdominal paracenteses in patients with liver disease and reported four patients with serious hemorrhagic complications (1.7%), which was significantly higher than previously published data. McVay and Toy reviewed 608 procedures in 395 patients and found the incidence of significant bleeding (defined as more than a 2 g/dL drop) was 3.1%. Delayed bleeding has also been described and could be due to rapid decompression of splanchnic circulation related to a sudden decrease in intraabdominal pressure leading to increased portal pressures and varix rupture. Higher rates of bleeding have been seen in patients with higher Child‐Pugh and MELD scores. Previous studies have also found a significant association between AKI and bleeding risk.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^d68d3076]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AGA best practice advice 2 — preventive measures against AKI in cirrhosis include avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), avoidance of excessive or unmonitored diuretics or nonselective beta-blockade, avoidance of large-volume paracentesis without albumin replacement, and counseling patients to avoid alcohol use.

### Effects of plasma expansion with albumin and paracentesis on haemodynamics and kidney function in critically ill cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective uncontrolled trial [^eee66bc7]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Several studies focused on the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction or on the prevention of hepato-renal failure in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. For both indications, plasma expansion with human albumin has become firmly established. The treatment of HRS, once it has occurred, has been addressed by other studies, mainly focusing on the effect of vasopressors, but suggesting that plasma expansion with albumin may be an important part of the treatment.

The present study was undertaken in cirrhotic intensive care patients with advanced cirrhosis, tense ascites and acute renal failure that persisted after fluid resuscitation but without evidence of intrinsic kidney disease. The aim was to investigate the single and combined haemodynamic and renal effects of plasma expansion by infusion of albumin and of the decrease in intra-abdominal pressure by paracentesis under the condition of parameter-guided maintenance of central volume.

### Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction with modest-volume paracentesis is partly ameliorated by albumin infusion in acute-on-chronic liver failure [^06fc841f]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a serious complication of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis in cirrhosis and is reduced with albumin infusion. There is a lack of data on PICD in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Because ACLF patients have greater hemodynamic derangements than patients with decompensated cirrhosis, we investigated whether PICD could develop with modest-volume paracentesis (MVP) and the role of albumin infusion.

Approach and Results

A total of 80 ACLF patients undergoing < 5 L paracentesis were randomized to receive albumin (8 g/dL of ascitic fluid; n = 40) or no albumin (n = 40) and serially followed to detect PICD. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, including volume of ascitic tap (4.16 ± 0.23 versus 4.14 ± 0.27 L; P = 0.72) and plasma renin activity (PRA; 20.5 ± 7.03 versus 23.2 ± 8.24 ng/mL/hour; P = 0.12). PICD was more frequent in the no-albumin group than the albumin group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.001), with higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (50% versus 27.5%; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (67.5% versus 22.5%; P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (62.5% versus 30%; P = 0.001), and in-house mortality (62.5% versus 27.5%; P = 0.003). PRA of 25.15 ng/mL at day 3 had sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 68%, respectively, for development of PICD at day 6. Albumin infusion decreased the incidence of PICD at day 6 (odds ratio, 0.068; 95% confidence interval, 0.011–0.43; P = 0.005).

Conclusions

PICD is common and develops even with MVP in ACLF patients. Albumin infusion decreases the incidence of PICD and mortality in patients with ACLF. Clinical trial identifier: NCT02467348.

### Midodrine versus albumin in the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotics: a randomized pilot study [^28674067]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intravenous albumin has been used to prevent paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) in cirrhotics; however, its use is costly and controversial. Splanchnic arterial vasodilatation is primarily responsible for PICD. There are no reports of use of midodrine in the prevention of PICD. In this pilot study, we evaluated midodrine and albumin in the prevention of PICD.

Methods

Forty patients with cirrhosis underwent therapeutic paracentesis with midodrine or albumin in a randomized controlled trial at a tertiary center. Effective arterial blood volume was assessed by plasma renin activity.

Results

Plasma renin activity at baseline and at 6 days after paracentesis did not differ in the two groups (43.18 ± 10.73 to 45.90 ± 8.59 ng/mL/h, P = 0.273 in the albumin group and 44.44 ± 8.44 to 41.39 ± 10.21 ng/mL/h, P = 0.115 in the midodrine group). Two patients had an increase in plasma renin activity of more than 50% from baseline in the albumin group, and none in the midodrine group. A significant increase in 24-h urine volume and urine sodium excretion was noted in the midodrine group. Midodrine therapy was cheaper than albumin therapy.

Conclusions

The study suggests that midodrine may be as effective as albumin in preventing PICD in cirrhotics, but at a fraction of the cost, and can be administered orally. Midodrine also resulted in an increase in 24-h urine volume and sodium excretion.

Large volume paracentesis (LVP) in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) among critically ill acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients — We suggest not performing large volume paracentesis (LVP) in critically ill ACLF patients with SBP (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). LVP is defined as removing greater than 4 L of ascitic fluid; in a randomized comparison of LVP plus albumin versus diuretics plus albumin in cirrhotic patients with SBP, there were no statistically significant differences for mortality, renal impairment, or resolution of SBP.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^e75a2a93]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for select patient populations have been published in some jurisdictions, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. The British Society for Gastroenterology published guidelines on the management of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. They recommend albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The French Society of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and the French Association for the Study of the Liver jointly released guidelines for the management of liver failure in critical care. They recommend the use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (with terlipressin), large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines from 2021recommend the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis, severe muscle cramps, severe hyponatremia (sodium < 120 mEq/L), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The Italian Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Italian Society for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology guidelines update from 2020 include the use of albumin for ascites requiring moderate doses of diuretics as an outpatient treatment. This was an update from their 2016 guidelines that also recommended the use of albumin in patients requiring large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or with hepatorenal syndrome. Similarly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 guidelines detailing the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis recommended albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with acute kidney injury without known cause, or with hepatorenal syndrome. The ICTMG guidelines are concordant with these guidelines for recommending albumin for large-volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but report insufficient evidence to support its use in other settings. The use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome, in conjunction with terlipressin, was recommended commonly in prior guidelines, likely based on both expert opinion and the fact that randomized trials used albumin in both treatment arms (albumin vs albumin plus terlipressin). We elected to refrain from making a recommendation without clinical trial evidence to support its use and highlight that this indication needs further study.

How should ascites be managed in the intraoperative or postoperative period?

Recommendation

Albumin administration can be considered as part of intraoperative fluid management to help avoid PPCD related to intraoperative ascites evacuation, based on its benefit in PPCD prevention in non-operative situations such as LVP. TIPS should be considered postoperatively in patients with ascites that is refractory to medical management.

No recommendation is made for or against the routine use of intra-abdominal drains. If used, drains should be removed as soon as feasible.

### The effect of albumin administration in critically ill patients: a retrospective single-center analysis [^c4f3b262]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Nearly 21,000 ICU cases over 9-year period were examined in this study. Although crystalloids have slightly diminished, the use of albumin has increased at the University Hospital Basel. This increase is seen in most ICU patients and is particularly evident in patients undergoing surgery, transfusion, and in septic shock patients. However, the number of patients with liver cirrhosis treated with albumin has remained similar throughout the study period. This is most likely due to albumin substitution after paracentesis for ascites drain and the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. Further, over the course of the 9-year study period albumin was given to less ill patients as can be seen by the decrease in SAPS-II among patients in the albumin group.

This study established a drop in hemoglobin approximately 20–30 minutes after albumin administration, which remained lower for at least 12 hours. The amount of albumin administered and the osmolality of the compound directly relate to the decrease in hemoglobin and, thus, the effect on plasma volume. The isooncotic solutions, in particular, showed a more considerable decrease in hemoglobin. It is unclear whether the administration of albumin, which lowered hemoglobin, played a role in the increase of transfused patients. However, it cannot be ruled out that in some cases the hemoglobin fell below the threshold to qualify for RBC transfusion. It is also possible that the administration of albumin may have unmasked an underlying anemia associated with reduced plasma volume, resulting in the need for RBC transfusions.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: new concepts and perspectives [^073b9870]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding circulatory abnormalities in cirrhosis led to development of several therapeutic strategies, which are currently used in clinical practice, to improve/prevent kidney complications, including blockade of sodium retaining factors and/or treatment with vasoconstrictor drugs. Some of these strategies include the intravenous administration of albumin with the objective of improving arterial underfilling. Currently, accepted indications of albumin include prevention of circulatory dysfunction following large-volume paracentesis, prevention of HRS in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and management of HRS in association with vasoconstrictor drugs.

On this background, the current article reviews the new concepts on pathogenesis of cirrhosis progression, in particular the role of systemic inflammation in the development of complications of cirrhosis and ACLF, and the potential role of albumin to prevent disease progression and reduce the inflammatory status.

Compared to alternative treatments, administration of 20–25% albumin (6–8 g for every litre over 5 L of ascites removed) during LVP is associated with lower incidence of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, a known trigger for AKI, specifically HRS-AKI. In patients with refractory ascites, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been shown to be effective at controlling ascites and may thereby prevent the development of HRS-AKI. An implantable medical device, alfapump ® (Sequana Medical NV, Ghent, Belgium) enables mobilization of ascitic fluid to the bladder for urinary excretion and has been shown to reduce the frequency of LVPs in patients with refractory ascites. However, it is not widely available and has been associated with AKI if the volume of ascites removed early after insertion is high, thus regular administration of albumin may be required to prevent AKI. –

What diagnostic tools should be included in the work-up of patients with cirrhosis and AKI?

Consensus statements

We recommend using similar tools for the diagnostic work-up for AKI in patients with cirrhosis as used in those without cirrhosis (best practice statement).
We suggest using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) eGFR equation without the race variable, and preferably with cystatin C (CysC), for assessment of kidney function, though the performance at low GFR and in those with ascites may be suboptimal (weak recommendation, grade B).
In addition to SCr, we suggest complementary use of functional and damage-related markers to aid in timely detection of AKI, characterisation of different AKI phenotypes and to guide treatment strategies (weak recommendation, grade B).

Rationale:

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with cirrhosis and AKI includes clinical history, assessment of intravascular volume status, and detection of potential precipitants. Assessment of intravascular volume remains challenging as most currently available haemodynamic monitoring tools have not been studied in patients with cirrhosis. Point-of-care ultrasonography has been suggested as a tool to assess volume status at the bedside; however, it is prone to interobserver variability and is challenging to use in patients with significant ascites. – Examination of urinary sediment is difficult in patients with elevated bilirubin levels due to staining of cells and casts. Additionally, significant interobserver variability and discordance with kidney biopsy have been reported. Complications from percutaneous renal biopsy are documented in up to 30% of cases compared to 0.9% in the general population;, however, low complication rates have been reported using the transvenous route, even in patients with coagulation disorders.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^001c8295]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

Post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction in liver cirrhosis with ascites undergoing large volume paracentesis

Guidance Statement 6. Terlipressin could be considered for the prevention of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotic patients with ascites undergoing large volume paracentesis (> 5 L).

Post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) is defined as an increase in plasma renin activity > 50% from baseline within 6 days after large volume paracentesis (LVP), which is defined as the amount of ascites removed is > 5 L, in cirrhotic patients with ascites. It is associated with excessive expansion of arterial capillaries after LVPand causes rapid re-accumulation of ascites and development of hyponatremia and renal dysfunction, thereby increasing the mortality. Human serum albumin is the first-line choice for the prevention of PPCD. Accordingly, LVP should be performed together with the administration of albumin (8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) to prevent from PPCD. Several recent studies also suggested that the use of terlipressin could prevent from PPCD. In an RCT, 40 cirrhotic patients with ascites who underwent LVP were assigned to terlipressin (n = 20) and albumin (n = 20) groups. Terlipressin at a dosage of 1 mg was given by intravenous infusion at the beginning of LVP, 8 h, and 16 h. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were significantly improved at 4–6 days after treatment in both terlipressin and albumin groups, and their benefits in preventing from PPCD were similar. Another RCT involving 20 cirrhotic patients with ascites who underwent LVP demonstrated no significant difference in changes of plasma renin activity 4–6 days after treatment between terlipressin and albumin groups (p = 0.39). Based on the current evidence, we recommend that the dosage of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with ascites who will undergo LVP is 1 mg by intravenous boluses at the beginning of the LVP, 8 h, and 16 h.
