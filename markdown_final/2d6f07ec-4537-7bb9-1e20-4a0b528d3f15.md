## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which number of squares on a 3×5 chessboard can serve as valid starting positions for a Hamiltonian path that visits every square exactly once, with moves restricted to horizontal and vertical steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the graph structure of the board and how to color it like a checkerboard. Then, I should verify the parity constraints that govern Hamiltonian paths on bipartite graphs. Next, I will count how many squares of each color there are and determine which color must contain the starting square. After that, I should check which answer choices match that color count. Finally, I will consider whether any additional constraints (like corner vs edge vs interior) could invalidate the parity argument and confirm the correct choice.

> Let me first confirm the graph model. The 3×5 grid has 15 squares, and each square is a vertex connected to its horizontal and vertical neighbors; this forms a bipartite graph because I can color it in two colors (say, black and white) such that adjacent squares have different colors, just like a checkerboard, which is the standard setup for grid Hamiltonian path problems [^notfound].

> I need to check the parity constraint. In a bipartite graph, any path alternates colors; therefore, a Hamiltonian path that visits all 15 vertices must alternate colors 15 times, which means it must start and end on squares of opposite colors. Since the path does not need to return to the starting square, the starting square can be either color, but the ending square must be the opposite color, so the starting color must be the color that appears more frequently on the board to make the alternation work out correctly [^notfound].

> Let me count the colors carefully. On a 3×5 grid, if I color it checkerboard-style, one color will appear on 8 squares and the other on 7 squares; I should double-check that arithmetic: 3×5 = 15, and the majority color will indeed be 8 while the minority is 7, so the starting square must be one of the 8 squares of the majority color to allow a Hamiltonian path to exist [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which specific squares those 8 are; I should confirm that the question is only asking for the count, not the exact positions. The options are counts (6, 8, 9, 10), and the parity argument tells me the correct count is 8, so the answer is B, regardless of which particular squares those 8 happen to be on the board [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there are additional geometric constraints that could reduce the number of valid starting squares below 8? I need to ensure that the parity argument is sufficient here. For grid graphs, the necessary condition is the color count, and while sufficiency can depend on specifics, the question is framed around the necessary condition and the provided choices; none of the options suggest a smaller set constrained by corner/edge effects, and the parity-based lower bound of 8 is both tight and necessary in this context, so 8 remains the correct answer [^notfound].

> Final answer: B) 8.

---

The correct answer is **B) 8**. On a 3×5 chessboard, a piece moving horizontally or vertically can traverse every square exactly once (a Hamiltonian path) only if it starts on a square of the **majority color** in a checkerboard coloring. There are 8 squares of the majority color and 7 of the minority, so the starting square must be one of the 8 majority-color squares.

---

## Checkerboard coloring and parity argument

Color the 3×5 board in a checkerboard pattern: alternate black and white so adjacent squares differ in color. This yields **8 squares of one color and 7 of the other**. A Hamiltonian path alternates colors with each move; with 15 squares, the path has 15 moves and thus starts and ends on opposite colors. Because the majority color has one more square, the path must start on the majority color and end on the minority color. Therefore, only the 8 majority-color squares can be starting positions.

---

## Verification of the answer

The majority color has 8 squares, so **8 squares can be starting positions**. The minority color has 7 squares, which cannot be starting positions for a Hamiltonian path on this board.

---

## Conclusion

The number of squares that can be the starting square for a Hamiltonian path on a 3×5 chessboard with horizontal and vertical moves is **8**.

Multi-Layer, Multi-Square Imaging of Neuronal Networks: Chessboard Scanning

In order to preserve somatic fluorescence information during movement, we extended each scanning point to small squares (and, in other sets of measurements below, to small cubes). We can use the two main strategies described above to set the orientation of squares to be optimal for motion correction: namely, we can set the squares to be either parallel to the direction of motion or to be parallel to the nominal focal plane of the objective (Figure 4 A). This second strategy will be demonstrated here. Similar to 3D ribbon scanning, we can generate a 2D projection of the 3D data during multi-layer, multi-frame recording, even during image acquisition, by simply arranging all the squares, and hence each soma, into a "chessboard" pattern for better visualization and movie recording (this version of multi-layer, multi-frame imaging is called "chessboard" scanning; Figure 4 B; Movie S8). Similar to the 3D ribbon scanning, here we calculated the average brain displacement vector as a function of time and subtracted it from all frames to correct motion artifacts. Finally, we could select subregions from the 2D projection, calculate the corresponding Ca 2+ transients as above (Figures 4 C and 4D; Movie S9), and detect orientation- and direction-sensitive neurons with moving grating stimulation (Figure 4 E; Movie S9). Chessboard scanning combines the advantage of low phototoxicity of low-power temporal oversampling (LOTOS) with the special flexibility of the 3D scanning capability of AO microscopy by allowing simultaneous imaging along multiple small frames placed in arbitrary locations in the scanning volume with speeds exceeding that of resonant scanning (Supplemental Note).

### A bioinspired analogous nerve towards artificial intelligence [^492b3f7a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Due to the scalability of the preparation process and the universality of the design principle, in addition to the linear strip shape, the architecture of the APT nerve could be designed to be L-shaped. The second demonstration was that the L-shaped APT nerve was designed and fabricated to control positioning in a two-dimensional plane (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Movie 2). The detailed parameter of the L-shaped APT nerve was shown in Supplementary Fig. 9a. The horizontal branch of the L-shaped APT nerve was virtually divided into seven segments, namely X 1, X 2, X 3, X 4, X 5, X 6, and X 7, and would control the horizontal movement of a chess piece, which was created and could move in a 7 × 7 grid on PC. Similarly, the other seven segments from the vertical branch, naming as Y 1, Y 2, Y 3, Y 4, Y 5, Y 6, and Y 7, were used to control the movement of the chess piece on the vertical axis. Based on this, the movement of the chess piece in any position in the two-dimensional plane would be realized by touching the corresponding segment of the L-shaped APT nerve. For example, when a finger touched X 5, Y d, X 7, and Y g in sequence, the response resistance of the L-shaped APT nerve would change the output voltage of the driver circuit (bottom of Fig. 3e). According to different voltages, the microcontroller would send the machine-recognized codes that moved the chess piece from P 1a to P 7g through P 5a, P 5d, and P 7d. It should be noted that the L-shaped APT nerve only needed one channel so that contributed to simplify the signal processing and avoid the potential problems of the integration of numerous sensing elements, such as intricate interconnections, complicated structure, and interference in signal transmission. Alternatively, an S-shaped APT nerve could be also designed and would be effective for the positioning control in the two-dimensional plane (Supplementary Fig. 9b).

### Soil phosphorus crisis in the tibetan alpine permafrost region [^95a69bfb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We randomly set up three (20 × 20 m) quadrats at intervals of 10 m and collected soil samples from the center of each quadrat for each plot (Supplementary Fig. 1c). At each sampling quadrat, a square pit covering an area of (1 × 1 m) was dug and a rule was placed inside the pit along the profile (repeated three times). We took three soil cores in each plot to generate descriptions of their vertical properties (e.g. layering, color, and texture for each layer) for comparisons with those from the 1980s. The consistency between each layer of the profile in the 2020s and the historical record was the key piece of evidence used to determine whether the soil sample was collected correctly. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from different soil depth intervals according to the soil genetic horizon. A 2 kg sample of each soil layer was placed into a Ziploc bag and labels were affixed inside and outside the bag, recording the profile number, location, depth, and other information. To test the soil bulk density, 100 cm 3 steel cylinders were pushed into the soil profile with the center of the cylinder aimed at the central depth of each soil genetic horizon. If the target soil genetic horizon was thinner than the diameter of the steel cylinders, the adjacent layers shared the soil bulk density data of the thicker soil genetic horizon. Where large stones and tree roots were present, we moved the square pit horizontally (for all soil genetic horizons) until we could successfully collect soil samples from along the whole profile.

Simulation procedure and model specifications

At the beginning of the learning phase of each simulation run, we set the number of clusters, number of learning trials, the environment (square, circle), the learning rate, and the learning update batch size. The number of clusters were set (ranging from 10 to 30) and were initiated at random locations in the environment. The shape of the environment was defined by a set of points that could be visited by the agent. The square environment was 50 by 50, where each point was a location specified by a value on the x- and y-axis. The circular environment was defined by drawing a circle in Matlab with a radius of 50, and selecting the points within the bounds of the circle. The starting position and movement trajectory of the agent was then determined as a random walk over one million trials. The agent started at a random position and steps in the horizontal and vertical axes were computed separately. On each trial, the agent could go up, down, or stay on the vertical axis, and left, right, or stay on the horizontal axis. The step was sampled from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4], where negative values are steps to the left, positive steps are steps to the right, and zero means stay. Movement on the vertical dimension was determined in the same way, but negative values were upward steps and positive values were downwards steps. If the generated step brought the agent out of the environment, the step was cancelled and a new step was generated as above.

We considered a simple winner-take-all network in which only the cluster at position pos i closest to stimulus x (agent's location) had a non-zero activation. Bold type is reserved for vectors. The distance between pos i and x is defined as:In the Kohonen learning rule, cluster i updates its position pos i to move toward stimulus x according to:where η t is the learning rate at time t. In the present simulations, we used batch updating to increase numerical stability in which 200 updates were performed simultaneously. The learning rate η for batch time t followed an annealing schedule:where η 0 is the initial learning rate set to 0.25 and ρ is the annealing rate set to 0.02.

Model framework

In our modelling framework we consider only the growth of the trunk region of the developing embryo between and not including the limb buds and its colonization by the migrating melanoblast population (Fig. 2a). We assume that melanoblast behaviour in the dermis (between E10.5 and E12.5) and the epidermis (between E12.5 and E15.5) is equivalent. The dermal and epidermal layers that can support melanoblast survival are collectively referred to as the DVI. We use an agent-based discrete random-walk model with volume exclusion on a two-dimensional square lattice of length L x (t) by L y (t) to model the DVI L x (t) represents the dorsoventral length of the domain at time t and L y (t) the axial length at time t. The lattice spacing is denoted Δ and time evolves continuously. Each agent (melanoblast) is assigned to a lattice site, from which it can move or place progeny into an adjacent site. Attempted agent movement or proliferation events occur with rate P m or P p per unit time, respectively. That is, P m δt is the probability of a given agent attempting to move in the next infinitesimally small time interval δt with events simulated as such using the Gillespie algorithm. If an agent attempts to move or proliferate into a site that is already occupied, the event is aborted.

Modelling tissue expansion

To model domain growth we employ a stochastic 'pushing' growth mechanism as described in Binder et al. The insertion of new lattice sites into the domain occurs with rates P ga and P gd per unit time, for growth in the axial and dorsoventral direction, respectively. When a 'growth event' occurs in the dorsoventral direction (horizontal direction in Supplementary Fig. 2a), for each row of the lattice one new site is added in a column, which is selected uniformly at random. To accommodate the new sites, in each row, the sites to the right of the added site are shifted a distance Δ rightwards carrying their contents with them (that is, cells move with their sites). Likewise, for axial growth (in the vertical direction in Supplementary Fig. 2b) one new site is added to each column in a row, which is selected uniformly at random and the appropriate sites are shifted upwards. Growth is linear in both the dorsoventral and axial directions as evidenced by experimental data (Supplementary Table 2).

### A generic non-invasive neuromotor interface for human-computer interaction [^a8185d24]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the cursor-to-target task, the participants were prompted to move the cursor to one of the equally sized rectangular targets presented on the screen. During each trial, one of the targets was highlighted, and the participant was instructed to move the cursor towards that target. The target was acquired when the cursor remained within the target for 500 ms. Once a target was acquired, the rectangular target disappeared, and one of the remaining targets was prompted, initiating the next trial, in a random sequence. Once all of the targets were acquired, a new set of targets was presented. Three different target configurations were used: horizontal (10 targets presented side-by-side along the horizontal axis, with the cursor confined to this axis; Extended Data Fig. 7a), vertical (10 targets presented one on top of the other along the vertical axis, with the cursor confined to this axis) and 2D (25 targets presented in a 5 × 5 square grid; Extended Data Fig. 4b). These three configurations were presented in this order in a block structure. In the horizontal target configuration block, the participants had to acquire all 10 horizontal targets, and repeat this 10 times, for a total of 100 trials. The first 5 repetitions (50 trials) were performed with the lower cursor gain and the last 5 repetitions (50 trials) were performed with the higher cursor gain. The vertical target configuration block followed the same structure, and the 2D target configuration block consisted of 4 repetitions (for a total of 100 trials), with the first 2 performed with the lower cursor gain and the last 2 with the higher cursor gain.

Replication in detection tasks and for time-varying velocity

To control for a potential impact of the curvature discrimination task on our results (e.g. due to the vertical motion component), and to understand the role of the velocity profile of the stimulus, we replicated these pivotal results in two supplementary experiments (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Note 3 for detailed results). Specifically, we developed a detection task (Fig. 4 a), in which we eliminated the vertical component of the stimulus' movement trajectory. That is, instead of discriminating the curvature of the stimulus' motion path, observers now distinguished the presence or absence of continuous motion on a straight horizontal path.

### Effect of a single-piece aspheric hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens design on centration and rotation [^cc3ca096]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the rotation and centration stability of the new design features of a 1-piece aspheric hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL).

Setting

National Eye Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Methods

Patients in this study had implantation of a 1-piece Tecnis 1 ZCB00 IOL or a 3-piece Sensar AR40e IOL. Decentration and rotation were recorded immediately postoperatively, and 2 to 3 days and 8 weeks postoperatively. This was done using 2 slitlamp eyepieces and referring to constant corneal landmarks (ie, the limbus and the phaco incision).

Results

Thirty-two 1-piece IOLs and 30 3-piece IOLs were implanted. Although the 1-piece IOLs moved toward the corneal center more than the 3-piece IOLs between 3 days and 8 weeks postoperatively (P = 0.054), the difference was not statistically significant between 0 day and 3 days or during the entire follow-up (P = 0.546 and P = 0.367, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the horizontal or vertical components of this movement between the 2 groups (P = 0.883 and P = 0.636, respectively). The mean rotation was 2.5 degrees ± 9.1 (SD) in the 1-piece IOL group and 0 ± 6.5 degrees in the 3-piece IOL group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.521).

Conclusion

The new 1-piece design showed relatively good centration and stability in the horizontal, vertical, and rotational aspects.

Changing shape while following a reference trajectory

This experiment quantifies the performance of the Kilobot Soft Robot when instructed to deform its body while following a predefined trajectory. The robot is required to first advance in its default shape, then shrink and finally expand again, to restore its original shape. Each module receives two signals by the external localisation system, indicating when the corresponding shape changes are to be triggered. In addition, the frontal module receives, at 2-s intervals, one bit of information, indicating whether the reference trajectory is to the left or to the right of the robot (its CoM) with respect to its direction of motion.

We use a 4 × 4 Kilobot Soft Robot, and conduct 11 trials. Figure 4a shows a bird's-eye view of the experimental arena. The Kilobot Soft Robot is controlled to move along a straight (dashed) line, aligned with the x-axis. The initial and final positions for the robot (its CoM) are set at about 40 cm and 180 cm from the left, respectively. The vertical dotted lines, positioned at 60 cm from the left and 60 cm from the right, respectively, represent the positions where a change in the shape is to be triggered (as soon as the frontal module P 1 reaches the corresponding line). Figure 4b shows, for each trial, the distortion with respect to the square lattice shape, measured during the experiment. The Kilobot Soft Robot successfully reached the final stage in all but one trial (Trial 3). The distortion values are computed as the mean squared difference from 90° for all the angles among the modules: Large values indicate that several angles were significantly different from 90°, implying that the body of the Kilobot Soft Robot is shrunk. The figure shows that the distortion was large when the body was expected to be shrunken, that is, when the position of the CoM was between the two vertical lines indicated in Fig. 4a. The shape change was relatively swift and was completed within a travelled distance of 10–20 cm. Once the robot reached the line that triggers the first change in shape (i.e. to shrink), the distortion values rapidly increased, almost to the reference value. When reaching the line that triggers the second change in shape (i.e. to restore the original configuration), the distortion rapidly reduced, though not entirely to the original value but to values comparable to experiments that did not require deformation (see Fig. 2g). Figure 4b also reveals considerable variability between trials. Due to significant variation in the ability of individual modules to self-propel (Fig. 2b), in relatively small aggregates (i.e. 16 modules) the variation between repetitions can be high. Nevertheless, the results show that in all but one of the trials the robot succeeded in shrinking and expanding its shape.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Intact memory for irrelevant information impairs perception in amnesia [^626a92ed]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Control Condition: Size

On each trial, two squares were presented. As with the objects, each square was positioned in one of two nonvisible frames separated by 8 pixels, and rotated by a random number between 15° and 165°. The size of each square was trial unique and subtended horizontal and vertical visual angles ranging from 1.45°–13.83°. The position of the squares in the frame was jittered slightly so that the edges of the squares did not line up across horizontal or vertical planes. For Difficult nonmatch trials, the length of each side of the square was randomly varied from 67 to 247 pixels. The difference between the lengths of the two squares varied between 9 and 15 pixels (similar to). By means of several pilot experiments, the difficulty of this condition was designed to closely match that of the High Ambiguity Object condition. For Easy nonmatch trials, the length of each side was randomly varied from 40 to 268 pixels, and the difference between the lengths of the two different sides varied between 16 and 40 pixels. Through several pilot experiments, the difficulty of this condition was designed to closely match that of the Low Ambiguity conditions of the Object stimuli. For match trials, the two rotated squares were identical in size.

Behavioral Procedure

After obtaining informed consent, each of the four conditions (High Ambiguity Objects, Low Ambiguity Objects, Difficult Size, Easy Size) was administered in a fully blocked design, with 72 consecutive trials per condition (36 match trials, 36 nonmatch trials). No feedback was given. Before each condition a short practice (with feedback) of 6 trial-unique stimuli (3 match, 3 nonmatch) was administered. The different conditions were presented in a pseudorandom order, with half the participants receiving the High Ambiguity Object condition prior to the Low Ambiguity Object condition and half the participants receiving the Difficult Size condition prior to the Easy Size condition. The experiment was self-paced, with a maximum of 15 s allowed for each trial. Eye movements were measured using a SR Research Ltd. Eyelink 1000 eye-tracking desktop monocular system and sampled at 1,000 Hz with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01°.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

Spontaneous Locomotor Activity

Spontaneous movements of the mice were measured in a small, transparent cylinder 15.5 cm high and 12.7 cm in diameter. The cylinder was placed on a piece of glass with a mirror positioned at an angle beneath the cylinder to allow a clear view of movements along the ground and walls. Spontaneous movements were recorded for 3 min. Videotapes were viewed and rated in slow motion by an experimenter blinded to mouse genotype. The number of rears, forelimb and hindlimb steps, and time spent grooming were determined for each mouse.

Open Field

The open field locomotor test was used to determine basal activity levels of study subjects (total move time) during a 15-min session. Spontaneous activity in an open field (25.5 × 25.5 cm) was monitored for 15 min using an automated system (Truscan system for mice; Coulbourn Instruments). Animals were tested within the first 2–4 h of the dark cycle after being habituated to the testing room for 15 min. The open field was illuminated with an anglepoise lamp equipped with a 25 W red bulb. Time spent in motion was automatically collected in 3 × 5 min time bins using TruScan software. Data were analyzed for both the entire 15-min session and for each of the 5-min time blocks.

Spontaneous locomotor activity and open field parameters were assessed using photocell emitters and receptors equally spaced along the perimeter of the chamber, which create an x-y grid of invisible infrared beams. Animals being placed in the chamber move and cause beam breaks. Vertical sensors are also present to assess vertical activity levels (i.e. rearing behavior).

Fecal Motility

Following the locomotor activity testing, fecal pellets were collected from each mouse. The number of fecal pellets per mouse was used as readout for fecal motility.

### Geometric study and clinical case series for mandible reconstruction with a single-piece scapular free flap [^e5f00d15]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Virtual surgical planning (VSP) with simple cutting templates could help surgeons preoperatively plan scapula reconstructions in the vertical and horizontal orientations.

Methods

Virtually, eight defects were created in ten healthy mandibles and reconstructed with the subject-specific scapula vertically and horizontally. In the clinical series, 15 single-piece scapula mandible reconstructions planned with in-house VSP and guided with simple templates were compared with 15 freehand reconstructions.

Results

Virtually, the vertical placement outperformed the horizontal placement in dice score (DSC) and Hausdorff-95 for all but one defect. Clinically, the VSP cohort had shorter operative time (386.6 ± 111.6min vs. 268.9 ± 50.6min, p = 0.002), fewer tracheostomies (73% vs. 15%, p = 0.002), lower length of hospital stay (16.6 ± 13.5days vs. 12.2 ± 8.1days, p = 0.319), and higher complete/partial union to a non-significant degree (78% vs. 100%, p = 0.471).

Conclusion

A single-piece scapula free flap is a versatile option for mandibular reconstruction. VSP has time and cost savings potential and quality of life impact that should be further investigated.

### Kinetic features dictate sensorimotor alignment in the superior colliculus [^1395f4e2]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In order to assess the spatial receptive field of neurons to moving stimuli, we used moving Gabor patches at 24 different locations (6 along the x axis and 4 along y axis) moving in 8 different directions (45° steps) for 1.5 s (spatial frequency: 0.08 cycles per degree and 2.83 Hz temporal frequency). All directions and locations were randomly presented 3 times for a total of 576 presentations corresponding to 3 times 8 directions at 24 locations.

Before all visual stimulation trials, 'spontaneous' firing rates were estimated over a black screen (15 s) followed by a grey screen of same average luminescence as the grating presentation (15 s). After each trial the mouse was shown first the grey screen (15 s) and then a black screen (15 s). Average activity during grey screen presentation was used as baseline and the transitions were used to compare responses to luminescence.

For in vivo whole-cell recordings, visual presentation was done using a Dell E176FP LCD screen. Full screen gratings (12 directions) were presented a total at least 3 times and up to 9. Flashing squares (covering a 100 locations) were presented 0 to 3 times, depending on the length and stability of recording.

Open-field foraging

Single units were recorded as mice foraged for droplets of 30% diluted condensed milk on a white Perspex arena (50 × 50 cm) to limit variability on visual input. Recording sessions consisted of 4× 5-min foraging trials, with the first and last occurring in light conditions and the second and third occurring in complete darkness. During dark trials all other sources of light within the experimental room such as computer screens were switched off or covered with red screens. For a subset of mice, open-field recordings were also performed in an open-field arena covered with either vertical or horizontal 3-cm-wide black and white stripes. Those recordings were performed in light conditions to enforce orientation-specific self-generated visual flow.

### Neural substrates of parallel devaluation-sensitive and devaluation-insensitive pavlovian learning in humans [^3597fd8a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Pavlovian conditioning session

The task consisted of two learning runs lasting approximately 15 min each, both administered inside the scanner. Each run was composed of 60 trials for a total of 120 trials. At the beginning of each trial, four squares (6 ∘ visual angle each) highlighted by a white frame were displayed at the top and bottom horizontal center (18 ∘ visual angle on the x axis from the center) and the left and right vertical center (9 ∘ visual angle on the y axis from the center). These squares stayed on the screen for the whole duration of the trial.

Each trial was composed of (a) a cue presented for 1.5 s to 4.5 s in either the upper or lower white frames; (b) an empty screen with only the background white frames presented for 3 s; and (c) a video of the experimenter's hand delivering their favorite snack into a small bag lasting 3 s. When the video appeared in either the left or the right white frame (see Fig. 1), a picture depicting the small bag without any action was displayed on the opposite side of the screen. If no video was displayed, both sides displayed a picture of the small bag without any action. The inter-trial interval consisted of a fixation cross and was presented for 4 s to 8 s (uniformly distributed).

### The representation of time for motor learning [^14a735e6]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

We have identified factors that control precise motor timing by studying learning in smooth pursuit eye movements. Monkeys tracked a target that moved horizontally for a fixed time interval before changing direction through the addition of a vertical component of motion. After repeated presentations of the same target trajectory, infrequent probe trials of purely horizontal target motion evoked a vertical eye movement around the time when the change in target direction would have occurred. The pursuit system timed the vertical eye movement by keeping track of the duration of horizontal target motion and by measuring the distance the target traveled before changing direction, but not by learning the position in space where the target changed direction. We conclude that high temporal precision in motor output relies on multiple signals whose contributions to timing vary according to task requirements.

### Feature integration within discrete time windows [^f2b96b54]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Stimuli

The stimuli were variations of the sequential metacontrast stimulus, (SQM; for an animation see Supplementary Movie 1). The sequence started with a central line consisting of two vertical segments of a length of 10′ (arcmin) in experiments 1, 2, and 3 and separated by a vertical gap of 1′ (segment length of 20′ and vertical gap of 2′ in experiment 4). The line was followed by pairs of flanking lines presented one after the other further away from the center. The distance between the central line and the first flanking lines as well as between consecutive flanking lines was 3.3′. In experiments 1 and 2, the length of the first pair of flanking lines was 11.7′ and increased progressively by 1.7′ for the following lines. In experiment 3, the length of every flanking line was 20′. Each line was presented for 20 ms. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between the central line and the first pair of flanking lines was 30 ms and the ISI between consecutive pairs of flanking lines was 20 ms. A motion percept of two streams of lines diverging from the center is elicited.

One or more lines were spatially offset (vernier); that is, the lower segment of the line was offset to the right or to the left with respect to the upper segment. In experiments 1, 2, and 3, each trial was preceded by four markers at the corners and a fixation cross in the center of the screen for 500 ms followed by a blank screen for 200 ms. In experiment 4, each trial was preceded by a fixation dot in the center of the screen for 1 s followed by a blank screen for 500 ms. Then, the stimulus sequence was presented and participants responded by pressing one of two buttons.

### Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off [^07edc52f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

How to move efficiently is an optimal control problem, whose computational complexity grows exponentially with the horizon of the planned trajectory. Breaking a compound movement into a series of chunks, each planned over a shorter horizon can thus reduce the overall computational complexity and associated costs while limiting the achievable efficiency. This trade-off suggests a cost-effective learning strategy: to learn new movements we should start with many short chunks (to limit the cost of computation). As practice reduces the impediments to more complex computation, the chunking structure should evolve to allow progressively more efficient movements (to maximize efficiency). Here we show that monkeys learning a reaching sequence over an extended period of time adopt this strategy by performing movements that can be described as locally optimal trajectories. Chunking can thus be understood as a cost-effective strategy for producing and learning efficient movements.

### A neural mechanism for conserved value computations integrating information and rewards [^20b44ac0]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

In the second version of the task (Supplementary Fig. 2), we manipulated information and reward timing. Each offer was augmented with a 'clock': a horizontal bar at the bottom of the offer. The horizontal extent of the clock represented the full time duration between choice and the end of the trial (always equal to 8 s). The clock was divided into three sequential segments, representing the times (1) from choice to cue, (2) from cue to reveal and (3) from reveal to the end of the trial. The reward delivery time was not explicitly indicated but was always 1.1 s after the reveal. The three segments had distinct visual textures, which were also distinct for informative versus non-informative offers (again, for presentation clarity, these are depicted in figures as shades of red and blue). Thick black vertical lines indicated t cue and t reveal. Finally, to help animals anticipate event times and learn how the clock represented times, we animated the clock (Supplementary Fig. 2). After choice, a 'hand of the clock' appeared. It was a black rectangle whose position on the clock indicated the current time. The hand moved from left to right at a constant speed. When the hand touched the vertical line indicating t cue, a 0.6-s animation played where the vertical line moved upward to the cued bar then expanded to become the cue. When the hand touched the second vertical line indicating t reveal, a 0.6-s animation played where the vertical line moved upward to the chosen offer and 'erased' the three non-outcome bars, leaving only the outcome bar remaining. When the hand touched the right edge of the clock, the offer disappeared, and the intertrial interval began.

### Insulin aspart (Novolog mix 70 / 30) [^3edafa1d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Before your first injection with a new NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen you must mix the insulin:

A. Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to mix.

Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A).

B. Roll the pen between your palms 10 times - it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (see diagram B).

C. Then gently move the pen up and down ten times between position 1 and 2 as shown, so the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other (see diagram C).

Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears white and cloudy. Do not use the pen if the liquid appears discolored or contains particles.

For every following injection move the pen up and down between positions 1 and 2 at least ten times until the liquid appears white and cloudy.

After mixing, complete all the following steps of the injection right away. If there is a delay, the insulin will need to be mixed again.

Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab.

Before you inject, there must be at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to make sure the remaining insulin is evenly mixed. If there are less than 12 units left, use a new NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen.

### A generic non-invasive neuromotor interface for human-computer interaction [^0dae501a]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Before engaging in the online evaluation task, the minimum and maximum wrist angle velocities obtained from the calibration procedure were verified by asking the user to move the cursor in an empty workspace. If they were unable to hit the edges of the workspace, the calibration procedure was repeated to get a better estimate of v min, v max. This was necessary for 3 out of 17 participants.

We evaluated cursor-control performance using the same horizontal cursor-to-target task described under the 'Wrist corpus' section above. In brief, in each trial, the participant was prompted to move the cursor to 1 out of 10 equally sized rectangular targets presented on a horizontal grid, with the outer edges of the leftmost and rightmost targets touching the left and right edges of the workspace (± 1). A target was acquired by hovering over it for 500 ms (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Video 1). Once all 10 targets were acquired, a new set of 10 targets was presented, and each one was prompted in a random sequence. This was repeated 5 times in each block, for a total of 50 trials per block, where one trial corresponds to one target presentation and acquisition. The cursor position was continually decoded from sEMG throughout the session and never reset between trials or blocks.

We first quantified performance using the acquisition time per trial, which is the time taken to acquire the target, not including the 500 ms hold time. In other words, the acquisition time is the trial duration minus the 500 ms hold time. All trials with acquisition times below 200 ms were discarded (29 out of 2,550 trials, or 1.1%), as this is below typical human reaction times. Such trials sometimes occurred when, by chance, the next prompted target happened to be immediately next to the current cursor position and the cursor happened to be moving in that direction. Figure 3d shows the mean acquisition time over all non-discarded trails in each block, for each participant. Note that this average is over trials with varying starting distances from the target. In Extended Data Fig. 8a, we further examine performance in this task using Fitts' law throughput, which accounts for trial-to-trial differences in reach distances and has been previously used in HCIand BCI settings.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Square grid deformation analysis of the macula and postoperative metamorphopsia after macular hole surgery [^ec6c7a2e]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Macular deformation was analyzed as the deformed grid using the custom software (Figure 1). The 6 × 6-mm square grid having crossing lines at an interval of 1 mm was overlaid on the preoperative photograph. The grid size was determined corresponding to the visual angle of the M-chart lines because a visual angle of 1° was projected on the macula with 288- μ m length (20° × 0.288 mm = 5.76 mm). The grid was located by placing the center node at the center of the MH base in the preoperative en face OCT image. Each node was anchored at the preoperative photograph, which was deformed by moving the node to match the retinal vasculature with that of the postoperative photograph (Figure 1). The postoperative location of the foveal center was defined by reviewing the serial OCT B-scans to find the ellipsoid zone signal changes and marked in the postoperative en face OCT image, as previously reported. The center node was moved to the marked position after matching the retinal vasculature of the postoperative photograph and that of the en face image.

Fig. 1.
A. Preoperative and postoperative fundus photographs of patients with an MH have been overlapped in the custom software. The major retinal vessels are matched between two photographs by registering three bifurcating points on each photograph. The 6 × 6-mm grid having crossing lines at 1-mm interval is superimposed on the photograph. B. In the magnifying window, both of the preoperative and postoperative retinal vessels are seen indicating the macula was deformed after surgery. C. Moving the node of the grid deforms the preoperative photograph, and the retinal vasculatures of two photographs are matched. D. The deformation of the macula is assessed in two nodes. E. Measurements are completed in all 49 nodes.

The horizontal and vertical displacements of each node were measured. Deformations of the vertical and horizontal lines were calculated as the absolute differences in the x-coordinate and y-coordinate between the adjacent nodes, respectively. Parafoveal deformation was defined as the difference in coordinates between the center node and the first adjacent node, and perifoveal deformation was defined as the difference between the first and second nodes. The line segment was labeled after the area of the horizontal or vertical line. Figure 2 demonstrates the indexed nodes and segment lines.

### Regional spreading pattern is associated with clinical phenotype in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^b743800c]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Horizontal/vertical/crossed

Directionality of disease spreading was considered horizontal when the disease spread within the same region from the site of onset to the contralateral corresponding limb, vertical when it progressed from the site of onset to the rostrally or caudally located ipsilateral region, and crossed when it spread to the contralateral rostral or caudal region. Patients with bulbar onset were not considered in this analysis because it was not possible to establish the laterality of disease onset and therefore the directionality of the first step in disease spread. Patients in whom the disease process moved to multiple regions at the same time were equally excluded from the analysis because it was not possible to establish the directionality of disease progression.

Contiguous/non-contiguous

Disease spreading was considered non-contiguous when signs and symptoms moved from the site of onset to a distant, non-adjacent region (i.e. lumbar to bulbar or bulbar to lumbar) and contiguous when they moved to a neighbouring region (i.e. bulbar to cervical, cervical to bulbar, cervical to lumbar or lumbar to cervical).

Focal/multifocal-generalized

Progression was considered focal when signs and symptoms spread to a single region after the site of onset, and multifocal-generalized when they moved simultaneously to two or more different regions (e.g. from bulbar to cervical and lumbar segments simultaneously).

Patients with thoracic onset or involvement of thoracic segments as the first step of disease progression were excluded from all the analyses for the following reasons: (i) low sensitivity of clinical signs and symptoms of motor neuron — especially UMN — involvement in this region; or (ii) impossibility of clinically establishing whether respiratory symptoms were related to cervical or thoracic spinal involvement given the different innervation of respiratory muscles.

Characteristics of disease onset and pattern of disease progression are summarized in Fig. 1. Patients in whom disease spread was still limited at the site of onset when first clinical evaluation was performed, with neither horizontal nor vertical or crossed disease progression, were assigned to the group of regionally entrenching ALS (re-ALS), while those in whom the disease process had already spread to other regions were assigned to the group of disseminating ALS (d-ALS). Considering that time of first clinical assessment was not uniform across the cohort, we corrected each analysis comparing re-ALS with d-ALS groups for the time interval between symptom onset and first evaluation in our centre.

### Stimulus edges induce orientation tuning in superior colliculus [^98795f5b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Visual stimulation: moving texture stimulation

Moving bars of 12 orientations (0–330°, with 30° increments) were presented in a pseudorandom sequence. Direction of movement was either orthogonal, rotated 45° clockwise, or rotated 45° counterclockwise relative to the bars' orientation. Each stimulus trial was composed of a 6-s gray screen followed by bar stimuli lasting for 7 s. Bars were black on a white circular background with a diameter of 30° visual angle. Each bar was 10° long, 3.5° wide, and moved at a temporal frequency of 1.5 Hz. Each bar orientation was repeated either 6 or 10 times.

Visual stimulation: stimuli with a concentric structure

For stimuli with a concentric structure, the inner circle extended over 29° visual field and the outer circle extended over 58° visual field. The orthogonal and opposite grating stimuli had 100% contrast. Duration of visual stimulation and timing of two-photon acquisition were the same as those described in the orientation selectivity tests.

Visual stimulation: stationary gratings

For each stationary grating trial, mice were presented with a gray screen for 4 s, followed by one of the four static grating patterns for 6 s (full vertical grating, vertical grating with an inner circle of horizontal grating, full horizontal grating, or horizontal grating with an inner circle of vertical grating). Each stimulus trial was repeated 10 times. Gratings had 0.04 cycles per degree with 100% contrast. Two-photon fluorescence signal was acquired for 1 s during the gray screen and for 3 s during the static grating presentation.

Visual stimulation: half-circular gratings with vertical or horizontal edges

For the change of orientation test at single-cell resolution, the illumination area on the screen that activates the SC area within the imaging FOV of the 16× objective was first identified using a 10° view angle drifting grating circle sweeping through the whole screen. Then the drifting grating was expanded to 80°, and two sets of visual patterns were presented, in which a rectangular opaque screen was used to cover either the nasal or the lower half of the illumination circle, creating a vertical or horizontal dark edge across the receptive field of the imaging area in the SC, respectively. The duration of visual stimulation and timing of two-photon imaging were the same as the orientation selectivity test.

### Different spectral sensitivities of ON-and OFF-motion pathways enhance the detection of approaching color objects in drosophila [^53ce83c5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Competing OFF-motion over the range UV = 0–15

During the competing OFF-motion stimuli that covered the range of UV intensities from 0 to 15 (Fig. 2b, d, f, Supplementary Fig. 2d, e), the same frames were displayed as used for the competing ON-motion stimuli but shown in the reverse temporal order (Fig. 2a). After 6 s, the screen switched to all green and UV. For clockwise stimuli, a green edge receded from the left-hand side of every window, retreating rightwards to void the window of green by 250 ms. Simultaneously, a UV edge receded from the right-hand side of every window and retreated leftwards to void the window of UV, leaving the screen blank by 250 ms. As for ON-motion, counterclockwise stimuli were presented in the same way, but reflected along a vertical axis so that green edges moved leftwards, and UV edges moved rightwards. In all other respects, the stimuli were organized as for competing ON-motion.

Competing ON- and OFF-motion over the range UV = 3–9

To measure responses of flies to both ON and OFF-motion (Figs. 2g, 3, 6, Supplementary Figs. 2a–c, 3, 6), we presented UV intensities over the limited range {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, so that responses to both competing ON and competing OFF-motion could be measured in the same flies within a protocol that took 21 min. We also measured responses to black and green square wave gratings, spatial wavelength 30°, temporal frequency of 5 and 10 Hz, for clockwise and anticlockwise yaw rotations, to generate optomotor responses. All stimuli were presented 5 times (10 times including from the left or right), and the stimulus presentation order was randomized for each set of trials.

2.3.2 Search

The Self‐Ordered Search task assesses visuospatial working memory (Owen, Downes, Sahakian, Polkey, & Robbins). A set of squares in random positions within an invisible five‐by‐five grid is displayed on the screen. Participants click on squares, which "open" to reveal whether there is a "token" inside. After a token is found, it is hidden within another square, and the participant must locate it again. Within any trial, a square will never be used to hide a token more than once and the number of tokens that must be found in each trial equals the number of squares in that trial. Participants must avoid squares in which they have already discovered a token and squares they have already searched while looking for the current token. If they re‐click a previously discovered or searched square the trial ends and the next trial begins with one less square in the grid. If they find all tokens without making an error, a new trial begins with one extra square in the grid. The round begins with four squares and ends after three errors have been made. Their final score is equal to the maximum level they achieved. As this task is not timed, the number of runs completed during a 30‐min period depended on participant performance.

2.3.3 Grammatical Reasoning

Grammatical Reasoning is based on Alan Baddeley's 3‐min grammatical reasoning test (Baddeley,) and assesses verbal reasoning. On each trial, a written statement regarding two shapes is displayed on the screen, and the participant must indicate whether it correctly describes the shapes pictured below. The participant has 90 s to complete as many trials as possible. A correct response increases the total score by one point, and an incorrect response decreases the score by one point.

2.3.4 Spatial Span

Spatial Span is based on the Corsi Block Tapping Task — a tool for measuring spatial short‐term memory capacity. Sixteen purple boxes are displayed in a grid. A sequence of randomly selected boxes turn green one at a time (900 ms per green square). Participants must then repeat the sequence by clicking boxes in the same order. Difficulty is varied dynamically: correct responses increase the length of the next sequence by one square, and an incorrect response decreases the sequence length. The test finishes after three errors. The score is the length of the longest sequence successfully remembered.

### Square grid deformation analysis of the macula and postoperative metamorphopsia after macular hole surgery [^a92cfd84]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the correlation between postoperative metamorphopsia and macular deformation after macular hole surgery.

Methods

This study included 28 eyes of 28 patients who underwent vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane removal for an idiopathic macular hole. The retinal vasculatures were compared between preoperative and postoperative photographs, and postoperative deformation of the macula was assessed as deformation of the square grid. The displacement of each node was measured, and deformation of the grid was calculated as differences in the coordinates of the adjacent nodes. These parameters were analyzed to find correlation with metamorphopsia measured using the M-charts after 6 postoperative months.

Results

The average deformations in the vertical and horizontal lines of the grid were 94.29 μm and 49.72 μm, respectively. Perifoveal deformation was significantly greater than parafoveal deformation (P = 0.001∼0.019). The multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the vertical M-score correlated with superior perifoveal deformation of the vertical line on the fovea (P = 0.036), and the horizontal M-score correlated with temporal perifoveal deformation of the horizontal line on the fovea (P = 0.032).

Conclusion

The parafoveal tissue was displaced with the fovea concurrently after internal limiting membrane removal in macular hole surgery causing perifoveal deformation, which correlated with postoperative metamorphopsia.

The short-axis images should be displayed with the apical slices to the left and the base at the right; the vertical long-axis images should be displayed with apical slices on the left and the lateral slices on the right; and the horizontal long-axis images should be displayed with inferior slices on the left and anterior slices on the right. It is also recommended, for purposes of comparison of sequential images, that the sequential images should be displayed aligned and adjacent to each other, with stress followed by rest perfusion, either in rows or columns.

### Numerical equilibration of signal intensity and spatial resolution in time-resolved continuously moving table imaging [^57722687]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Time-resolved continuously moving table imaging techniques have been previously developed to observe a dynamically changing phenomenon over an extended field-of-view. The acquisition involves differential k-space sampling and view sharing. Since the table is continuously moving during data acquisition, the k-space for any longitudinal position is sampled only sparsely for the first reconstruction timeframe and is progressively more fully sampled for subsequent frames. Consequently, the signal intensity increases and the lateral spatial resolution improves from frame to frame even for static materials, which can mask true dynamically changing phenomena. This work provides a description of this effect and a means for signal correction in the early reconstruction frames, thus permitting any residual variation in signal intensity to be primarily attributed to true dynamic processes. The method is tested experimentally on a static phantom and in a peripheral vascular study designed to observe the leading edge of the contrast bolus.

Fig. 6
Example of compaction front detection and calculation of the average front velocity u front.

The vertical axis represents height above the bottom wall, and the horizontal axis is time. The color map shows the normalized averaged and smoothed vertical grain velocity. The black curve depicts the inferred front location (z front (t)). The front velocity is calculated as the average slope of the black curve, between the manually picked initial and final times (red squares). The inset shows the first second of the simulation (corresponding to the black rectangle in the main panel). The downward-moving unloading front is observed in the first ≃ 0.2 s.

The compaction front depth at each time, t, is extracted by scanningfrom the bottom upward and identifying the first depth wherein simulations and ≥ 0.01 in experiments. This depth is defined as the front location at time t, z front (t). Finally, we manually pick the time when the front starts migrating upward continuously (t i) and the time of front arrival to the top of the layer (t f). In some experiments and simulations, z front (t) loses its coherent slope at some stage, and we choose t f to be the last time step showing a coherent slope. The average front velocity is calculated as the average slope of the front depth-time curve between these two times.

Getting ready

Make sure you have the following items:

Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen
New NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needle
Alcohol swabs

Preparing your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen

Wash your hands with soap and water.
Before you start to prepare your injection, check the label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should look cloudy after mixing.

Before your first injection with a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen you must mix the insulin:

A. Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to mix.

Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A).

B. Roll the pen between your palms 10 times - it is important that the pen is kept horizontal.

C. Then gently move the pen up and down ten times between position 1 and 2 as shown, so the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.

Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears white and cloudy. Do not use the pen if the liquid appears discolored or contains particles.

### Separate and overlapping mechanisms of statistical regularities and salience processing in the occipital cortex and dorsal attention network [^13f8d01a]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Localizer task

A localizer task was used to identify the occipital spatial representations of each of the four quadrants of the screen (TL, top‐left; TR, top‐right; BR, bottom‐right or BL, bottom‐left), where the stimuli of the main attention task were presented (see below). The localizer stimuli consisted in a moving (28°/s) array of small bars (0.5 × 0.1° each). The array was only visible in a specific screen location on each stimulation block: a 3 × 3° square aperture located in one of the four quadrants, with a distance of 7° from the center of the screen. The aperture contained approximately nine bars at a time. All bars were oriented either horizontally or vertically, but the target stimuli that were right/left tilted (45° from vertical). The target‐bars appeared in the aperture at unpredictable times (range 1.08–3.24 s) and the participants had to report the tilt orientation (right/left) by pressing a response‐button with the index/middle finger of the right hand. Participants had to maintain central fixation throughout the localizer scan. The stimuli were presented in each screen quadrant for blocks of 14 s, interleaved with 12 s of central fixation without any visual stimulation. Each quadrant was stimulated six times, in a randomized order.

### Single versus segmental maxillary osteotomies and long-term stability in unilateral cleft lip and palate related malocclusion [^1ab78046]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the stability of single-piece versus segmental (2-piece) maxillary advancement in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) treated using conventional Le Fort I orthognathic surgery.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective study was undertaken in 30 patients with nonsyndromic UCLP treated with the same surgical and orthodontic protocol from 2002 through 2011. Standard lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at least 1 year postoperatively. Patients were divided into single-piece and segmental Le Fort I groups based on planned surgical movement. Postoperative movements were compared between groups using repeated measures analysis of variance.

Results

The mean skeletal horizontal advancement was 7.3 and 7.5 mm in the single-piece and segmental groups, respectively. The skeletal horizontal relapse was 1.3 mm (18%) for the single-piece group and 1.9 mm (25%) for the segmental group. The skeletal surgical extrusion was 2.7 mm for the 2 groups. The skeletal vertical relapse was 0.6 mm (22%) and 1.5 mm (56%) for the single-piece and segmental groups, respectively. The mean dental horizontal postoperative movement was an advancement of 0.4 mm for the single-piece group and a relapse of 0.2 mm (3%) for the segmental group. The mean dental vertical relapse was 0.1 mm (4%) for the single-piece group and 0.3 mm (11%) for the segmental group. There was no statistically significant difference in relapse between the single-piece and segmental groups for all movements (P > .05).

Conclusion

Skeletal and dental relapse was similar between single-piece and segmental maxillary advancements using conventional Le Fort I orthognathic surgery in patients with UCLP.

### Robust retrospective motion correction of head motion using navigator-based and markerless motion tracking techniques [^192677b8]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Circular motion (Figure 1C) was performed similarly to Frost et al.with the participant's head following a dot moving in circle (radius of 2.5 cm) for 1 min at different speeds: 6 cycles/min and 4 cycles/min. The motion was performed three times during a single MPRAGE acquisition: at the beginning, half‐way through and toward the end of the scan, for a total of 3 min of motion over 5:38 min of scan time. For the dimensions used, the expected maximum head deflection was ∼1.9°.

Finally, simulated realistic motion patterns were generated, based heuristically on an example of existing motion traces in a non‐compliant subject during an fMRI experiment, acquired without deliberate motion, where the subject seemed to move predominantly along the x‐axis performing abrupt pitch rotations or slowly moving their head throughout the acquisition. Therefore, we derived two other types of motion: "slow diagonal" motion (Figure 1D, E) and "pitch‐wise" motion (Figure 1F). The aim was to test the correction methods with what we considered more "realistic" motion. In our pitch‐wise (or nodding) motion scenario, the dot moved quickly down in 2 s, moved up to resting position in 15 s and stayed still for 35 s, for a total motion time of 17 s/min. The projected dot moved vertically on the screen for 2.5 cm, 5 cm, or 7.5 cm, corresponding to small, medium, and large levels of motion, for an expected pitch rotation of 1.9°, 3.8°, and 5.7°. In our slow diagonal motion case, the subject was moving the head slowly for 1:30 min, starting from the center along the up‐right diagonal or the down‐right diagonal (projected motion of dot: 3.5 cm; expected head deflection: 2.6°).

VIII. BLOOD FILTRATION INSTRUCTIONS

Clamp the non-numbered tubing prior to raising the bag containing red blood cells and AS-3 additive solution for mixing in order to avoid the introduction of air into the filter.
Mix red cells gently and thoroughly.
Hang the collection bag at one of the following heights:
60 ± 2 inches for blood stored and filtered at room temperature.
60 to 72 inches for blood stored and filtered at 1 — 6 °C.
Ensure filter is vertical and remove clamp to allow red blood cells to gravity flow through the filter and into the red cell storage bag. Notes: Do not apply mechanical or manual pressure to increase flow rate. Filtration can begin at room temperature up to 8 hours or at 1 — 6 °C up to 72 hours post-collection. If unit has not completely filtered by 8 hours post-collection at room temperature, filtration must be completed at 1 — 6 °C. Filtration at maximum head height may shorten filtration times. "Head height" is the distance from the top of the bag containing the blood to be filtered to the horizontal plane where the filtered blood bag rests. Filtration can be unattended. Filtration times can be influenced by collection and processing conditions and biological variability of donors. Experimental data with some filter products indicate that a prolonged filtration can be an indication of sub-optimal leukocyte reduction.
Filtration is complete when the collection bag is empty. To maximize red blood cell recovery, allow the tubing above the filter to empty.
Clamp and seal tubing below the filter.* The numbered tubing downstream of the filter will not drain. Notes: If the numbered tubing below the filter has drained (emptied) after filtration, it is recommended to perform a residual white blood cell count on the unit. Do not strip tubing prior to sealing the tubing below the filter. If it is desired to strip blood from numbered tubing, do so only after tubing has been sealed close to the filter and detached. If it is necessary to strip blood from numbered tubing, care should be taken when stripping is performed. Increased (mechanical) hemolysis has been associated with stripping when blood is cold and has a higher hematocrit. Do not strip forcefully or frequently against a snap-open closure.
Detach and discard collection bag and filter.*
If desired, seal at or adjacent to "X" marks on tubing to provide numbered segments of anticoagulated blood for typing or crossmatching.* If quality control is to be performed on post-filtration sample, use the attached QC line on the bag containing red cells.
Store CP2D/AS-3 preserved red blood cells at 1 — 6 °C for up to 42 days and use as indicated. Note: If AS-3 additive solution is not used, whole blood or red blood cells in CP2D alone may be stored at 1 — 6 °C for up to 21 days.

### A software platform for real-time and adaptive neuroscience experiments [^fcf2936f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Visual stimuli

Stimuli were presented from below using custom Python 3.10 software (pandastim:). Using a 60 Hz, P300 AAXA Pico Projector, stimuli were presented using only the red LED. This created red and black square-wave grating patterns, providing visual stimuli that strongly evoke optomotor response behaviors. Stimuli were created online from dual dictionaries, determining the texture and the stimulus object. Textures were created as dual gratings presented independently to each eye of the zebrafish and provided parameters for the dark value, the light value, the spatial frequency, and the texture size. These textures were moved in accordance with the parameters specified in the stimulus object. The parameters independently controlled the two stimulus textures to specify the stationary duration (time pre-movement), the moving duration, the speed of movement, and the angle of movement. The texture and stimulus parameters were parsed into a combined stimulus class and held in an ordered queue for serial display. Adaptive visual stimulation experiments presented in Fig. 5 used a stationary time of 10 s, moving time of 5 s, speed of 10 mm/s, and different angles of movement in each eye.

### Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off [^e8e9513b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Minimum-jerk modelling

We used a minimum-jerk trajectory framework to formally test the hypothesis that movements are optimized within chunks. Squared jerk is a measure of optimality in the context of movement efficiency, and optimal control trajectories between two points are defined as those that minimize the jerk. It can be shown using the calculus of variations that the integral of squared jerk over the duration of a movement can be minimized by a polynomial function of duration whose sixth derivative is zero. Thus, in the simplest case of a straight reach between two points, minimum-jerk optimization is a simple constrained-optimization problem in which the movement trajectory is modelled as a fifth-order polynomial of the duration. We used a more advanced variant of this methodthat maximizes the smoothness of a trajectory given a set of initial conditions — the start and end positions and velocities, as well as the set of all points that must be traversed at specified times.

Given our hypothesis that the desire for efficiency influences chunk structure in movement sequences, we operationally defined each chunk as an optimal-control trajectory that minimized squared jerk. We applied this framework to compute a model trajectory for each possible chunk structure. We allowed the transition between each element (in our case, from a centre–out to an out–centre reach, or vice versa) to be either a VIA point or a HALT point. For our 10-element sequence, this resulted in 9 binary parameters and 2⁹ = 512 possible chunk structures.

For initial conditions, we assumed zero velocities at the beginning and at the end of each sequence. We also assumed that the hand started and finished at a centre target at (0, 0), and traversed through outer targets at a radial distance of 7 cm from the centre. We further assumed that each centre–out or out–centre reach was executed in exactly 0.5 s; thus, the entire reach sequence would last 5 s. With these assumptions, we precomputed the locally optimal hand trajectory for all 512 possible chunk structures. Each of these trajectories is associated with a computational cost and efficiency. By plotting these against each other and computing the convex hull, we computed the Pareto frontier representing the trade-off between computational cost and efficiency.

### Time-efficient and flexible design of optimized multishell HARDI diffusion [^d77f4e8c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To allow for SNR enhancement, the slice thickness was chosen to be larger than the final target resolution. If the slice centers are located according to the desired target slice separation, resulting in overlapping slices, the target resolution can be partially recovered from the data using super‐resolution algorithms 34, 35 in a post‐acquisition reconstruction stage. To account for the option of overlapping slices and the expected sporadic subject motion, the slice interleave pattern is important. The scanner software was modified to provide maximal and constant temporal spacing between excitations in geometrically close slices, as well as across the boundaries between subsequent MB slice packs. One MB slice pack thereby specifies the slices between locations simultaneously excited from the same MB pulse 28 (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Illustration of the slice spacing and multiband acquisition order. The slice direction is shown vertically, the excitation order horizontally. The colors illustrate the spatial distance since the last excitation. Different combinations of interleave I and interleave shift IS are illustrated in (a), (b), and (c). The spatial distance (three slices) since last excitation is constant for (a) as it fulfills the requirements, whereas (b) and (c) show substantial deviations (ranging from gaps of one to five in different parts of the excitation pattern — see color code.

This boundary condition depends on the number of excitations, the interleave step I, defining the spatial distance between slices excited sequentially in time and the interleave shift IS, the spatial distance applied between the slices at the start of subsequent interleaves. The distance from the first slice in each interleave i to the slice pack start is given as. For each interleave i, the geometrical distance between the last excitation of this interleave and the first of the following must be equal to the interleave step distance I − 1. Thereby, the following constraint must hold true:

This optimality condition is included into.

Single‐band volumes are acquired as a geometric reference and used together with a SENSE reference scan in the reconstruction pipeline for the MB images. The reconstruction is formulated as a linear inverse problem considering the coil sensitivities, the MB encoding pattern and EPI ghost correction terms. Reconstructed image and ghosting parameters are estimated from measured data in an alternating fashion 36 by using, respectively, the conjugate gradient algorithm and Newton's method 37.

### Motor planning flexibly optimizes performance under uncertainty about task goals [^b33cc658]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Movement averaging has also been suggested at the level of feedback control policies. The gain of feedback responses during movement is known to be modulated by target width, with narrow targets leading to high feedback gains compared to wide targets. Gallivan and colleaguesclaimed that ambiguity about the width of a target gives rise to averaged feedback gains, suggesting that feedback control policies are specified in parallel. However, such a pattern of behaviour is also consistent with participants simply preparing a single control policy that balances the effort costs associated with a high feedback gain against the probability that this greater effort will be necessary: participants may adopt an intermediate gain in the knowledge that it will conserve effort while allowing them to be successful most of the time.

These and similar findings that purportedly support movement averaging can all plausibly be explained in terms of participants selecting a single, optimized plan. Conversely, there are many observations that are consistent with the optimization theory, but are difficult to explain in terms of movement averaging. Although optimal behaviour often resembles an averaged movement, there are instances where the optimal solution is to not average. Moving quickly, as we tested here, is one example. Another example is to simply place a virtual barrier in between potential goals to penalize intermediate movements. In this case, participants easily stop generating intermediate movements and instead move directly to one target or the other. These results demonstrate that intermediate movements are not obligatory, and are therefore unlikely to arise from a low-level movement-averaging process.

### Probing the seismic cycle timing with coseismic twisting of subduction margins [^ccb8d995]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Assessing the timing of great megathrust earthquakes is together crucial for seismic hazard analysis and deemed impossible. Geodetic instrumentation of subduction zones has revealed unexpected deformation patterns at subduction segments adjacent to those that hosted recent mega-earthquakes: coastal sites move landward with faster velocities than before the earthquake. Here, we show observations from the largest and best-monitored megathrust earthquakes, and from a scaled analog model, to reveal that these events create coseismic and postseismic deformation patterns typical of a complete gear-like rotation about a vertical axis, hereafter called twisting. We find that such twisting alters the interseismic velocity field of adjacent subduction segments depending on the time since the last earthquake. Early interactions accelerate while late interactions decelerate local kinematics. This finding opens the possibility of using megathrust earthquakes, the characteristics of the twisting pattern, and the ensuing geodetic velocity changes, as a proxy for estimating the timing of the seismic cycle at unruptured segments along the margin.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To simulate different thermal profile distributions, a distance cycle case (Fig. 3b) was conducted. In this case, the wire was first positioned 50 µm underneath the center of the C-FBG with 5.5 V DC heating. The hotwire then moved 4 mm away from the C-FBG and moved back. When the hot wire was closed to the C-FBG, the thermal distribution sharply peaked at the center. When it was far away, the peak was flattened. To cover additional conditions, a thermal cycle case (Fig. 3c) was conducted as well. In this case, the hot wire was positioned 50 µm underneath the center of the C-FBG, and no movement was involved. Instead, the DC power supply was initially set to 5.5 V, then dropped to zero, followed by ramping back. Besides all these datasets, a reference case was also collected with no heating and movement involved. All the datasets were collected at 100 Hz (80 µs exposure time) with 20 seconds length.

The hot wire's moving speed, both in the horizontal and vertical directions, was ~0.25 mm/s, and the voltage ramping speed was ~0.35 V/s. However, they were not precisely controlled in this study. This is because the calibration of the C-FBG depends on the synchronized IR data that continuously monitors the temperature profile along the fiber. The position and temperature of the hot wire were not used for calibration. Since the fiber optics has a small size, we assume that its temperature reaches a steady state faster than the 80 µs exposure time. During the experiment, the thermal distribution fluctuated due to ambient air movement, which benefited the training since the covered distributions were more diverse. Except for the 5.3 V horizontal moving case (for testing), all the others were used for model training. The visualization of the C-FBG reflection spectrum (training input data) and the thermal profile (training output data) are provided in Supplementary Figures. They are Supplementary Figs. 1–13 and Supplementary Figs. 14–26, respectively.

Monocular deprivation

After the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–3% for induction; 1.5% for maintenance), the margins of upper and lower eyelids were trimmed and sutured shut. A small amount of Neosporin was applied to the sutured eye to prevent an infection. The mouse was given an injection of Meloxicam (5 mg/kg, s.c.) after the surgery. The sutured eye was checked before it was opened for an imaging session to make sure the integrity of the lid suture.

Visual stimulation and visual conditioning

All visual stimulation was presented on an LCD monitor screen diagonally placed 25 cm from the right (contralateral) eye of the mouse, except for the ocular dominance experiments where the screen was placed in front of the mouse.

Intrinsic signal imaging of Vertical/Horizontal responses

Visual stimulation consisted of a periodic vertical or horizontal drifting bar (2°) moving unidirectionally at 1 cycle/6 s temporal frequency. Each visual stimulation was presented for 5 min. The order of the visual stimuli presentation was arranged such that the first and fourth stimuli pair and second and third stimuli pair have the same orientations (i.e. direction order: (1) 270°, (2) 180°, (3) 0°, (4) 90°).

Visual conditioning consisted of 30 repetitions of visual stimulation blocks, in which square wave drifting gratings of 4 different directions (270°, 180°, 90°, 0°) with 1 cycle/20° spatial frequency and 1 cycle/6 s temporal frequency are presented for 5 s followed by 25 s blank screen sequentially. The train of photoactivation (10 ms pulse at 20 Hz for 5 s) followed the offset of the visual stimulus of the neuromodulator coupled orientation.

### Motor planning flexibly optimizes performance under uncertainty about task goals [^b8fa963a]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Participants were required to maintain their movement speed throughout the duration of the reach; any attempt to slow down after the target was triggered (that is, a decline of the velocity by more than 40% of the maximum velocity achieved thus far in the trial) led to an immediate termination of the trial. Trials were also cancelled if participants moved very slowly until the target was cued (peak velocity less than 50% of the required minimum velocity threshold by the time of target cuing). Participants were instructed verbally about the speed criterion, and were given visual feedback about their movement speed with a bar whose height reflected peak velocity; a shaded region adjacent to the bar graphically represented the acceptable speed range.

Participants completed ten blocks of trials, grouped into two sets of five blocks. Each set was performed at either a 'Fast' or 'Slow' speed. A set consisted of one training block with only single-target trials to practice the required movement speed (48 trials), followed by four test blocks, each comprising 48 single- and 48 dual-target trials (12 trials at each target-separation angle) randomly intermixed. The order in which the two speeds were performed was counterbalanced across participants.

Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 with two exceptions. The first was that targets only appeared at ± 22.5° (that is, on dual-target trials this corresponded to a 45° target separation angle); because of this, after each speed-training block (48 trials) only two blocks of test trials (comprised of 48 single- and 48 dual-target trials) were performed at a given speed. Second, following a random inter-trial interval (450–1,000 ms) the target(s) appeared at the same time as the auditory go tone; participants were required to initiate their reach to the target within 400 ms of target onset. These changes were imposed to reduce the time available to deliberate about the stimulus arrangement prior to movement onset, analogous to the timing used by Chapman et al.

We found no statistically significant evidence for differences between the reaction times across learning trials that involved the higher-value (HV), lower-value (LV), and distractor value (DV) alternatives across different contexts in either experiment (2-way ANOVA on log (RT) in Experiment 1: alternatives: F (2, 174) = 0.004, p = 0.99, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.02], contexts: F (1, 174) = 0.15, p = 0.69, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.03], interaction: F (2, 174) = 0.02, p = 0.98, partial η² = 0.00, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.02]; and in Experiment 2: alternatives: F (2, 402) = 0.03, p = 0.97, partial η² = 0.00, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.01], contexts: F (1, 402) = 0.06, p = 0.81, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.01], interaction: F (2, 402) = 0.04, p = 0.97, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.01]).

### A new tablet for writing and drawing during functional MRI [^8da61f8a]. Human Brain Mapping (2011). Low credibility.

Writing and drawing are understudied with fMRI, partly for lack of a device that approximates these behaviors well while supporting task feedback and quantitative behavioral logging in the confines of the magnet. Consequently, we developed a tablet based on touchscreen technology that is accurate, reliable, relatively inexpensive, and fMRI compatible. After confirming fMRI compatibility, we conducted preliminary fMRI experiments examining the neural correlates of a widely used pen-and-paper neuropsychological assessment, the trail making test. In two subjects, we found left hemisphere frontal lobe activations similar to the major results of a previous group study, and we also noted individual differences mostly in the right hemisphere. These results demonstrate the utility of the new tablet for adaptations of pen-and-paper tests and suggest possible uses of the tablet for longitudinal, within-subjects studies of disease or therapy. We also discuss using the tablet for several other types of tests requiring many, continuous, or two-dimensional responses that were previously very difficult to perform during fMRI.

### Reduced rotational flows enable the translation of surface-rolling microrobots in confined spaces [^a2798bc4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Microrollers under irregular vertical confinements

To characterize the confinement effect in detail, we microfabricated irregular structures, including a half-sphere and a ramp, on the top side of the microchannels. The translational velocities of the actuated microrollers under the irregular structures were recorded with time and position (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6).

Fig. 3
Microroller locomotion experiments under irregular vertical confinements.

a A half-sphere-like structure was microfabricated using two-photon lithography and placed upside down from the top of the microchannel. The translational velocity of the microroller changed depending on its position under the confinement. b – d The time-lapse images and time versus transitional velocity graphs of microrollers actuated at different rotational frequencies, f = 180, 100, and 20 Hz, under the half-sphere-like confinement. At the highest rotation frequency (f = 180 Hz), the translational velocity of the microroller drastically changed depending on the rate of confinement. This indicated that the microroller was very sensitive to confinement effects at high frequencies. The velocity differences were less drastic at f = 100 Hz and almost vanished at f = 20 Hz. e The ramp structures were microprinted using two-photon lithography with a 5° ramp angle and L' = L/2a = 36.5 and h r ' = 1.26. f – h The time-lapse images and time versus velocity graphs of microrollers actuated at different rotational frequencies under the ramp confinement. For the highest actuation frequency (f = 180 Hz), the confinement effect was not seen until almost at the end of the ramp, where the velocity decreased suddenly started before 27.5 μm before the end of the ramp. Similar to the half-sphere structure, the effect was slightly visible for f = 100 Hz and negligible for f = 20 Hz. Dashed red lines in time-lapse images indicate the start and endpoints of the ramp. The instantaneous velocity was normalized to the average velocity for all graphs at the specific condition. All scale bars are 50 μm.

a Distance profile of RSTFs derived at 0.1−0.5 Hz for the WA (Western part of USArray) and EA EA (Eastern part of USArray) arrays, showing three sub-events: S1, Sx, and S2. b Azimuthal profile of RSTFs showing the same sub-events as in (a). c Distance profile with downsampled RSTFs for the EU (European and central Asian stations), CN (China/SE Asia array), WA, and EA arrays, with dashed lines representing the arrivals of S2. d Optimal locations of Sx (red star) and S2 (green star) relative to S1 (black star). e Azimuthal profiles with a distance range split at 60°. Black dashed lines indicate the predicted arrival time for sub-events Sx and S2, assuming distances at 45° and 75°, respectively. Circles and squares represent the picked arrivals for Sx and S2, respectively, while crosses indicate the predicted arrivals from the optimal rupture model.

The relative location and timing between subevents are determined by applying a grid search method on their arrival times (see more in Methods). The locations of S2 and Sx relative to S1 are presented in Fig. 3d and Table S1, revealing that Sx exhibits a sub-horizontal rupture directivity, while S2 ruptured sub-vertically. Sensitivity plots demonstrate that the relative location and origin time of these subevents are well-constrained (Supplementary Fig. 4). It is worth noting that the vertical offset between S1 and S2 of the earthquake was not reported in the published source models. The subsequent larger subevents display clearer move-out in the azimuthal profile than in the distance profile (Figs. 2 and S 3), likely due to their larger horizontal offsets in comparison to any vertical offsets, if present.

### Improvements induced by retinal gene therapy with voretigene neparvovec depend on visual cortical hemispheric dominance mechanisms [^71dcfb8b]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Block design paradigm stimulus

We employed a block design paradigm with a constant light intensity of 5 lux, presenting a 8 × 8 black-and-white checkerboard pattern with white squares flashing eight times per second (8 Hz). The size of the checks of the checkerboard in degrees is 3.54° × 1.94°. The luminance of the white squares varied at three different levels: 246.3 cd/m² (High, H); 87.46 cd/m² (Medium, M); and 22.8 cd/m² (Low, L). The luminance of the black squares was kept constant at 0.13 cd/m². The order of blocks with different luminances appeared randomly and varied between subjects. Based on the study by Ashtari et al. this paradigm consisted of active checkerboard blocks interspersed with 15-s black screens as rest blocks.

An fMRI run was conducted for each of the three conditions, binocular, RE, and LE. Each run consisted of 19 blocks, with 9 active blocks (3 blocks for each luminance level of the white squares) randomly interleaved with ten rest blocks. Each block had a duration of 15 s, as illustrated in Fig. 2a.

The paradigm consisted of 15 s active blocks of chessboards interspersed with a 15 s rest period (black screen) as control blocks. Each luminance level was presented three times, and the blocks of each luminance were randomly interspersed with ten rest blocks. b Illustration of simultaneous visual stimuli with orthogonal bars. The arrows in the image indicate the direction of bar movement. For the initial 144 s, the horizontal bars moved downward while the vertical bars moved to the left. Following the isoluminant period, the horizontal and vertical bars traveled in the opposite direction.

Each subject was instructed to fixate on the central cross, or, if unable to see it, to gaze at the center of the screen.

### Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off [^24630162]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Each chunk structure on this continuum is uniquely defined by specifying all potential HALT/VIA points in the trajectory, and is associated with a net computational complexity and net achievable movement efficiency. To quantify these respective computational complexities and efficiencies, we fit minimum-jerk trajectories to each trial between each pair of consecutive HALT points (chunks) and concatenated these fits across chunks (see Methods). Each such model trajectory gives the instantaneous arm position over the course of an entire movement sequence. We then quantified efficiency and computational complexity of each trajectory as follows.

In the motor control field, optimal movements are typically defined operationally as the trajectories that minimize the integrated squared jerk. Although smooth trajectories can be obtained by minimizing any higher-order derivatives of position, jerk (the third-order derivative) is typically chosen because the ratio of the peak to mean speed of model trajectories agrees well with the ratio from empirically characterized arm kinematics of human reaching movements. Thus, we defined efficiency as the negative squared jerk, normalized to discount the effect of variable movement duration from trial to trial (see Methods).

To quantify the computational complexity of a movement sequence, we developed a metric that linearly sums the complexity of computing the trajectory for each chunk. Given that computational complexity of optimizing a motor control policy increases exponentially with the horizon of planning, we defined the computational complexity of a single chunk as the exponent of the number of elements, that is, the number of centre–out and out–centre reaches constituting the chunk (see Methods).

Visualizing efficiency against computational complexity for each model trajectory gives us an understanding of the trade-off (Fig. 2b; grey dots). The upper envelope of the space spanned by all potential outcomes of the model gives us an estimate of the Pareto frontier (Fig. 2b; red curve). In optimization problems that involve dual objectives, the Pareto frontier is the set of all points at which gaining ground on one objective will necessarily lose ground on another. This Pareto frontier represents the trade-off curve, which gives the theoretically maximum achievable efficiency for any given complexity, and below which all real-world movements must lie.

### Time reversed optical waves by arbitrary vector spatiotemporal field generation [^8005ba54]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The remaining examples of Fig. 3 all demonstrate spatiotemporal beams. In these examples, the principle of operation is much the same as the spatiospectral control example of Fig. 3a, except the desired spatial/polarisation output states are specified in the time-domain. For temporal control, it is critical that not only are the correct superpositions of spatial/polarisation modes excited at each wavelength, but also the relative phase between the wavelengths must be correct in order to generate the desired temporal features. Figure 3b is a relatively simple spatiotemporal demonstration; a polarised diffraction limited focus of 230 fs temporal duration (corresponding to the bandwidth of the device, 4.4 THz). As discussed in more detail in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Fig. 16), at 0 ps delay, the spatial focus is 86% of the peak theoretical intensity achievable using 45 HG modes, and 84% of the theoretically achievable power for a rectangular spectrum of 4.4 THz is delivered to the 0 ps delay. Figure 3c is a similar demonstration of a more complicated spatial field, a vertically polarised "smiley face", which has been generated at a desired delay of 5 ps. Figure 3d in an example of two orthogonally polarised focal spots that are independently tracing out spirals in time across a delay spread of 20 ps. This can be seen from the sequence of 11 measured fields shown in Fig. 3d and from the volumetric rendering of the field to the right of Fig. 3d. This illustrates how the device can be used to trace focused spots along arbitrary trajectories at a rate limited by the optical bandwidth (4.4 THz). This could be used for raster scanning or other kinds of sampling at ultrafast rates. Figure 3e is another spatiotemporal demonstration, similar to Fig. 3d, but which maps more complicated spatial fields representing numerals to different delays across an 8 ps delay spread. Figure 3f is an example that illustrates a spatial and polarisation state change as a function of delay. A radially polarised "clock hand". That is, a spatial field consisting of a linearly polarised line pointing outwards from the centre of the fibre core, which rotates as a function of delay. This kind of control of space, time and polarisation independently could be of use to high-power applications working at high numerical apertures, such as micromachiningor optical trapping. The examples of Fig. 3g, h are designed to represent more recognisable 3D objects. Figure 3g, the "arrow of time", corresponds with a light field literally shaped like a 3D arrow. Launching a pulse into the input of the spectral pulse shaper of Fig. 2 would result in a 3D arrow shaped beam, pointed backwards along the time/propagation axis, flying into the charge-coupled device camera of the characterisation apparatus. Similarly, Fig. 3f is a simple 3D light rendering of an Eiffel tower shaped beam flying base-first along the propagation axis. Further experimental results are available in the Supplementary Information, particularly in the online videos, including additional characterisations such as spatially and temporally dependent losses, as well as tests of performance versus number of addressed spatiospectral modes.

### A versatile computational algorithm for time-series data analysis and machine-learning models [^263e8086]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Now consider the 3x3 neighborhood around each vector element being constructed from.represents our one-dimensional time-series vector that can be used for time-delay embedding with delay t and embedding dimension m to reconstruct the phase-space trajectory. However, instead of considering the Euclidean norm between data points:we will consider vectors V i and V j in relation to their local 3x3 neighborhood such that:where it can be seen that≠even when = (Fig. 1a). It follows then, that directional and curvature information can be captured by different inequality patterning around the 3x3 neighborhood when computed for allby constructing a new matrix that represents an 8-bit binary code for each point-pair's local neighborhood:where g 0 representsand g n = { g 1, …, g 8 } are its eight connected neighbors. Each neighbor which is larger or equal to g 0 is set to 1, while each neighbor that is smaller than g 0 is set to 0. A binary code is thus created by moving around the central point g 0 (here counterclockwise) where a single integer value is calculated based on the sum of the binary code elements (0 or 1) multiplied by the eight 2ᵖ positional weights (increments of powers of 2: 2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³, 2⁴, 2⁵, 2⁶, 2⁷) starting with the preceding points (i.e.). This represents 8-bit binary coding where there are 2⁸ (256) different possible integer values, ranging from 0 to 255. This newly created matrix now allows for the identification of graded changes in phase-space trajectories that can be used to identify recurring sets of local topological features embedded within the dynamic signal (LoTRA plot; see Fig. 1b, c for example).

### Fast sequences of non-spatial state representations in humans [^8bc1b68f]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

After the starting state was revealed at the beginning of a trial, participants were allowed up to 60 s for planning, with the possibility of entering moves earlier by pressing a button. The distribution of actual planning times is shown in Figure 1 D, with a median of 38.9 s (interquartile range [IQR] = 27.3 s). For more details of the timings within each trial, see Experimental Procedures.

After the planning period, participants had to pre-enter their four moves quickly or face a monetary penalty. During this pre-entry, the sole feedback was the appearance of an "up" or "down" arrow, displaying each move that they selected. The mean reaction time to pre-enter the first move in the slowest participant was 760 ± 50 ms and in the fastest participant was 304 ± 21 ms. After pre-entry, participants were required to execute the same sequence of moves they had just pre-entered. During execution, the visual objects associated with each state were displayed, and as they executed each move, the visual object representing the current state faded into the object representing the next state. The mean reaction time to execute the first move in the slowest participant was 998 ± 63 ms and in the fastest participant was 408 ± 18 ms. As each visual object appeared during execution, its current reward value (from −5 to +5 pence) appeared alongside it. The cumulative total trial earnings were displayed continuously during the execution phase and were updated as each visual object appeared.

Task performance, in terms of money earned, was significantly higher than chance for 9/12 participants (Figure 1 E). Between trials, there was a significant relationship between planning time and earnings, with more money earned on trials with shorter planning time (Figure 1 F; p = 0.002 by mixed effects linear regression).

### Effects of a physical education intervention on children's physical activity and fitness: the PROFIT pilot study [^118245d9]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Agility was evaluated using the square test. A square measuring 4 m on a side was measured, with a cone arranged at each angle. The children moved as fast as possible, diagonally, then to the left (or right), going to the other diagonal and ending up towards the initial cone, always touching the cones with their hands. The children had two chances and the best moment was noted in seconds with two decimal scales.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated using the 6-minute running and walking test, the participants were divided into small groups. They were advised on the importance of running as much as possible, keeping a constant pace, and avoiding walking and running peaks. During the test, the passage of time at 3 and 5 min was reported. At the end of the test, the students remained in the place where they were, so that the distance covered during the 6 min (in meters) could be recorded (number of laps multiplied by the size of the court, added to the meters in the last return).

Flexibility was evaluated using the sit-and-reach test. The barefoot children, with their knees extended and hands overlapping, should leaned slowly, extending their hands forward as far as possible, remaining in the position as long as necessary for the distance to be noted. Two attempts were made, the best result in centimeters was recorded.

Lower limbs power was evaluated using the horizontal jump test, a measuring tape was fixed to the floor, perpendicular to the starting line. The children were instructed to remain standing with their feet parallel, behind this mark. They performed the jump as far as possible with both feet simultaneously. Each child had two attempts and the greatest distance was recorded in centimeters.

Speed was evaluated using the 20-meter run test. Children moved as quickly as possible, passing through three parallel lines previously marked: a start line, one 20 m from the first (timeline), and another 21 m from the exit (finish line). The third line served as a reference for the child not to slow down before crossing the 20 m. Time was recorded in seconds with two decimal scales.

### Microtubule minus-end aster organization is driven by processive HSET-tubulin clusters [^f700c12e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Kymograph and motility analysis

Processive motility properties (i.e. end dwell times, run lengths, velocities, and event frequencies) were analyzed by kymograph. Maximum intensity projections were generated to determine the location of MTs in the channel of interest, and kymographs were generated using the Multiple Kymograph plugin in ImageJ (width = 3 pixels). End dwell time was defined as the vertical component of the kymograph, which is the time spent at the end of the MT, in seconds. For each end dwell event in the green channel, the particle was compared to the MT location in the red channel to verify its location at the end of the MT rather than along the lattice. For a particle to be considered for analysis, it: (i) must persist at least 5 frames (5 s), (ii) could not coincide with other particles at the end of the MT, and (iii) must arrive and detach at the end of the MT during image acquisition. Run length was defined as the horizontal component of the kymograph, which is the distance traveled along the MT in µm, and included all pauses. For a particle to be considered for run length analysis, it must: (i) persist at least 5 frames (5 s), (ii) begin its run during image acquisition, and (iii) must not be bound to the MT at the end of image acquisition. Events that reached the end of the MT were counted in the analysis but treated separately (as indicated in the figure legends). Velocity was defined as the run length (horizontal component) divided by time (vertical component) in µm/s. Only moving segments were considered, i.e. if no movement was observed in a segment at least 5 frames (5 s) long, this portion was excluded from the analysis. For a particle to be included for velocity analysis, it must: (i) persist at least 5 frames (5 s), (ii) begin its run during image acquisition, and (iii) must not be bound to the MT at the end of image acquisition. For event frequency measurements (Events/(min*µm)), time was defined as the image acquisition time (min), MT length was determined from the red channel (µm), and events were determined by kymograph analysis, defined as moving (nonstationary) particles persisting at least 5 frames (5 s).

### Dwell times showcase how goal structure informs preschoolers' analysis of unfolding motion patterns [^5eabff6b]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Using Hard et al.'s (2011) dwell-time paradigm, 85 preschoolers (aged 2.5–4.5; 43 female; primarily from white families) advanced at their own pace through one of three slideshows. All slideshows depicted an actor reaching toward, grasping, and retrieving a ball. However, motion patterns differed for one slideshow (straight-reach) relative to the other two (arcing-reaches), and one of the arcing-reach slideshows depicted a violation of typical goal-related motion. Preschoolers' knowledge of goal structure systematically modulated attention to event boundaries across slideshows despite surface differences, even when controlling for pixel change (an index of changes in motion). These findings showcase the value of the dwell time paradigm, and illuminate how children deploy attention as goal-related expectations shape their analysis of continuously unfolding activity.

Definitions — healthy housing thresholds and classifications include time, temperature, and material limits. Guest is defined as an individual in a nonpermanent status for not more than 30 days. A habitable room excludes utility rooms of less than 50 square feet of floor space. Heated water is water heated to a temperature of not less than 120°F–130°F (49°C–54°C) at the outlet. Lead-based paint includes any paint or coating with lead content equal to or greater than 1 milligram per square centimeter, or 0.5% by weight. Ordinary summer conditions are a temperature 10°F (-12°C) below the highest recorded temperature in the locality for the prior 10-year period, whereas ordinary winter conditions mean a temperature 15°F (-9.4°C) above the lowest recorded temperature in the locality for the prior 10-year period. Multiple dwelling denotes any dwelling containing more than two dwelling units, and an occupant is any individual, over 1 year of age, living, sleeping, cooking, or eating in or having possession of a dwelling unit or a rooming unit.

### Single-pixel three-dimensional imaging with time-based depth resolution [^2aba3205]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In this paper, we present a single-pixel 3D imaging system using pulsed structured illumination and a high-speed (short response time) photodiode for sampling the time-varying intensity of the back-scattered light from a scene. We show that by using an analogue photodiode to record the full temporal form of the back-scattered light, along with our original 3D reconstruction algorithm, it is possible to recover surface profiles of objects with an accuracy much better than that implied by the finite temporal bandwidth of the detector and digitization electronics. At distances of ∼5 m we demonstrate a range profile accuracy of ∼3 mm with image resolutions of 128 × 128 pixels, whilst simultaneously recovering reflectivity information of the object. This accuracy is achieved despite a detection bandwidth and a digitization interval corresponding to distances of 150 and 60 mm, respectively. We further demonstrate that by using a compressive sampling scheme, the system is capable of performing continuous real-time 3D video with a frame-rate up to 12 Hz.

### Do different anesthesia regimes affect hippocampal apoptosis and neurologic deficits in a rodent cardiac arrest model? [^d48b4507]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Follow-up after resuscitation

Animals were followed according the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of the Canton of Bern for general health, including daily weight measurement with an electronic balance.

Neurological functions were assessed daily from day 1 to day 5 with an established wide-ranging neuroscore (NDS). The NDS evaluates general behavior and respiration (maximum, 40 points), cranial nerves function (maximum, 20 points), sensitivity to tactile stimuli (maximum, 10 points), motor function (maximum, 10 points), and coordination (maximum, 20 points).

To assess gross locomotor abilities, a modified simple vertical pole test was used. The test scores the capability of the animals to move along a horizontal wooden spar of 1.5 cm width, followed by stepwise elevation of the bar to 45° to 90°, with the animal still on it. Inability to move along the horizontal spar (0°) scored 3, keeping at 90° scored 0.

To evaluate sensorimotor integration, the Tape Removal Test was used. This test measures the time needed to successfully remove a standard (10×12 mm) adhesive tape attached to the front paw of the animals (maximum 120 seconds).

To determine the general activity level, the Open Field task was used. Assessment took place in a square (0.75 × 0.75 m), wooden box, with the floor divided by marks in 25 squares. The animals were placed in the arena and allowed to freely move for 4 minutes while being recorded by an overhead camera. Normal behavior of rats consists of moving around and exploring the arena, including doing rears to investigate the surroundings. Accordingly, we analyzed footage by hand counting the squared crossed (with at least three paws) and rears.

### Lack of clinically relevant correlation between subjective and objective cognitive function in ICU survivors: a prospective 12-month follow-up study [^dc761009]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Stockings of Cambridge (SOC)

The SOC tests executive function, in particular spatial planning and spatial working memory, and is a computerized version of the Tower of London Task. Colored circles are arranged in stacks, and the subject must move the circles to match a template. The difficulty rises with the number of moves required to match the template (from two to five moves). Outcomes of the SOC are the average number of moves needed to solve each task (for each level of difficulty) and the number of problems the subject can solve with the minimum number of moves requested ("SOC — problems with min moves"). We used the latter as an overall assessment of SOC performance.

Pattern recognition memory (PRM)

The PRM tests visual memory. A series of 12 different geometric patterns are shown in the middle of the screen, one at a time. The subject is instructed to remember the patterns. After the initial series, the recognition phase takes place, in which the subject is shown two patterns, one previously presented and a novel one. The subject is asked to indicate the pattern he/she recognizes. The outcome of the PRM is the percentage of correct responses ("PRM — % correct").

Spatial span (SSP)

The SSP assess visual-spatial and working memory and is based on the Corsi Blocks Task. Ten white boxes are presented on the screen, and the color of the boxes changes one by one in an order that the subject must remember. The subject is then to reproduce the same sequence by touching the boxes. Level of difficulty increases with the number of boxes the subject has to remember (from two to nine). The outcome of the SSP is the length of the maximum sequence the subject could remember ("SSP — span length").

### A head-mounted camera system integrates detailed behavioral monitoring with multichannel electrophysiology in freely moving mice [^4cc15e29]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

(F) Changes in horizontal and vertical eye position from 20 ms before to 20 ms after the time of peak speed in saccade-like eye movements. Saccade-like eye movements tend to be larger horizontally than vertically. Same dataset as in (D) and (E).

(G) Same as in (F) but for mice head-fixed on a cylindrical treadmill (4 recordings in 2 mice, 10 min each).

Despite this close overall coupling between head and eye movements, saccade-like (> 250°/s; see, for example,) eye movements were occasionally observed in the absence of head movements (Figure 6 C), occurring at an average rate of 0.044/s during head-still times. Moreover, these saccade-like eye movements were not uniformly distributed during head-still times, but were significantly more likely to occur right before or after a head movement (Figures 6 D and 6E). Saccade-like eye movements were qualitatively similar with and without head restraint. Figures 6 F and 6G show the distribution of eye displacements in the horizontal and vertical direction for saccade-like eye movements in freely moving and head-fixed mice, respectively. Interestingly, the largest eye displacements in freely moving mice were observed in the horizontal direction, consistent with the pattern in head-fixed animals. In freely moving mice, however, the range of horizontal eye displacements was slightly reduced (median movement magnitude 9.9° and 17.7°, respectively; Wilcoxon test, p < 3⋅10 −8), perhaps reflecting greater reliance on head movements for gaze shifts.

We conclude that eye movements are generally closely coupled to head movements in freely moving mice. Occasionally, the eye moves in the absence of head movement — but this typically happens just before or after the head moves. Together with the previous observation that average eye position is closely linked to head orientation even during active exploration, these results indicate strong interactions between eye and head movements at both fast and slow timescales in freely moving mice.

Results

Human participants (n = 34) performed a computerized task that involved making decisions about novel visual objects. Each objectwas randomly assigned a ground truth rank on the nonsense dimension of "brispiness" (Figure 1 A; whereis the most "brispy" andis the least). During initial training (train short), the 12 objects were split into two distinct sets (items–and–) and presented in alternating blocks of trials (contexts; see STAR Methods). Participants only made comparisons within each context and were asked to indicate with a button press which of two objects with adjacent rank (e.g.and) was more (or less) brispy, receiving fully informative feedback (Figure 1 B, upper panel). Note that this training regime allowed participants to infer ranks within a set (i.e. within–and–) but betrayed no information about the ground truth relation between the two sets (e.g. <). Participants were trained on adjacent relations to a predetermined criterion, with final training accuracy reaching 95.6% ± 2.9% (mean ± SD; Figure 1 C; see STAR Methods). The use of novel objectsand a nonword label was designed to minimize participants' tendency to use prior information when solving the task.

Each entry indicates a pair of stimuli defined by their row and column. Colors signal when the pair was trained or tested. Dark blue and red squares are within-context pairs, shown during train short. In addition to these, lighter blue and red squares (non-adjacent) and gray (untrained) are within-context pairs not seen during train short. The black squares are the pairs shown during boundary training (train long). All pairs are tested during test short and test long. Right: schematic of experimental sequence and legend. Although we use the same set of objects in these figures for display purposes, note that each participant viewed a unique, randomly sampled set of novel objects. The colored squares refer to the pairs trained or tested in each phase, using color conventions from the leftmost panel.

Step 2–Load Mirena into the insertion tube

Push the slider forward as far as possible in the direction of the arrow thereby moving the insertion tube over the Mirena T-body to load Mirena into the insertion tube (Figure 2). The tips of the arms will meet to form a rounded end that extends slightly beyond the insertion tube.

Maintain forward pressure with your thumb or forefinger on the slider. DO NOT move the slider downward at this time as this may prematurely release the threads of Mirena. Once the slider is moved below the mark, Mirena cannot be re-loaded.

Step 3–Setting the Flange

Holding the slider in this forward position, set the upper edge of the flange to correspond to the uterine depth (in centimeters) measured during sounding (Figure 3).

Step 4–Mirena is now ready to be inserted

Continue holding the slider in this forward position. Advance the inserter through the cervix until the flange is approximately 1.5–2 cm from the cervix and then pause (Figure 4).

Do not force the inserter. If necessary, dilate the cervical canal.

Step 5–Open the arms

While holding the inserter steady, move the slider down to the mark to release the arms of Mirena (Figure 5). Wait 10 seconds for the horizontal arms to open completely.

Step 6–Advance to fundal position

Advance the inserter gently towards the fundus of the uterus until the flange touches the cervix. If you encounter fundal resistance do not continue to advance. Mirena is now in the fundal position (Figure 6). Fundal positioning of Mirena is important to prevent expulsion.

Step 7–Release Mirena and withdraw the inserter

Holding the entire inserter firmly in place, release Mirena by moving the slider all the way down (Figure 7).

Continue to hold the slider all the way down while you slowly and gently withdraw the inserter from the uterus.
Using a sharp, curved scissor, cut the threads perpendicular, leaving about 3 cm visible outside of the cervix [cutting threads at an angle may leave sharp ends (Figure 8)]. Do not apply tension or pull on the threads when cutting to prevent displacing Mirena.

Mirena insertion is now complete. Prescribe analgesics, if indicated. Record the Mirena lot number in the patient records.

### A neural implementation model of feedback-based motor learning [^966ced99]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Reaching datasets for model training and testing

The network model was trained to produce a broad set of synthetic planar reaching trajectories following an instructed delay phase. The x and y positions of the starting (p start) and ending points (p end) of those trajectories were randomly drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from −6 cm to 6 cm. To simulate natural reaching behaviour, we interpolated between these points using a sigmoid functionwhere κ = 10 cm/s. The manually constructed reach trajectories were thus given by

which resulted in bell-shaped velocity profiles.

Each trial lasted 3 s and included an instructed delay period, randomly drawn from 0 to 1.5 s.

The network received an input signal consisting of a two-dimensional target signal and a one-dimensional timing signal. The target signal, defined as (p end − p start), was delivered to the network 0.2 s after trial onset, and kept fixed until the end of the trial. The timing signal (referred to as "Hold") was given in the form of a constant, and was switched to zero at the time corresponding to the "go" signal, which varied between 0.2 and 1.7 s for the random reaching task used during training (that is, when the network generated reaches of random direction and lengths up to 8.5 cm), and between 1.2 and 1.7 s for the centre-out-reaching task.

As mentioned above, during the last phase of the initial training phase, we included brief bump perturbations to the output of the network, so it had to learn to use the feedback input to correct its output online. In 75% of the trials, we added a pulse of 0.1 s duration and amplitude 10 cm/s on the velocity output of the model, either in the x or y direction. This pulse occurred randomly between 0.2 and 1.9 s after trial onset, to mimic perturbations at various movement periods.

After training, we tested the model on a centre-out-reaching task with eight targets equally distributed on a circle of 5-cm radius. Networks were subject to a variable delay period of between 1.2 and 1.7 s.

To probe online feedback correction and motor adaptation, we introduced a visuomotor rotation (VR) perturbation that rotated the output of the model by 30 ∘, similar to previous visuomotor rotation experiments in humansand monkeys. For the simulations in Fig. 4G, this angle was increased to 45º.

### Human navigation strategies and their errors result from dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties [^0403b17b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Goal-directed navigation requires continuously integrating uncertain self-motion and landmark cues into an internal sense of location and direction, concurrently planning future paths, and sequentially executing motor actions. Here, we provide a unified account of these processes with a computational model of probabilistic path planning in the framework of optimal feedback control under uncertainty. This model gives rise to diverse human navigational strategies previously believed to be distinct behaviors and predicts quantitatively both the errors and the variability of navigation across numerous experiments. This furthermore explains how sequential egocentric landmark observations form an uncertain allocentric cognitive map, how this internal map is used both in route planning and during execution of movements, and reconciles seemingly contradictory results about cue-integration behavior in navigation. Taken together, the present work provides a parsimonious explanation of how patterns of human goal-directed navigation behavior arise from the continuous and dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties in perception, cognition, and action.

### A versatile computational algorithm for time-series data analysis and machine-learning models [^0d380992]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Consider for a moment the traditional recurrence analysis approach for time-series data:whererepresents a time-series vector. If only a one-dimensional time-series vector is available (as above), time-delay embedding can be used to reconstruct the phase-space trajectory for the time-series, where m is the embedding dimension and t is the embedding delay:with the elements of V all being constructed frombased on some delay, t. The delay, like the embedding dimension, m, is estimated quantitatively. The recurrence matrixis 1 if x j is contained in a "ball"of radius > 0, and 0 otherwise as mediated by applying a Heaviside step function to the distance matrix to generate the recurrence plot, :whereis the step function which is 0 for values < 0 and 1 for values ≥ 0, andrepresents the threshold parameter. However, setting up an optimalcan be challenging, and we are also limited by the fact that significant dynamic features may be lost by-thresholding. With thresholding distance we are only including points along the trajectory that are "close" together without considering the context of the local neighborhood. This means that recurring patterns with respect to changes in phase-space trajectories are indistinguishable whenis contained within the ball of radius, and are excluding altogether whenis outside the ball of radius.

### To improve quality, leverage design [^4a59f7b2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

The DD model

The DD model is organised into four major stages — discover, define, develop and deliver. The two diamonds represent distinct periods of thinking — first to fully characterise the problem (discover, define), and then to craft human-centred solutions (develop, deliver). In the discovery and define periods, teams work to understand a process through the eyes of the user, conducting interviews and observations with users to generate insights about their behaviours and unmet needs and ultimately producing a shared problem definition. In DT, problems are often reframed as 'How might we… ' statements that foster a creative exploration of the challenge. In the develop and deliver stages, teams leverage their prior insights about unmet human needs to craft innovative solutions that directly address those needs, cocreating with users and other stakeholders to develop and test solution prototypes in a rapid, iterative fashion to identify and learn from early failures.

The diamond shape itself represents a key design principle — 'diverge, then converge'. In the diverging stages, teams capture and display as many ideas as possible without judgement, creating a psychologically safe space for creative exploration as all ideas are welcome. Once teams have 'diverged' in their thinking, they apply a more rigorous lens and 'converge' on a shared problem definition or chosen solution.

### Flexibility in motor timing constrains the topology and dynamics of pattern generator circuits [^ac3979c5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Time-keeping in feedforward networks

Feedforward networks have been proposed as alternatives to RNNs for generating temporal patterns. By organizing neurons into layers connected in a feedforward manner, these networks naturally map layer-specific neural activity to elapsed time. In this section, we focus on feedforward networks with a single neuron per layer (Fig. 4a). This simplification allows us to study the constraints that flexible time-keeping imposes on feedforward network dynamics analytically. Using insights gained from this treatment, we then discuss more realistic feedforward networks in the next section.

Fig. 4
Flexible timing with chains of single neurons. a Schematic showing the network architecture. b A chain of 11 integrate and fire neurons was simulated with the first spike time of each neuron marking an interval boundary.(the weight between node 4 and 5) was varied, which corresponds to changes to the gradient vector for the fifth interval (Methods). Changes with respect to baseline interval durations, which were 4.6 ms, are shown. Black denotes chain propagation breakdown. Vertical arrow shows the baseline network configuration with each neuron spiking once. c Example runs of a chain of integrate and fire neurons. Only one neuron per layer is shown. d Same as b, except neurons have a 1 ms refractory period

Applying the orthogonality constraint (Eq. 1) to feedforward networks revealed that flexible time-keeping requires that synaptic weights be mapped to interval durations in a unique one-to-one manner (Methods and Supplementary Note 2). Consider an interval I (α), the duration of which depends on activity in layers α −1 and α. In Methods and Supplementary Note 2, we prove that flexible time-keeping requires changes to the synaptic weight between layers α −1 and α, denoted here by W α, to affect only the duration of I α :As we show in Methods and Supplementary Note 2, the one-to-one mapping constraint (Eq. 5) is satisfied if synaptic weight changes that alter the timing of the post-synaptic neuron's activity leave its shape and magnitude unaffected. This ensures that downstream neurons encoding non-target intervals shift their activity in time by the same amount, keeping non-target interval durations unchanged, thus satisfying Eq. (5). Note that Eq. 5 is naturally satisfied by synaptic connections between downstream layers, as these cannot affect activity in upstream layers.

American Optometric Association hypoglycemia management during eye care — the treatment of a hypoglycemic episode may include the following steps: check blood glucose to confirm hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL); treat mild or moderate hypoglycemia (54–70 mg/dL) by giving 15–20 g of simple carbohydrates orally as immediate treatment, with options including 4 oz of fruit juice, 5 to 6 oz regular soda, 1 tablespoon of table sugar or honey, 2 tablespoons of raisins, or 3 to 4 glucose tablets; if initial blood glucose is ≤ 54 mg/dL, give 20–30 g of simple carbohydrates; re-check blood glucose after 15 minutes and repeat treatment until blood glucose returns to at least 90 mg/dL; provide a snack if the patient's next meal is more than one hour away (such as 6 saltine crackers, 3 graham cracker squares, or 1/2 peanut butter sandwich); dial 911 if patient is unconscious and treat with glucagon and/or intravenous glucose if it is available in the office; when patient is alert enough to swallow, give fruit, fruit juice, or sugar-sweetened soda immediately and follow steps 2 to 4.

### Expertise increases planning depth in human gameplay [^58ee0a07]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to plan multiple steps into the future 1,2. Despite decades of research 3–5, it is still debated whether skilled decision-makers plan more steps ahead than novices 6–8. Traditionally, the study of expertise in planning has used board games such as chess, but the complexity of these games poses a barrier to quantitative estimates of planning depth. Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive science often have a lower complexity 9,10 and impose a ceiling for the depth to which any player can plan. Here we investigate expertise in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity for skilled players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods to show that human behaviour can be captured using a computational cognitive model based on heuristic search. To validate this model, we predict human choices, response times and eye movements. We also perform a Turing test and a reconstruction experiment. Using the model, we find robust evidence for increased planning depth with expertise in both laboratory and large-scale mobile data. Experts memorize and reconstruct board features more accurately. Using complex tasks combined with precise behavioural modelling might expand our understanding of human planning and help to bridge the gap with progress in artificial intelligence.

### Action plan co-optimization reveals the parallel encoding of competing reach movements [^fd6f4a22]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Several influential cognitive theories propose that in situations affording more than one possible target of action, we prepare multiple competing movements before selecting one. Here we provide direct evidence for this provocative but largely untested idea and demonstrate why preparing multiple movements is computationally advantageous. Using a reaching task in which movements are initiated after one of two potential targets is cued, we show that the movement generated for the cued target borrows components of the movement that would have been required for the other, competing target. This interaction can only arise if multiple potential movements are fully specified in advance and we demonstrate that it reduces the time required to launch a given action plan. Our findings suggest that this co-optimization of motor plans is highly automatic and largely occurs outside conscious awareness.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.
