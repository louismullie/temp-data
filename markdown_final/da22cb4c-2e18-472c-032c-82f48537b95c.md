## Question

3 Suppose 2005 line segments are connected end-to-end, forming a closed polyline, and no two segments of the polyline lie on the same straight line. Then, what is the maximum number of intersection points where the polyline intersects itself?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maximum number of self-intersection points in a closed polyline made of 2005 line segments, with the constraint that no two segments are collinear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the combinatorial upper bound on intersections between pairs of segments. Then, I should verify which pairs can actually intersect given the closed-chain structure. Next, I will consider whether adjacent or near-adjacent segments can intersect, and how the "no two segments collinear" condition affects this. Finally, I will compute the maximum and confirm the result with a quick sanity check.

> Let me first confirm the combinatorial ceiling. In a set of n line segments, the maximum number of intersection points is given by choosing 2 segments out of n, which is C(n, 2) = n(n − 1)/2, because two distinct segments can intersect at most once. For n = 2005, that would be 2005 × 2004 / 2 = 2,009,010, but wait, let me verify whether all such pairs can actually intersect in a closed polyline before I accept that number [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. In a closed polyline, segments are connected end-to-end, so adjacent segments share a vertex and cannot intersect except at that shared vertex, which does not count as a proper crossing. Therefore, I need to subtract the pairs of adjacent segments from the total. There are exactly n adjacent pairs in a closed chain of n segments, so the maximum number of intersecting pairs is C(n, 2) − n = n(n − 1)/2 − n = n(n − 3)/2. For n = 2005, that is 2005 × 2002 / 2 = 2,007,005, but I should double-check whether even non-adjacent segments can always be made to intersect without violating the collinearity constraint [^notfound].

> I will now examine whether non-adjacent segments can indeed intersect. The "no two segments lie on the same straight line" condition prevents collinearity, but it does not prevent two non-adjacent segments from crossing in the plane; with careful geometric arrangement, we can make any pair of non-adjacent segments intersect at an interior point, so the bound n(n − 3)/2 is achievable in principle. Let me reconsider whether any additional constraints from the closed chain could block this, and I don't see a topological obstruction that would prevent realizing all such crossings simultaneously with appropriate vertex placements and segment orientations [^notfound].

> But wait, what if segments that are "almost adjacent" (separated by one segment) still cannot cross due to proximity constraints? Let me verify that. Even when segments are separated by a single intermediate segment, it is geometrically possible to arrange the chain so that those two segments cross, so the only pairs we must exclude are the n adjacent pairs. Therefore, the formula n(n − 3)/2 stands as the correct maximum. For n = 2005, that yields 2005 × 2002 / 2 = 2,007,005 intersection points, and I should confirm the arithmetic one more time: 2005 × 2002 = 4,014,010, divided by 2 is indeed 2,007,010, wait, I just misstated that; 4,014,010 divided by 2 is 2,007,005, not 2,007,010, so the correct maximum is 2,007,005 [^notfound].

> Final answer: The maximum number of self-intersection points is 2,007,005, achieved when every pair of non-adjacent segments intersects exactly once and no two segments are collinear [^notfound].

---

The maximum number of self-intersection points in a closed polyline with 2005 segments, where no two segments are collinear, is **2,007,005**. This is the number of ways to choose 2 segments from 2005, minus the 2005 adjacent pairs that cannot intersect (except at shared vertices), giving C(2005, 2) − 2005 = 2,007,005 [^notfound].

---

## Combinatorial analysis

- **Total pairs of segments**: C(2005, 2) = 2005 × 2004 / 2 = 2,009,010.
- **Adjacent pairs**: 2005 (each segment is adjacent to two others, but each pair is counted once).
- **Non-adjacent pairs**: 2,009,010 − 2005 = 2,007,005.

Each non-adjacent pair can intersect at most once, and with no three segments concurrent, each intersection is unique. Thus, the maximum is **2,007,005**.

---

## Geometric realizability

This bound is achievable: arrange the polyline so that every non-adjacent pair intersects exactly once, which is possible in the plane without violating the collinearity constraint. Adjacent segments only meet at vertices and do not contribute additional intersections.

---

## Final answer

The maximum number of self-intersection points is **2,007,005**.

In case volume and surface area should be estimated on the same fields of view, test points and test lines can be combined into test line segments. These test line segments contain two test points, one on each end.

### The role of intersection and street design on severity of bicycle-motor vehicle crashes [^0bfcd8a3]. Injury Prevention (2017). Low credibility.

Orthogonal intersection, non-orthogonal intersection and straight street

The crashes occurring within a 20 m radius of the centre of an intersection were considered as 'at or close' to that intersection (irrespective of the intersection categorisation on the police reports). Thus, we defined a 20 m radius from the centre of an intersection as 'within intersection proximity' in the spatial analysis, which is a little larger than 15 m adopted in other transportation studies. This approach was chosen to account for minor geospatial errors in recording the location data.

The street centreline file depicts each street with one line that is in the centre of the street. Each centreline is composed of several segments that were drawn by a cartographer when developing the centreline map. Usually, a real intersection is where segment end points for each intersection leg collide and merge. In order to measure the street angle at the intersection closest to a crash location, the closest street centreline to the crash location was identified using ArcMap's analysis tools and stored as separate information. Then, the second-closest street centreline to the crash location was identified and stored. Both first and second segments had to be within 20 m of crash location for the angle measurement. If the second segment was more than 20 m away, we assumed that the crash was not at the intersection. The two segments in the buffer (ie, closest and second-closest segments) were isolated for each crash in ArcMap (please see online supplementary appendix 1, for details of intersection angle calculation).

Detection of the margin of a structure

We define the margin of a structure as the cells in the periphery or border of a tissue structure. An example would be the margin of a tumor. Our margin detection algorithm is based on computing an alpha hull, a generalization of convex hull. The convex hull of a set of points is a closed curve of a minimum perimeter that contains the whole point set (Supplementary Fig. 13).

Unlike convex hulls which use straight line segments to connect the outermost layer of points, alpha hulls use curves, and are therefore better suited for defining tissue structure margins (Supplementary Fig. 14). All the curves in the alpha hull are generated from circles of the same radius. The radius of the circles (α) decides the curvature of the alpha hull. A larger α gives a less curved alpha hull, and fewer points are recognized as bordering cells. SPIAT computes a default α value based on the number of reference cells in the image, but the user can also choose to specify the value of α. Larger values of α are better for tissue structures with very complex or unclear borders, whereas smaller values of α give a better resolution for those with clearer borders. We used the R package alphahullto implement the alpha hull. The cells on the alpha hull are defined as the bordering cells of the structure.

Next, cells are assigned as either being "Inside", "Border", or "Outside" of the tissue structure by the R package sp, (Supplementary Fig. 15). First, our function draws a polygon that is composed of the bordering cells. Then, we use the point.in.polygon function from the sp package to locate the cells. This function implements the ray crossing method to determine if a point is inside of a polygon or outside. Starting from a point, a ray launches from the point. The number of intersections between the ray and the edges of the polygon indicates the location of the point. If the number is even, it means the point is outside of the polygon; odd, inside. As a result, each cell in the image is assigned an identity, "Inside", "Outside", or "Border".

Indicators for compliance threshold determination at intersection

In the scenario of a left-turn conflict with a straight-moving vehicle, it is difficult for the turning vehicle to generate as much displacement as possible in the forward direction of the straight-moving vehicle within the virtual lane, as defined in RSS. To address this issue, we adjusted RSS to eliminate the travel displacement of the leading vehicle. The adaptive RSS distance d aRSS is defined as follow:where v s represents the velocity of the straight-moving vehicle when the trigger is first activated, ρ represents the reaction time, which is equal to 0.458 s; and a min, brake represents the minimum braking deceleration, which is set to −0.7 m/s 2, i.e. the lower limit of deceleration for a straight-moving vehicle without interference.

The maximum acceleration a max, accel of a straight-moving vehicle when it crosses the stop line until a trigger is activated is defined as follows:where t s represents the time at which the straight-moving vehicle starts to overlap the stop line and t act represents the time at which the trigger is first activated.

The minimum accelerationof a straight-moving vehicle when the trigger is activated until the left-turning or straight-moving vehicle reaches the intersection point is defined as follows:where t pass represents the time at which the left-turning or straight-moving vehicles reach their trajectory intersection point.

The intersection points (x int, y int) can be calculated easily using the intersection point formula of the line segments. Using the coordinates of this intersection point and the states of the left-turning and straight-moving vehicles in the dataset, TTI left andwhen the trigger is active can be calculated as follows:where l traj represents the length of the trajectory between the vehicle and the intersection point; v x act and v y act represent the longitudinal and lateral speeds, respectively, of the vehicle when the trigger starts to activate, N represents the minimum number of sampling points for trajectories that contain intersection point; l veh represents the vehicle length.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

Immunohistochemistry

To determine the location of damaged collagen, the samples were stained using Col2-¾M and Col2-¾C short antibodies. Col2-¾M is a nonspecific indicator of collagen molecule damage, tagging an epitope within the triple-helix of the collagen molecule after the molecule is denatured. Col2-¾C short is a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the COOH terminus of the three-quarter fragment, which is generated very specifically by the cleavage of native type II collagen by mammalian collagenases. Using these antibodies, distinction can be made between mechanical damage (Col2-¾M) and enzymatic cleavage (Col2-¾C short). The staining procedures have been described in detail elsewhere. Adjacent sections were stained with safranin O.

Cartilage thickness

The thickness measurements were made according to a previously described method. The cartilage thickness was measured in the central zone of the tibial plateau and in the corresponding zone on the femoral condyle. For each specimen, five equally distanced (100 μm), safranin O-stained sections were measured at a 12.5× magnification using custom-made software. Manually, a polyline roughly delimiting the cartilage from the subchondral bone was produced. This polyline was converted to a b-spline consisting of a fixed number of points (500 points/section). Two parallel polylines were constructed from this b-spline. One of these polylines was offset to the inside, the other to the outside. A series of straight line segments was generated between each pair of points on these polylines. On each line segment, two points were automatically calculated (Fig. 4). The first one represents the transition between calcified cartilage and cartilage (tidemark level). The second one represents the outside edge of the cartilage. If necessary, these points could be corrected manually. The distance between these points was considered as the cartilage thickness along the line segment. The cartilage thickness was calculated as the mean length of all the segments generated. All sections were investigated blinded and in random order.

Schematic representation of cartilage thickness measurements. A series of straight line segments perpendicular to both of the polylines were generated. On each line segment, two points were automatically calculated. One point represents the transition between calcified cartilage and cartilage (tidemark), and the other point represents the outer edge of the cartilage. The distance between these points was considered as the cartilage thickness along the line segment. The mean length of all line segments between the two points was calculated as overall cartilage thickness

Fig. 5
a Selecting edges inside the bounding boxes; b detecting edge segments; c grouping and labeling edge segments; d adjusted straight lines; e adjusted curved lines

Sixteen peaks are identified in the Hough polar space, which determine the corresponding m and d parameters associated with 16 straight lines adjusted to the edges. The goal is to fit several piecewise line segments for the best description of the curved edges. This minimizes the effect of some adverse structures, such as edge protrusions seen at the top of the edges, which is detrimental when trying to fit a unique line. Segments with slopes tending toward the horizontal are excluded since the target edges to be described are oriented toward the vertical. For this purpose, segments with slopes less than 30° are discarded. Figure 5 b displays the segments extracted and associated with the four edges. Then, we proceed to isolate groups of segments to fit a unique line on the cloud of points that define the groupings of the segments. Figure 5 c displays the grouping of such lines; each group is identified by applying region labeling. Each labeled region is expanded horizontally by a morphological dilation operation with a structural element of 1 × 5. Each labeled and expanded region is intersected with the edges belonging to the bounding boxes, in this example, the ones displayed in Fig. 5 a. This allows the isolation of labeled pixel alignments, as displayed in Fig. 5 c, on which groups of labels are identified; in this example, four groups (1, 2, 3 and 4) are marked. For each group of labels, two least squared regression-based polynomial settings are applied. The first adjusts a straight line, as displayed in Fig. 5 d, and the second is to adjust a curve, i.e. a polynomial of degree equal to or greater than two. In all our experiments, we verified that a degree of two suffices (this is justified according to the experimental results explained in the Results and Discussion section). This means that the polynomial is defined as follows: x = a + by + cy 2, where the independent variable is expressed as y and a, b and c are the coefficients estimated by regression. For each grouping of pixels, the points with the maximum and minimum values of component y are identified, y iM and y im, where i represents the number of the group. Figure 5 e displays the four curves adjusted for the four edges available together with y 1 M, y 4 M, y 1 m and y 4 m for illustrative purposes.

Noise-reduction in pairwise alignments for subsequent segmentation

Pairwise alignments are retrieved from minimap2 in. paf format, in which each alignment can be interpreted as a four-dimensional vector from start (query-start/target-start) to end (query-end/target-end) coordinates. To prepare subsequent compression steps, alignments are pre-processed in multiple ways: First, alignments are filtered by a minimum length threshold (l), removing very short alignments. Second, alignment breakpoint coordinates are rounded in x and y direction to the closest multiple of a rounding parameter (r). Finally, alignment vectors are shortened along the x or y axis in case they do not have a slope of exactly 1 or -1 until they do so. The choice of r and l directly influence the expected dimensionality and complexity of the segmented dotplot. To maximize information content while limiting the size of segmented dotplots, we set l and r to be stepwise functions of the sequence length:
l = r = 100 for sequences smaller than 50 kbp
l = r = 1.000 for sequences between 50 kbp and 500 kbp
l = r = 10.000 for sequences between 500 kbp and 5 Mbp
l = r = 20.000 for sequences larger or equal to 5 Mbp

Alignment segmentation and dotplot condensation

A custom algorithm converts the pairwise alignment returned by minimap2 into a segmented representation (NAHRwhals step 3) which facilitates downstream analysis and implicitly identifies repeat pairs required for subsequent steps. Following noise-reduction, borders, or 'gridlines', separating unique sequence blocks, are inferred in an iterative way (Fig. S3). In the first iteration, horizontal and vertical gridlines are drawn starting from each start- or endpoint of any alignment. In every subsequent step, overlaps between existing gridlines and alignments are determined, with the points of overlaps serving as a new source for spawning a new gridline in perpendicular direction. This process is repeated until no new gridlines can be spawned. In rare cases where the determined grid exceeds predefined maximum dimensions (default: n_rows + n_cols ≤ 250; n_alignments ≤ 150), the parameters for minimum alignment length (l) and rounding (r) are doubled until dimension requirements are met. Any sequence interval between two gridlines is then considered a segment, and any pairwise alignment can be expressed as a matrix of alignment of segments (x: Ref, y: Query) (Fig. S3B).

### Validation of a new method for the detection of pathlines in vascular X-ray images [^869666e5]. Investigative Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

This article presents the validation of a new pathline approach, based on the wavefront propagation principle, on a large variety of vascular images. The purpose of the novel approach, called wavepath, was to minimize the variability of the measurements in the quantitative vascular analysis by reducing the variability that is introduced by manually placing the start and end points of the vessel segment. This results in a robust and reproducible pathline detection that is subsequently used in the analysis and lesion quantification. The validation study that was performed concerned a large variety of vessel segments and showed that the approach results in a pathline that is totally constant in its middle part. This holds not only for the straight segment version but also for the bifurcation version and ostial version of the algorithm. Moreover, the average number of additional points per pathline needed to guide the wavepath through the correct vessel is minimized to 0 for the straight segments, 0.06 for aortic bifurcations, 0.25 for carotid bifurcations, and 0.08 for the ostial segments. In conclusion, our new approach performs very well in all types of vascular x-ray images, resulting in a stable and robust pathline detection.

### Is the middle between both halves? midpoint location and segment size estimation in neglect [^b7e5475a]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Line bisection errors in neglect are attributed to perceptual size distortions. In order to compare the two segments of the line to determine if they are equal, one might first estimate the location of a midpoint that defines the two line segments to be compared.

Objectives

The authors attempted to determine whether estimating a line's midpoint can be dissociated from comparing the two segments of this line, and if so, what the relative contribution of each of these tasks is to the perceptual bias in neglect.

Methods

The authors studied two patients with hemispatial neglect from right hemisphere lesions by asking them where bisection marks were placed on prebisected lines and whether the two adjacent line segments were equal.

Results

There was a stronger bias judging the position of the bisecting marks ("where" determination) than comparing the size of two adjacent line segments.

Conclusions

These results suggest that perceptual size distortion of line segments alone cannot explain the subjects' line bisection bias, but postperceptual deficits in "where" computations may better account for their errors locating the midpoint. "Where" determinations might require more attentional capacity, depend more heavily on viewer-centered allocation of attention, and be mediated by the right hemisphere's "where" dorsal stream. In contrast, comparing the length of two segments might be mediated by the left hemisphere's "what" ventral stream.

### A deep-learning-based framework for identifying and localizing multiple abnormalities and assessing cardiomegaly in chest X-ray [^f4942464]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The CTR can be calculated using the convention of measuring the thoracic diameter (L) as the distance from the inner margin of the ribs at the level of the dome of the right hemidiaphragm and the cardiac diameter (L 1 + L 2) as the horizontal distance between the rightmost and leftmost margins of the cardiac shadow. In our study, the calculation of the CTR was based on the segmentation of both lungs and the heart in CXRs. In particular, we employed attention UNet to develop the deep model for the segmentation of both lungs and the heart, where the input image size was 512 × 512, the number of epochs was set to 100 and the batch size was set to 4. The initial learning rate was 0.00001; when the loss of the validation set increased for two consecutive epochs, the learning rate was reduced by half. Once the binary mask of both lungs and the heart was obtained, the thoracic diameter (L) and the cardiac diameter (L 1 + L 2) could be calculated by the proposed algorithm, where the process for doing so is described as follows.

Step 1: The closed morphology operation was applied to the mask to eliminate holes and burrs.

Step 2: By using the connected area labelling approach, the two largest connected areas of the lung and the largest connected area of the heart were preserved in the mask.

Step 3: The Canny operator was applied to the mask to obtain the single-pixel boundary between the lung and the heart.

Step 4: Traversing upwards from the lowest point of the right lung boundary using a number of horizontal lines, at least two intersections were encountered between each horizontal line and the boundary. The first two intersections were determined from left to right, and the distance between these two intersections was calculated. As the upwards traversal process proceeded, a number of difference values between two adjacent distances could be obtained. Note that the horizontal line that determined the maximum difference value can be regarded as a tangent line passing through the right diaphragm.

### Universal protein misfolding intermediates can bypass the proteostasis network and remain soluble and less functional [^44f22416]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Intra-molecular entanglement drives long-lived, soluble misfolded conformations

To determine what topological characteristics, if any, the misfolded conformations of different proteins have in common, we used the Gauss linking number calculated from linking between a closed loop formed by a native contact between residues i and j and the pseudo-closed loops formed by the flanking termini, g(i, j). This quantity provides a useful measure of whether subsections of the protein chain are entangled with each other. Misfolding, or changes in the linkage between the two closed loops, can then be identified by changes in the Gauss linking number of specific native contacts between a reference structure and a target structure (Fig. 3a, b).

Fig. 3
Detecting non-native entanglements in a monomeric protein structure.

a Schematic of how self-entanglements can be detected by examining the change in the Gauss linking number g(i, j) (Eq. (5)) between a closed loop (pink) formed by the backbone segment between residues i and j that form a native contact (gold dashed line) and another pseudo-closed loop formed by the C-terminal backbone segment (blue) and a pseudo-vector (dashed green line) connecting the C-terminal residue and the start of the C-terminal segment, which begins at residue j +1. Threading of the N-terminal segment (composed of residues 1 through i −1) is determined in a similar manner. Examples of different Gauss linking numbers and their corresponding structures are shown in this hypothetical illustration. The magnitude of g(i, j) is proportional to the number of threading events of the blue segment through the pink loop, while its sign is a function of the relative positioning of primary structure vectors at crossing points between the pink and blue segments. The structure with g(i, j) = 0 exhibits no entanglement. b An example of a gain in entanglement of the protein YjgH (PDB: 1PF5), where the C-termini (cyan) threads a loop (pink) formed by the native contact between residues D72 & Y104 (gold).

A protein is considered entangled if ≥ 50% of its misfolded trajectories are entangled. All error bars are 95% confidence intervals computed from bootstrapping 10 6 times.

### A universal state and its relaxation mechanisms of long-range interacting polygons [^3f92af34]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We further apply this simulation across a broad density range and summarize all results with two phase diagrams in Fig. 1g, for squares and triangles, respectively. When the cut-off distance R c is small, the stable states depend on shape and exhibit very poor 6-fold symmetry; however once the cut-off distance is large enough, the hexagonal plastic crystal universally appears. This is true for a broad density range, confirming the robust shape independency experimentally observed. In addition, simulations further reveal that adding or removing the long-range interaction tail only changes the total system energy by a small fraction around 15%, yet it completely eliminates the shape dependency, significantly changes the phase space, and makes the plastic crystal a universal state for various polygons.

Distinct structures formed by particle vertices

Experiments and simulations demonstrate that polygon shape makes very slight influence on the static structure of particle centers in the long-range interaction regime. Consequently, we may naturally ask: what is the role of shape in this regime then? Further investigation reveals that shape strongly influences the arrangement of particle vertices and determines the dynamic responses. In Fig. 2a, b we demonstrate the vertex structures of square and triangle systems, with the nearby vertices connected for a better illustration. Strikingly, despite that the raw images are exactly the same as Fig. 1b, c, the patterns formed by vertices give a completely different impression without any obvious hexagonal symmetry.

Note that Fig. 2a, b use the identical raw images as Fig. 1b, c. c 2D Fourier transform of square vertices indicates 6-fold symmetry. d 12-fold symmetry appears around ka /2 π = 2 for triangle vertices, with a the average particle distance. e collection of triangles' neighboring vertices from all configurations at this density. f 2D Fourier transform of e also exhibits an obvious 12-fold symmetry around ka /2 π = 2

### Sensitivity and spectral control of network lasers [^ad9cccab]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A derivative-free, greedy iterative algorithm was used to find the optimised pump patterns. Firstly, a coarse grid (8 × 5 grid with each pixel corresponding to 60 × 60 μ m 2 size on sample) was used. Starting from the pixel closest to the centre of the grid, each pixel was switched off consecutively and the change in the intensity of the selected lasing mode was calculated using the recorded spectral counts. For a given lasing peak p, we calculated the following quality function at each optimisation step n :where a n is the ratio of the intensity of the selected lasing peak p to the average intensity of the top M strongest lasing peaks (M = 10 in our experiments), all under pump pattern n. If Φ n > 0, the pump on that pixel was kept off, otherwise it was switched back on, and the routine was iterated. The final pattern from a first run was then fed as the initial pattern for a subsequent re-run with a finer grid (patch sizes of 30 × 30 μ m 2) for further optimisation.

Numerical construction of Buffon graphs

Buffon graphs were generated by drawing lines on a plane at random points with random slope. The intersections of all the lines within a square region on the plane were obtained and the length of the line segments between intersections calculated. If a segment length was smaller than a minimum distance of 1 μ m, the intersection points were merged together to the median point. The final set of intersection points and line segments was then used to specify the graph vertices and adjacency matrix. The Buffon graphs used for numerical calculations were constructed to be similar to the polymer nanofiber networks, with 96 nodes, 131 edges, average degree 4, and mean edge length 23.8 μ m.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

Contouring tools for annular segmentation — Freehand tool or Hounsfield-based contour detection yields a "Non-smoothened, irregular line following path of cursor or detected attenuation threshold" and can cause "Systematic overestimation of perimeter due to non-smoothened contour; Smoothing algorithms, can allow for more realistic perimeter assessment". Polygon methods use "Manual placed segmentation points connected by straight line without interpolation" and "Depending on the number of dots, this may yield a closer estimate of perimeter than freehand contouring without smoothing", whereas spline methods use "Manual placed segmentation points connected by a cubic spline interpolation – 'elastic ruler'" enabling "Accurate quantification of annular perimeter".

### Realization and topological properties of third-order exceptional lines embedded in exceptional surfaces [^d357310a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

As the counterpart of Hermitian nodal structures, the geometry formed by exceptional points (EPs), such as exceptional lines (ELs), entails intriguing spectral topology. We report the experimental realization of order-3 exceptional lines (EL3) that are entirely embedded in order-2 exceptional surfaces (ES2) in a three-dimensional periodic synthetic momentum space. The EL3 and the concomitant ES2, together with the topology of the underlying space, prohibit the evaluation of their topology in the eigenvalue manifold by prevailing topological characterization methods. We use a winding number associated with the resultants of the Hamiltonian. This resultant winding number can be chosen to detect only the EL3 but ignores the ES2, allowing the diagnosis of the topological currents carried by the EL3, which enables the prediction of their evolution under perturbations. We further reveal the connection between the intersection multiplicity of the resultants and the winding of the resultant field around the EPs and generalize the approach for detecting and topologically characterizing higher-order EPs. Our work exemplifies the unprecedented topology of higher-order exceptional geometries and may inspire new non-Hermitian topological applications.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### A PET / CT approach to spinal cord metabolism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^320b6be0]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Image analysis

The different spinal canal and SC districts were defined anatomically considering the cervical segment as the region between the skull base and the plane adjacent to the caudal face of the C7 vertebral body. The dorsal segment was defined as the district between this plane and the one adjacent to the caudal face of D12. The sacral and lumbar canal districts were a priori considered free from SC and were thus excluded from the analysis.

Images were analysed according to a previously validated method based on generalization of the Hough transform technique for pattern recognition. According to the original definition, given a pointin the image plane satisfying the equation of a straight linethe Hough transform of P, with respect to the class of straight lines, is the straight line of equationinto the parameter space where the two independent real parameters a, b vary. This definition implies that all points on the line (1) in the image space correspond to lines in the parameter space that all intersect at the point (a, b) uniquely identifying the original line. This correspondence between the image and the parameter spaces holds not only for lines, but also for several classes of algebraic curves. This simple fact inspired the following pattern recognition algorithm for the identification of curves in a digital image:
Apply the traditional Canny edge detection algorithm to extract discontinuities.
Compute the Hough transforms with respect to the selected family of curves of all points in the image plane highlighted by the edge detection process.
Discretize the parameter space into cells whose size is optimized for the specific recognition problem (for the recognition of SC the four-dimensional parameter space is discretized with hypercubes with side equal to 0.02, while for the recognition of the spinal canal the two-dimensional parameter space is discretized with squares with side again 0.02).
Construct an accumulator function defined on the discretized parameter space such that for each cell the value of the accumulator function is equal to the number of Hough transforms passing through that cell.
Search for the parameter values identifying the cell where the accumulator function reaches its maximum.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Modeling the electrical resistivity of polymer composites with segregated structures [^efc4bc6b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Computational modeling

To represent a random configuration of silica particles on a cubic domain, spheres are scattered by choosing the center coordinates of each individual sphere uniformly at random. Spheres are placed one-by-one so that the distances from the designated center position to the center positions of pre-existing spheres are apart from each other farther than the diameter. The diameter of the sphere is set to the average size of the silica filler, and the number of spheres per unit volume is determined according to the weight ratio of silica particles in the composite samples used in the experiments.

Upon the completion of the random placement of circular fillers, a CNT network is created on the domain by placing multiple random instances of a flexible wire. According to morphological characteristics as observed in the SEM and TEM images, a random instance of the wire is placed so that a CNT wire is distributed uniformly in the simulation domain and can proceed forwardly to pass through a gap between silica particles but cannot penetrate the particles. The flexibility of a CNT wire is reflected by modeling them as a series of small line segments connected with joints that can bend freely within a certain degree (up to 120°). To create a single wire on the domain, constituting line segments are placed in sequence from one side to the other. The first line segment is placed at random in the volume that spheres do not occupy. Subsequent line segments are placed in a straight line unless they touch spheres. If the line segment touches a sphere, the direction of the line segment is changed toward a tangential direction of the sphere in contact so that the wire smoothly circumvents the sphere. The width and length of a single wire are set to the average diameter and length of CNTs used in the experiment, respectively. The length of a line segment is set the same as the width of the wire, and thus the line segment can be thought as of a small spherical cylinder of the identical height and width, i.e. with a square side view. This facilitates the test for the connectivity of two wires since the contact suffices to check whether, at each endpoint of a line segment, there exists any other endpoint of a line segment from a different wire within a ball of radius equal to the length of the line segment centered at the endpoint. A graphical description of the procedure is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. A sample cubic domain of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm is taken from the composite model to obtain the CNT network. The connectivity of the domain is checked by examining the contacts between flexible wires. For a pair of two wires, all possible pairwise distances between two line segments from respective wires are calculated. If at least one value of the distances is less than 2 nm, which is based on a tunneling mechanism (see Supplementary Note 1) –, the two wires are considered to be in contact at the position of the corresponding line segments. A graphical representation of the procedure is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. A clustering analysis identifies percolating clusters of wires that span across the domain. Starting from the leftmost wires touching the left end, each cluster is expanded gradually toward the right end by including wires in contact. If a cluster contains one of the rightmost wires touching the right end, this cluster is declared to be a conducting path. For all conducting paths, KCL is applied at all junctions of wires to construct a system of linear equations about voltage drops across the junctions due to the contact resistivity (ρ c). In the simulation, ρ c is considered as a tunneling resistivity arising from the thin insulating layer (i.e. epoxy resin) between crossing CNTs –. Since 1 V voltage is assumed to apply across the domain, the inverse of the solution of the system of linear equations corresponds to the overall resistance of the network. This process is repeated to obtain 500 independent random instances, and an ensemble average of the resistance is calculated based on the set of tested samples between 30th percentile and 70th percentile. The simulation is conducted over different configurations of silica content, silica size, CNT content, and CNT dimension. For massive simulation, the source code is implemented in MATLAB parallel computing tool box.

### Measurement of cortical thickness from MRI by minimum line integrals on soft-classified tissue [^0361785e]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Estimating the thickness of the cerebral cortex is a key step in many brain imaging studies, revealing valuable information on development or disease progression. In this work, we present a framework for measuring the cortical thickness, based on minimizing line integrals over the probability map of the gray matter in the MRI volume. We first prepare a probability map that contains the probability of each voxel belonging to the gray matter. Then, the thickness is basically defined for each voxel as the minimum line integral of the probability map on line segments centered at the point of interest. In contrast to our approach, previous methods often perform a binary-valued hard segmentation of the gray matter before measuring the cortical thickness. Because of image noise and partial volume effects, such a hard classification ignores the underlying tissue class probabilities assigned to each voxel, discarding potentially useful information. We describe our proposed method and demonstrate its performance on both artificial volumes and real 3D brain MRI data from subjects with Alzheimer's disease and healthy individuals.

### 3D-FVS: construction and application of three-dimensional fundus vascular structure model based on single image features [^844c2c47]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Vascular structure surface model

Considering the optic disc was one of the widest research areas in ophthalmic related diseases, our method only studied on it and these areas were labelled by a professional doctor firstly. In this stage, the methods used to build vascular structure surface models were the same as which was implemented in SimVascular, a software used to construct hemodynamic model in the following steps. Firstly, this method required to extract the centreline and downsample the points on it. Then the radius of cross-section corresponding to the point will be calculated and circles with these points as the centre will be drawn. Finally, these contours will be connected smoothly to form the vascular structure surface model.

This study utilized the Zhang-Suen thinning algorithm to skeletonize the segmented fundus vascular images. Each iteration step of this algorithm was to corrode the target pixels satisfying certain conditions. This algorithm was iteratively executed until no new pixels were corroded. The output of this skeletonization step was illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1a. Then all the points on the skeleton line will be traversed for finding the coordinates of the endpoints and intersections of the skeleton line, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, by calculating the number of points near the point with the size of 3 × 3 area. When the points on the skeleton line were too dense, it will lead to the intersection between the corresponding contours of every two points (which was shown in Fig. 2j), and the blood vessel modelling process cannot be completed at this time. Therefore, downsample was used to prevent intersections between the corresponding contours of every two feature points by removing points in a fixed number of intervals.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^31dd0050]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Upon inspection, the problem can be transformed to streamline coordinates (Fig. 2a) using the function

In the streamline domain Φ, the problem is equivalent to a channel geometry with flows of concentration c = 1 and c = 0 separated by a no-flux boundary condition on the origin. At the stagnation point, the no-flux condition is dropped, and the flows are free to mix (Fig. 2a) (see Supplementary Table 2 for more details on the streamline problem). The separating streamline going from the stagnation point to the aspiration aperture corresponds to the semi-infinite segment of the horizontal axis where the fluids can mix. If the Péclet number is high enough (higher than about 10, which is always realized in microfluidics applications), this segment can be taken to have concentration c = 1/2 and the walls of the channel geometry can be safely ignored (Supplementary Note 1). The problem can thus be decomposed in two problems of advection-diffusion around semi-infinite obstacles of fixed concentration. The problem of advection-diffusion around such a semi-infinite obstacle has been extensively studied in theoretical fluid mechanics, notably in the theory of dendrite solidification, and in the study of out of plane flow in Burgers vortex sheets. It yields the solutionwhere Φ stag is the image of the stagnation point and erf(x) is the error function. The sign of ± is determined by whether we have an incoming flow of concentration c = 0 or c = 1. However, neither of these concentration profiles represent the full dipole footprint when transformed. This can be seen physically in the flow dipole, in which there is both incoming fluid at concentration 0 (aspirated from the system's surroundings), and incoming fluid at concentration 1 (injected by the aperture). To solve this issue, we separate the problem into an "interior" and an "exterior" domain at the streamline of concentration c = 1/2 (see checkerboard insets in Fig. 2). There remains a discontinuity in our solution due to the branch cut of the logarithm functions in Eq. (1), but the solution can be made continuous by placing the singularities on the real axis and using it as an axis of symmetry. The final step is then to obtain the entire solution as a piecewise function assembling the "interior" and "exterior" solutions, given by transforming Eq. (6) back to the dipole flow domain Z. The interior and exterior domains can be defined either by checking the sign of Φ in the streamline domain or by using the expression for the separating line in the Z domain in polar coordinates (see Supplementary Note 2).

### Machine learning model for predicting the conversion to dementia using the cube copying test [^cec799ee]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that very early signs of constructional apraxia-like symptoms are already present during the preclinical or MCI stages in individuals who will eventually convert to AD, DLB, or FTD and that these subtle changes can be detected using high-precision AI technology. Visuospatial dysfunction in patients with dementia encompasses difficulties in object recognition, spatial orientation, figure-ground discrimination, visual integration, and visual attention. – These impairments are often reflected in CCT drawings as inappropriate sizes, inaccurate line lengths and shapes, failures in connecting lines or positioning, lack of parallelism, missing elements, unnecessary lines, and distortions or simplifications of three-dimensional structures.–

In this study, converters' drawings exhibited greater discrepancies from the reference values for the number of lines in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and the number of vertices compared to those of non-converters. These deviations likely reflect characteristics such as drawing with multiple discontinuous lines rather than a single straight line, producing wavy lines, endpoints failing to overlap at a single point, and lines that were inappropriately segmented or connected at incorrect points.

Converters also exhibited shorter horizontal and vertical lines and longer diagonal lines than non-converters, along with greater variance in the lengths of all line types. This pattern suggests a distorted drawing style characterized by compromised perspective and reduced accuracy. Additionally, the average angle differences between lines of the same type, as well as the variance of angle differences between horizontal and diagonal lines, were larger. These findings indicate that converters' drawings lacked parallelism, reflecting inconsistency in their drawing styles (Figure 7).

Figure 7.
Characteristics of converters' drawings. (a) Multiple discontinuous, wavy lines instead of a single straight line. (b) Lines segmented at intersections with other lines. (c) Endpoints do not converge at a single point. (d) Incorrect connection positions of endpoints. (e) Lengths and angles between lines of the same type differ, causing a lack of parallelism.

### Consensus guide on CT-based prediction of stopping-power ratio using a hounsfield look-up table for proton therapy [^20db469a]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Studies have shown large variations in stopping-power ratio (SPR) prediction from computed tomography (CT) across European proton centres. To standardise this process, a step-by-step guide on specifying a Hounsfield look-up table (HLUT) is presented here.

Materials and Methods

The HLUT specification process is divided into six steps: Phantom setup, CT acquisition, CT number extraction, SPR determination, HLUT specification, and HLUT validation. Appropriate CT phantoms have a head- and body-sized part, with tissue-equivalent inserts in regard to X-ray and proton interactions. CT numbers are extracted from a region-of-interest covering the inner 70% of each insert in-plane and several axial CT slices in scan direction. For optimal HLUT specification, the SPR of phantom inserts is measured in a proton beam and the SPR of tabulated human tissues is computed stoichiometrically at 100 MeV. Including both phantom inserts and tabulated human tissues increases HLUT stability. Piecewise linear regressions are performed between CT numbers and SPRs for four tissue groups (lung, adipose, soft tissue, and bone) and then connected with straight lines. Finally, a thorough but simple validation is performed.

Results

The best practices and individual challenges are explained comprehensively for each step. A well-defined strategy for specifying the connection points between the individual line segments of the HLUT is presented. The guide was tested exemplarily on three CT scanners from different vendors, proving its feasibility.

Conclusion

The presented step-by-step guide for CT-based HLUT specification with recommendations and examples can contribute to reduce inter-centre variations in SPR prediction.

### Electrocardiographic predictors of coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac deaths in men and women free from cardiovascular disease in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^9015ae5b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
ST‐T vector magnitude curve with temporal landmarks and measurement points for key intervals and amplitudes in the repolarization model. The peak of the global T wave (T p) coincides with the rate‐adjusted QTpeak (QT pa). The time point of Tonset (T o) corresponding to the rate‐adjusted QTonset interval (QT oa) is obtained by extrapolating the line from the time of maximum slope at T‐wave upstroke (T xc) to the intersection with the horizontal line drawn from the minimum ST after the J‐point. The time of the minimum slope at the T‐wave downstroke (T xd) defines the end point of the T p T xd interval conceived in the repolarization model to represent initial left ventricular repolarization time (RT) dispersion. Double arrow signifies ST segment convexity as the difference of the ST segment from the gradient line from the ST onset to T p.

In addition to θ(T p |T ref), a number of other spatial angles reflecting deviations of the direction of repolarization from the reference normal direction during various repolarization subintervals and other repolarization‐related interval and amplitude variables were used in various phases of the study. Their definitions are listed in the footnotes of the corresponding tables.

Back-extrapolated volume (BEV) on the volume–time curve — Time 0 is found by drawing a line with a slope equal to peak flow through the point of peak flow on the volume–time curve and setting Time 0 to the point where this line intersects the time axis. The BEV is equal to the volume of gas exhaled before Time 0, which, in these two examples from the same patient, is 0.136 L for the left panel (acceptable) and 0.248 L for the right panel (unacceptable). For this patient, the BEV limit is 5% FVC = 0.225 L.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

### Principles of epidemiology: lesson 4, section 3 archive… [^789defc5]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

The dependent variable, number of cases, is shown on the vertical axis. A grid is included in Figure 4. 1 to illustrate how points are plotted. For example, to plot the point on the graph for the number of cases in 1953, draw a line up from 1953, and then draw a line from 449 cases to the right. The point where these lines intersect is the point for 1953 on the graph. In an arithmetic-scale line graph, a set distance along any axis represents the same quantity anywhere on that axis. In Figure 4. 2, for example, the space between tick marks along the y-axis represents an increase of 10, 000 cases anywhere along the axis — a continuous variable. Furthermore, the distance between any two tick marks on the x-axis represents a period of time of one year. This represents an example of a discrete variable. Thus an arithmetic-scale line graph is one in which equal distances along either the x- or y- axis portray equal values.

More About the X-axis and the Y-axis When you create an arithmetic-scale line graph, you need to select a scale for the x- and y-axes. The scale should reflect both the data and the point of the graph. For example, if you use the data in Table 4. 14 to graph the number of cases of measles cases by year from 1990 to 2002, then the scale of the x-axis will most likely be year of report, because that is how the data are available.
- Make the length of the y-axis shorter than the x-axis so that your graph is horizontal or "landscape. " A 5: 3 ratio is often recommended for the length of the x-axis to y-axis.
- Always start the y-axis with 0. While this recommendation is not followed in all fields, it is the standard practice in epidemiology. Frequency polygons A frequency polygon, like a histogram, is the graph of a frequency distribution. In a frequency polygon, the number of observations within an interval is marked with a single point placed at the midpoint of the interval.

Each point is then connected to the next with a straight line. Figure 4. 13 shows an example of a frequency polygon over the outline of a histogram for the same data. This graph makes it easy to identify the peak of the epidemic.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Smoking-attributable cancer mortality in California, 1979–2005 [^11d351d6]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Annual percentage change

To better compare the SACMR trend of California to that of the rest of the US during 1979–2005, we applied the Joinpoint regression model to identify the significant change points and to report the annual percentage change (APC) between the identified points. The Joinpoint regression interpreted changes over time more accurately and determined if those changes were statistically significant. We used the Joinpoint regression program V.3.3to fit the Joinpoint regression models. The program took the SACMR trend data in 1979–2005 and fitted a series of straight lines to the SACMR on the log scale. The straight lines were connected together at the year of 'joinpoints'. Each joinpoint year denoted a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) change in trend. The tests of significance used the Monte Carlo permutation method to find the 'best fit' line for each time period defined by the joinpoint years. The program started with the minimum number of joinpoint (eg, 0 joinpoints, which is a straight line) and tested whether more joinpoints were statistically significant and must be added to the model (up to that maximum number). The program provided model fitting results and one graph for each joinpoint model, from the model with the minimum number of joinpoints to the model with maximum number of joinpoints. The program also marked a model with the optimum number of joinpoints, which we used as the final model to best describe the SACMR trends in California and the rest of the US during 1979–2005. In addition, the program provided the annual percentage change of SACMR and its 95% CI over each time period defined by the joinpoint years. The annual percentage change summarised the SACMR trend between two joinpoint years. More details of the Joinpoint Regression Program can be found at. We compared the joinpoint years and the APC values of the SACMR during 1979–2005 between California and the rest of the US.

### Quantification of the shape of fiber tracts [^cbeacc43]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The fiber tracts generated using diffusion MRI are usually simply displayed and assessed visually for a specific clinical or medical research purpose. This paper proposes computational techniques that can be used to study the shape of the tracts and make interindividual comparisons. These methods make use of fundamental geometric invariants, such as curvatures and torsions, or Fourier descriptors, together with the link of a pair of curves. Intersubject comparisons only require that the starting and ending points of the tracts can be defined and do not require point-by-point correspondences such as obtained using image registration. Principal component analysis-based shape analysis is also investigated. The invariants are tested on simulations and in vivo datasets, and the scale dependence and noise sensitivity of the measures are assessed. The potential for these techniques to be used in neuroscience research and clinical applications is demonstrated.

### Bending forces and nucleotide state jointly regulate F-actin structure [^fff2edfc]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Rise, twist and curvature measurements

Rise and twist were measured along deformed actin filament axes using custom Python scripts, implementing an approach similar to previously described helix deformations –. First, a central axis was defined using a 3D spline fit. To minimize edge effects, the model was extended by copying the model twice, aligning the terminal three subunits of one copy's barbed end with the terminal three subunits of the original model's pointed end and then aligning the terminal three subunits of the other copy's pointed end with the terminal three subunits of the original model's barbed end. The overlapping subunits from the copied models were deleted to generate a final, 42-protomer model. This was used to define the central spline while sufficiently minimizing edge effects.

To define the 3D spline for each filament's central axis, an iterative, orientation-independent approach was implemented using a set of waypoints. The initial 41 waypoints were defined as the set of 3D coordinates corresponding to the centroid of 2 consecutive subunits in a rolling window along the filament. A 3D cubic spline with a natural boundary condition was then fit through the set of waypoints to generate the initial filament axis. A set of line segments with a length equal to the filament's radius and one end positioned at each subunit's centroid was aligned to minimize the free end's distance from the spline. The waypoints were then updated to become the Euclidean average of two of these consecutive free ends. The process of updating the 3D cubic spline, defining new line segment extensions from the subunit centroids, and updating waypoints was repeated 500 times to obtain the final central axis spline.

Automatic measurement of Cobb angle in patients with scoliosis.

Objective

To test the accuracy of an automatic Cobb angle determination method from frontal radiographical images.

Summary Of Background Data

Thirty-six frontal radiographical images of patients with scoliosis.

Methods

A modified charged particle model is used to determine the curvature on radiographical spinal images. Three curve fitting methods, piece-wise linear, splines, and polynomials, each with 3 variants were used and evaluated for the best fit. The Cobb angle was calculated out of these curve fit lines and compared with a manually determined Cobb angle. The best-automated method is determined on the basis of the lowest mean absolute error and standard deviation, and the highest R2.

Results

The error of the manual Cobb angle determination among the 3 observers, determined as the mean of the standard deviations of all sets of measurements, was 3.37°. For the automatic method, the best piece-wise linear method is the 3-segments method. The best spline method is the 10-steps method. The best polynomial method is poly 6. Overall, the best automatic methods are the piece-wise linear method using 3 segments and the polynomial method using poly 6, with a mean absolute error of 4,26° and 3,91° a standard deviation of 3,44° and 3,60°, and a R2 of 0.9124 and 0.9175. The standard measurement error is significantly lower than the upper bound found in the literature (11.8°).

Conclusion

The automatic Cobb angle method seemed to be better than the manual methods described in the literature. The piece-wise linear method using 3 segments and the polynomial method using poly 6 yield the 2 best results because the mean absolute error, standard deviation, and R2 are the best of all methods.

### ASNC imaging guidelines for SPECT nuclear cardiology procedures: stress, protocols, and tracers [^51c4039a]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) nuclear cardiology — heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) determination provides an ROI-based method in which "The following steps are recommended:" first, for heart counts draw an irregular ROI along the epicardial border and avoid adjacent lung and liver if possible; second, for mediastinal counts draw a horizontal line at the lung apices (or the top of the display if apices are not included) and a vertical line equidistant from the medial lungs, then examine the counts for "the 12 pixels" along this vertical line "starting 4 pixels at the horizontal/vertical line intersection point", identify the lowest-count pixel (choose the most superior if tied), draw a "7 × 7" square ROI around it, and calculate HMR by dividing myocardium counts/pixel by "the counts/pixel in the 7 × 7 mediastinal ROI".

### Standards for quantitative assessments by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA): an expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) [^c62a38c1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2024). High credibility.

CCTA assessment of intervened coronary artery segments — treated segment boundaries, stenosis calculation, and illustrative examples specify that the treated coronary segment includes 5 mm proximal and distal to the boundaries of the stent, bioresorbable scaffold or balloon, and in stented segments the treated segment is between dashed lines which are 5 mm away from the edges. Area stenosis is calculated as the percentage lumen reduction at the narrowest section (minimum lumen area relative to the averaged reference areas) measured outside the treated segment (> 5 mm beyond the edges). Imaging limitations include that blooming and beam hardening prevent accurate evaluation of the lumen within metal stents. Examples include a chronic total occlusion with occluded segment of 37.8mm measured along the curved reconstruction and a bifurcation disease annotated as Medina classification 1, 1, 0 with measurement of the angles between the left anterior descending coronary artery and a diagonal branch.

### Brain damage: neglect disrupts the mental number line [^3653f4cb]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

A popular metaphor for the representation of numbers in the brain is the 'mental number line', in which numbers are represented in a continuous, quantity-based analogical format. Here we show that patients with hemispatial neglect misplace the midpoint of a numerical interval when asked to bisect it (for example, stating that five is halfway between two and six), with an error pattern that closely resembles the bisection of physical lines. This new form of representational neglect constitutes strong evidence that the mental number line is more than simply a metaphor, and that its spatial nature renders it functionally isomorphic to physical lines.

### Grasping through dynamic weaving with entangled closed loops [^706e785c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Principle of the woven structure.

a Woven structure in fabric. b Threads form the warp and weft with position differences along the z -axis. c Every thread intersects at the center with a position difference in the z -axis by moving linearly. Adjacent threads are each at a relatively high (+) or low (−) position in the z -direction. d Weaving mechanism reconfiguration for gripper by connecting the end of each strip with making a closed loop.

The gripper consists of multiple identical closed-loop strips, each serving as both a warp and a weft. Each strip was designed as a single line connecting two circular plates (outer and inner plate) with different sizes at each end (Fig. 2a). The middle part of the strip is twisted byto form a loop so that the upper faces of the plates at both ends of the strip face are equally upward. Inner and outer bound points exist, which are the boundaries of the plates and strip (Fig. 2b). The boundary between the inner plate and strip is the inner bound point, and the boundary between the outer plate and strip is the outer bound point. Owing to the input rotation valueof the inner plate, an angular difference occurs between the tangents at the inner and outer points, which affects the shape of the loop and ultimately enables the weave. Additionally, two offsets exist between these two points (Fig. 2b, c): the differences in the plate size and thickness of the stacked strips cause radial position and height offsets denoted byand, respectively. In the weaving process, the aforementioned offsets enable the transition between the woven and unwoven states without interference between the strips. The outer plate at the bottom is fixed to the frame, and the inner plate at the top is connected to the electric motor. By rotating the inside plate clockwise, we induced strip motion by creating a relative rotational motion between the two plates (Supplementary Video 1). The strips were placed circularly along the inner and outer ground. To explain the weaving mechanism, we simulated the structural changes of the weaving gripper with eight strips through finite element analysis (FEA) and analyzed its trajectories at different rotation angles. For clarity, only the reference strip and the preceding and following strips in the clockwise position changes are illustrated in Figs. 2f, i, l, o, and r.

### Relationship between rheology and structure of interpenetrating, deforming and compressing microgels [^e59c3230]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Edge detection and contour smoothing of particles imaged by dSTORM

Our goal now is to obtain a faithful contour of each particle and use it for measuring different geometric features such as the particle area, area overlap and deformations. To this end we must first segment the image, that is separate the particle from the background and determine the boundary. There are several methods in image analysis to accomplish this, all with their advantages and pitfalls. More sophisticated methods involve gradients or Laplacians of the image. What characterizes an edge is a sharp change in intensity, making derivatives well suited to capture their locations. We use the Laplacian of Gaussian edge detector in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc. USA), which allows for edges to be selected based on their strength, and not on image intensity values. It also produces closed contours without branching, unlike methods based solely on thresholding. The Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection consists of the following steps: first the image is smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian kernel, then the Laplacian (second derivative in 2D) is calculated and finally the zero-crossings are found which correspond to edges. Examples for the image segmentation done with this method, starting from a dSTORM image of a typical round and a more compressed and deformed particle are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. The two particles also display different intensities (i.e. density of blinking events detected), yet we can see that the overall shapes and sizes are well captured, with a decrease in size and deformations clearly visible for the second example. Nonetheless, the presence of significant roughness of the contour remains an obstacle in characterizing shape deformations. Visual inspection of the original deformed particle image clearly suggest five corners and nearly flat facets and this are the features to isolate by image analysis. In order to smooth the particle contours while maintaining the prominent shape features we need to eliminate small scale shape fluctuations without significantly altering the overall larger scale shape and corners. To this end we use the method of Fourier descriptors, which has been used for a variety of applications involving image analysis. By taking the Fourier transform of the contour different spatial frequencies can be separated, then, by appropriate filtering, a smoothed contour can be retrieved and used as a starting point for further analysis. First, coordinates of the boundary pixels with respect to the particle′s center of mass are extracted from the segmented image and ordered counterclockwise. We thus obtain a discrete curve [x j, y j] with j = 1. N where N is the number of pixels. Then, the coordinates are transformed into complex numbers as z j = x j + iy j. Now the Fourier descriptors Z (k) are calculated using a discrete Fourier transform

### Glass-cutting medical images via a mechanical image segmentation method based on crack propagation [^b06e7ef0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Initial crack

In each partial model, we set an initial crack. The initial crack will grow along grooves under external load until reaching object boundaries. For the first local model, the initial crack needs to be specified. After completing crack propagation in the current region, the next local model can be determined according to the position and the orientation of the crack. The new area will partially overlap the old one so that it can contain the end portion of the crack in the previous area as the initial crack.

The initial crack in the first local model can be provided either manually or automatically (Fig. 10b). In the manual method (top half of Fig. 10b), one needs only to choose a short line a few pixels in length along the target boundary as the position of the initial crack in the mechanical model. This selection is simple and accurate because the target boundary is generally very clear in such a location and there is an obvious groove corresponding to the target boundary in the mechanical model. For the automatic method (bottom half of Fig. 10b), the initial crack can be generated by the following procedure: define the side length of square ABCD representing the local image to be 2 L. The target boundary intersects with the two parallel edges AD and BC. Draw a straight line starting from P M1, the midpoint of the side AB, and passing through P M2, the midpoint of the side DC, ending at the point O. The distance from P M1 to O is N times the length of AB (N > 1). Therefore, a triangle AOB is formed with angle at point O equal to φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N)). Dividing φ by an integer m defines the angle increment, Δ φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N))/ m. Starting at line OA, and sweeping toward line OB by incrementing the angle by Δ φ each iteration, the ray with angle φ i = i Δ φ (i = 0, 1, 2,…) will intersect the target boundary at the point P i in this local image area. Because the grayscale value of the pixels at the target boundary changes significantly, an edge-detection operator, such as the Canny edge detector, can easily identify the coordinates of the points P i. After detecting several boundary points, the initial crack of the first local model can be automatically formed by connecting these points to form a small line segment.

### Unlocking the general relationship between energy and entanglement spectra via the wormhole effect [^16f8bb34]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The reader may ask that even if the rules on the connections of replicas (integer imaginary time) resemble the closed system, how about the rules of other imaginary times? As shown in Fig. 3 c, the real worldline (solid line) means it is at the τ A = 0, 1, 2. we can measure, i.e. the connected part of two nearest replicas, and the virtual process goes in/out of one replica are denoted as the dashed line. Furthermore, becauseis independent on imaginary time, the rule of worldline evolution should be same in any time, i.e. the translation invariance of time. Thus, is likely to be the similar asof real closed A system all the time. A more intuitive diagram can be seen in Fig. 3e, the blue line means the space-time world of EH which is time independent. The green line represents the space-time world of replica manifold, i.e. the system drawn in (a). These two worlds cross at integer time points, thus, we can obtain the information of EH from the green system at integer time.

The above argument can be applied to the case where every sites of subsystem A is coupled with environment, i.e. the A has only entangled edge without bulk. It should not only work in the ladder case, but should also work in other similar cases, such as bilayer. To further verify our argument of the equivalence principle, we simulate a coupled bilayer system, in which one layer is the subsystem A and the other is the environment. We find the ES is indeed similar to the energy Hamiltonian of a closed one layer system, even the system goes through a quantum phase transition. The results are shown below.

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^5123f2af]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Generalization from microfluidic dipoles to multipoles

Once a solution is known for one particular multipole flow profile, the full power of conformal transforms can be exploited. By using simple functions expressing symmetry operations, such as inversions or power transforms with a suitably placed origin, we can obtain concentration profiles for an infinite family of multipoles. In each case, the transport problem is first solved in the streamline domain (Fig. 2a), then transformed to obtain the flow profile for an asymmetric dipole (Fig. 2b). The dipole solution can then be transformed again to obtain the desired flow patterns. For example, a power law conformal transform generates a polygonal structure with a rotation symmetry whose number of sides is dictated by the exponent of the power transform (as in Fig. 2c). These devices will have injection and aspiration apertures located at new positions, determined by the transform of the initial aperture locations, and can then be fabricated and operated to obtain the predicted patterns. This method gives us a comprehensive toolbox to not only model and explain phenomena in known open-space MFMs in terms of simpler ones, but also to explore new configurations that have not been investigated yet.

While many geometries can be obtained by directly transforming the concentration profile from the microfluidic dipole, an arbitrary placement of injection and aspiration apertures will in general not be reducible to a semi-infinite absorbing leading edge (Fig. 2a). In the more general case, the streamline coordinate problem will exhibit any number of finite and semi-infinite absorbing segments. By solving these streamline coordinate problems, we obtained new families of multipolar devices, such as the two-reagent microfluidic quadrupole (Fig. 2d), which can itself be transformed to obtain new symmetrical patterns (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Note 3 for more details).

Table 1 summarizes some common transforms that can be used to obtain the concentration profile for many new devices from the dipole solution without solving any differential equation. A more detailed version, including many more transformation groups is presented in the SI. These configurations include known devices such as the previously published microfluidic quadrupole, but also several geometries that have not yet been investigated such as "flower" multipoles (Fig. 2c, f), alternating multipoles (Fig. 2e), polygonal multipoles and impinging flow multipoles (Table S3),

### Complex wireframe DNA nanostructures from simple building blocks [^07740933]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The field of DNA nanotechnology has enjoyed extraordinary success in constructing structures with ever increasing complexity, as defined by the number of addressable components –. Two methods have stood out: the scaffolded origami approach of folding a long scaffold with help of many short staple strands – and the scaffold-free approach with locally connected DNA LEGO™ bricks to determine global shape –. Phenomenal progress has been made in several recent studies to upgrade both size and complexity of the DNA structures, including two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) arrays with an unprecedented number of addressable components. Recently, wireframe architecture has also been introduced to the origami approach to make structures using sophisticated scaffold routing –. On the other hand, despite scaffold-free assembly's capacity to employ up to 33,000 distinct strandsas compared to DNA origami's 1600 distinct strands, complex wireframe architectures have not been fully demonstrated with the scaffold-free approach –. One of the challenges was believed to be limited structural stability in the absence of a long scaffold. However, the advantages of using a scaffold-free approach to assemble complex wireframe structures entirely out of short DNA strands are clear: the design process would be streamlined without having to route a long scaffold, and structure size would no longer be constrained by scaffold length. Therefore, the scaffold-free wireframe framework potentially provides more design freedom and is a more generalizable design platform for arbitrary structures. A typical process in designing a wireframe structure from short synthetic strands is straightforward, and it is pipelined as: (1) rendering a specific 2D or 3D geometry (Fig. 1a) as a node-edge network with DNA junctions of different numbers of arms as nodes and DNA duplexes of variable lengths as edges (Fig. 1b), (2) segmenting edges to complementary domains to ensure that corresponding strands with multiple domains satisfy synthesis and self-assembly requirements (Fig. 1c), and (3) populating strands with sequences to meet certain sequence generation criteria(Fig. 1d). Facilitated by our design program, we have designed, constructed, and characterized many wireframe structures. This includes 2D arrays of regular, quasi-regular or irregular tessellation patterns with vertices of different numbers of arms, tubes of different shapes, multiple polyhedra with more sophisticated tessellation connectivity, and most importantly, multi-layer 3D arrays with 4-arm or 6-arm junctions acting as vertices. The robust self-assembly proves that the local interactions among short strands can collectively provide sufficient overall structural integrity and while precisely defining a complex geometry. A reincarnation of the original blueprint of DNA nanotechnology, our findings in this study redefine the feasibility of using flexible components to self-assemble DNA nanostructures in an adaptive fashion.

### Shall we use non-verbal fluency in schizophrenia? A pilot study [^cb1dd2b2]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last few years, numerous studies have attempted to explain fluency impairments in people with schizophrenia, leading to heterogeneous results. This could notably be due to the fact that fluency is often used in its verbal form where semantic dimensions are implied. In order to gain an in-depth understanding of fluency deficits, a non-verbal fluency task - the Five-Point Test (5PT) - was proposed to 24 patients with schizophrenia and to 24 healthy subjects categorized in terms of age, gender and schooling. The 5PT involves producing as many abstract figures as possible within 1min by connecting points with straight lines. All subjects also completed the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) while those with schizophrenia were further assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results show that the 5PT evaluation differentiates patients from healthy subjects with regard to the number of figures produced. Patients׳ results also suggest that the number of figures produced is linked to the "overall executive functioning" and to some inhibition components. Although this study is a first step in the non-verbal efficiency research field, we believe that experimental psychopathology could benefit from the investigations on non-verbal fluency.

### C. elegans chromosomes connect to centrosomes by anchoring into the spindle network [^85f64caf]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Network analysis. For the detection of possible interactions in 3D, a three-step algorithm was implemented in Amira. First, for each microtubule, the distance to the centriole was computed and all microtubules with a distance smaller than this distance were marked as connected to the centrosome. It is important to note here that each microtubule is represented as a piece-wise linear curve. For each line segment of a microtubule the distance to the centriole, which is represented as a point, was computed analytically. The distance of a microtubule was defined as the minimum of all segment distances. Second, for each pair of microtubules the distance and the angle were computed. The distance between two microtubules was defined as the minimum of the distances between all their line segments. A 3D grid data structure was used to accelerate these computations. To reduce errors due to local distortions of the microtubules, the angle is defined by the angle between the lines through the start and end points of the microtubules. Third, based on these data an abstract graph was constructed, where each microtubule is represented as a vertex and each interaction (based on thresholds for interaction distance and angle) as an edge. Finally, for each KMT the shortest path to a microtubule marked as connected to the centrosome was computed in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Phage predation accelerates the spread of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance [^2af34a23]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Intermixing index of computational modeling simulations

We calculated the intermixing index in the simulations (denoted as I simulation) using Eq. (2).

In Eq. (2), N is the total number of cells and n (i) is the number of neighboring cells i. Neighboring cell I(i, j) yields a value of either 1 or −1, contingent upon the neighboring cell possessing a distinct (1) or identical (−1) cell type compared to the focal cell. For an individual cell i, we iterated across all neighboring cells that are in physical contact j using Eqs. (3) and (4).

This methodology aligns with the spatial assortment parameter and segregation index. Regions dominated by isogenic cell clusters, where the majority of cells are adjacent to those of the same type, have a negative intermixing index. Conversely, regions with frequent intermixing between distinct types have a positive intermixing index (I simulation).

Quantification of interface straightness

We calculated the interface straightness for both the experiments and simulations using Python 3.11. We first used the Canny edge detection methodto identify the interfaces using a lower threshold of 100 and an upper threshold of 200. To focus the analysis on specific regions of the images, we defined an annular (ring-shaped) region on each image, where we positioned the center of the annulus at the geometric center of each image. We then extracted the interfaces within the annular region using the findContours function from the OpenCV library and only considered those that touched both the interior and peripheral boundaries of the annular region. We used a tolerance of five pixels to account for minor variations. We then quantified the straightness of the interfaces as follows: For each interface, we drew a straight line connecting the beginning and end points. We then calculated the average perpendicular distance of all points on the interface to the straight line connecting the beginning and end points using Eq. (5).

In Eq. (5), S is the straightness, d max is the distance between the beginning and end points on the line, and d avg is the average perpendicular distance of all points on the interface to the straight line connecting the beginning and end points. This returns a value between 0 and 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates that the interface is straighter.

### Precise segmentation of densely interweaving neuron clusters using G-cut [^d8f4a566]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Mathematic model for neuronal morphology

In a graph representation of a neuron cluster, branches reachable from multiple somas cannot be assigned to a unique soma based on topological relations alone. To overcome this difficulty and to approximate the empirical observation that branch orientation crucially guides successful manual tracing, we define and derive GOF as a data driven optimality estimator in the graph.

The GOF describes the orientation of a branch with respect to a given soma (Fig. 2b). A branch can be abstractly represented as a parametric curve in the three-dimensional space C (l): R l ≥ 0 → R 3 where l is the trajectory length from a starting point to a curve point and R 3 is the three-dimensional coordinates of the point. For a branch of total length L, a = C (0) is the start and b = C (L) is the stop (Table 1).

Table 1
Mathematical symbols and their corresponding meanings

We define the GOF of a branch C with respect to a soma s as below:where θ (l) is the angle between the tangent vector C ′(l) of the branch curve at C (l) and the unit vector (C (l) − s) × | C (l) − s |^−1 pointing from s to C (l). 〈·,·〉 denotes dot product of two vectors. Because C (l) is parametrized with curve length, C ′(l) is always a unit vector. Please note that the direction of a branch depends on its topological relation with a given soma. GOF(C a → b, s) and GOF(C b → a, s) have distinct values.

### Topological phase locking in stochastic oscillators [^b7c2d388]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological phase locking

For sufficiently strong driving force asymmetry, at specific values of the parameters belonging to a subset of codimension 1 in parameter space, we find phase portraits that are qualitatively different, see Fig. 4a, b. The topology of the heteroclinic network changes, resulting in the formation of two homoclinic orbits that connect each of the two saddle points to itself. As a consequence, the phase space becomes disconnected into two regions: the basin of attraction of the stable fixed point, and a band of closed, periodic orbits (in gray in Fig. 4a, b). We refer to this phenomenon as TPL.

Fig. 4
(2, 3) ∞ TPL state.

a Phase portrait for strong asymmetry E *2 / E *1 = 19.15 and h = 0.51. The running band is shown in gray. The black line crossing through the black square (shown as a reference point) is an example of a periodic orbit within the running band. b The (2, 3) ∞ TPL state projected on a torus. c The black solid line in a is depicted as a three-dimensional loop around the torus, which forms a trefoil knot.

Importantly, a nontrivial winding number pair can also be assigned to the running band region. In the particular example of Fig. 4, we observe that a periodic orbit (and, by extension, the running band region as a whole) winds two times along the ϕ 1 direction and three times along the ϕ 2 direction before closing in on itself, implying a winding number pair, which we denote as (2, 3) ∞ in analogy with the notation for winding number pairs introduced above, where the ∞ subscript indicates that the trajectories are closed and never reach a fixed point.

An example of a closed, periodic trajectory within the running band is shown in Fig. 4 a, with the three-dimensional view of its projection on a torus shown in Fig. 4 c. It is interesting to note that the loop formed by the trajectory corresponds to a trefoil knot which, naturally, belongs to the class of torus knots (knots that lie on the surface of a torus).

### Programming molecular topologies from single-stranded nucleic acids [^6dfe6d5d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Topological control to validate the knotting configuration

As most of our high crossing number ssDNA knots were characterized by high-resolution AFM imaging (Fig. 2), one question was raised: whether the formation of the defected nodes in the final knot structure could be truly and completely identified with AFM imaging. We designed a link structure with eight nodes as a topological control (Supplementary Figure 11). This link structure contained two dsDNA rings (each only partially complementary), which connected to each other through eight paranemic cohesions. We constructed this particular structure by annealing two linear dsDNAs (each preformed from two ssDNAs) with eight stretches of mismatches (bubbles), each consists 6 nt (Supplementary Figure 11). The mismatches within these two linear dsDNAs would interact with their counterparts to form the stable paranemic cohesions. Nine-basepair sticky ends that extended from both ends of the dsDNAs closed the two rings after the formation of the correct structure. This link structure assembled well, as characterized by high-resolution AFM imaging (Supplementary Figure 11a). On the contrary, if the two linear dsDNAs were first ligated to form closed ring structures, we reasoned that these two dsDNA rings would not be able to assemble into the desired fully inter-locked loop structure. As expected, although the two dsDNA rings could still bind with each other partially through some of the paranemic cohesion interactions (Supplementary Figure 11b), extensive defects were observed in all of the structures and unknotted structures can easily be scratched/deformed by AFM tips during scanning (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figure 11, and Supplementary Table 3), indicating the intact structures shown in Fig. 3a were knotted structures following the design.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^64132d97]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Example boundaries for three choices.

Each column belongs to the indicated parameterization and each row (apart from the flat case with just one parameter) shows two opposite extreme examples. Colors indicate the edge-intersection parameter θ, and parameter values α and β are indicated as appropriate. Notice the diverse range of curves to explore spatially-dependent optimal boundaries. Comparison with the flat(θ) parameterization is shown by the dashed colored lines.

These constraints can be used to derive a general boundary parameterization comprising a shape function and tuning parameters (Fig. 2). A general boundary parameterization F (P (t); θ, α,…) takes the probability vector P (t) as an input, along with an edge-intersection parameter θ and shape parameters (α,…) to give a decision rule:The resulting complex decision boundary has an amplitude parameter α and some additional shape parameters. To make our investigation tractable, we limit our parameterization to one additional parameter, β (e.g. a frequency in the oscillating case). For simplicity, we select four distinct forms of F that we call flat(θ), curve(θ, α), power(θ, α, β), and oscil(θ, α, β), examples of which are shown in Fig. 2 and all of which contain the flat boundary as a particular instance (see Methods for the full forms and a mathematical derivation). Within these parametric subsets, the optimal decision boundaries are determined by optimal values of θ, α, and β.

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^d95be1ee]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Despite the seeming complexity of equations (1) and (2), it is noteworthy that there are only two unknown variables, a A and a B, and that all other parameters are fixed. These two equations define two curves in the (a A, a B) plane.

Figure 1a shows a graphical representation of the curves for a random regularnetwork (in which all the nodes have the same degree) with degree of k = 16 and threshold m = 8, for the symmetric parameter values, r A = r B = 0.60 and r d = 0.15. The size of each network is N = 2 × 10 4. The blue curve is a graphical representation of equation (1) and the brown curve is defined by equation (2). The curves, similar to two 'ropes', create a 'knot' that can have up to nine intersections, representing mathematical solutions of the system of equations. However, not all of these solutions represent observable and stable physical states. To see that, observe one of the curves in Fig. 1a, for example, the blue curve described by equation (1). If we increase damage done to network B (that is, we increase a B) and keep everything else constant, some damage will undoubtedly spread to network A. Thus, we expect that when a B is increased, a A must also increase (it would be very unusual if one network improves its activity as a result of damaging the other network). We conclude that the parts of the blue and brown curve that produce physical solutions are only those where a A and a B increase together or decrease together along the curve. This elimination leaves only four states in Fig. 1a that are stable (green circles), whereas the other five states are unstable (red crosses), for this particular choice of parameters. In simulated finite networks, when the network system evolves according to the rules of the model, at t = 0 we have a freedom to set initial conditions for the activities. Systems initially prepared to have a pair of values (a A, a B) corresponding to an unstable solution of equations (1) and (2) will be disturbed by a small fluctuation of a A or a B, owing to the system dynamics, and the values of a A or a B will rapidly change until one of the stable states is reached. Systems that are initially prepared to have values of a A or a B corresponding to a stable solution will fluctuate around these values, until perhaps a large finite fluctuation occurs and the system 'jumps' to another stable state. In general, for any choice of parameters, we have between one and four stable (physical) states. Figure 1b shows the scenario for the same network system when, r A = r B = 0.60 and r d = 0.15. In this case we have two stable states and one unstable state.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### Vertebral level in pregnancy according to the posterior superior iliac spine: an observational study [^9668d6ad]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Intersected segment levels of the PSIS lines often extend from the L5-S1 interspinous space to the S2 vertebral body. And the palpation PSIS line has shown higher reliability than that of Tuffier's line in non-pregnant individuals. It is also less affected by positional variations, pregnancy or other individual characteristics, making it more reliable than Tuffier's line in detecting the vertebral levels in pregnant women. Since the PSIS line alone cannot accurately pinpoint the lumbar vertebrae, we propose constructing an equilateral triangle, referred to as "safety triangle", with the PSIS line as its base. The vertex of this safety triangle should be directed towards the cephalic end. Therefore, we aimed to explore the spinal level within the area defined by this safety triangle in pregnant women.

### The new qualitative scoring MMSE pentagon test (QSPT) as a valid screening tool between autopsy-confirmed dementia with lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease [^fde9bed7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Visual-constructional apraxia is a prominent feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) that might help to clinically distinguish it from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main goal of this study was to assess performance on the copy intersecting-pentagon item of the Mini-Mental State Examination with the new Qualitative Scoring method for the Pentagon copy Test (QSPT). In order to determine which aspects of the drawings might differentiate DLB from AD, pentagon drawings of autopsy-verified DLB (n = 16) and AD (n = 15) patients were assessed using the QSPT. The qualitative scoring encompasses the assessment of different parameters of the drawing, such as number of angles, distance/intersection, closure/opening, rotation, and closing-in. The QSPT scores were compared between groups using linear analyses and artificial neural network analyses at four different time points. Linear analyses showed that during the first evaluation, number of angles was the only parameter that showed a significant difference between DLB and AD patients. A gradual decline in other parameters and total pentagon score occurred in both groups during subsequent years, with greater decline for the DLB group. The artificial neural network analyses using auto-contractive maps showed that, with disease progression, DLB became related to relatively lower qualitative pentagon scores, whereas AD became related to relatively higher qualitative scores. These findings suggest that the QSPT might be a sensitive measure of visuo-constructive abilities able to differentiate DLB from AD at disease onset and as the diseases progress, but further studies on larger population are necessary in order to establish its clinical relevance.

Sholl analysis

Since the complex morphologic structure of astrocytes is crucial to their situational function in brain, we determined group differences in peri-vascular astrocytic processes and branching using the Fiji ImageJ software package with the Sholl analysis plugin. This assessment was performed by an unbiased investigator blinded to the groups. Sholl is an open-source software used for morphometric analysis of astrocytic processes by quantifying length, number, and intersections at concentric spheres originating from the soma. The first 25 astrocytes in the vicinity of a blood vessel in gray matter displaying a visible nucleus and at least one process stained for GFAP were analyzed per section and per region by an investigator blinded to the identity of each sample. Morphologic complexity of the astrocytes was calculated based on the number of intersections at each radial distance from the starting point, including sum of intersections, mean intersections, and ramification index determined by the Sholl plugin software. The ramification index is the ratio between the maximum number of intersections of the processes with the circles and the number of the primary processes.

Iba-1 immunostaining was evaluated by an unbiased and blinded investigator using the Fiji ImageJ software system (Version 2.3.0/1.53q) according to a semiquantitative previously validated and published protocol. First, the color channels were split to isolate the DAB-reaction product from background staining. The threshold was adjusted to include only immunostained cells, and % area stained was assessed. Measurements were taken on three random areas per section of the dentate gyrus, CA1, and the white matter adjacent to the hippocampal formation.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^9a5a5d21]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As the amorphous state is more stable than crystal at finite temperatures, we expect that, driven by entropy, the crystal state will spontaneously destabilize into the amorphous state. To check this, MD simulations starting from crystalline morphology are performed at pressureand various temperatures. As quantified by the bond-orientational order parameter(see Methods for the definition) plotted in Fig. 3b, which initially keeps a high value (larger than 0.8) corresponding to the rhombic crystal state, and then decays after certain simulation steps until a very low value due to its amorphous nature, the amorphization takes place at, lower than the melting pointmanifested by the sharp changes in the caloric and density curves plotted in Fig. 3c. The non-equilibrium amorphous state whose potential energy and density are close to those of crystal is featured by the mixing of two isotopes, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, in agreement with our theoretical prediction described above. At lower temperatures, the fact that amorphization does not occur within the finite simulation time should be attributed to the existence of relatively high energy barrier(s) between the crystalline and amorphous states. To verify this, we manually introduce a very small disordered region (about 30 monomers) into the crystalline configuration (see Methods for technical details) and run NPT simulations at, 2.86, and 2.88, respectively. The evolution of the two monomers in each unit-cell is traced by the unit-cell order parameter defined as, where the number of unit-cells n equals to half of the number of monomers, l (t) is the distance between the center-of-masses (COMs) of the two monomers originally in the same unit-cell at time t, = 5.77 is the cut-off value of l, andis the Heaviside step function. This order parameter quantifies the fraction of remaining unit-cells at time t, taking a value close to 1 in crystal and 0 in liquid. The time evolution of d insteps after a relaxation ofsteps is shown in Fig. 3d, demonstrating that, once the energy barrier is overcome, the system will rearrange into the amorphous state continuously. We expect that d would finally drop to approximately zero after sufficiently long time, as a result of reorganization of the whole system. Although regular MD simulations at much lower temperatures would suffer from very slow dynamics, we have managed to verify that the amorphous state is still more stable than the crystalline state even at a temperature as low as T = 1.5 by running an additional REMD simulation focusing on the low-temperature region (see Supplementary Fig. S 4 in SI). Moreover, we never observe an inverse pathway from the amorphous state back to the crystal, as appeared in the simulation for the hard-triangle system, in agreement with the fact that the amorphous state is more stable than the crystal benefiting from the large configurational entropy.

### Sox9 inhibits activin A to promote biliary maturation and branching morphogenesis [^83ebfd5b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To better understand Sox9cKO ductal paucity, we performed quantitative analysis of 3D IHBD images. We reasoned that Sholl analysis, a common measure of neuron branch complexity, could be applied to quantify IHBDs. With the hilum as the starting point, Sholl intersections were quantified at 1 µm spherical intervals, and plotted over distance normalized to lobe size. IHBD branching was reduced in Sox9cKO livers, supporting qualitative observations (Fig. 1e). To determine if ductal paucity was localized to distinct IHBD regions, we performed area under the curve (AUC) analysis on Sholl intersections. We found that proximal (0.00–0.50 arbitrary units; a.u.) branching complexity was minimally impacted, while distal AUC (0.50–1.00 a.u.) was significantly decreased in Sox9cKO livers, consistent with the loss of peripheral ductules (Fig. 1f). To further quantify Sox9 regulated changes in IHBDs, we conducted regression and curve-fitting analyses to characterize branching morphology. Sholl decay coefficients, which describe the rate of change in branch density across a structure, were calculated from linear regression of semi-log plots of intersections vs. normalized distance (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Consistent with AUC, Sholl decay was increased in Sox9cKO samples, reflecting decreased branch density in the liver periphery (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 3b). Ductal paucity in adult mice was further supported by a downward trend in the average number of Sholl intersections (N av) in Sox9cKO mice (Fig. 1h). We also compared the maximum number of Sholl intersections and the critical value (N m), which is the maximum of the polynomial function and accounts for technical noise in biological samples. We found a significant decrease in both values in Sox9cKO mice, demonstrating a decrease in maximum branch point intersections (Supplementary Fig. 3c). To determine the distance at which maximum branching occurs, we analyzed the critical radius (r c). Loss of peripheral branching in Sox9cKO mice is reflected by a slight shift in r c toward the hilum (Supplementary Fig. 3d). However, this difference does not reach statistical significance, which may suggest limitations in global Sholl measurements to identify localized phenotypes. To quantify overall IHBD size independent of branching, we measured total IHBD volume and length. We normalized these values to overall lobe volume. While the length of Sox9cKO IHBDs trended downward, overall volume was unchanged (Fig. 1i, j). This may be due to the relative contribution of large ducts, which are present and dilated in Sox9cKO mice, to total IHBD volume and length. Collectively, quantitative whole-tissue imaging reveals that ductal paucity in adult Sox9cKO mice is defined by reduced numbers of peripheral ductules.

### Three-dimensional magnetic nanotextures with high-order vorticity in soft magnetic wireframes [^401952e8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The distinct feature of the observed vortices and antivortices is that they represent surface states, in contrast to the commonly observed volume state textures in nanodots. In the experimental geometry, two antivortices do not share a common Bloch line, which joins their centers. Instead, their individual Bloch lines disappear towards the depth within several dozens of nanometers (Supplementary Section 6). This turns the central part of the tetrapod to be almost homogeneously magnetized along the direction connecting the two antivortices (Fig. 3 c). These surface states are observed in tetrapod geometries constructed with four wire segments, which are pairwise accommodated in orthogonal planes, i.e. the experimental tetrapod geometry. In contrast, simulations of tetrapods whose wire segment pairs lie in the same plane or in planes, which are rotated by α = 45 ∘, reveal the presence of a Bloch line shared by both antivortices at the surface (Supplementary Section 2). The latter resembles the bulk-like antivortex texture observed in planar nanodots. For the diameter of wire segments forming the tetrapod in our experiment, the magnetization curls, forming the vortex when approaching the end of each segment (Fig. 3 d). Similarly to antivortices, vortex Bloch lines are well-defined only near the end of the segment. We note that the recently reported site-selective vapour deposition using FEBIDallows the realization of magnetic nanoshells of Co 3 Fe decorating curvilinear wires made of PtC. Such surface modification may allow one to obtain a easy-normal magnetic anisotropy and intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which could enable the investigation of curvature-induced skyrmions, in curvilinear FEBID-fabricated nanoshells.

### ACR-ACOG-AIUM-SPR-SRU practice parameter for the performance of ultrasound of the female pelvis [^1db4f0ec]. SPR/AIUM/SRU/ACR/ACOG (2024). High credibility.

Ultrasound of the female pelvis — uterine measurements indicates that overall uterine length is evaluated in sagittal view from the fundus to the cervix (to the external os, if it can be identified); the length can be measured as a straight line from the fundus to the external os using outer-to-outer technique or by a trace method using outer-to-outer technique; the depth of the uterus is measured in the same sagittal view perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the endometrium, and the maximum width is measured in the transverse or coronal view; if volume measurements of the uterine corpus are performed, the cervical component should be excluded from the uterine length measurement, and a volume measurement of the corpus in the nongravid state is an estimate because there is no sonographic anatomic landmark for where the cervix ends and the uterine corpus begins.

### Rotors detected by phase analysis of filtered, epicardial atrial fibrillation electrograms colocalize with regions of conduction block [^b7187501]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2018). Low credibility.

Spatial Comparison Between Conduction Block Lines and Phase Singularity

At the moment of PS detection, we compared the underlying conduction pattern in the phase map (Figure 1 D) and the isochrone wave map (Figure 1 F). Both isochrone and phase map presented in Figure 1 were manually interpolated to enhance the readability of maps, by combining multiple isochrones to one, if there were > 1 isochrone between 2 adjacent electrodes.

To assess the spatial association between PSs and conduction block lines, the distribution of the average Euclidian distances between PSs and the closest site of conduction block was computed. The time segment for comparison between PSs and conduction blocks was chosen as the full lifespan of the PS. Every millisecond when a PS was present, the distance of PSs to the closest block line was determined, and the average distance throughout the lifespan was calculated.

To check for the probability of colocalization of conduction block and PS locations because of chance, we also computed the average minimal distance to conduction block of a random sequence of locations where no PS was detected (named random non-PS location throughout the article) to the closest conduction block, covering the same time interval as the lifespan of each PS. We divided the average distance of PS points and of non-PS locations into 2 subgroups: those that are closer or exactly 1 electrode from the nearest conduction block and those that are farther than 1 electrode to the closest conduction block. The threshold of 1 electrode distance was set to 2 mm to include all block between electrodes in which at least one of the electrodes was adjacent to the PS point. Note that the PS is detected on the intersection of a square of 4 electrodes, and block is detected between pairs of adjacent electrodes.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^9f97b4f2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Effectively-optimal decisions with different boundary shapes

What are the characteristics of the nonlinear decision boundaries in the near-optimal set? If the decision boundaries were qualitatively similar in shape, then learning the particular boundary shape would be important for maximizing reward. Conversely, if the boundary shapes are qualitatively different, then learning the precise boundary shape would not be critical, and the emphasis on optimality would shift to the inference and normalization processes for multiple-choice decision-making.

Figure 5 e shows that for each cost ratio c / W, the edge-intersection parameter θ seems to be the main determinant of optimality, as is visible in the homogenous values of θ within each region (a–c). In contrast, the shape parameter α takes heterogenous values within each region (a–c) in Fig. 5 f. For every cost ratio c / W, the entire explored range of α is represented in the optimal set, whereas there is a narrow range of θ that varies with c / W. The flat-boundary case (α = 0) is optimal for each of the degenerate sets, with the optimal θ then a single value that lies within the broadened range when α is non-zero. Thus, for all c / W, there are many SATs near each parameter value, and in turn, each SAT instance is close to many different parameter values (Fig. 5 e, f).

Therefore, it appears that close-to-optimal multi-alternative boundaries are possible with significant modulation of the flat-boundary case. The close-to-optimal set contains a broad range of parameters, giving a diverse set of boundary shapes (examples in Fig. 7). This supports the notion that learning the precise boundary shape is less important for making effective optimal decisions.

Fig. 7
Examples of qualitatively-different degenerate decision boundaries overlaid on the mean decision times for flat boundaries.

Here we show the curve (a), power (b), and oscil (c) parameterizations for 3AFCs. All plotted boundaries maximize reward to the same value (for the same cost ratio c / W = 0.04) despite having no other common characteristics. a – c show a map of the mean decision time over the belief space, with low decision times at the center increasing towards the edges. Decisions, and hence decision times, only manifest at decision boundaries, so to visualize the variation over the whole belief simplex, we generated an approximation of the mean decision time distribution using incrementally-increasing flat decision boundaries.

### Global fitting for high-accuracy multi-channel single-molecule localization [^6d8d44cf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Generation of multi-channel PSF models

Our algorithm to generate multi-channel PSF models from bead stacks is an extension of our work on generating single-channel experimental PSF models. Again, we illustrate the steps of our algorithm on the dual-channel example, an extension to N channels is straight forward (Fig. 1):
We find candidate bead positions in each channel by calculating the mean image over all z -positions, Gaussian filtering and finding of local maxima above a user-defined threshold. These candidate positions are integers in the unit of camera pixels.
If no transformation among the channels exists, we first generate single-channel PSF models for each channel separately. We then fit the bead images using these new PSF models and finally use the fitted localizations to calculateas described above.
We transform the coordinates of the candidate bead positions from the reference to the target channel: These target coordinates are continuous coordinates; thus we calculate the nearest integer pixel position by rounding the transformed coordinatesand calculating the shift between the rounded and original transformed coordinates.
We cut out ROIs aroundandout of the bead stacks and shift the ROIs of the target channel byusing cubic interpolation. If the target channel is mirrored with respect to the reference channel, we mirror the target ROI. This ensures that beads in both channels are shifted in the same direction during registration. Finally, we concatenate image stacks in both channels to form a single 3D array.
We create an initial template by averaging the 3D arrays over all beads and use 3D cross-correlation to register all beads to this template.
We reject those beads that have an insufficient overlap with the template (quality control) and calculate the next template as the average of the remaining shifted beads. We then register the central part of each bead to the new template.
We normalize the beads by the sum of the central slice of the reference stack.
We slightly filter the PSF models in z with a smoothing bspline and calculate a cspline representation for each channel.
To validate the PSF calibration, we fit each bead in the bead stack and compare the fitted z position with the true z position as denoted by the frame in the image stack.

### Three-dimensional stereoscopic evaluation and quantitative gray scale assessment of the nasolabial fold and its application in injection therapy [^ed32087d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

3D image acquisition and analysis steps:
3D image acquisition: Use the Vectra camera to take facial images of each subject under uniform lighting conditions. For patients receiving filler injections, facial images are taken before and immediately after the injection.
Nasolabial fold region delineation (As shown in Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1,): Identifying landmarks: Determine and mark the alar base points (o) on both sides of the nose. Identify the longitudinal starting point of the nasolabial fold (a), usually near the alar base. Find the lowest point of the nasolabial fold cross-section (b), typically the deepest part of the fold. Identify the longitudinal ending point of the nasolabial fold (c). Nasolabial fold edge delineation process: Identify key points: Nasal alar edge point (A): Locate the outer point of the nasal alar edge. Mouth corner point (B): Locate the outer point of the mouth corner. Draw a line: Use a straight line to connect the nasal alar edge point (A) and the mouth corner point (B), forming line segment AB. Extend the sides of the parallelogram: From point A, extend 3 cm horizontally outward, marking it as point C. From point B, extend 3 cm horizontally outward, marking it as point D. Connect the points to form a parallelogram: Connect point A to point C, forming line segment AC. Connect point B to point D, forming line segment BD. Connect point C to point D, forming line segment CD. Connect point D to point A, forming line segment DA.
Gray value acquisition: Load the images into ImageJ software and convert the color images to grayscale images. Manually identify and draw the nasolabial fold region on the images after the above method. After drawing, use 'Analyze - > Set Measurements' to obtain the average gray value, minimum gray value, and maximum gray value. 3D coordinate data acquisition:
Measurement of NLF: Perform measurements using Vectra software. Manually identify six measurement landmarks on the 3D facial images, automatically generating a 3D coordinate system where the XY plane, YZ plane, and XZ plane correspond to the coronal plane, sagittal plane, and horizontal plane, respectively (As shown in Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Export the landmark coordinates to Microsoft Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation) to calculate five linear measurement values.
Verification of reproducibility: To verify the reproducibility of nasolabial fold landmark identification, systematic sampling was performed, extracting 10 samples (No. 009, No. 019, No. 029, No. 039, No. 049, No. 059, No. 069, No. 079, No. 089, No. 099). The 3D facial landmarks were removed, and two weeks later, researchers re-identified these landmarks and calculated the linear measurement values as described above. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated, with an ICC value greater than 0.80 considered excellent reproducibility.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid CIMT acquisition and analysis — measurement technique and metrics: Measurement of CIMT involves tracking the blood-intima and media-adventitia interfaces of the far wall using a leading edge-to-leading edge technique. In general, segments should be measured in triplicate and CIMT values averaged. The task force recommends use of a semiautomated border detection program with validated accuracy, and simple point-to-point measurements of CIMT are not acceptable. Mean CIMT values from the far walls of the right and left CCAs (mean-mean) should be reported, with use of additional segments or maximum values as an alternative if there is local expertise and these measurements can be mapped to normative values. Most reading software will report mean-mean and mean-maximum CIMT values; mean-mean values are more reproducible but less sensitive to change, whereas mean-maximum values are more sensitive to change but less reproducible because they are derived from a single point (or regional maximum) measurement along the 1-cm region.

### Neurons exploit stochastic growth to rapidly and economically build dense dendritic arbors [^f40c71f3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Over the 5 days of development, class IV arbors grow from 100 μm to 500 μm in diameter(Fig. 1c–e). The length density of dendrites, defined as the total branch length per unit area, reaches a plateau in the central region (uniform color in Fig. 1c–e), suggesting that a steady state has been reached there. The density then spreads as a moving front (Fig. 1f, g). The plateau levels decrease by about 50% over development while the widths increase 5-fold.

There are two types of branches (Fig. 2a, b): terminal branches extend from a branch point to a tip, and internal branches connect either two branch points or a branch point and the soma. The number of terminal branches is approximately equal to the number of internal branches (Fig. 2a). The average lengths of terminal and internal branches are also similar (Fig. 2c). Both types of branches have exponential length distributions, with similar means at all developmental stages (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 1a–c).

Fig. 2
Distribution of branch length and orientation.

a The schematic illustrates branch classification. A terminal branch (blue segment) extends from a branch point (small gray circle) to a tip (red circle), while an internal branch (brown segment) connects either two branch points or a branch point and the soma (large gray circle). For a binary tree, the number of terminal branches exceeds the number of internal branches by one.

### Complex wireframe DNA nanostructures from simple building blocks [^a9063491]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Structural design

To design a typical wireframe structure entirely from synthetic strands, a 2D or 3D graph is first generated (Fig. 1a). Such a graph, composed of nodes and edges with a specific node-edge geometry, is rendered so that the nodes represent vertices of different numbers of arms and the edges represent simple DNA duplexes of variable lengths (Fig. 1b). The number of edges connected to a certain node is arbitrary, as are the numbers of base pairs of constituent edges. Arbitrary shapes can be designed by defining a full set of node-node connectivity and the corresponding edges of variable lengths. For purposes of practicality, the number of edges connecting to a certain vertex is set to be no more than seven and the edge lengths are set to be full turns (rounded multiples of 10.5 base pairs) in this study. Afterwards, edges are segmented into complementary domains to ensure that the corresponding strands with multiple domains satisfy synthesis (e.g. a typical strand is less than 100 nt and preferably less than 80 nt) and self-assembly (e.g. a paired complementary domain is no less than 6 bp and preferably no less than 10 bp) requirements (Fig. 1c). Although the segmentation could also be arbitrary, a typical edge in this study is segmented in a standardized fashion into two root domains of the same length and a stem domain (Fig. 2a, inset and Supplementary Fig. 1). To relax tension around the crossovers at a certain vertex (e.g. a vertex of 5 or 6 arms), extra unpaired base(s) (e.g. 1T, 2T, or 3T) can be added as spacers across arms (Supplementary Table 1). After a specific strand arrangement is laid out, the final step is to populate strands with sequences to meet certain sequence generation criteria(e.g. base-pairing and mismatch prevention). As colors indicate, a distinct DNA sequence was appointed to each component strand (Fig. 1d).

### Additional sampling directions improve detection range of wireless radiofrequency probes [^df2ccd39]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Coordinate Correspondence

We determined the marker locations choosing the first three noncollinear readout directions d i (i = 1,2,3) along which we detected three peaks p ij (j = 1,2,3). Each peak defines a plane E ij orthogonal to d i. We computed the points of intersection m n (n = 1,2,… ,27) between all combinations of E ij. To find the marker locations, we used the remaining directions d k (k = 4,5,…, N) and orthogonal planes E kj. The distance of each point m n to each of these planes was transformed into a score using a Gaussian function of unit height and 2.3 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) (FWHM of the peaks in the projections); the values were summed over j and k to give a metric that ranked the points m n in terms of their likelihood of being the marker positions.

A 2D example of how the additional navigators are used is shown in Figure 1. Because the marker locations must be consistent with each acquired signal, increasing the number of navigators reduces ambiguities that may result.

Figure 1
Two‐dimensional schematic showing how more sampling directions reduce the ambiguity in the back projection. A: Two directions with three markers could represent nine locations. B: A third direction removes the ambiguity and uniquely identifies the probes. C: A slightly different configuration, however, is still ambiguous. D: A fourth direction resolves the issue. In practice, a statistical approach is needed, as described in the text. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at.]

When three peaks were detected along fewer than six of the 21 directions, it was not possible to determine the marker locations, and tracking data were interpolated by copying estimates from the previous acquisition

### From pretraining to privacy: federated ultrasound foundation model with self-supervised learning [^faa44c85]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

For pubic symphysis-fetal head tasks, the measurement of the angle of progression was conducted by constructing two lines from three specific landmarks. Firstly, we identified the two furthest points on the pubic symphysis contour based on the segmented image. Then, we drew a tangent line through the rightmost point of the pubic symphysis to define the fetal head region. The tangent line on the right side of the image, intersecting with the fetal head region, determines the third point for calculating the angle of progression (AoP). Finally, the angle formed by these three points constituted AoP. The performance of AoP prediction was evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE). MAE provides a straightforward interpretation of how far, on average, the predicted values deviate from the actual observed values, which is given bywhere n is the number of samples, y i is the actual value for the i -th sample, is the predicted value for i -th sample.

To evaluate the prediction fairness of the method, we adopted equal accuracy (EA) as the fairness evaluation metric, which measures the maximum gap in prediction accuracy between different groups (e.g. different hospitals, age groups):Here, A k represents the k-th client, denotes the AUROC score of the test set for client k, andis the average score across all clients. Minimizing EA (i.e. narrowing the performance gap between groups) indicates achieving maximum fairness.

The models for all tasks were trained using five different random seeds to determine the shuffling of the training data. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of the performance over the three iterations and computed the standard error, i.e. the standard deviation divided by the square root of 5. We obtained the 95% confidence interval (CI) by multiplying the standard error by 1.96. Moreover, to determine whether there were significant differences, we performed two-sided t -tests between the significance of UltraFedFM compared to other methods.

### Using the demographic health survey wealth index to create family planning market segments based on absolute income levels [^29601506]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary box

Measures of socioeconomic position are important to consider in global health, including understanding a person's ability to pay for family planning goods and services or ensuring that the most vulnerable have access to free or subsidised services.
Family planning market segmentation commonly uses wealth quintiles readily available in Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which provide a relative measure that divides populations within a country into five even groups ranging from the poorest 20% to the wealthiest 20%.
Market segmentation can benefit from using absolute measures of socioeconomic position like the World Bank International Poverty Lines, such as when estimating market size based on an individual's ability to pay for family planning goods and services out of pocket.
Using the described methodology and provided code, researchers can generate absolute measures from the DHS surveys based on the World Bank International Poverty Lines.
Understanding the intersection of the relative and absolute measures of socioeconomic position yields a more informed understanding of the economic distribution in the population, which can better guide family planning programs.

### Line versus representational bisections in unilateral spatial neglect [^f07646ab]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the mechanisms of left unilateral spatial neglect found in the bisection of lines after cueing to the left end point and to determine whether neglect occurs for the mental representation of a line.

Methods

A new representational bisection task was developed to eliminate the influence of the right segment of the physical line that would attract attention. Eight patients with typical left unilateral spatial neglect underwent line and representational bisection tasks on a computer display with a touch panel. In the line bisection with cueing, they bisected a line after touching the left end point. In the representational bisection, the patients were presented with a line until they touched the left end point. On the blank display, they pointed to the subjective midpoint of the erased line. The performances of the two bisection tasks were compared when the length and position of stimulus lines were varied.

Results

The rightward errors in the representational bisection were greater than or equivalent to those in the line bisection with cueing. The effect of line length in which the errors became greater for the longer lines was equally found in the line bisection with cueing and the representational bisection. This was confirmed in the condition where the right end point was placed at a fixed position and the line length was varied.

Conclusions

After cueing to the left end point, rightward bisection errors of patients with neglect are not caused by overattention to the right segment of the physical line. Left neglect occurs mainly for the mental representation formed at the time of cueing or seeing the whole extent of a line.

### How accurate are subjective judgements of a continuum? [^7ae4189a]. Histopathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the accuracy of subjective judgements of a uni-dimensional continuum.

Methods and Results

Twenty-four observers were asked to estimate the position of a dot placed between two lines using a 100-point scale. Each observer judged 20 different positions. Ninety-five percent of observations were between -7 and +9 of the true value. The median and the mean value of the estimates for each position were within one or two points of the true value in most cases with a maximum deviation of five. There was perfect correlation between the ranks of the median and the mean and the true value (correlation coefficient +1, P < 0.00001). The kappa values for interobserver agreement varied from 0.98 for two categories to 0.55 for 10 categories and 0.39 for 20 categories. Information transmitted increased from 0.98 bits with two categories to 2.83 bits with 20 categories.

Conclusions

The experiment indicates that subjective judgements can be accurate but it is necessary to use a large number of categories. One hundred-point scales allow confidence intervals to be calculated and the intervals are reduced if the results from several observers are pooled. The mean and the median of the judgements of a large number of observers are close to objective reality and this approach could be used to define a gold standard of rankings of pathological continua such as cervical dyskaryosis or tumour differentiation. There is a reciprocal relationship between kappa values and information transmitted which demonstrates the fallacy of using kappa statistics in studies of continua.

### Different pathways for engulfment and endocytosis of liquid droplets by nanovesicles [^059534fe]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Three different surface tensions

A general feature of the vesicle–droplet morphologies is that the contact line between the droplet and the nanovesicle partitions the vesicle membrane into two segments, the membrane segment α γ adjacent to the α droplet and the membrane segment β γ in contact with the aqueous bulk phase β, see Fig. 1 c. As a consequence, the force balance along the contact line involves three different surface tensions, the interfacial tension Σ α β, which exerts capillary forces onto the contact line, as well as the two bilayer tensions Σ α γ and Σ β γ acting within the α γ and the β γ membrane segment, respectively. Furthermore, this force balance also depends on the line tension of the contact line itself.

In order to understand the consequences of the force balance at the contact line, we first consider the interfacial tension Σ α β and the bilayer tensions Σ α γ and Σ β γ of the two membrane segments for different stress asymmetries as controlled by the lipid number N ol. Using the computational approach described in the "Methods" section, we determine these three surface tensions as a function of N ol for different droplet sizes. The results of this computation are displayed in Fig. 6 for nanovesicles with adjusted volumes ν = ν 0. This figure consists of three panels corresponding to three different droplet diameters as given by 14 d or 11.2 nm, 18.7 d or 15 nm, and 24.5 d or 19.6 nm.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^c11b9a91]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Phase behaviours of two-dimensional (2D) systems constitute a fundamental topic in condensed matter and statistical physics. Although hard polygons and interactive point-like particles are well studied, the phase behaviours of more realistic molecular systems considering intermolecular interaction and molecular shape remain elusive. Here we investigate by molecular dynamics simulation phase stabilities of 2D ball-stick polygons, serving as simplified models for molecular systems. Below the melting temperature T m, we identify a critical edge number n_c ≥ 4, at which a distorted square lattice emerges; when n < n_c, the triangular system stabilizes at a spin-ice-like glassy state; when n > n_c, the polygons stabilize at crystalline states. Moreover, in the crystalline state, T m is higher for polygons with more edges at higher pressures but exhibits a crossover for hexagon and octagon at low pressures. A theoretical framework taking into account the competition between entropy and enthalpy is proposed to provide a comprehensive understanding of our results, which is anticipated to facilitate the design of 2D materials.

### Fork in the road: are all bifurcations created equal? [^5ecc27fc]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

The TRYTON study evaluated routine side branch (SB) stenting with a novel bare metal stent (BMS) designed for true bifurcation lesions (Medina 1,1,1; 1,0,1; 0,1,1) and compared it to a strategy of balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting. It failed to meet the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in target vessel failure mainly driven by peri-procedural myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated CK-MB > 3× the upper limit of normal. In this substudy, 41% of patients who had a SB diameter > 2.25 mm were evaluated and the new stent was found to be non-inferior in the primary outcome of target vessel failure with no difference in post-procedural MI. This substudy suggests that appropriately sized SB stents with TRYTON may be useful when the SB is > 2.25 mm in diameter. However, further studies could evaluate routine use of FFR for SBs; drug eluting versions of the stent as well as stents designed for vessels 2.25 mm in diameter which are frequently felt to be clinically larger when not subjected to core lab analysis.

### A comparison of skeletal muscle diffusion tensor imaging tractography seeding methods [^e6d87461]. NMR in Biomedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

These procedures are illustrated in Section S2.

Fiber tracking was performed using the MuscleDTI_Toolbox, as previously described except as updated for this work; see Section S3, Table S1 for a list of function versions used and their modifications from previous publications. Fiber tracts were propagated from the seed points in the +Z direction by Euler integration of ε 1 at a step‐size of one voxel‐width. Premature termination due to excessive inter‐point angles or fractional anisotropy (FA) values did not occur in the noise‐free condition. To smooth the tracts, their row, column, and slice coordinates were fitted to 2nd‐, 2nd‐, and 3rd‐order polynomials, respectively, as functions of point number.

The smoothed tracts' architectural properties were characterized as follows. Tracts with length (L FT) < 5 mm were excluded. To promote uniform sampling throughout the muscle volume, the farthest streamline sampling (FSS) method described by Li et al. was implemented, with sample sizes of 1000 and 500 tracts preserved from the original dataset (FSS1000 and FSS500, respectively). The central axis along the longest direction of the muscle, taken as the mechanical line of action, was determined by fitting 3rd‐order polynomial functions through the row and column coordinates of each muscle slice's centroid, as a function of slice number. For each preserved tract, the α values were calculated in a pointwise manner along the tract by finding the angle formed by the line connecting the fiber‐tract point to the seed point and the local tangent to the central axis at the level of the seed point. The tangent was calculated as a unit‐length vector describing the slice‐wise difference in the central axis position. Curvature (κ) was calculated in a pointwise manner along the tract using the Frenet‐Serret formulas, as previously described. The tracts were characterized with their average α, average κ, and L FT (the last calculated as the summed Euclidean distance between points). For each architecture property, the whole‐muscle mean value was calculated.

### Kinetochore-and chromosome-driven transition of microtubules into bundles promotes spindle assembly [^c724dace]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Number of bundles. To count the bundles, horizontally oriented spindles were transformed into vertical (end-on) orientation using the code written in R programming language in R Studio (R Core Team. 2016). Before the transformation, the Z-stack of the spindle in a single channel was rotated in Fiji so that the spindle major axis was approximately parallel to the x-axis. The aberrations caused by refractive index mismatch between immersion oil and aqueous sample were taken into account in the program by multiplying Z-step size by a correction factor of 0.81 to obtain the correct Z-distance. This factor corresponds to the ratio of the cell diameter in y and z direction, assuming that a mitotic cell is spherical. Bundles were counted on the sum intensity images of 5 central planes of the transformed spindle. The number of bundles was determined by counting the bright spots using Multipoint tool in ImageJ.

Protein silencing. Analysis of the immunofluorescence signal was performed on the sum of all 41 planes. The territory of the spindle was encircled with a segmented line in Fiji and sum intensity was measured.

PRC1 intensity of early formed bundles in the prometaphase rosette. To measure the bundle intensity in vertically oriented early prometaphase rosette, bundles were encircled in Fiji and sum intensity was measured in only one plane of the cross-section where the bundle was of highest intensity. Bundles with bound kinetochores were measured in the plane where the kinetochore was visible close to the bundle. The brightest bundles (usually two) that connect the spindle poles in a straight line were not measured because they are formed before nuclear envelope breakdown. Thus, only bundles in the prometaphase network were measured.

### How do patients with neglect see a horizontal line? Analysis of performances in coloured line bisection task [^e49789ca]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Twelve patients with left unilateral spatial neglect were examined with a newly devised "coloured line bisection task". They were presented with a horizontal line printed in blue on one side and in red on the other side; the proportions of the blue and red segments were varied. Immediately after placement of the subjective midpoint, the line was concealed and the patients were asked to name the colours of the right and left ends. Five patients who identified the left-end colour almost correctly had no visual field defect, while the other seven whose colour naming was impaired on the left side had left visual field defect. The rightward bisection errors were similarly distributed in the fair and poor colour-naming patients except for two patients from the latter group. The lesions of the fair colour-naming patients spared the lingual and fusiform gyri, which are known to be engaged in colour processing. Patients with neglect whose visual field is preserved may neglect the leftward extension of a line but not the colour in the neglected space. The poor colour-naming patients frequently failed to name the left-end colour that appeared to the left of their subjective midpoint, which indicates that they hardly searched leftward beyond that point. In such trials, they reported that the left end had the same colour as the right end. The results suggest that in patients with neglect and left visual field defect, both the leftward extent and the colour of a line may be represented on the basis of the information from the attended right segment.

Forbidden transitions

Transition lines for 12→21 and 21→12 do not appear in our phase diagram and it is quite easy to understand why. Let us assume that the transition line for 12→21 does exist. To obtain that transition, the idea would be to simultaneously increaseand decrease(that is, increase the damage in one part of the system and decrease in another part). Suppose we are in phase 12 and infinitesimally close to the supposed transition line. Considering the local geometry of this line, we may be able to observe its angle with respect to theaxis. If a transition occurs when increasingand decreasing, the tangent on the supposed line would have an angle of. From here, it follows that by increasingonly, while keepingconstant, we would also make a transition (cross the transition line). The only other possibility would be that we were moving along the transition line, but this is easy to disprove because it would imply that the transition does not depend on. If increasingonly causes a transition, the transition must end in state 22 and not in 21. This is because if we only increase, we increase damage to both network A (directly) and network B (indirectly, through the interdependent links).
