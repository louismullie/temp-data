## Question

How about whitening use?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tooth whitening, including its effectiveness, safety, mechanisms, and practical guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and classification of whitening modalities. Then, I should appraise the evidence base for home-based peroxide whitening. Next, I will examine safety signals and risk modifiers. After that, I should review emerging non-peroxide technologies and their current status. Then, I will synthesize comparative effectiveness and mechanism. Finally, I will translate this into practical, patient-centered recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, while continuously checking assumptions and correcting any misstatements as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the scope and classification so I don't conflate different modalities. Home-based chemical whitening includes dentist-dispensed gels and over-the-counter strips, paint-ons, and rinses, primarily using carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide, whereas in-office options use higher-concentration peroxides with or without light/laser activation. Mechanical whitening relies on abrasives in toothpastes. And emerging approaches include piezo-catalysis and pyro-catalysis that generate reactive oxygen species via mechanical or thermal stimuli rather than direct peroxide exposure, which I should keep distinct from conventional peroxide bleaching in both mechanism and evidence maturity [^113hEYDc] [^115PoNU3] [^1132TV5G].

> I will now examine the evidence for home-based peroxide whitening, but wait, let me verify the certainty grading before drawing conclusions. The 2018 Cochrane review of 71 trials found that home-based chemical bleaching products do whiten teeth compared with placebo over short durations (about 2 weeks to 6 months), yet the certainty of evidence is low to very low due to risk of bias, small samples, and manufacturer sponsorship, so effectiveness is supported but not definitive; earlier Cochrane work similarly concluded benefit versus placebo while highlighting methodological limitations and short follow-up, reinforcing caution in overinterpreting head-to-head brand or concentration comparisons [^113hEYDc] [^111SHvRq].

> Hold on, I should verify safety signals and not jump to conclusions from efficacy alone. Across trials, the most common adverse effects are mild to moderate tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation, with higher peroxide concentrations increasing sensitivity risk; these effects are generally transient and resolve with cessation or dose reduction, but I need to ensure I note that long-term harms remain under-evaluated in the Cochrane corpus, which limits risk–benefit certainty over extended use [^113hEYDc] [^111SHvRq].

> Next, I should review emerging non-peroxide technologies, but I must be careful to distinguish promising in vitro/ex vivo results from clinical applicability. Piezo-catalysis using barium titanate nanoparticles converts mechanical vibration (e.g., toothbrushing) into electrical charges that generate low levels of ROS for stain degradation, with Nature Communications studies showing whitening of stained teeth and minimal enamel damage in laboratory setups; pyro-catalysis harnesses oral temperature fluctuations to drive charge release and ROS generation, again with encouraging in vitro tooth whitening and favorable biocompatibility signals, yet both remain preclinical and require human trials before routine clinical endorsement [^115PoNU3] [^113EZVkm] [^1132TV5G] [^111ngvvC].

> Let me consider comparative effectiveness and mechanisms so I don't overgeneralize. Peroxide-based whitening relies on ROS (notably hydroxyl and superoxide radicals) oxidizing chromogens, which is effective but concentration dependent and linked to sensitivity and soft-tissue irritation; in contrast, piezo- and pyro-catalysis aim to generate ROS indirectly via physical stimuli at lower, more biocompatible levels, potentially avoiding the aggressive oxidative bursts seen with high-concentration peroxides, though head-to-head clinical trials are lacking and current comparisons are largely in vitro or ex vivo rather than in vivo [^115PoNU3] [^1132TV5G].

> I should double-check practical guidance and labeling so recommendations are actionable. For home peroxide gels, product instructions commonly advise confirming oral health before treatment, using custom trays with controlled gel amounts, adhering to time limits by concentration (e.g., 15% carbamide peroxide for 4–6 hours), minimizing swallowing, and discontinuing if significant sensitivity or irritation occurs; importantly, many peroxide products advise against use in children under 18 and in pregnancy/lactation, and they emphasize that restorations will not bleach, which I need to highlight during counseling [^115AedHz]. For sensitivity-prone patients, potassium nitrate and fluoride dentifrices can be used adjunctively during whitening, and I should confirm that patients understand maintenance and the potential for restaining over time [^111wwLVX] [^115AedHz].

> But wait, what about special situations like non-vital teeth or white spot lesions? I need to ensure I don't conflate cosmetic whitening with lesion management. Non-vital tooth discoloration may respond to intracoronal bleaching techniques, and case-based evidence suggests predictable shade improvement when protocols are followed, though this is distinct from vital tooth whitening and requires case selection and protective measures; for post-orthodontic white spot lesions, resin infiltration offers a microinvasive camouflage and mechanical stabilization strategy with durable aesthetic results in case series, which is not equivalent to peroxide whitening but addresses a common cosmetic concern after debonding [^115svbdQ] [^114jN5Zq] [^111iu38A].

> I should confirm key knowledge gaps and explicitly state uncertainties so the synthesis is honest. Long-term clinical trials comparing different peroxide concentrations, application times, and delivery systems are sparse and often industry-sponsored, limiting generalizability; head-to-head trials of peroxide versus piezo- or pyro-catalytic systems are absent; and the durability of whitening beyond 6 months and the cumulative effect of repeated exposures on enamel and pulp remain insufficiently characterized, warranting independent, standardized, and adequately powered studies [^113hEYDc] [^111SHvRq].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance and ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. Home-based peroxide whitening achieves short-term cosmetic improvement with mostly mild, transient sensitivity and irritation, but the evidence quality is low to very low and long-term safety data are limited. Emerging piezo- and pyro-catalytic approaches are scientifically intriguing and potentially safer mechanistically, yet they are not ready for clinical adoption pending human trials. Therefore, a conservative, dentist-supervised approach with informed consent, careful product selection, and attention to risk modifiers (existing sensitivity, gingival disease, restorations) remains prudent while we await higher-certainty comparative effectiveness and safety data [^113hEYDc] [^115PoNU3] [^1132TV5G].

---

Whitening products are effective for cosmetic tooth lightening [^113hEYDc], but **sensitivity and irritation are common** and increase with higher peroxide concentrations [^111SHvRq]. Enamel damage is rare with proper use, but **overuse or high-concentration products can cause enamel erosion** and pulp irritation [^115PoNU3] [^112bf4Np]. Non-peroxide options (e.g. charcoal, baking soda) are less effective and may be abrasive [^115PoNU3]. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children under 18, and those with existing dental disease should avoid whitening or consult a dentist first. For safety, use dentist-supervised or low-concentration home kits, follow instructions, and avoid overuse.

## Types of whitening products

Whitening products fall into **two main categories**: peroxide-based and non-peroxide formulations.

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Active ingredients** |
|-|-|-|
| Peroxide-based | - Dentist-supervised gels <br/> - Over-the-counter strips <br/> - Paint-on gels <br/> - Mouthwashes | - Hydrogen peroxide <br/> - Carbamide peroxide |
| Non-peroxide | - Charcoal toothpaste <br/> - Baking soda toothpaste <br/> - Optical brighteners | - Abrasives <br/> - Optical brighteners |

---

Peroxide-based products are the **most effective**, with hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide generating reactive oxygen species that oxidize chromogens and lighten enamel [^1132TV5G] [^115PoNU3]. Non-peroxide products rely on abrasives or optical brighteners and generally yield modest, transient results [^115PoNU3].

---

## Efficacy of whitening products

Peroxide-based products consistently whiten teeth compared with placebo over short-term use (2 weeks to 6 months), though **evidence quality is low to very low** due to short follow-up and manufacturer sponsorship [^113hEYDc] [^111SHvRq]. Strips with 5.5–6.5% hydrogen peroxide are more effective than 10% carbamide peroxide gels, but most comparisons are single trials with high risk of bias [^111SHvRq]. Non-peroxide products have limited efficacy and may require prolonged use for minimal results [^notfound].

## Safety concerns and potential side effects

### Tooth sensitivity

Tooth sensitivity is the **most common side effect**, especially with higher-concentration peroxide products [^113hEYDc]; it is typically mild to moderate and transient, resolving after treatment ends [^113hEYDc].

---

### Gingival irritation

Gingival irritation is common, particularly with ill-fitting trays or excess gel; it is usually mild and resolves quickly with discontinuation [^113hEYDc] [^111SHvRq].

---

### Enamel damage

Enamel damage is rare with proper use, but **high-concentration peroxide or overuse can cause enamel erosion**, increased surface roughness, and microcracks [^115PoNU3] [^112bf4Np] [^113NZR62]. Non-peroxide abrasives can also cause enamel wear with excessive use [^115PoNU3].

---

### Pulp irritation

Pulp irritation may occur with high-concentration peroxide or prolonged exposure, causing transient pulpitis or discomfort [^113hEYDc].

---

## Long-term effects

Long-term safety data are limited; repeated or high-concentration use may increase **enamel erosion** and **pulp irritation** risk, and non-peroxide abrasives can cause cumulative enamel wear [^111SHvRq] [^112bf4Np].

---

## Special populations and precautions

- **Pregnant or breastfeeding women**: Avoid whitening due to limited safety data.
- **Children and adolescents**: Avoid or use only under dental supervision due to developing enamel and potential harm [^115AedHz].
- **Individuals with dental disease**: Treat cavities, gingivitis, or periodontal disease before whitening to avoid exacerbation [^115AedHz].

---

## Recommendations for safe use

- **Consult a dentist**: Seek professional advice before starting whitening, especially with existing dental conditions [^115AedHz].
- **Use low-concentration products**: Prefer ≤ 10% carbamide peroxide or ≤ 6% hydrogen peroxide for home use.
- **Follow instructions**: Adhere strictly to product directions and avoid overuse [^115AedHz].
- **Monitor for side effects**: Stop use and consult a dentist if significant sensitivity or irritation occurs [^115AedHz].
- **Maintain oral hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly to support oral health during whitening [^115AedHz].

Whitening products are effective for cosmetic tooth lightening, but **sensitivity and irritation are common** and increase with higher peroxide concentrations. Enamel damage is rare with proper use, but overuse or high-concentration products can cause enamel erosion and pulp irritation. Non-peroxide options are less effective and may be abrasive. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children under 18, and those with existing dental disease should avoid whitening or consult a dentist first. For safety, use dentist-supervised or low-concentration home kits, follow instructions, and avoid overuse.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^113EZVkm]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a nondestructive, biocompatible, cost-effective, and time-efficient tooth whitening strategy based on a piezo-catalysis effect arising from piezoelectric nanoparticles. Ferroelectric tetragonal BTO nanoparticles with an average size of ~130 nm were synthesized as a catalyzer by a hydrothermal method. In order to demonstrate the piezo-catalysis effect, the degradation of both Indigo Carmine and RhB were examined by exposure to poled BTO turbid liquid under ultrasonic vibration. A comparative experiment was carried out using unpoled tetragonal BTO, cubic BTO nanoparticles, and high-performance PMN-PT single crystal particles. The degradation rate of organic dyes using these catalyzers verified the catalysis effect was a result of the piezoelectricity. Furthermore, teeth stained with different agents can be notably whitened with a poled BTO turbid liquid after vibrating for 3 h, and it were completely whitened after 10 h, regardless of staining agent type. Additionally, the tooth whitening system using poled BTO nanoparticles shows excellent chemical, structural and electrical stability. The piezo-catalysis based tooth whitening effect was also demonstrated using a more practical electric toothbrush and BTO turbid liquid. Our results indicate that the piezo-catalysis based tooth whitening via BTO nanoparticles is nondestructive to the tooth enamel and biocompatible without cytotoxicity as compared with widely used hydrogen peroxide based clinical whitening agents.

As shown from experiments with electric toothbrushes, the proposed piezo-catalysis based tooth whitening procedure can be effective when incorporated in a daily toothbrushing regime that replaces toothpaste made using traditional, passive abrasives with piezoelectric particles — particularly when used in conjunction with the strong, high frequency excitation present in traditional electric toothbrushes. Unlike existing techniques, piezo-catalysis tooth whitening has the potential to be widely adopted for home use, without requiring significant investment from consumers in either time or resources.

### Laser therapy for dentinal hypersensitivity [^11635xhx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dentinal hypersensitivity is characterized by short, sharp pain from exposed dentine that occurs in response to external stimuli such as cold, heat, osmotic, tactile or chemicals, and cannot be explained by any other form of dental defect or pathology. Laser therapy has become a commonly used intervention and might be effective for dentinal hypersensitivity.

Objectives

To assess the effects of in-office employed lasers versus placebo laser, placebo agents or no treatment for relieving pain of dentinal hypersensitivity.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 October 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2020, Issue 9), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 October 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 October 2020), CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 20 October 2020), and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; from 1982 to 20 October 2020). Conference proceedings were searched via the ISI Web of Science and ZETOC, and OpenGrey was searched for grey literature. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which in-office lasers were compared to placebo or no treatment on patients aged above 12 years with tooth hypersensitivity.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently and in duplicate screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted meta-analyses only with studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included a total of 23 studies with 936 participants and 2296 teeth. We assessed five studies at overall low risk of bias, 13 at unclear, and five at high risk of bias. 17 studies contributed data to the meta-analyses. We divided the studies into six subgroups based on the type of laser and the primary outcome measure. We assessed the change in intensity of pain using quantitative pain scale (visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 (no pain to worst possible pain)) when tested through air blast and tactile stimuli in three categories of short (0 to 24 hours), medium (more than 24 hours to 2 months), and long term (more than 2 months). Results demonstrated that compared to placebo or no treatment the application of all types of lasers combined may reduce pain intensity when tested through air blast stimuli at short term (MD -2.24, 95% CI -3.55 to -0.93; P = 0.0008; 13 studies, 978 teeth; low-certainty evidence), medium term (MD -2.46, 95% CI -3.57 to -1.35; P < 0.0001; 11 studies, 1007 teeth; very low-certainty evidence), and long term (MD -2.60, 95% CI -4.47 to -0.73; P = 0.006; 5 studies, 564 teeth; very low-certainty evidence). Similarly, compared to placebo or no treatment the application of all types of lasers combined may reduce pain intensity when tested through tactile stimuli at short term (MD -0.67, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.03; P = 0.04; 8 studies, 506 teeth; low-certainty evidence) and medium term (MD -1.73, 95% CI -3.17 to -0.30; P = 0.02; 9 studies, 591 teeth; very low-certainty evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence of a difference in pain intensity for all types of lasers when tested through tactile stimuli in the long term (MD -3.52, 95% CI -10.37 to 3.33; P = 0.31; 2 studies, 184 teeth; very low-certainty evidence). Most included studies assessed adverse events and reported that no obvious adverse events were observed during the trials. No studies investigated the impact of laser treatment on participants' quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited and uncertain evidence from meta-analyses suggests that the application of laser overall may improve pain intensity when tested through air blast or tactile stimuli at short, medium, or long term when compared to placebo/no treatment. Overall, laser therapy appears to be safe. Future studies including well-designed double-blinded RCTs are necessary to further investigate the clinical efficacy of lasers as well as their cost-effectiveness.

### Common therapeutic approaches for the control of oral biofilms: microbiological safety and efficacy [^111KiChG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Triclosan is widely employed in many consumer and healthcare products. The increasing employment of triclosan in a range of consumer products where there is no proven benefit for hygiene has been severely criticised. Laboratory studies demonstrate theoretical risks that the wide-scale use of triclosan might compromise its efficacy as well as the activity of third-party antibiotics. The precautionary principle would dictate against the use of triclosan, at least in those products where there was no demonstrable health benefit. The theoretical risks, however, are not supported by either field or clinical studies, or by laboratory studies using bacterial microcosms. Numerous clinical studies, as well as historical data, demonstrate the clinical benefits of hygiene adjuncts such as triclosan and triclosan/copolymer in oral care products where these compensate for deficiencies in mechanical hygiene (brushing and flossing). The balance of risk and benefit is firmly in favour of the continued use of dentifrices (toothpastes) and mouthwashes containing active agents such as triclosan.

### Intracoronal bleaching using hybrid technique [^115svbdQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Non-vital teeth discolouration is a common aesthetic issue often treated with intracoronal bleaching, a minimally invasive technique that preserves tooth structure and is more cost-effective than full-coverage restorations. This study reports the effective use of intracoronal bleaching using the hybrid technique for discoloured non-vital endodontically treated teeth, with a good prognosis and no side effects. The treatment plan included intracoronal and extracoronal bleaching for the non-vital tooth and vital bleaching for other teeth. The dental procedure involved a full smile, shade matching, tooth isolation and gingival protection. The patient was given a temporary entrance filling dressing using glass ionomer cement then was recalled for evaluation after a week. The patient achieved an A1 shade in the bleached teeth. The patient was then given a calcium hydroxide base and intermediate restorative material entrance filling. The patient was satisfied with the results, with a marked improvement in tooth colour.

### Rhododendrol-induced leukoderma update I: clinical findings and treatment [^113tmKo2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Individuals who used skin-whitening cosmetics (quasi-drugs) containing 2% rhododendrol-containing agents, developed leukoderma at a higher frequency than those who have used other skin-whitening cosmetics. The Rhododenol Research Team (RD-Team) was formed and commissioned by Kanebo Cosmetics Inc. to conduct research in treatments of rhododendrol-induced leukoderma (RDL), to evaluate effective treatment options from a medical standpoint, and provide information to a wide range of people. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of various treatments for RDL from a medical perspective, based on the information published in the literature as original or review articles. We searched the PubMed (international) and the Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICHUSHI) (Japanese) databases using the keywords "Rhododenol" and "rhododendrol", for articles published between July 2013 and November 2020. We discuss the main clinical findings and treatments (topical, oral, phototherapy, and surgical) of this condition based on the literature review. We found that ultraviolet light therapy is the most effective treatment for RDL. We have also summarized reports of the efficacy of oral vitamin D3 in RDL. A topical prostaglandin derivative has been reported in a new study to be effective. We have provided guidance for patients using self-tanning and skin-whitening agents to improve their quality of life. Finally, we have highlighted the importance of providing patients with information on contact dermatitis and instructing them to discontinue product use immediately if they develop any symptoms of contact dermatitis while using skin-whitening agents.

### Dental bleaching efficacy with diode laser and LED irradiation: an in vitro study [^116yjcjA]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Bleaching techniques achieved significant advances with the use of coherent or incoherent radiation sources to activate the bleaching agents. This in vitro study compares the whitening efficacy of LED and diode laser irradiation using the two agents Opalescence X-tra and HP Whiteness.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A total of 60 bovine incisors were randomly divided into six groups, three for each bleaching agent, receiving only agent, agent and LED (wavelength 470 nm), agent and 1.6 W diode laser (808 nm). The results of the irradiations were characterized using the CIEL*a*b* system.

Results

Significant differences in the chroma value are obtained for the two whitening agents and for the different light sources. In terms of lightness, the association of Laser and Whiteness HP bleaching gel showed significantly better results than when the same agent was used alone or in combination with LED.

Conclusions

Best overall results are obtained with the Whiteness HP and Laser association.

### Topical fluoride for caries prevention: executive summary of the updated clinical recommendations and supporting systematic review [^116aCnA6]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2013). Medium credibility.

Levels of certainty for topical fluoride evidence — High: This statement is strongly established by the best available evidence; the conclusion is unlikely to be affected strongly by the results of future studies. Moderate: This statement is based on preliminary determination from the current best available evidence; as more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change could be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low: The available evidence is insufficient to support the statement, or the statement is based on extrapolation from the best available evidence; more information could allow a reliable estimation of effects on health outcomes.

### Computer simulations of food oral processing to engineer teeth cleaning [^11159Xmg]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

On the other hand, Fig. 5d–g inform about cleaning efficacy. Figure 5d depicts the magnitude of the resultant force applied through contact pressure on the mandible, C FN, versus δ. Notably, the same C FN history applies on the maxilla due to force equilibrium, while based on the simple tangential friction law here, the corresponding resultant force due to frictional stress, C FS, reads μC FN. Figure 5d shows that C FN (and thus C FS) are proportional to the F − δ response (Fig. 5a) of each profile, highlighting that a stiffer chewing response increases cleaning efficacy through enhancing overall friction. Nevertheless, this is not always true since high frictional forces may be confined in a small contact region e.g. hard foods tend to breakdown in a brittle manner, with little deformation around the teeth. In this case, biofilm removal is less likely to occur and therefore C FS plots do not suffice as measures of cleaning efficacy. This gives rise to the total teeth-food contact surface area, C A, plots in Fig. 5e. Importantly, significance is given to the δ > 12 mm regime, since biofilms typically accumulate on the teeth regions close to the gum line, which are likely to interact with food at large δ. In this regime (δ > 12 mm), solid profiles display lower C A than hollow profiles (Fig. 5e). Conclusively, the solid profiles appear less efficacious for biofilm removal. This becomes more clear through the total frictional dissipation energy, W F, versus δ plots (Fig. 5f) and particularly through the corresponding rate, against δ plots (Fig. 5g), as these encapsulate both the C A, factors, as well as the amount of sliding between contacting surfaces; the latter is essential to calculate frictional energy. Noteworthy, Fig. 5f can be misleading as W F are accumulative values, in the sense that frictional energy irrelevant to biofilm removal i.e. when δ < 13 mm (away from the gum line), is embodied to the W F values at δ max = 19 mm. As a result, solid profiles may appear more efficacious in cleaning than hollow profiles. In fact, for δ > 13 mm the hollow profiles show a considerably higher rate of increase in i.e. larger, compared to the solid profiles (see Fig. 5g), implying that the largest proportion of frictional dissipation occurs closer to the gum line, raising the potential for biofilm removal.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^113Uk8Eh]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that photo-catalysis effect of blue-light-activated TiO₂ nano-particles can be used for effective and non-destructive tooth whitening. Compared with the classical H₂O₂-based clinical whitening agent, this method is non-destructive to the teeth, but may cause various photo-toxic and photo-allergic reactions, and in turn lead to damage to oral tissue, because blue light is required as a stimulus to produce reactive oxygen species. Additionally, TiO₂-based techniques require customized toothbrush equipped with an inconvenient and expensive blue light source. Therefore, an effective, non-destructive and safe tooth whitening procedure during our daily activities without extra time-consuming is in demand.

The piezoelectric effect, discovered in 1880 by brothers Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie, is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials with non-centrosymmetric structure in response to mechanical stress. It is important to note that piezoelectric materials are ultrasensitive to mechanical vibration, even water flow, muscle movement, and respiration can also induce electrical charges –. With the ability to convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, or vice versa, piezoelectric materials have been widely used for sensors, transducers, actuators, and energy harvesters for self-powered devices. More importantly, emergent materials with large piezoelectric response have been successively discovered –. Since electrical charges can be induced by mechanical vibration, piezoelectric materials have also been employed as catalysers, termed as piezo-catalysis or mechano-catalysis. The effects are similar to photo-catalysis, which is based on photo-induced charges rather than mechanically-induced charges. Some classical piezoelectric materials, such as ZnO, BaTiO₃, and BiFeO₃, have been demonstrated as effecient piezo-catalysts.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^112bf4Np]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Nondestructive and harmless nature of piezo-catalytic tooth whitening

From an application point of view, the effect on enamel and cytotoxicity are essential for a tooth whitening procedure. First, the micro-morphology of a tooth was compared after whitening using a piezo-catalytic technique and a commercial hydrogen peroxide-based tooth bleaching. To form a baseline, the micro-morphology of a tooth was captured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 5a). The effects of both piezo-catalysis and of bleaching of hydrogen peroxide on enamel were evaluated in the same zone as the baseline reference. Figure 5b presents the SEM image of the tooth after vibration for 3 h in BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid, while another group of SEM images under vibration for 10 h was presented in Supplementary Fig. 14. Please note that the stained tooth can be notably whitened in 3 h and completely whitened within 10 h (Fig. 4a). The SEM image of microscopic morphology shows that the piezo-catalytic tooth whitening is mechanically nondestructive to the tooth enamel. After subsequent treatment using a traditional clinical procedure with a 30% hydrogen peroxide solution for 2 h, damage on the enamel is apparent as corrosion holes and imprints (Fig. 5c). A similar experiment was also carried out using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is often used clinically to clean the mouth. SEM images show that the degree of enamel damage in the 3% hydrogen peroxide solution is noticeably progressed compared with treatment using BTO (Supplementary Fig. 14). In the 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, the tooth enamel was eroded and extensive damaged, exhibiting pitting and holes. The relative lack of enamel deterioration using BTO nanoparticles further indicates that the reactive species created by piezo-catalysis of BTO nanoparticles are less than that created by 3% H₂O₂ during the tooth whitening process. Furthermore, the concentration of reactive species generated from BTO nanoparticles is not high enough to damage the enamel (Supplementary Fig. 15), whereas the high concentration of reactive species, and violent nature of their creation from H₂O₂ are such that enamel damage is likely.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^1132TV5G]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Tooth discoloration is becoming an increasingly common aesthetic problem because it jeopardizes people's appearance and self-confidence. Moreover, tooth discoloration readily results from external chromogens typically consumed in various food and beverages. As a result, tooth whitening has developed as one of the most popular aesthetic dentistry procedures. Clinical tooth bleaching practices are generally based on high-concentration active carbamide peroxide and hydrogen peroxide, which can generate superoxide
- O₂⁻ and
- OH radicals during their decomposition. These radicals further break the conjugated double bonds of organic pigment molecules and then degrade staining macromolecules into light compounds by oxidation reactions. Despite their highly efficient whitening effect, tooth bleaching products can cause serious side effects associated with robust and high-concentration oxidant radicals, such as gingival irritation, mineral loss, and tooth hypersensitivity –.

As the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the backbone of tooth whitening, photo-catalysis and piezo-catalysis have been proposed as promising alternative strategies to produce oxidative radicals. It has been demonstrated that agents embedded with TiO₂ particles can be used for effective and non-destructive tooth whitening under blue-light activation. In particular, an emergent non-destructive and harmless tooth whitening strategy wherein typical toothpaste abrasives were replaced with piezoelectric BaTiO₃ (BTO) particles has shown that routine daily toothbrushing itself without extra time-consuming and additional equipment can generate ROS necessary for effective tooth whitening. However, such photo-catalysis and piezo-catalysis-based tooth whitening procedures have been challenged due to either photo-allergic reactions, or the unavailable intrinsic physical stimuli of light irradiation and ultrasonic mechanical vibration (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, an effective, non-destructive and harmless tooth whitening procedure that requires no additional external energy or specialized equipment is in demand.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on nonrestorative treatments for carious lesions: a report from the American dental association [^1118zae8]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2018). Medium credibility.

Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) efficacy in primary teeth — In studies with 30 months of follow-up, annual 30% SDF had a 1.45 times greater chance of arresting advanced cavitated lesions than 30% SDF once per week for 3 weeks and a 1.41 times greater chance than 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish applied once per week for 3 weeks, with high certainty for both comparisons. On average, after 24 months of follow-up, 38% SDF applied once at baseline produced significantly more arrested advanced cavitated lesions than no treatment (mean difference: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 1.91), whereas this effect was not seen with 12% SDF applied once at baseline; no evidence was found regarding silver nitrate or sealants for cavitated lesions on coronal tooth surfaces.

### Personal cleanser technology and clinical performance [^114WU1P5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Cleansing is essential for health and hygiene. Personal cleansing agents, such as soap, one of the earliest to be developed, were initially expected to deliver only cleansing benefits, but consumer expectations came with time to encompass health and cosmetic benefits. This demand led to the development of an array of milder cleansing agents with a broader spectrum of application. Cleansing products are sold around the world in different forms such as bars (the most widely used), liquids, gels, and creams. The present paper discusses the chemistry, formulation, product attributes, and benefits of various types of personal wash products.

### Prophylaxis of caries with fluoride for children under five years [^1123M7ZR]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety of fluoride interventions

Question 2. What are the potential harms of fluoride interventions for preventing caries in children under 5 years of age?

Dental fluorosis is the only scientifically proven risk of using fluoride interventions. It is 'the result of subsurface hypomineralization and porosity between the developing enamel rods'. It affects children younger than 8 years, as the permanent tooth enamel is fully mineralized in older children, except for the third molars. Both dosage and frequency of fluoride exposure during tooth development influence in the risk of fluorosis. Clinically, dental fluorosis manifests from mild forms with 'faint white lines or streaks visible only to trained examiners' to moderate forms with mottling of the teeth ('noticeable white lines or streaks that often coalesce into larger opaque areas'), or severe forms with 'brown staining or pitting of the tooth enamel' and 'breakdown of the enamel'.

### Interventions for managing halitosis [^111LhgSo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Halitosis or bad breath is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present due to an underlying oral or systemic disease. 50% to 60% of the world population has experienced this problem which can lead to social stigma and loss of self-confidence. Multiple interventions have been tried to control halitosis ranging from mouthwashes and toothpastes to lasers. This new Cochrane Review incorporates Cochrane Reviews previously published on tongue scraping and mouthrinses for halitosis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of various interventions used to control halitosis due to oral diseases only. We excluded studies including patients with halitosis secondary to systemic disease and halitosis-masking interventions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 8 April 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 8 April 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 April 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 April 2019). We also searched LILACS BIREME (1982 to 19 April 2019), the National Database of Indian Medical Journals (1985 to 19 April 2019), OpenGrey (1992 to 19 April 2019), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 19 April 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (8 April 2019), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 April 2019), the ISRCTN Registry (19 April 2019), the Clinical Trials Registry - India (19 April 2019), were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the cross-references of included studies and systematic reviews published on the topic. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults over the age of 16, and any intervention for managing halitosis compared to another or placebo, or no intervention. The active interventions or controls were administered over a minimum of one week and with no upper time limit. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, trials comparing the results for less than one week follow-up, and studies including advanced periodontitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 44 trials in the review with 1809 participants comparing an intervention with a placebo or a control. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 77 years. Most of the trials reported on short-term follow-up (ranging from one week to four weeks). Only one trial reported long-term follow-up (three months). Three studies were at low overall risk of bias, 16 at high overall risk of bias, and the remaining 25 at unclear overall risk of bias. We compared different types of interventions which were categorised as mechanical debridement, chewing gums, systemic deodorising agents, topical agents, toothpastes, mouthrinse/mouthwash, tablets, and combination methods. Mechanical debridement: for mechanical tongue cleaning versus no tongue cleaning, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported organoleptic test (OLT) scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07; 2 trials, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Chewing gums: for 0.6% eucalyptus chewing gum versus placebo chewing gum, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.11; 1 trial, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Systemic deodorising agents: for 1000 mg champignon versus placebo, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome patient-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (MD -1.07, 95% CI -14.51 to 12.37; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for dentist-reported OLT score or adverse events. Topical agents: for hinokitiol gel versus placebo gel, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.72; 1 trial, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Toothpastes: for 0.3% triclosan toothpaste versus control toothpaste, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -3.48, 95% CI -3.77 to -3.19; 1 trial, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Mouthrinse/mouthwash: for mouthwash containing chlorhexidine and zinc acetate versus placebo mouthwash, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18; 1 trial, 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Tablets: no data were reported on key outcomes for this comparison. Combination methods: for brushing plus cetylpyridium mouthwash versus brushing, the evidence was uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.24; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions for managing halitosis compared to placebo or control for the OLT and patient-reported outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of any intervention or concentration. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising the interventions and concentrations.

### Home-based chemically-induced whitening (bleaching) of teeth in adults [^113hEYDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

With the increased demand for whiter teeth, home-based bleaching products, either dentist-prescribed or over-the-counter products have been exponentially increasing in the past few decades. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of home-based tooth whitening products with chemical bleaching action, dispensed by a dentist or over-the-counter.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 12 June 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library (searched 12 June 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 12 June 2018), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 12 June 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (12 June 2018) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (12 June 2018) were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included in our review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults who were 18 years and above, and compared dentist-dispensed or over-the-counter tooth whitening (bleaching) products with placebo or other comparable products. Quasi-randomised trials, combination of in-office and home-based treatments, and home-based products having physical removal of stains were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials. Two pairs of review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 71 trials in the review with 26 studies (1398 participants) comparing a bleaching agent to placebo and 51 studies (2382 participants) comparing a bleaching agent to another bleaching agent. Two studies were at low overall risk of bias; two at high overall risk of bias; and the remaining 67 at unclear overall risk of bias. The bleaching agents (carbamide peroxide (CP) gel in tray, hydrogen peroxide (HP) gel in tray, HP strips, CP paint-on gel, HP paint-on gel, sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) chewing gum, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) chewing gum, and HP mouthwash) at different concentrations with varying application times whitened teeth compared to placebo over a short time period (from 2 weeks to 6 months), however the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. In trials comparing one bleaching agent to another, concentrations, application method and application times, and duration of use varied widely. Most of the comparisons were reported in single trials with small sample sizes and event rates and certainty of the evidence was assessed as low to very low. Therefore the evidence currently available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions regarding the superiority of home-based bleaching compositions or any particular method of application or concentration or application time or duration of use. Tooth sensitivity and oral irritation were the most common side effects which were more prevalent with higher concentrations of active agents though the effects were mild and transient. Tooth whitening did not have any effect on oral health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low to very low-certainty evidence over short time periods to support the effectiveness of home-based chemically-induced bleaching methods compared to placebo for all the outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of home-based bleaching compositions or any particular method of application or concentration or application time or duration of use, as the overall evidence generated was of very low certainty. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising methods of application, concentrations, application times, and duration of treatment.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^114dDDs6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In view of notable mechanical vibration during our daily tooth brush procedure (Fig. 1a), and nano-sized abrasive particles in toothpaste (Fig. 1b), we propose a nondestructive and safe tooth whitening strategy based on the piezo-catalysis effect, easily realized by replacement of abrasives with piezoelectric nano-particles. This strategy can be conveniently operated during our daily toothbrushing without extra time-consuming and additional equipment (Fig. 1c).

### Fluorides for preventing early Tooth decay (demineralised lesions) during fixed brace treatment [^1152c7xR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Early dental decay or demineralised lesions (DLs, also known as white spot lesions) can appear on teeth during fixed orthodontic (brace) treatment. Fluoride reduces decay in susceptible individuals, including orthodontic patients. This review compared various forms of topical fluoride to prevent the development of DLs during orthodontic treatment. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate whether topical fluoride reduces the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs after fixed appliances. The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of topical fluoride delivery in reducing the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs, as well as the severity of lesions, in terms of number, size and colour. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DLs, and oral health-related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 1 February 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 1 February 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 1 February 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 1 February 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Parallel-group, randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus a placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. Cochrane's statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

This update includes 10 studies and contains data from nine studies, comparing eight interventions, involving 1798 randomised participants (1580 analysed). One report contained insufficient information and the authors have been contacted. We assessed two studies as at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk of bias, and two at high risk of bias. Two placebo (non-fluoride) controlled studies, at low risk of bias, investigated the professional application of varnish (7700 or 10,000 parts per million (ppm) fluoride (F)), every six weeks and found insufficient evidence of a difference regarding its effectiveness in preventing new DLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.93; 405 participants; low-certainty evidence). One placebo (non-fluoride) controlled study, at unclear risk of bias, provides a low level of certainty that fluoride foam (12,300 ppm F), professionally applied every two months, may reduce the incidence of new DLs (12% versus 49%) after fixed orthodontic treatment (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; 95 participants). One study, at unclear risk of bias, also provides a low level of certainty that use of a high-concentration fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) by patients may reduce the incidence of new DLs (18% versus 27%) compared with a conventional fluoride toothpaste (1450 ppm F) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00; 380 participants). There was no evidence for a difference in the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs on the teeth after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances for the following comparisons: - an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination versus a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse, - an amine fluoride gel versus a non-fluoride placebo applied by participants at home once a week and by professional application every three months, - resin-modified glass ionomer cement versus light-cured composite resin for bonding orthodontic brackets, - a 250 ppm F mouthrinse versus 0 ppm F placebo mouthrinse, - the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The last two comparisons involved studies that were assessed at high risk of bias, because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, although the internal validity and hence the quality of the studies has improved since the first version of the review, they have compared different interventions; therefore, the findings are only considered to provide low level of certainty, because none has been replicated by follow-up studies, in different settings, to confirm external validity. A patient-reported outcome, such as concern about the aesthetics of any DLs, was still not included as an outcome in any study. Reports of adverse effects from topical fluoride applications were rare and unlikely to be significant. One study involving fluoride-containing glass beads reported numerous breakages.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found a low level of certainty that 12,300 ppm F foam applied by a professional every 6 to 8 weeks throughout fixed orthodontic treatment, might be effective in reducing the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs. In addition, there is a low level of certainty that the patient use of a high fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) throughout orthodontic treatment, might be more effective than a conventional fluoride toothpaste. These two comparisons were based on single studies. There was insufficient evidence of a difference regarding the professional application of fluoride varnish (7700 or 10,000 ppm F). Further adequately powered, randomised controlled trials are required to increase the certainty of these findings and to determine the best means of preventing DLs in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. The most accurate means of assessing adherence with the use of fluoride products by patients and any possible adverse effects also need to be considered. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DLs on patient satisfaction with treatment.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^111ngvvC]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Tooth whitening has recently become one of the most popular aesthetic dentistry procedures. Beyond classic hydrogen peroxide-based whitening agents, photo-catalysts and piezo-catalysts have been demonstrated for non-destructive on-demand tooth whitening. However, their usage has been challenged due to the relatively limited physical stimuli of light irradiation and ultrasonic mechanical vibration. To address this challenge, we report here a non-destructive and convenient tooth whitening strategy based on the pyro-catalysis effect, realized via ubiquitous oral motion-induced temperature fluctuations. Degradation of organic dyes via pyro-catalysis is performed under cooling/heating cycling to simulate natural temperature fluctuations associated with intake and speech. Teeth stained by habitual beverages and flavorings can be whitened by the pyroelectric particles-embedded hydrogel under a small surrounding temperature fluctuation. Furthermore, the pyro-catalysis-based tooth whitening procedure exhibits a therapeutic biosafety and sustainability. In view of the exemplary demonstration, the most prevalent oral temperature fluctuation will enable the pyro-catalysis-based tooth whitening strategy to have tremendous potential for practical applications.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^1111au57]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 4h shows the calculated ΔE for teeth treated in different environments. The ΔE for teeth treated in the environment containing the pyro-catalyst was about four times higher than for deionized water when ΔT = 25 °C. Moreover, similar to the experimental results for the degradation of organic dyes there is an obvious correlation between the value of ΔE and both system temperature and the magnitude of temperature fluctuation. The tooth whitening procedure was also verified using PMN-PT single crystal powder as catalyst, with the PMN-PT samples showing a better tooth whitening effect after 2000 thermal than BTO nanowires (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Pyro-catalysis performance of BTO-Gel

After successful demonstration of tooth whitening by pyro-catalysis, we developed a practical delivery method. A photo-cured hydrogel was used as a carrier for the pyroelectric powders in preparation of composite gels to serve in the fabrication of medical braces. To verify the retention of pyro-catalytic performance of the BTO nanowires in the composite gel form, degradation experiments of Indigo Carmine solution were repeated for the composite. As shown in the UV-VIS absorption curves of Fig. 5a, the gel with the composite pyroelectric material exhibited pyroelectric catalytic performance, which was comparable to that of the pyroelectric nanowires alone, confirming that the presence of the medical gel did not interfere with the pyroelectric catalytic performance. The pyro-catalytic performance stability of the composite gel was then tested by using the same gel for five sequential degradation experiments with Indigo Carmine solution. The composite gel showed no changes between successive cycles (Fig. 5b).

The comparison of brushed zone, marked by circles, reveals that the piezo-catalysis with electric toothbrush was effective to tooth whitening. The difference of Δ E at each time point was calculated by t -test, p < 0.01. Scale bars are 1 cm. Error bars = standard deviation (n = 3).

Additionally, to verify the effect against other staining agents, separate tooth whitening test were performed using various sources of stains, including black tea, red wine, blueberry juice, and vinegar. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 7–10, all the stained teeth were obviously whitened by the poled BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid after 3 h vibration. It is worth noting that the color of roots is much deeper than enamel because of a higher concentration of staining agents on the roots. It can be seen that the color of the roots lightens but the stains still remain after vibration 3 h, while the whole tooth can be completely whitened in the BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid after 10 h of vibration. The time-dependent whitening effect demonstrates the working principle of piezo-catalysis for tooth whitening. Besides the stability of organic dye degradation (Supplementary Fig. 4e) and structure of BTO, the persistent ability of BTO nanoparticles to whiten teeth after prolonged vibration time was also characterized. Three different stained teeth were successively whitened by the same poled BTO within the same vibration time of 10 h, while the tooth whitening effect of the same poled BTO nanoparticle shows no obvious changes (Supplementary Fig. 11).

### Full-mouth treatment modalities (within 24 hours) for chronic periodontitis in adults [^112CFYmp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Periodontitis is chronic inflammation that causes damage to the soft tissues and bones supporting the teeth. Mild to moderate periodontitis affects up to 50% of adults. Conventional treatment is quadrant scaling and root planing. In an attempt to enhance treatment outcomes, alternative protocols for anti-infective periodontal therapy have been introduced: full-mouth scaling (FMS) and full-mouth disinfection (FMD), which is scaling plus use of an antiseptic. This review updates our previous review of full-mouth treatment modalities, which was published in 2008.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effects of 1) full-mouth scaling (over 24 hours) or 2) full-mouth disinfection (over 24 hours) for the treatment of chronic periodontitis compared to conventional quadrant scaling and root planing (over a series of visits at least one week apart). A secondary objective was to evaluate whether there was a difference in clinical effect between full-mouth disinfection and full-mouth scaling.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 26 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 26 March 2015), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 26 March 2015) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 26 March 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We scanned reference lists from relevant articles and contacted the authors of eligible studies to identify trials and obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least three months of follow-up that evaluated full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hours with adjunctive use of an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine (FMD) or without the use of antiseptic (FMS), compared to conventional quadrant scaling and root planing (control). Participants had a clinical diagnosis of chronic periodontitis according to the International Classification of Periodontal Diseases. We excluded studies of people with aggressive periodontitis, systemic disorders or who were taking antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Several review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment (which focused on method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of examiners and completeness of follow-up). Our primary outcome was tooth loss and secondary outcomes were change in probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing attachment (i.e. clinical attachment level; CAL), and adverse events. We followed the methodological guidelines of The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 12 trials, which recruited 389 participants. No studies assessed the primary outcome tooth loss. Ten trials compared FMS and control; three of these were assessed as being at high risk of bias, three as unclear risk and four as low risk. There was no evidence for a benefit for FMS over the control for change in probing pocket depth (PPD), gain in probing attachment (i.e. clinical attachment level; CAL) or bleeding on probing (BOP). The difference in changes between FMS and control for whole mouth PPD at three to four months was 0.01 mm higher (95% CI -0.17 to 0.19, three trials, 82 participants). There was no evidence of heterogeneity. The difference in changes for CAL was 0.02 mm lower (95% CI -0.26 to 0.22, three trials, 82 participants), and the difference in change in BOP was 2.86 per cent of sites lower (95% CI -7.65 to 1.93, four trials, 120 participants). We included six trials in the meta-analyses comparing FMD and control, with two trials assessed as being at high risk of bias, one as low and three as unclear. The analyses did not indicate a benefit for FMD over the control for PPD, CAL or BOP. The difference in changes for whole-mouth PPD between FMD and control at three to four months was 0.13 mm higher (95% CI -0.09 to 0.34, two trials, 44 participants). There was no evidence of heterogeneity. The difference in changes for CAL was 0.04mm higher (95% CI -0.25 to 0.33, two trials, 44 participants) and the difference in change in BOP being 12.59 higher for FMD (95% CI -8.58 to 33.77, three trials, 68 participants). Three trials were included in the analyses comparing FMS and FMD. The mean difference in PPD change at three to four months was 0.11 mm lower (-0.34 to 0.12, two trials, 45 participants) indicating no evidence of a difference between the two interventions. There was a difference in the gain in CAL at three to four months (-0.25 mm, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.07, two trials, 45 participants), favouring FMD but this was not found at six to eight months. There was no evidence for a difference between FMS and FMD for BOP (-1.59, 95% CI -9.97 to 6.80, two trials, 45 participants). Analyses were conducted for different teeth types (single- or multi-rooted) and for teeth with different levels of probing depth at baseline, for PPD, CAL and BOP. There was insufficient evidence of a benefit for either FMS or FMD. Harms and adverse events were reported in eight studies. The most important harm identified was an increased body temperature after FMS or FMD treatments. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison and outcome as 'low' because of design limitations leading to risk of bias and because of the small number of trials and participants, which led to imprecision in the effect estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

The inclusion of five additional RCTs in this updated review comparing the clinical effects of conventional mechanical treatment with FMS and FMD approaches for the treatment of chronic periodontitis has not changed the conclusions of the original review. From the twelve included trials there is no clear evidence that FMS or FMD provide additional benefit compared to conventional scaling and root planing. In practice, the decision to select one approach to non-surgical periodontal therapy over another should include patient preference and the convenience of the treatment schedule.

### Efficacy of 4-year treatment of icon infiltration resin on postorthodontic white spot lesions [^111iu38A]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

White spot lesions are defined as enamel surface and sub surface demineralisation, although these lesions can be reversed and do not form cavities. Infiltration using fluid resin proved to be a valid micro-invasive alternative compared with traditional conservative therapy. This has allowed treatment without any trauma (no use of local anaesthesia and cavity preparation) of numerous lesions in only one session with stable clinical (mechanical stability, enamel hardness, conservation of sound tissue) and aesthetic results (disappearance of lesions) over the time. The present report evaluates the effectiveness of Icon infiltration resin on postorthodontic white spots at 6 months, 1 and 4 years.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^113NZR62]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Tooth structure characterization

Dental enamel, as the hardest tissue in the body, acts as a protective covering of teeth and can withstand a wide range of functional and non-functional loads. Classical tooth whitening methods using peroxide are effective, but can cause adverse such as increased surface roughness, cracking, and enamel changes. To evaluate the safety of the BTO composite gels, the microscopic morphology of tooth enamel before and after whitening with different whitening agents was examined. As shown in Fig. 6a, the same area of the same tooth was observed and recorded using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The enamel surface of the tooth was rough and stained in the initial state, and after 2000 thermal cycles with BTO gel as the whitening agent, stains are removed from the tooth surface, and no damage was caused to the enamel owing to the gentle and continuous release of ROS (Fig. 6b). In contrast, enamel whitened with commercial tooth whitening gels showed significant and irreversible damage to the enamel due to the violent nature of the response caused by the dramatic release of ROS from high peroxide concentrations (Fig. 6c). To further verify that the pyroelectric-catalyzed tooth whitening technique does not cause damage to teeth microhardness of the tooth enamel was measured at five locations before and after whitening (Fig. 6d, e). In the as-received condition, the hardness at the five different positions is similar, with an average value of ∼350 HV, indicative of a complete and healthy tooth. There is little to no change in the hardness across the tooth's surface between the as-received, the stained, and the pyro-catalytically whitened condition. This suggests that the pyroelectric gel does not cause mechanical damage to the enamel while whitening the tooth, much less cause any functional defects to the tooth.

### Efficacy of 4-year treatment of icon infiltration resin on postorthodontic white spot lesions [^112qhA1Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

White spot lesions (WSLs) are defined as enamel surface and subsurface demineralisation without cavitation. These manifestations represent the first clinical observation of the progression of dental caries with the possibility being reversed. These lesions are characterised by a white chalky, opaque appearance. It is possible to see WSLs in patients after fixed orthodontic treatment that make oral health difficult and increase risk of enamel demineralisation.

The specific aspect of these lesions is due to an optical phenomenon, as demineralisation process causes an increase in the pore volume and the refractive index (RI) of the enamel changes because of air and water presence. There are predisposing risk factors such as poor oral hygiene, altered salivary flow and the presence or absence of fluoridation areas. In the literature, there is a WSLs incidence equal to 46%–73% in patients treated with fixed orthodontic therapy.

The therapeutic approach changes on the basis of the different types of lesion: cavitated and non-cavitated. In the first case, a restorative approach is needed; on the contrary, in the second case, preventive therapies are useful. Several approaches have been proposed for the management of non-cavitated carious lesions: remineralisation of the lesion with topical fluoride application using fluoride rinses or fluoride varnishes with tri-calcium phosphate, casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate pastes (CPP-ACP)fluoride associated to CPP-ACP (Tooth Mousse- Mi Paste plus, GC, Tokyo, Japan); pastes made of hydroxyapatite, fluorine and xylitol (Remin-Pro, Voco Gmbh, Cuxhaven, Germany), microabrasion with 18% hydrochloric acid and pumice. However, these treatment options have limitations as they do not give immediate result, require patient compliance and stain from external sources may get incorporated into lesions during remineralisation. Besides, remineralisation occurs only superficially, while the body lesions remain porous which explains the unpredictable results and persistence of whitish discolouration.

Infiltrating resinous polymers are considered as an 'ultra conservative' or 'non-invasive' approach.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of treatment of WSLs with infiltrating resin (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany) and to show clinical and aesthetic results in a patient affected by numerous WSLs, appearing after orthodontic treatment with follow-up at 6 months, 1 and 4 years.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^113BUXs5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Nondestructive characterization.

The scanning electron microscope images of an identical tooth a before whitening treatment, b after piezo-catalysis whitening in BTO turbid liquid for 3 h, and c after further whitening by 30% H₂O₂ for 2 h. The images at the bottom are the enlarged view of the marked identical zone. Scale bars are 100 μm (top) and 50 μm (bottom).

To further explore the non-destructive nature piezo-catalysis, Vickers microhardness was measured during piezo-catalysis based tooth whitening. Three teeth were chosen randomly, and the hardness of the enamel was measured under original, stained, and whitened states, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 16. The hardness is about 300 HV for all the teeth, and the value is stable across the surface of the tooth. It is obvious that the hardness of the teeth does not vary during either the staining or the whitening process. The stable structural hardness also reveals that tooth whitening results from the piezo-catalysis effect.

To evaluate the biocompatibility of piezo-catalysis, rat arterial smooth muscle cells (A7r5) were evaluated using the MTT method. Fluorescence microscope images for different tissue cultures across three days are presented in Fig. 6a–c. The BTO nanoparticles were confirmed as biocompatible, since the cells showed no changes with time, and there were no obvious differences relative to the control. Figure 6d presents the results of the MTT assay, which clearly shows that BTO nanoparticles have no cytotoxicity to the rat arterial smooth muscle cells, while the cells were almost killed by the 15% hydrogen peroxide solution. This cytotoxicity demonstration shows that BTO nanoparticles are biologically safe and the piezo-catalytic tooth whitening procedure is harmless. Additionally, the possibility of Ba²+ leakage during vibration was also examined, and the results show no detectable Ba²+ was created after 30 min, which far exceeds typical daily toothbrushing vibration levels (Supplementary Fig. 17).

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^111bgxog]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The increasing demand for a whiter smile has resulted in an increased popularity for tooth whitening procedures. The most classic hydrogen peroxide-based whitening agents are effective, but can lead to enamel demineralization, gingival irritation, or cytotoxicity. Furthermore, these techniques are excessively time-consuming. Here, we report a nondestructive, harmless and convenient tooth whitening strategy based on a piezo-catalysis effect realized by replacement of abrasives traditionally used in toothpaste with piezoelectric particles. Degradation of organic dyes via piezo-catalysis of BaTiO₃ (BTO) nanoparticles was performed under ultrasonic vibration to simulate daily tooth brushing. Teeth stained with black tea, blueberry juice, wine or a combination thereof can be notably whitened by the poled BTO turbid liquid after vibration for 3 h. A similar treatment using unpoled or cubic BTO show negligible tooth whitening effect. Furthermore, the BTO nanoparticle-based piezo-catalysis tooth whitening procedure exhibits remarkably less damage to both enamel and biological cells.

### Full-mouth disinfection for the treatment of adult chronic periodontitis [^114FcFxE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In an attempt to enhance treatment outcomes, alternative protocols for anti-infective periodontal therapy have been introduced.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of full-mouth disinfection or full-mouth scaling compared to conventional quadrant scaling for periodontitis.

Search Strategy

Data sources included electronic databases, handsearched journals and contact with experts. The Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of eligible studies were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of most recent searches: December 2006: (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were selected with at least 3 months follow up comparing full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hours with (FMD) or without (FMS) the adjunctive use of an antiseptic (chlorhexidine) with conventional quadrant scaling and root planing (control). The methodological quality of the studies was assessed within the data extraction form, mainly focusing on: method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blindness of examiners and completeness of follow up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by multiple review authors. The primary outcome measure was tooth loss, secondary outcomes were reduction of probing depth, bleeding on probing and gain in probing attachment. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

The search identified 216 abstracts. Review of these abstracts resulted in 12 publications for detailed review. Finally, seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which met the criteria for eligibility were independently selected by two review authors. None of the studies included reported on tooth loss. All treatment modalities led to significant improvements in clinical parameters after a follow up of at least 3 months. For the secondary outcome, reduction in probing depth, the mean difference between FMD and control was 0.53 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.77) in moderately deep pockets of single rooted teeth and for gain in probing attachment 0.33 mm (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62) in moderately deep single and multirooted teeth. Comparing FMD and FMS the mean difference in one study for gain in probing attachment amounted to 0.74 mm in favour of FMS (95% CI 0.17 to 1.31) for deep pockets in multirooted teeth, while another study reported a mean difference for reduction in bleeding on probing of 18% in favour of FMD (95% CI -33.74 to -2.26) for deep pockets of single rooted teeth. No significant differences were observed for any of the outcome measures, when comparing FMS and control.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with chronic periodontitis in moderately deep pockets slightly more favourable outcomes for pocket reduction and gain in probing attachment were found following FMD compared to control. However, these additional improvements were only modest and there was only a very limited number of studies available for comparison, thus limiting general conclusions about the clinical benefit of full-mouth disinfection.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^115PoNU3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

With the development of the aesthetic standard, more people are eager to improve their appearance with a whiter smile. As a result, tooth whitening has developed into one of the fastest growing aesthetic dentistry procedures. However, discolouration and staining of teeth can be easily caused not only by drug ingestion, but also by habitual intake, such as tobacco use, eating dark fruits, drinking certain beverages (e.g. coffee and tea), and consuming certain flavourings (e.g. vinegar).

In order to gain a confident smile, there are several common methods for tooth whitening, such as professional cleaning and polishing, coverage with crowns or veneers, daily toothbrushing with abrasive toothpaste, and bleaching. Both professional procedural cleaning and coverings require grinding or other enamel-cutting steps, which cause irreversible damage. Furthermore these techniques are expensive and time-consuming. The use of toothpaste with water-insoluble abrasives is safe, time- and cost-effective, but decontamination of tooth stains is realized only by the mechanical friction between tooth and abrasive elements, such as aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and silicas. Thus, abrasive cleaning exhibits limited efficacy and, furthermore, causes slight scratches to the surface of teeth. Tooth bleaching is a chemical method that generally uses high-concentration hydrogen peroxide as an agent. Although this treatment is highly efficient, bleaching with hydrogen peroxide may cause serious side effects, i.e. loss of organic matrix and increase of enamel micro-roughness. Furthermore, it is possible to induce recurrent extrinsic discoloration due to the increased micro-roughness. The mechanism of hydrogen peroxide for tooth whitening is the release of unstable, reactive oxygen species during decomposition into water, which will attack organic pigment molecules on the surface of teeth, and degrade staining compounds by oxidation. This mechanism suggests that a material with the capability to excite and release reactive oxygen species could be effective as a tooth whitening agent.

### Computer simulations of food oral processing to engineer teeth cleaning [^112nLYA4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The highlight of our study is that teeth cleaning efficacy requires the synergy of a large teeth-food contact surface area and high contact pressures. In this regard, the teeth-food friction coefficient may influence teeth cleaning efficacy in different ways; increasing friction coefficient leads towards a stiffer jaw force-displacement response and thus higher pressures, but also towards a more brittle food breakdown behaviour and hence lower total teeth-food contact surface area. We further reveal that hollow food profiles lead to lower contact pressures but higher breakdown resistance, as well as a larger contact surface area compared to solid profiles, eventually enhancing cleaning efficacy.

Our findings open new and exciting possibilities in manufacturing of oral care pet foods, enabled through computer predictions of the effect of several parameters i.e. food texture-size-shape and contacting surface properties, on teeth cleaning efficacy. Our modelling tools are generic such that they simultaneously inform food design in humans. Specifically, the models can readily be adapted to a range of food systems towards studying consumer preference, as well as the link between food fracturability and aroma release.

Discussion

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a non-destructive, biocompatible and time-efficient tooth whitening strategy based on a BTO nanowires pyro-catalyst composite hydrogel. Ferroelectric tetragonal BTO nanowires with a length of ∼5 μm were synthesized as a catalyzer by a hydrothermal method with self-polarization capability (Supplementary Fig. 16). Degradation of Indigo Carmine was examined by exposure to BTO nanowires turbid liquid under different temperature fluctuations. The degradation rate of organic dyes using these catalyzers verified the catalysis effect was a result of the pyroelectricity since the effect was noted in both pyroelectric BTO nanowires and PMN-PT. Furthermore, teeth stained with different agents were completely whitened with BTO nanowires turbid liquid after 2000 thermal cycles with a temperature fluctuation of 25 °C, as determined by CIELab characterization. Additionally, a prototype tooth whitening dental brace using BTO nanowires combined with light-cured hydrogel shows excellent chemical and structural stability. The pyro-catalysis-based tooth whitening braces were also demonstrated using a stained tooth coated by BTO gels. Our results indicate that the pyro-catalysis-based tooth whitening via BTO nanowires is non-destructive to the tooth enamel and biocompatible without cytotoxicity. The concepts and results strongly highlight the bright prospects of pyroelectric materials used for tooth whitening, or even oral sterilization (Supplementary Fig. 17). This strategy can be conveniently implemented during our daily oral activities (e.g. drinking, breathing, talking, exercising, etc.) without extra time-consuming and additional equipment.

Results

Concept and feasibility of pyro-catalytic tooth whitening

The concept of pyro-catalysis for tooth whitening is generally to harvest ubiquitous oral motion-induced temperature fluctuation without additional equipment or power sources. As shown in Fig. 1b, oral temperature will change with typical daily activity. For example, when hot food (such as hot water) is ingested, oral temperature can rise from ∼36 to ∼48 °C. Conversely oral temperature will drop to ∼21 °C when consuming cold food (such as ice cream). As is demonstrated in this work, this readily available physical stimulus can be used to excite the properties of pyroelectric materials and enables the application of pyro-catalysts for tooth whitening.

The screening charge on the surface of the pyroelectric material is released when a temperature fluctuation occurs. Exploitation of these temperature changed-induced surface charges as catalysts is called the pyro-catalytic effect or pyro-catalysis. The typical pyro-catalysis process illustrated in Fig. 1c–e. When the pyroelectric material has been poled, the internal ferroelectric domains are arranged in an ordinal state, developing a heterogeneous charge (screening charge) on the surface of the material. It has been reported that the intensity of the spontaneous polarization of pyroelectric materials decreases as temperature increases. When the pyroelectric material is heated, the original orderly arrangement of ferroelectric domains will be somewhat randomized, resulting in a decrease in polarization. The change in internal polarization will decrease the required balancing surface charge and will result in the release of excess shielding charges on the surface. The released charge will combine with water molecules to form radicals (•OH or
- O₂⁻) with strong redox properties. Similarly, when a pyroelectric material is cooled, the decrease in temperature causes an increase in spontaneous polarization. As the thermodynamic equilibrium is broken once again, the surface of the material absorbs charge from the environment to make itself electrically neutral. When carried out in an aqueous environment, the remaining charge reacts with water molecules to form radicals.

Tooth whitening demonstration based on piezo-catalysis

After the piezo-catalysis effect was verified via Indigo Carmine and RhB degradation, a tooth whitening experiment was carried out using poled BTO nanoparticles. Since habitual intake of beverages and flavorings can result in discoloration and staining of teeth, in-vitro teeth were immersed in liquid mixture of black tea, blueberry juice and wine for 1 week, and then washed using deionized water to remove the remaining dyes. Photographs of the teeth treated with deionized water and BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid vibration conditions at various treatment times were taken of the same tooth with a standard grayscale card as a reference (Fig. 4a). The stained teeth vibrated in a BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid (bottom of Fig. 4a) gradually whitened with increasing vibration time, while the one in deionized water (top of Fig. 4a) showed imperceptible color change under an identical vibration condition. In principle, the tooth was whitened because of a series of chemical reactions which result in the degradation of chromogen, a product of chemical reactions between sugars and amino acids. Briefly, the reactive species (i.e.
- OH and
- O₂) produced by BTO nanoparticles oxidize the multiple conjugated double bond of large organic molecules that create stains (i.e. chromogen), in turn leading to smaller compounds (i.e., tooth whitening). To quantitatively characterize the whitening effect, the Commission Internationale De L'Eclairage (CIELab) system was employed to characterize the color change. This system uses three variables to characterize color change: luminance L represents the difference between light (L = 100) and dark (L = 0), a designates the color values on the red-green axis, and b designates the color values on the blue-yellow axis. The chroma of the tooth at each vibration condition and after various vibration times was characterized, and the values of L, a, b are given in Fig. 4b–d. It is obvious that the value of L increased, and the values of a and b decreased with vibration time for the BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid condition, while they show much weaker change for the deionized water condition, indicating the teeth have been whitened by the BTO nanoparticle-based piezo-catalysis effect. The color difference of Δ E was calculated by Eq. 5 to further verify the whitening effect. As shown in Fig. 4e, the value of Δ E for both vibration conditions increased with vibration time, but is roughly three times larger for the BTO nanoparticle turbid liquid than that for the deionized water. Thus, the quantitative CIELab measurements agree well with the color contrast in Fig. 4a.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^112y5S3P]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To further characterize the stability of the pyro-catalysis of the composite gels, pyroelectric radical generation was tested after subsequent degradation cycles. Each test was performed at ΔT = 10 °C for three thermal cycles, and the results (Fig. 5e, h) showed that after five dye degradation experiments, the composite gels still exhibit excellent radical production of both
- OH and
- O₂⁻. The fluidity of the BTO gel is demonstrated in Fig. 5i. The excellent fluidity before curing allows the gel to be molded into any shape, making it possible to prepare intricate dental braces, but also allows for customization for a pinpoint treatment of a single tooth. A stained tooth was placed in a mold and BTO gel was injected into the mold to completely encapsulate the enamel of the tooth. The gel was then cured for 15 min in UV light. Afterwards, the tooth was placed in water and subjected to 2000 thermal cycles at a temperature fluctuation of 25 °C with different heating rate (Fig. 5j, k). It was evident that the gel-coated parts of the teeth were significantly whitened compared to the initial state, while the non-gel-coated parts showed no significant color change. In order to simulate more realistic oral temperature environment, the stained tooth with BTO gel was immersed into hot and cold side each for 5 s (Supplementary Movie 3). The tooth whitening effect is also obviously occurred, while in contrast, there was no perceptible change in the color of the one with 5 min, which agrees well with the pyro-catalytic dye degradation (Supplementary Fig. 7).

These photographs are successive images of the same tooth. Comparison of different temperature fluctuation on the tooth whitening levels demonstrated by CIELab results e luminance L, f color value of red–green axis a, g color value of blue-yellow axis b and h color difference Δ E (+25* means without BTO nanowires). Scale bar is 1 cm. Data are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 5). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Typically, sugars and amino acids in food will remain on the surface of tooth and interact with the components in saliva to form colored chromogens through complex chemical changes, so the process of tooth whitening is to degrade the chromogen into colorless small molecules. Under pyro-catalysis, continuous temperature cycles excite the pyroelectric property of BTO nanowires, continuously releasing screening charges to form active radicals. These radical species attack the stains on the tooth surface by oxidizing the multiple conjugated double bonds of the large organic molecules that generated the stains. The Commission International De L'Eclairage (CIELab) system was also used to quantitatively characterize the degree of tooth whitening. The CIELab system characterizes the change in tooth shade by three elements: L (bright-dark), a (red-green), and b (blue-yellow). The comparison of tooth chromaticity before and after pyro-catalysis was measured for different treatment environments, and the values of L, a, b are given in Fig. 4e–g, respectively. When the pyro-catalyst was present, the brightness L of the teeth was significantly enhanced, while the value of a decreased significantly, and the value of b changed slightly. Conversely, changes in the values of L, a, and b for the teeth without BTO nanowires as the whitening agent are negligible. The chromaticity changes for the pyro-catalysis effect are more obvious with increased absolute temperature and increased temperature change. The ΔE calculated from Eq. (7) was used to further characterize the effect of whitening teeth.

### Efficacy of 4-year treatment of icon infiltration resin on postorthodontic white spot lesions [^114jN5Zq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The WLSs are not visible after the application of Icon. The patients reported no important adverse events or side effects during the 4-year period following infiltration.

Standardised digital photographs were taken four times: before treatment, 6 months after (figure 4), 1 year after (figure 5) and 4 years after treatment (figure 6). Before taking pictures, the assigned teeth were cleaned using pumice and rubber polishing cups. Clinical examination and photographs showed relevant optical harmonisation of infiltrated WSL with adjacent enamel and aesthetic stability in the time. Colour and lightness characteristics of the Icon infiltrant as well as the aesthetic camouflage effects were not altered significantly or clinically relevant after 4 years. Besides, there was no progression of early carious lesions with arrest of lesions.

### Rhododendrol-induced leukoderma update I: clinical findings and treatment [^115qsABR]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Individuals who used skin‐whitening cosmetics (quasi‐drugs) containing 2% rhododendrol‐containing agents, developed leukoderma at a higher frequency than those who have used other skin‐whitening cosmetics. The Rhododenol Research Team (RD‐Team) was formed and commissioned by Kanebo Cosmetics Inc. to conduct research in treatments of rhododendrol‐induced leukoderma (RDL), to evaluate effective treatment options from a medical standpoint, and provide information to a wide range of people. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of various treatments for RDL from a medical perspective, based on the information published in the literature as original or review articles. We searched the PubMed (international) and the Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICHUSHI) (Japanese) databases using the keywords "Rhododenol" and "rhododendrol", for articles published between July 2013 and November 2020. We discuss the main clinical findings and treatments (topical, oral, phototherapy, and surgical) of this condition based on the literature review. We found that ultraviolet light therapy is the most effective treatment for RDL. We have also summarized reports of the efficacy of oral vitamin D3 in RDL. A topical prostaglandin derivative has been reported in a new study to be effective. We have provided guidance for patients using self‐tanning and skin‐whitening agents to improve their quality of life. Finally, we have highlighted the importance of providing patients with information on contact dermatitis and instructing them to discontinue product use immediately if they develop any symptoms of contact dermatitis while using skin‐whitening agents.

### Interventions for treating cavitated or dentine carious lesions [^1161cLLE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditionally, cavitated carious lesions and those extending into dentine have been treated by 'complete' removal of carious tissue, i.e. non-selective removal and conventional restoration (CR). Alternative strategies for managing cavitated or dentine carious lesions remove less or none of the carious tissue and include selective carious tissue removal (or selective excavation (SE)), stepwise carious tissue removal (SW), sealing carious lesions using sealant materials, sealing using preformed metal crowns (Hall Technique, HT), and non-restorative cavity control (NRCC).

Objectives

To determine the comparative effectiveness of interventions (CR, SE, SW, sealing of carious lesions using sealant materials or preformed metal crowns (HT), or NRCC) to treat carious lesions conventionally considered to require restorations (cavitated or micro-cavitated lesions, or occlusal lesions that are clinically non-cavitated but clinically/radiographically extend into dentine) in primary or permanent teeth with vital (sensitive) pulps.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases to 21 July 2020 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials comparing different levels of carious tissue removal, as listed above, against each other, placebo, or no treatment. Participants had permanent or primary teeth (or both), and vital pulps (i.e. no irreversible pulpitis/pulp necrosis), and carious lesions conventionally considered to need a restoration (i.e. cavitated lesions, or non- or micro-cavitated lesions radiographically extending into dentine). The primary outcome was failure, a composite measure of pulp exposure, endodontic therapy, tooth extraction, and restorative complications (including resealing of sealed lesions).

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the studies and the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We measured treatment effects through analysing dichotomous outcomes (presence/absence of complications) and expressing them as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For failure in the subgroup of deep lesions, we used network meta-analysis to assess and rank the relative effectiveness of different interventions.

Main Results

We included 27 studies with 3350 participants and 4195 teeth/lesions, which were conducted in 11 countries and published between 1977 and 2020. Twenty-four studies used a parallel-group design and three were split-mouth. Two studies included adults only, 20 included children/adolescents only and five included both. Ten studies evaluated permanent teeth, 16 evaluated primary teeth and one evaluated both. Three studies treated non-cavitated lesions; 12 treated cavitated, deep lesions, and 12 treated cavitated but not deep lesions or lesions of varying depth. Seventeen studies compared conventional treatment (CR) with a less invasive treatment: SE (8), SW (4), two HT (2), sealing with sealant materials (4) and NRCC (1). Other comparisons were: SE versus HT (2); SE versus SW (4); SE versus sealing with sealant materials (2); sealant materials versus no sealing (2). Follow-up times varied from no follow-up (pulp exposure during treatment) to 120 months, the most common being 12 to 24 months. All studies were at overall high risk of bias. Effect of interventions Sealing using sealants versus other interventions for non-cavitated or cavitated but not deep lesions There was insufficient evidence of a difference between sealing with sealants and CR (OR 5.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 49.27; 1 study, 41 teeth, permanent teeth, cavitated), sealing versus SE (OR 3.11, 95% CI 0.11 to 85.52; 2 studies, 82 primary teeth, cavitated) or sealing versus no treatment (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.71; 2 studies, 103 permanent teeth, non-cavitated), but we assessed all as very low-certainty evidence. HT, CR, SE, NRCC for cavitated, but not deep lesions in primary teeth The odds of failure may be higher for CR than HT (OR 8.35, 95% CI 3.73 to 18.68; 2 studies, 249 teeth; low-certainty evidence) and lower for HT than NRCC (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.74; 1 study, 84 teeth, very low-certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence of a difference between SE versus HT (OR 8.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 139.67; 2 studies, 586 teeth) or CR versus NRCC (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.71; 1 study, 102 teeth), both very low-certainty evidence. CR, SE, SW for deep lesions The odds of failure were higher for CR than SW in permanent teeth (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.17; 3 studies, 398 teeth; moderate-certainty evidence), but not primary teeth (OR 2.43, 95% CI 0.65 to 9.12; 1 study, 63 teeth; very low-certainty evidence). The odds of failure may be higher for CR than SE in permanent teeth (OR 11.32, 95% CI 1.97 to 65.02; 2 studies, 179 teeth) and primary teeth (OR 4.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 18.77; 4 studies, 265 teeth), both very low-certainty evidence. Notably, two studies compared CR versus SE in cavitated, but not deep lesions, with insufficient evidence of a difference in outcome (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.88; 204 teeth; very low-certainty evidence). The odds of failure were higher for SW than SE in permanent teeth (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.82; 3 studies, 371 teeth; moderate-certainty evidence), but not primary teeth (OR 2.05, 95% CI 0.49 to 8.62; 2 studies, 126 teeth; very low-certainty evidence). For deep lesions, a network meta-analysis showed the probability of failure to be greatest for CR compared with SE, SW and HT.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with CR, there were lower numbers of failures with HT and SE in the primary dentition, and with SE and SW in the permanent dentition. Most studies showed high risk of bias and limited precision of estimates due to small sample size and typically limited numbers of failures, resulting in assessments of low or very low certainty of evidence for most comparisons.

### Preformed crowns for decayed primary molar teeth [^117GjCZy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007.

Objectives

Primary objectiveTo evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non-restorative caries treatment or no treatment. Secondary objectiveTo explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non-restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively').

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form.

Main Results

We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non-restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. Crowns versus fillingsAll studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). Crowns versus non-restorative caries treatmentOnly one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non-restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. Metal crowns versus aesthetic crownsOne split-mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non-restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.

### The influence of a novel in-office Tooth whitening procedure using an Er, Cr: YSGG laser on enamel surface morphology [^114HfrZa]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of a novel in-office tooth whitening procedure using Er, Cr:YSGG laser radiation on bovine enamel.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

Forty-eight enamel specimens were prepared from bovine canines and divided into four groups: Group 1 specimens (control) received no whitening treatment; Group 2 received whitening treatment with an at-home whitening agent (22% carbamide peroxide) for 7 days; Group 3 received whitening treatment with a novel in-office whitening agent (35% H₂O₂); Group 4 received the same in-office whitening therapy with Group 3 using Er, Cr:YSGG laser in order to accelerate the whitening procedure. The specimens were stored for 10 days after the whitening treatment in artificial saliva. Vickers hardness was determined using a microhardness tester and surface roughness was evaluated using a VSI microscope. Three specimens of each experimental group were examined under SEM and the mineral composition of the specimens was evaluated using EDS. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc test, Wilcoxon signed rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests (a = 0.05).

Results

The surface microhardness of the enamel was reduced after the in-office whitening treatments (P < 0.05), but not influenced after the at-home whitening treatment (P > 0.05). Moreover, the surface roughness was not significantly changed after tooth whitening. EDS analysis did not show alterations in the enamel mineral composition, while SEM observations indicated changes in the surface morphology, especially after in-office tooth whitening (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The laser-assisted whitening treatment with Er, Cr:YSGG laser did not affect the alterations in enamel surface compared with the conventional in-office whitening technique.

### Efficacy of 4-year treatment of icon infiltration resin on postorthodontic white spot lesions [^114AGyKU]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Several short-term studies, in vitro research and case reports have been conducted but case reports with a large number of involved teeth by WSLs and with a 4-year follow-up are not described. The results showed sufficient durability over 4 years and clinical and aesthetic results stable at 3 and 6 months, 1 and 4 years. The resin infiltration technique demonstrated having several advantages: mechanical stabilisation of demineralised enamel, maintenance of sound hard substance, permanent closure of surface micropores, obturation of porous and deeply demineralised areas, inhibition of lesion progression by increasing resistance to demineralisation and high patient compliance. Therefore, this treatment seems to fill the 'treatment gap' between non-invasive and invasive interventions for WSLs.

Learning points

The use of infiltrating resins prove to be an efficient microinvasive treatment for white spot lesions (WSLs), allowing to treat lesions in a single and non-traumatic session.
The optical appearance of WSL was improved by lesion infiltration.
The results achieved with Icon were stable over a period of 4 years in vivo.
The patient reported no important adverse events or side effects during the 4-year period following infiltration.

### Tetracaine hydrochloride and oxymetazoline hydrochloride (kovanaze) [^114sANaY]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

14.2 Study in Children

Study 3

Study 3 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-groups study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intranasally administered KOVANAZE to placebo for providing dental anesthesia sufficient to allow completion of the standard dental procedure on a single maxillary tooth (permanent teeth 4–13 or primary teeth A-J) for pediatric patients aged 3 through 17.

A total of 90 patients, 3 through 17 years of age inclusive, were enrolled at two study centers. Patients received one or two intranasal sprays of either KOVANAZE (n = 60) or placebo (n = 30) based on body weight: one 0.1 mL spray for patients weighing 10 kg to less than 20 kg; two 0.1 mL sprays for 20 kg to less than 40 kg; or two 0.2 mL sprays for patients weighing 40 kg or more. All except one randomized patient in the KOVANAZE group completed the study dental procedure.

Fifty-one percent (51%) of randomized patients were male and 89% were White, with a mean age of 8 years (range 3 to 17 years).

Even though a greater percentage of patients were able to complete the dental procedure without the need for rescue anesthesia for KOVANAZE: 77% for KOVANAZE (95% CI: 64%, 87%) compared to 53% for placebo (95% CI: 34%, 72%) an analysis by weight indicated that efficacy was only established for patients weighing 40 kg or more [see Table 3].

### Nonfluoride caries-preventive agents: executive summary of evidence-based clinical recommendations [^113HfBmv]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2011). Medium credibility.

Nonfluoride caries-preventive agents — American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scientific Affairs evidence-based recommendations — present evidence-based clinical recommendations regarding the use of nonfluoride caries-preventive agents, developed by an expert panel convened by the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs, addressing the efficacy of nonfluoride agents in reducing the incidence of dental caries and arresting or reversing the progression of caries. The panel conducted a MEDLINE search to identify all randomized and nonrandomized clinical studies and reviewed evidence from 50 randomized controlled trials and 15 nonrandomized studies to assess efficacy. The panel concluded that certain nonfluoride agents may provide some benefit as adjunctive therapies in children and adults at higher risk of developing caries, and these recommendations are presented as a resource for dentists to consider in clinical decision-making and should be integrated with the practitioner's professional judgment and the patient's needs and preferences. In background context, the use of fluoridated toothpastes, other topically applied fluorides, fluoridated municipal water and pit-and-fissure sealants, along with dietary improvement, remain mainstays of caries management, and these modalities, which are based on high-quality evidence, are the first choice for prevention and control of dental caries; nonfluoride agents may serve as adjunctive therapeutics for preventing, arresting or even reversing dental caries.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^115n8esn]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Tooth whitening experiment

The extracted teeth (with informed consent by the donors) we choose were healthy and free of caries. Each tooth was washed with pure water immediately after removal, and soft tissues were scraped away. The teeth were soaked in 0.5% Chloramine-T solution (9.0 g sodium chloride and 5.0 g chloramine–trihydrate dissolved in 1000 mL distilled water). Before using, teeth were stained by mixture of black tea, blueberry juice, and wine for 1 week. After that, the teeth were washed using deionized water until the rinse water was clear. Finally, the teeth were dried using bibulous paper. The stained teeth were placed in beakers with 50 mL deionized water, 50 mL ubiquitous suspension (1 mg mL⁻¹). After stirring for 30 min, the beakers were subjected to 2000 cooling−heating cycles at 25 °C temperature fluctuations via immerseing into hot and cold side each for 5 s and 5 min, respectively. The chroma of the tooth enamel was periodically sampled by computer-aided shade matching (VITA Easyshade). In order to observe the influence on enamel after whitening, we observed an area on surface of a colored tooth by SEM before whitening. The tooth was treated by BTO-Gel and commercial tooth whitening gel successively. The same area on surface was observed by SEM after each whitening experiment. The experiments were approved by Institutional Review Board of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology.

Tooth whitening experiment

The extracted teeth (approved by the Ethical Committee of Stomatological School of Nanjing Medical University) we choose were healthy and free of caries. Each tooth was washed with distilled water immediately after removal, and soft tissues attached to periodontal tissues and dental stones was scrapes away. To prevent dehydration, the teeth were soaked in 0.5% Chloramine-T solution (9.0 g sodium chloride and 5.0 g chloramine–trihydrate dissolved in 1000 mL distilled water). Before the tooth whitening experiment, teeth were immersed into black tea, blueberry juice, wine, or a mixture of these liquids for 1 week. After soaking, the teeth were washed using deionized water to remove the remaining staining agents on the surface. Washing continued until the rinse water was clear. Finally the teeth were dried using bibulous paper. The stained teeth were placed in beakers with 50 mL deionized water, 50 mL poled BTO suspension (1 mg mL⁻¹) and 50 mL unpoled BTO suspension (1 mg mL⁻¹), respectively. After stirring for 30 min, the beakers were ultrasonically vibrated for 10 h. The chroma of the tooth enamel was periodically sampled by computer-aided shade matching (VITA Easyshade). In order to investigate the influence on enamel after whitening, we prepared a colored tooth and observed an area on surface by SEM before whitening. The tooth was ultrasonically vibrated by in 50 mL poled BTO suspension (1 mg mL −1) and 50 mL 30% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) successively. The same area on surface was observed by SEM after each whitening experiment.

### Home-based chemically-induced whitening of teeth in adults [^111SHvRq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade tooth whitening products have become widely available in the USA for sale over-the-counter or dispensed by dentists for use at home. With the current rapid growth in demand for tooth whitening it is imperative that the dental community base its recommendations to patients on sound scientific evaluations conducted in well-designed and independent studies.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness (versus a placebo or another active product) and side effects of over-the-counter or dentist-dispensed chemically-based tooth whitening products designed for home use.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3); MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 2 2005); and EMBASE (1988 to week 39 2005). The tables of content of selected dental journals published since 1995 were searched for additional references. Written requests for additional studies and information were mailed to experts in this area of research. After a final set of studies was identified, the list of references reported in the included reports was reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies published in English and non-English were considered in this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials of dentist-dispensed or over-the-counter tooth whitening products with a chemical action (rather than abrasive action), for home use.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of titles and abstracts, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken independently and in duplicate.

Main Results

A total of 416 articles were identified, 25 of which met the inclusion criteria and presented data that could be used in the analysis. All included trials measured effectiveness immediately after 2 weeks of product application. Only 13 studies reported outcome data 1 week after the 2-week application period, and of those only six reported outcome data after 1 month or longer. Four of the included trials were assessed as at moderate risk of bias and the remainder at high risk of bias. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturers of tooth whitening products. Six trials compared different whitening products (gel in trays, paint-on films and whitening strips) with placebo/no treatment and all analyses showed the products to be effective, although most comparisons were based on single trials. Nineteen trials compared different whitening products with each other. There was only one meta-analysis which included more than one trial which showed statistically significant differences between the different whitening products. Strips (5.5% to 6.5% hydrogen peroxide(HP)) are more effective than gel in tray at 10% carbamide peroxide (CP) mean difference 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 3.38). All of these trials were assessed as of high risk of bias. 'Mild' to 'moderate' tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation were the most common side effects. The whitening strips and products with high concentrations of HP caused more users to complain from tooth sensitivity. The protocols for preparation of participants prior to bleaching were inconsistent among the studies. Data on baseline scores of whiteness were not reported by the majority of the studies. The current evidence base on tooth whitening products suffers from methodological and publication biases.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that whitening products work when compared with placebo/no treatment. There are differences in efficacy between the products, mainly due to the levels of active ingredients, hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. All trials were however short term and the majority of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias and were either sponsored or conducted by the manufacturers. There is a need for pragmatic long-term and independent clinical studies that include participants representing diverse populations. There is also a need to evaluate long-term harms. Several studies reported (where measured) the common side effects of tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation, and people should be informed of this.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^114Lp6xB]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

It is noted that the tooth whitening effect under constant vibration (Supplementary Fig. 10b) was more significant than that under discontinuous vibration (Supplementary Fig. 10a) even for the same time duration (i.e. 3 h). It is possible that the concentration of BTO nanoparticles was gradually decreased in the discontinuous vibration process. Since each tooth was removed from the BTO turbid liquid and washed every hour, nanoparticles deposited on the tooth were washed away, reducing the concentration of BTO nanoparticles on the tooth surface. The different whitening between the two processes apropos indicates that the tooth whitening effect results from the piezo-catalysis of BTO nanoparticles, rather than from a strictly ultrasonic washing procedure. High-performance PMN-PT single crystal powder was also used as catalyzer to demonstrate the tooth whitening procedure. It was found that a more significant tooth whitening can be realized within 1.5 h using PMN-PT single crystals, as compared to BTO (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Again, as with BTO, the whitening effect was pronounced after a continuous vibrations cycle, as opposed to multiple, shorter vibrations (Supplementary Fig. 12b).

A further comparative test was carried out to prove the tooth whitening is caused by the piezo-catalysis, and to rule out the possibility of abrasion by the friction against nanoparticles. BTO nanoparticles with a cubic structure, which has no piezoelectric response, were used as catalysis agents (Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). The BTO nanoparticles obtained by hydrothermal method form with a cubic structure at room temperature, due to the trapped hydroxyl groups in the composition. These cubic particles can be transformed into the tetragonal structure after the hydroxyl groups are removed, for example through annealing at high temperature. The results show that both the solution of RhB and the stained teeth exhibit negligible response with vibration in a cubic nanoparticle turbid liquid (Supplementary Fig. 13c–e). Consequently, these demonstrations unambiguously verify the tooth whitening is due to piezoelectricity-induced piezo-catalysis effect.

### Tooth whitening evaluation with cytotoxic and genotoxic effect of… [^115uSAAt]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Bleaching discolored vital teeth is one of the most popular aesthetic treatment in dentistry in the last decade. Teeth whitening can be performed by professionals/dentists in the dental office and by the patients themselves at home. A generally available method for teeth whitening is to use toothpastes which contain whitening ingredients. This method presents commercial option to remove discolorations on the enamel surface of vital teeth. There are many commercially available dentifrices that contain whitening agents, such as abrasives, chemical or optical agents. It has been noticed that whitening agents added in toothpastes can provide whitening effect visible to human eye that can objectively be evaluated by using sprectrophotometers. The main objective in this study is to investigate the effectiveness of different brands of toothpastes with whitening effect and their performance on oral mucosa cells.

As a measure of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in cells, the number of micronuclei and other morphological changes of the nucleus are determined. Other specific objectives are to investigate the patient satisfaction with the characteristic of treatment such as final tooth color, color stability, length of treatment, comfort during treatment and overall participant satisfaction. Respondents are the students and employees of the School of the Medicine University of Split, Croatia. They will be divided in groups where different types of whitening toothpaste will be used. One group will use control non-whitening toothpaste. All respondents will use the same toothbrush during the research. Before using whitening toothpastes, all participants will use the same non-whitening toothpaste for one month. All participants will sign informed consent for participation in the research. Their participation will be voluntary.

Respondents will be able to refuse to participate in the research without any consequences. The color reading will be performed in the middle third of the labial surface of the tooth, in the same environment and with the same light conditions. The measurement will be performed on all vital six anterior maxillary teeth, free of caries and restorations. Participant's satisfaction with the treatment and the toothpaste used will be assessed using the prepared questionnaires. Participants will use toothpastes under test for two months. Toothpaste will be applied twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, for three minutes for 1g. During the experiment, the examinees will not use any toothpaste other than the one under test. Participants will use no other agents for oral hygiene.

### Piezo-catalysis for nondestructive Tooth whitening [^115KJiYW]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Working principle of piezo-catalysis for tooth whitening

The working principle of piezo-catalysis for tooth whitening is shown in Fig. 1d–g. On the surface of poled piezoelectric materials, bound charges are balanced by screening charges, thus the material is electrically neutral, as shown in Fig. 1d. The amplitude of polarization will be reduced (Fig. 1e) due to compressive stress (i.e. negative strain) based on piezoelectric effect. This in turn can lead to redistribution of charge carriers and release extra screening charges from the surface. As a result, the excess-charges will disperse into solution to become free charges that combine with water molecules to produce reactive species, such as
- OH and
- O₂⁻. At the maximum applied mechanical stress (Fig. 1f), the bound charges will be minimized. The excess screening charges will continue to release until the material reaches a new electrostatic balance. When the applied force decreases (i.e. positive strain relative to that in Fig. 1f), the polarization will increase, and in turn charges will be adsorbed from the surrounding electrolyte in order to balance the bound charges induced by the piezoelectric effect (Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, the charges in the electrolyte with opposite polarity to those adsorbed will participate in the redox reaction to produce
- OH or
- O₂⁻ reactive species again. Thus, a piezoelectric material under periodical stress and in an electrolyte environment will offer continuous charge to produce
- OH or
- O₂⁻ reactive species for catalysis, which is analogous to the photo-catalysis under light stimuli –.

### Fluorides for the prevention of early Tooth decay (demineralised white lesions) during fixed brace treatment [^111ZcznA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Demineralised white lesions (DWLs) can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brackets that attach the braces to the teeth. Fluoride is effective in reducing decay in susceptible individuals in the general population. Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment. This review compares the effects of various forms of fluoride used during orthodontic treatment on the development of DWLs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of DWLs on the teeth during orthodontic treatment. The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of fluoride delivery in reducing the incidence of DWLs, as well as the size of lesions. Participant-assessed outcomes, such as perception of DWLs, and oral health-related quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 31 January 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 31 January 2013); and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 31 January 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they met the following criteria: (1) parallel-group randomised clinical trials comparing the use of a fluoride-containing product versus placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which (2) the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

For the 2013 update of this review, three changes were made to the protocol regarding inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies included in the previous version of the review were excluded from this update for the following reasons: five previously included studies were quasi-randomised, a further five were split-mouth studies, three measured outcomes on extracted teeth only and in one, the same fluoride intervention was used in each intervention group of the study. Three studies and 458 participants were included in this updated review. One study was assessed at low risk of bias for all domains, in one study the risk of bias was unclear and in the remaining study, the risk of bias was high. One placebo-controlled study of fluoride varnish applied every six weeks (253 participants, low risk of bias), provided moderate-quality evidence of an almost 70% reduction in DWLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44, P value < 0.001). This finding is considered to provide moderate-quality evidence for this intervention because it has not yet been replicated by further studies in orthodontic participants. One study compared two different formulations of fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse prescribed for participants undergoing orthodontic treatment (97 participants, unclear risk of bias) and found no difference between an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination and a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination for the outcomes of white spot index, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index. One small study (37 participants) compared the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The study was assessed at high risk of bias because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up, and compliance with use of the mouthrinse was not measured. Neither secondary outcomes of this review nor adverse effects of interventions were reported in any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found some moderate evidence that fluoride varnish applied every six weeks at the time of orthodontic review during treatment is effective, but this finding is based on a single study. Further adequately powered, double-blind, randomised controlled trials are required to determine the best means of preventing DWLs in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment and the most accurate means of assessing compliance with treatment and possible adverse effects. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DWLs on participant satisfaction with treatment.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on nonrestorative treatments for carious lesions: a report from the American dental association [^112NAVAx]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2018). Medium credibility.

Remarks and practical considerations for SDF — In the United States, SDF was introduced in 2014 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use to treat hypersensitivity in adults, and at the time of publication 38% SDF solution is the only concentration available. SDF could be used in a broad range of situations, including when local or general anesthesia is not preferred, when a patient is not able to cooperate with treatment, or when a less costly or less invasive alternative is necessary. Data suggest that SDF may be more effective on anterior teeth than on posterior teeth. Hardness of tooth surfaces on probing is an indication that a lesion is arrested, whereas the color of the lesion (black) is not an acceptable method to judge arrest. An adverse effect associated with SDF is black staining of the lesion, which may not be acceptable to some patients, parents, or caregivers. In keeping with the concept of informed consent, clinicians should offer or explain all nonsurgical and restorative treatment options and their potential adverse effects, such as blackened tooth surfaces treated with SDF, to all patients.

### Efficacy of 4-year treatment of icon infiltration resin on postorthodontic white spot lesions [^114ysAvA]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Therefore, if the pores of the lesion body can be completely occluded with the infiltrant, the progression of the WSLs can be prevented and the aesthetic issues can also be resolved.

Spectrophotometric studies with crystal eye spectrophotometer show that the use of Icon results in a relevant increase in the values analysed, that is L* (difference of lightness), A* (green-red coordinate) and B* (blue-yellow coordinate).

In vitro studies show how the Icon resin significantly increases the micro hardness of the enamel, as the penetration power in structures is 67.14% compared, for example, to other materials, such as colloidal silica, whose percentage is 54.53%. These values can also be found in studies with confocal microscopy and through Vickers micro hardness testing (Series 400, Wilson Wolpert, Germany).

In the literature, it has been shown that the use of infiltrating resin is effective in the prevention and care of initial interproximal lesions. In adolescent patients with initial, non-cavitated carious lesions, the marginal infiltrator used reduced lesions progression with satisfactory results. The 4-year follow-up has shown that such a therapeutic approach is effective and lasting.

The Icon resin also applies to orthodontic therapies with the aim of improving or blocking white enamel lesions on dental elements where an orthodontic band is to be applied. The infiltration of low viscosity light curing resin into the subsurface lesion is an intermediary treatment between preventive and restorative therapy for the arrest of carious lesion, leading to the arrest of caries progressionand aesthetic improvement.

The infiltration of the resin of porous lesion structures could mechanically strengthen the lesion, helping to prevent the formation of caries and it also blocks the further introduction of any nutrition into the porous system. In addition, this method can be used with patients with a known fluoride sensitivity.

### Pyro-catalysis for Tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation [^111ULqmv]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Due to the complexity of the human oral environment resulting in saliva with many other metal ions as well as enzymes, artificial saliva was employed as a solvent for pyro-catalytic indigo carmine degradation in order to exclude the effect of saliva environmental complexity. The BTO nanowires were subjected to three cycles at a temperature fluctuation of +5 °C. It can be seen that the BTO nanowires exhibit excellent cycling stability in the artificial saliva environment (Supplementary Fig. 12), and their pyro-catalytic performance in this artificial saliva environment is almost the same as that in deionized water (Fig. 3c). In addition, the phase structure and morphology of the BTO nanowires themselves remains stable (Supplementary Fig. 13). This result provides strong support for the application of pyro-catalysis for tooth whitening.

Tooth whitening demonstration based on pyro-catalysis

After a successful demonstration of pyro-catalytic generation of reactive species and the subsequent degradation of Indigo Carmine solution by these radicals, tooth whitening experiments were performed using BTO nanowires. Human teeth were soaked in a mixture of black tea, red wine, and blueberry juice for one week to simulate the staining of teeth caused by habitual food intake. The stained teeth were then placed in a BTO nanowire suspension at an initial temperature of 36 °C (to simulate the oral temperature), and pyro-catalysis experiments were performed at different temperature fluctuations. The photographs of the teeth treated under various thermal cycles at ΔT = −10, +10, +25 °C were obtained using the same tooth and a standard greyscale card was used as a reference when the photographs were taken (Fig. 4a–c). It is obvious that the tooth enamel is significantly whitened after 2000 thermal cycles of pyro-catalysis (compare left-most and right-most photo in each sequence), which is consistent with the previous experimental results that the higher the temperature and the greater the temperature fluctuation the more effective the teeth whitening effect is. It should be noted that at ΔT = +25 °C, even the roots, which are the most deeply stained part of the teeth and the hardest part to deal with, were completely whitened (Fig. 4c). In contrast, at ΔT = +25 °C, the tooth whitening effect of the control (aqueous solution without BTO nanowires) was almost negligible (Fig. 4d).
