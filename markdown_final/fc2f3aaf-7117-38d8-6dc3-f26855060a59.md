## Question

Porcine kidney transplant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about porcine kidney xenotransplantation, specifically its current status, key results, remaining barriers, and next steps toward clinical trials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why xenotransplantation matters. Then, I should verify the immunologic barriers and how gene editing addresses them. Next, I will review preclinical and early human data, including the first living recipient. After that, I need to examine physiologic compatibility and coagulation issues. I will then assess infectious risks and mitigation. I should also consider ethical and regulatory readiness. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, evidence-based conclusion and outline what would change practice now versus what still needs work.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale. End-stage kidney disease affects hundreds of thousands in the US, with roughly 90,000 on the kidney waitlist and thousands dying or delisted each year; median wait times approach 3–5 years, and outcomes on dialysis are inferior to transplantation, so the supply-demand gap is the core driver for exploring porcine kidneys as a potential solution [^ed62acbe] [^40be3fbf] [^51547d1f].

> I need to check the immunologic barriers next. Hyperacute rejection from preformed anti-glycan antibodies (anti-Gal, anti-Neu5Gc, anti-Sd(a)) has long been the primary hurdle; triple-knockout pigs deleting these antigens, with or without human transgenes, have largely abrogated hyperacute rejection in preclinical models and early human studies, though antibody-mediated and cellular rejection remain concerns that require careful immunosuppression and monitoring [^032378b4] [^0765055c] [^eaa77172].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical readiness without reviewing the human data. The first living human porcine kidney transplant, reported in 2024, used a 69-edit Yucatan minipig kidney with triple glycan deletion, PERV inactivation, and seven human transgenes; the graft functioned immediately, normalized creatinine, and sustained life-supporting renal function for 51 days until the patient died from cardiac causes unrelated to rejection, which is a major milestone for xenograft physiology in humans [^0d4ff43d] [^51547d1f] [^e42bb290]. Earlier decedent models showed absence of hyperacute rejection and life-sustaining function over 7–74 hours, but the living recipient case is the first to demonstrate sustained creatinine clearance and dialysis independence in a person [^ec0bb4f3] [^6162473a] [^74b5e0f2].

> Wait, let me verify physiologic compatibility beyond filtration. The living recipient study showed effective waste clearance, electrolyte regulation, and urine concentration, but also revealed sodium retention requiring diuretics, impaired porcine renin–angiotensin processing of human angiotensinogen, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia likely related to preexisting hypoparathyroidism, and markedly increased uric acid excretion causing hypouricemia; these findings suggest most renal functions are adequate while highlighting endocrine and handling differences that will need proactive management and monitoring in future recipients [^e42bb290] [^3b92d802] [^8086d996]. Preclinical NHP data also show modest xenograft growth, limited RAAS contribution, and PTH-independent calcium–phosphate disturbances, reinforcing the need for anticipatory guidance and protocolized follow-up [^b3d84afb] [^c7796372].

> I should double-check coagulation and endothelial compatibility, as this has been a recurrent concern. Narrative reviews and translational studies emphasize species-specific coagulation dysregulation, including pig vWF–human platelet interactions, inefficient pig thrombomodulin–protein C activation, and risks of thrombotic microangiopathy and consumptive coagulopathy; genetic engineering to express human thromboregulatory proteins and careful perioperative anticoagulation strategies are key mitigations, and early human data did not show overt consumptive coagulopathy, though vigilance remains essential [^c31235e0] [^95838897] [^507ec90a]. Let me reconsider the clinical implication: this means centers will need coagulation-focused protocols and rapid access to plasmapheresis or targeted therapies if TMA or CC emerges [^c31235e0].

> Next, I should review infectious risks and mitigation. PERV remains a theoretical zoonotic risk, but no transmission has been observed in preclinical NHP studies or in the first living human recipient; nonetheless, PERV inactivation in donor pigs and longitudinal recipient monitoring are prudent, alongside rigorous pathogen screening of source herds and surveillance for porcine CMV and other swine pathogens, with archiving of donor, recipient, and contact samples for outbreak investigation if needed [^88aad2b9] [^51547d1f] [^6c0ede60]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance aligns with this approach; yes, infectious disease communities endorse structured surveillance and acknowledge manageable risk with appropriate protocols [^6c0ede60] [^7e0aae9f].

> I will now examine ethical and regulatory readiness. Compassionate-use human cases have proceeded under FDA oversight, and major societies are calling for carefully designed pilot trials in high-need patients with transparent consent, lifelong monitoring plans, and equity considerations to avoid exacerbating disparities; selection of patients with poor dialysis access, high sensitization, or long wait times is being weighed against the need to generate generalizable safety and efficacy data [^f69ea1e2] [^a4de7d17] [^fdb1bb22]. But wait, what if early trials focus only on the sickest patients and obscure benefit? Some experts argue for including lower-risk dialysis patients to better assess xenograft performance, which I should keep in mind as trial designs evolve [^7b921469].

> Let me synthesize the current status. We have moved from proof-of-concept in NHPs to demonstration of life-sustaining function in a living human, with no hyperacute rejection and meaningful dialysis independence for nearly two months; however, this remains a single case with confounding comorbidity and limited follow-up, so we cannot yet claim established clinical utility or define long-term outcomes [^0d4ff43d] [^51547d1f]. I should confirm that the field still needs larger, controlled studies to determine durability, optimal immunosuppression, and true risk–benefit versus dialysis or allotransplantation; indeed, multiple centers are preparing or initiating phase 1 trials, and regulatory guidance emphasizes consistent preclinical survival and standardized procurement and immunosuppression before broad clinical adoption [^17a7f265] [^f69ea1e2] [^20399539].

> Finally, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Porcine kidney xenotransplantation has achieved a historic milestone with sustained life-supporting function in a living human, overcoming hyperacute rejection and demonstrating largely compatible physiology; remaining challenges include optimizing immunosuppression to prevent rejection while minimizing toxicity, managing coagulation and endocrine differences, confirming long-term graft survival and quality of life gains, and implementing equitable access and rigorous infectious disease surveillance, all of which are now the focus of imminent pilot clinical trials and multidisciplinary oversight [^0d4ff43d] [^032378b4] [^f69ea1e2] [^fdb1bb22].

Porcine kidney xenotransplantation is now **clinically feasible** [^0d4ff43d], with the first living-human transplant showing immediate function and sustained filtration for 51 days until death from non-renal causes [^51547d1f]. Key barriers — hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, and coagulation dysregulation — are being addressed by **multi-gene editing** (α-Gal, Neu5Gc, Sd(a) knockouts; human complement and coagulation regulators; PERV inactivation) [^eaa77172] and **targeted immunosuppression** (CD40/CD154 blockade, complement inhibition) [^cdcc767d]. Remaining challenges include **long-term graft survival**, physiologic mismatches (RAAS, electrolyte handling), and zoonotic risk, especially PERV [^88aad2b9]; ongoing trials and decedent models are refining protocols and safety [^17a7f265] [^696a14e3]. If these issues are resolved, porcine kidneys could expand access to transplantation and reduce dialysis dependence [^ed62acbe].

## Historical milestones and recent clinical achievements

- **Early experiments**: Pig kidneys transplanted into non-human primates (NHPs) achieved survival up to 310 days, establishing physiologic compatibility and informing immunosuppression strategies [^40be3fbf].

- **Decedent model studies**: Recent brain-dead human models demonstrated life-sustaining function without hyperacute rejection, supporting clinical translation [^ec0bb4f3] [^6162473a].

- **First living recipient**: In March 2024, a 62-year-old man with ESRD received a 69-edit porcine kidney; the graft functioned immediately, normalized creatinine, and sustained filtration for 51 days until death from cardiac causes unrelated to rejection [^0d4ff43d] [^51547d1f].

---

## Genetic modifications and immunological strategies

| **Genetic modification** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| α-Gal, Neu5Gc, Sd(a) knockouts | Prevent hyperacute rejection from preformed antibodies [^0765055c] |
| Human complement regulators (CD46, CD55, CD59) | Inhibit complement-mediated injury [^eaa77172] |
| Human coagulation regulators (TFPI, thrombomodulin, EPCR) | Mitigate coagulation dysregulation [^c31235e0] |
| PERV inactivation | Reduce zoonotic risk [^ba182f4b] |

---

Immunosuppression regimens include **CD40/CD154 blockade** (tegoprubart) with complement inhibition (ravulizumab) and conventional agents (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, corticosteroids) [^cdcc767d].

---

## Physiological compatibility and challenges

- **Filtration and clearance**: Porcine kidneys demonstrate effective glomerular filtration, creatinine clearance, and electrolyte homeostasis in humans [^51547d1f] [^e42bb290].

- **RAAS mismatch**: Porcine renin inadequately processes human angiotensinogen, causing RAAS dysregulation and sodium retention; diuretics are often required [^e42bb290] [^8086d996].

- **Electrolyte handling**: Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia occur, likely reflecting species-specific differences in calcium-phosphate metabolism [^e42bb290] [^c7796372].

- **Growth considerations**: Miniature swine and growth hormone receptor knockouts address organ size and growth, improving human compatibility [^0c2f8379].

---

## Immunological barriers and solutions

- **Hyperacute rejection**: Eliminated by glycan antigen knockouts and complement regulation [^0765055c].

- **Acute rejection**: Controlled by CD40/CD154 blockade and complement inhibition; early human data show limited infiltration and anti-inflammatory signatures [^cdcc767d] [^864503b7].

- **Chronic rejection**: Still uncertain; ongoing studies aim to define long-term immune responses and tolerance strategies [^98f92f2b].

---

## Infectious risks and mitigation strategies

- **PERV**: Integrated porcine retroviruses pose a theoretical zoonotic risk; no transmission observed to date, and PERV-inactivated pigs are available [^88aad2b9] [^ba182f4b].

- **Exogenous pathogens**: Rigorous donor screening, pathogen-free herds, and post-transplant surveillance mitigate risks [^6c0ede60] [^47994570].

- **Bidirectional transmission**: Human pathogens (e.g. adenovirus) can infect xenografts; surveillance and infection control are essential [^4745c813].

---

## Ethical considerations and regulatory framework

Ethical considerations include **equitable access** — ensuring fair distribution across socioeconomic and racial groups to avoid widening disparities [^fdb1bb22] — and **informed consent**, with explicit discussion of risks, uncertainties, and lifelong monitoring [^a4de7d17]. Regulatory oversight is guided by the **FDA**, which mandates stringent preclinical evidence, standardized protocols, and longitudinal surveillance [^f69ea1e2].

---

## Current clinical trials and future directions

- **UAB phase I trial**: Enrolling 20 ESRD patients to assess safety, efficacy, and immunologic outcomes over one year [^17a7f265].

- **Decedent models**: Ongoing studies refine surgical techniques, immunosuppression, and monitoring protocols [^696a14e3].

- **Long-term goals**: Achieve > 1-year graft survival, minimize immunosuppression, and scale production for widespread clinical use [^0c2f8379].

---

## Potential benefits and limitations

Benefits include an **expanded organ supply** that could reduce waitlist mortality and dialysis dependence, and **physiologic function** with immediate filtration and electrolyte regulation [^ed62acbe] [^51547d1f]. Limitations include uncertain **long-term outcomes** — durability, chronic rejection, and physiologic adaptation remain to be proven — and **ethical and logistical** complexities, including equity, consent, and regulatory hurdles [^98f92f2b] [^f69ea1e2].

---

Porcine kidney xenotransplantation has achieved **proof-of-concept in humans**, with immediate function and sustained filtration in the first living recipient [^0d4ff43d]. Remaining challenges — long-term survival, physiologic mismatches, and infection risks — are being actively addressed by gene editing, immunosuppression, and surveillance [^032378b4]. If these are resolved, porcine kidneys could transform transplantation by expanding access and improving outcomes for patients with ESRD [^ed62acbe].

### Unique problems for the design of the first trials of transplanting porcine kidneys into humans [^a4de7d17]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past year, 3 scientific teams conducted experiments of genetically edited porcine organs into human recipients, 3 of whom were deceased and 1 living. In this editorial, we describe challenges for the design of initial xenotransplantation clinical trials and focus on patient selection, consent, and requisite post-transplant follow-up. Given the uncertain clinical benefit of xenotransplantation, we propose that patient selection criteria might include novel elements, such as approaching patients who have a low quality of life and a strong aversion to continued dialysis therapy. We set expectations related to the importance of informing and protecting family members and medical teams who could be exposed to zoonotic viral infection from the donor organ and/or receive unwanted publicity. Meeting these challenges in trial design and oversight will require multidisciplinary expertise, a conceptual model that extends beyond the individual patient, and creative collaboration between scientists and regulatory agencies.

### The time has come: the case for initiating pilot clinical trials of pig kidney xenotransplantation [^04bf2155]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In vitro studies indicate that kidney transplantation from gene-edited pigs in which expression of all three of the known glycan xenoantigens has been deleted may be more challenging in nonhuman primates (NHPs) than it will be in human recipients. Furthermore, pig-to-human xenotransplantation offers several other advantages - (i) the patient can communicate with the surgical team; (ii) recipient microbiological monitoring and environment will be clinical-grade; and (iii) sophisticated graft monitoring and imaging techniques, (v) therapeutic interventions, e.g., dialysis, plasmapheresis, and (v) intensive care can be deployed that are not easily available in NHP laboratory models. We suggest, therefore, that progress to develop safe, informative human clinical trials will be accelerated if pilot clinical cases are initiated. The selection of patients for kidney xenotransplantation can include those who are at high risk of dying imminently, e.g., those experiencing increasing vascular access challenges with no realistic alternative therapy available, and those who have been accepted onto the waitlist for an allograft, but who are unlikely ever to receive one. Patients with an increased risk of dying include those with (i) age > 60 years, (ii) blood groups O or B, and (iii) diabetic nephropathy. UNOS data indicate that an average of 25 patients on the kidney waitlist in the USA die or are removed from the list every day (i.e., > 9,000 each year). Given the improved xenograft survival observed in preclinical studies, we suggest that it is time to plan a small pilot clinical trial for healthy dialysis patients who understand the risks and potential benefits of kidney xenotransplantation.

### The time has come: the case for initiating pilot clinical trials of pig kidney xenotransplantation [^49a2223d]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Who, therefore, might be the best candidates for clinical xenotransplantation? One group includes elderly patients with diabetic nephropathy. In many regions of the country these patients are more likely to die or be removed from the waitlist than to receive a deceased human donor kidney, particularly those with disadvantageous blood groups or who are highly sensitized. Although it is impossible to determine exactly when death will occur, short survival may be predicted in such patients, and a case can be made for offering a pig kidney to them.

Given the pressing need for innovative solutions in organ transplantation and the promising preclinical data, it is imperative that we continue to advance xenotransplantation research and move decisively toward clinical trials, ensuring that this groundbreaking approach becomes a viable and life-saving option for patients who lack other meaningful alternatives.

Survival of patients (1) with a living donor kidney (top), (2) a deceased donor kidney (second from top), (3) on the waitlist while on dialysis (second from bottom), and (4) while on dialysis but not waitlisted for a kidney transplant (bottom). Approximately 45% of patients receiving chronic dialysis while on the waitlist for a deceased human donor kidney either die or are removed from the waitlist (as no longer acceptable candidates for the procedure) within 5 years. Reproduced with permission from Jagdale et al, based on data from 2 sources.

The immunological requirements for a first clinical trial that includes these patients would necessitate demonstrating no evidence of pretransplant serum anti-pig antibodies or complement-dependent cytotoxicity to donor-specific TKO pig cells to avoid the predictably increased risk of antibody-mediated graft injury in the setting of a "positive cross-match".

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that candidates for the first clinical trial of pig kidney transplantation should have suffered loss of a previous allograft. This requirement, however, would marginally increase the risk of failure of the xenotransplant from both surgical and immunological perspectives, and so we would counsel that this guidance be reconsidered.

It is important that careful consideration be given to the potential benefit of a pig kidney transplant to the specific patient. Attention must be focused not on the impact of the transplant on the field of xenotransplantation research but rather on its potential to benefit the individual patient being assessed.

### The time has come: the case for initiating pilot clinical trials of pig kidney xenotransplantation [^7b921469]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Given (1) the increasingly good results being obtained in pig-to-NHP kidney transplant models, (2) the immunological advantage of humans over NHPs as recipients, (3) the advantages of managing patients in a hospital setting, and (4) the pressing need, based on UNOS data indicating that an average of 25 patients on the kidney waitlist in the United States die or are removed from the list every day (ie, > 9000 each year), we feel there is urgency, indeed an ethical imperative, to initiate pilot clinical studies of gene-edited pig kidney transplantation as soon as possible. The results of ethically robust, scientifically sound initial pilot efforts by those who have requisite expertise in the field will enable rational, evidence-based design of IND-qualifying clinical trials.

Two pig kidney-to-human xenotransplants have been performed recently. A recipient of a TKO kidney with multiple additional gene edits at the Massachusetts General Hospital died 52 days after transplantation due to a presumed cardiac event with stable, life-supporting renal xenograft function. A patient at New York University who received a ventricular assist device several days before a GalTKO renal xenograft underwent an explant of the dysfunctional graft 47 days later and subsequently died (details not yet reported). We have and will continue to gain new information from these pioneering studies that are invaluable to the design and conduct of each subsequent pilot clinical experiment, particularly regarding the risk/benefit estimates associated with clinical xenotransplantation, and the selection and management of patients for whom this therapeutic balance is justifiable.

However, studies in such "high-risk" patients will inevitably be influenced adversely by the presence of comorbidities in these patients and may not provide a true assessment of the potential benefits of xenotransplantation. We suggest, therefore, that careful consideration also be given to the initiation of a limited clinical trial in "low-risk" patients who may face a more favorable outcome with a pig kidney transplant compared to continued dialysis. This trial should be designed to rigorously assess whether the potential benefits of xenotransplantation, including improved quality of life and prolonged survival, can surpass the outcomes achieved with the current standard of dialysis.

### Physiologic homeostasis in a living human after pig kidney xenotransplantation [^51547d1f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 35 million adults in the United States, with nearly 800,000 people experiencing kidney failure. Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment option for kidney failure, offering better survival and quality of life compared to dialysis. However, the demand for donor kidneys far exceeds supply, leaving most patients reliant on dialysis. More than 70% of individuals with kidney failure do not receive a transplant, and ~10% of those on the waiting list either die or are removed each year due to disease progression.

Xenotransplantation, using genetically modified pig kidneys, offers a potential solution to the organ shortage crisis by providing an unlimited supply of transplantable organs. Advances in genetic engineering have helped overcome key immune barriers and reduce the risk of thrombosis and viral transmission –. Preclinical studies in non-human primates have demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and durability of pig kidney xenografts, and short-term experiments in the human decedent model have provided critical insights into their compatibility to humans –.

Building on these advances, the first pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation in a living recipient was performed on March 16, 2024, at Massachusetts General Hospital. This landmark procedure offered an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate porcine kidney function in a living human, free from the physiological limitations of short-lasting brain-dead models.

Here, we report key physiological observations from the first-in-human porcine kidney xenograft over a 51 day postoperative follow-up period, including glomerular filtration, electrolyte and water regulation, acid-base balance, calcium-phosphate homeostasis, uric acid and magnesium handling, and erythropoiesis. This first-in-human case provides critical insights into the metabolic capacity of a pig kidney in sustaining normal human renal physiology, helping to refine future xenotransplantation strategies and expand access to life-saving kidney transplants.

### CRISPR-edited HLA donor kidney transplant to reduce rejection risk… [^0f6bb166]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

While immunosuppressive drugs can mitigate rejection, patients remain at risk for rejection if donor HLAs are unfamiliar, and life-long immunosuppression carries significant morbidities. For example, genome editing of induced pluripotent stem cells to knock out HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR successfully created universal cell grafts that evade T cell responses. Similarly, in animal models, silencing of major histocompatibility complex genes in donor organs dramatically prolonged transplant survival. In a recent porcine study, donor lungs with reduced MHC expression had markedly improved outcomes: ~71% of treated pigs survived long-term with little to no rejection. The overall hypothesis is that such CRISPR-edited "stealth" kidneys will be significantly less immunogenic, leading to fewer acute rejection episodes and reduced anti-graft antibody formation, thereby improving transplant success.

Biological: Ex Vivo CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing of Donor Kidney Procedure: Kidney Transplantation with Standard Care
- AOTCRI-101.
- Adult patients, age 16 to 85 years, with end-stage renal disease who are candidates for kidney transplantation. This includes patients on dialysis or approaching dialysis who have been evaluated and listed for transplant.
- Eligible for transplant surgery based on medical assessment. The patient's overall health status must be sufficient to undergo the transplant procedure and the required immunosuppression.
- **Suitable donor organ available**: A deceased-donor kidney that meets standard acceptable criteria for transplant and is ABO blood type compatible with the recipient. The donor kidney must be allocated to the trial and available for ex vivo gene editing prior to transplantation.
- **Informed consent**: The patient is able to understand the experimental nature of the study and has voluntarily signed the informed consent form. The patient must be willing to comply with all study procedures, follow-up visits, and laboratory tests.
- Severe co-morbidities that would significantly increase transplant risk or confound results: for example, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes with end-organ damage beyond ESRD, severe liver dysfunction, or other life-threatening illnesses unrelated to kidney failure. Such conditions could make the surgery unsafe or the outcome hard to interpret.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

There is considerable patient support for the potential of clinical organ xenotransplantation, as reflected by patients at a 2023 US National Kidney Foundation meeting. Many dialysis patients would choose to enroll in a pilot limited clinical trial of gene-edited pig kidney transplantation in which graft and patient survival are expected to exceed 12 months. During support by a pig kidney, patients on the waiting list for an allograft could remain eligible for a deceased human kidney. If graft rejection or other life-threatening complications develop, we would cautiously suggest that there is a possibility that the graft could be removed, all immunosuppressive therapy discontinued, and the patient returned to chronic dialysis. Nevertheless, there are clearly risks to the patient that need to be assessed realistically in the context of the circumstances of each candidate. Importantly, current evidence is that sensitization to pig xenoantigens (if it develops) would most probably not be detrimental to the success of a subsequent allotransplant (reviewed in the study by Cooper et al).

Such pilot clinical studies would arguably be a source of more information that is more valuable to accurately assess and iteratively improve study components than can be gained simply by continuing studies in NHPs (although these would, of course, be required if new gene edits are introduced into donor pigs or novel immunosuppressive agents become available). Studies in brain-dead human subjects (decedents) may provide complementary data but are unlikely to demonstrate consistent survival of life-supporting grafts for 12 months, as requested by the FDA for IND-qualifying preclinical pig-to-NHP studies.

The transplant community now has ~70 years of experience in clinical kidney allotransplantation to inform the management of patients with pig xenografts. In addition, the almost 40 years of research into xenotransplantationprovides a strong foundation for clinical application well beyond that which was available to the pioneering kidney allotransplant surgeons. Nevertheless, despite our familiarity with allotransplantation, the problems faced in xenotransplantation are sufficiently different that we recommend that the initial clinical studies should only be undertaken by those groups with extensive experience in the pig-to-NHP kidney transplant model.

SELECTION OF PATIENTS FOR PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION

Two groups of patients might ethically be offered a pig kidney graft.

"High-risk" patients would be those who have no realistic alternative therapy available to them. This may be the case in one of the following scenarios.
Patients with 100% calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRA) rendering access to a cross-match-negative human donor kidney improbable. While desensitization protocols and waitlist prioritization currently improve access for some of these patients, current regimens may increase morbidity. Current evidence suggests that many highly HLA-sensitized patients have no or low levels of anti-pig antibodies (reviewed in the study by Cooper et al), though some experimental data question this conclusion.
Patients who have lost 2 or more prior allografts to a recurrent kidney disease have predictably poor graft survival following a subsequent allograft. While it is unknown whether a human kidney disease will affect a pig xenograft, answering this question would be valuable to the field while offering a potential benefit both to the patient and the waitlist population competing for scarce allografts.
Patients experiencing increasing difficulty or complications with vascular access who have almost exhausted options for hemodialysis and are not candidates for peritoneal dialysis. A pilot study could be intended either as a bridge to a subsequent allograft or as a definitive "destination" therapy.

"Low-risk" patients are candidates listed for allotransplantation but who are very unlikely ever to be offered a suitable allograft. We suggest that the primary aim of a clinical trial in these patients would be to assess the safety and efficacy of pig kidney transplantation, either as a bridge or as destination therapy, in the absence of multiple or significant comorbidities. Overall, almost 50% of patients on the UNOS waitlist in the United States die or are withdrawn from the list within 5 years (because of general debility or increasing comorbidities) (Fig. 3). Early mortality and risk of accelerated decompensation among these patients can often be predicted at the time of listing based on (1) age > 60 years, (2) ABO blood type O or B, and (3) diabetes as the cause of their end-stage renal disease. Exclusion criteria would include prohibitive surgical risk, for example, severely limited physiologic reserve, untreatable infection, probably unacceptable body mass index (BMI), and a history of noncompliance, alcohol or drug abuse, or significant psychiatric problems.

### Infectious disease surveillance and management in clinical xenotransplantation: experience with the first human porcine kidney transplant [^47994570]. American Journal of Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The success and safety of clinical xenotransplantation are determined by technical aspects of surgery, the nature and intensity of immunosuppression, xenograft function, and the ability to avoid immunologic, hematologic, infectious and malignant complications. In clinical xenotransplantation from swine, infectious challenges relate to the potential spread of pig pathogens to immunosuppressed humans as well as manifestations of infections of the recipient from prior exposures to common human organisms. Robust strategies are required for donor screening, recipient monitoring, and infection prevention. This report outlines the comprehensive infectious disease management strategy deployed in the first living human recipient of a genetically modified pig kidney, including (1) donor screening and pathogen mitigation, (2) pre- and post-transplant infection monitoring of the recipient, (3) infectious complications and management, with (4) implications for future xenotransplantation protocols.

THE POTENTIAL FOR INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS

The topic of infection risk specific to xenotransplantation clinical trials has been addressed by many experts over many years. In brief, it is anticipated that if the organs are retrieved from pigs that are known to be free of potentially pathogenic exogenous microorganisms, for example, porcine cytomegalovirus or porcine circovirus, and recipients are appropriately screened and vaccinated, the majority of infectious complications are likely to be the same as those seen in recipients of human allografts. Infectious disease physicians have many years of experience in managing these conditions.

However, the risk of transmission to the recipient of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV, which are integrated into the genomes of most pig cells), will remain unknown until clinical xenotransplantation is undertaken. Nevertheless, if necessary, pigs are available in which PERV has been inactivated. Monitoring strategies, including metagenomics, both targeted and unbiased nucleic acid sequencing, can be applied to human xenograft recipients to augment standard microbiologic techniques.

- For the first time, a pig kidney has been transplanted into a human without triggering immediate rejection by the recipient's immune system, a potentially major advance that could eventually help alleviate a dire shortage of human organs for transplant. The procedure done at NYU Langone Health in New York City involved use of a pig whose genes had been altered so that its tissues no longer contained a molecule known to trigger almost immediate rejection. The recipient was a brain-dead patient with signs of kidney dysfunction whose family consented to the experiment before she was due to be taken off of life support, researchers told Reuters. For three days, the new kidney was attached to her blood vessels and maintained outside her body, giving researchers access to it. Test results of the transplanted kidney's function "looked pretty normal, " said transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the study.

The kidney made "the amount of urine that you would expect" from a transplanted human kidney, he said, and there was no evidence of the vigorous, early rejection seen when unmodified pig kidneys are transplanted into non-human primates. The recipient's abnormal creatinine level
- an indicator of poor kidney function
- returned to normal after the transplant, Montgomery said. In the United States, nearly 107, 000 people are presently waiting for organ transplants, including more than 90, 000 awaiting a kidney, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Wait times for a kidney average three-to-five years. The genetically altered pig, dubbed GalSafe, was developed by United Therapeutics Corp's Revivicor unit. It was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2020, for use as food for people with a meat allergy and as a potential source of human therapeutics.

Medical products developed from the pigs would still require specific FDA approval before being used in humans, the agency said. The current experiment involved a single transplant, and the kidney was left in place for only three days, so any future trials are likely to uncover new barriers that will need to be overcome, Montgomery said. Participants would probably be patients with low odds of receiving a human kidney and a poor prognosis on dialysis. "For a lot of those people, the mortality rate is as high as it is for some cancers, and we don't think twice about using new drugs and doing new trials when it might give them a couple of months more of life, " Montgomery said.

### Xenografts: are the risks so great that we should not proceed? [^477d6272]. Microbes and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Animal organs could save patients needing transplants, but further research is necessary to resolve remaining problems with organ rejection. Furthermore, xenotransplantation risks transmitting animal pathogens to patients and to the general population. It would be unethical to proceed with clinical trials before principles and procedures for dealing with this risk are in place.

### A pig kidney supporting human physiology [^ec0bb4f3]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Because of the global shortage of donor kidneys, xenotransplantation emerges as a potential solution for individuals with kidney failure who face challenges in securing a suitable donor kidney. A study featured in this month's issue of Kidney International assesses the kidney physiology of a porcine kidney transplanted into a brain-dead human with kidney failure, demonstrating life-sustaining physiological function for 7 days. Together with preclinical nonhuman primate studies, decedent models provide complementary data for development of clinical kidney xenotransplantation.

### Renal xenotransplantation: experimental progress and clinical prospects [^02aa7b4a]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

There are > 100,000 patients waiting for kidney transplants in the United States and a vast need worldwide. Xenotransplantation, in the form of the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs, offers the possibility of overcoming the chronic shortage of deceased and living human donors. These genetic manipulations can take the form of (i) knockout of pig genes that are responsible for the expression of antigens against which the primate (human or nonhuman primate) has natural "preformed" antibodies that bind and initiate complement-mediated destruction or (ii) the insertion of human transgenes that provide protection against the human complement, coagulation, or inflammatory responses. Between 1989 and 2015, pig kidney graft survival in nonhuman primates increased from 23 days to almost 10 months. There appear to be no clinically significant physiological incompatibilities in renal function between pigs and primates. The organ-source pigs will be housed in a biosecure environment, and thus the risk of transferring an exogenous potentially pathogenic microorganism will be less than that after allotransplantation. Although the risk associated with porcine endogenous retroviruses is considered small, techniques are now available whereby they could potentially be excluded from the pig. The US Food and Drug Administration suggests that xenotransplantation should be restricted to "patients with serious or life-threatening diseases for whom adequately safe and effective alternative therapies are not available". These might include those with (i) a high degree of allosensitization to human leukocyte antigens or (ii) rapid recurrence of primary disease in previous allografts. The potential psychosocial, regulatory, and legal aspects of clinical xenotransplantation are briefly discussed.

### Human and porcine early kidney precursors as a new source for transplantation [^88cab90c]. Nature Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Kidney transplantation has been one of the major medical advances of the past 30 years. However, tissue availability remains a major obstacle. This can potentially be overcome by the use of undifferentiated or partially developed kidney precursor cells derived from early embryos and fetal tissue. Here, transplantation in mice reveals the earliest gestational time point at which kidney precursor cells, of both human and pig origin, differentiate into functional nephrons and not into other, non-renal professional cell types. Moreover, successful organogenesis is achieved when using the early kidney precursors, but not later-gestation kidneys. The formed, miniature kidneys are functional as evidenced by the dilute urine they produce. In addition, decreased immunogenicity of the transplants of early human and pig kidney precursors compared with adult kidney transplants is demonstrated in vivo. Our data pinpoint a window of human and pig kidney organogenesis that may be optimal for transplantation in humans.

### Enhancing kidney transplantation and the role of xenografts: report of a scientific workshop sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation [^ed62acbe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 37 million people in the United States; of these, > 800,000 have end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Despite efforts to increase the donor kidney supply, approximately 100,000 people are registered on the kidney transplant wait-list with no measurable decrease over the past 2 decades. The outcomes of kidney transplantation are significantly better than for chronic dialysis: kidney transplant recipients have lower rates of mortality and cardiovascular events and better quality of life, but wait-list time matters. Time on dialysis waiting for a deceased-donor kidney is a strong independent risk factor for outcomes after a kidney transplant. Deceased-donor recipients with wait-list times on dialysis of < 6 months have graft survival rates equivalent to living-donor recipients with waitlist times on dialysis of > 2 years. In 2021, > 12,000 people had been on the kidney transplant waitlist for ≥ 5 years. As the gap between the demand for and availability of donor kidneys for allotransplantation continues to widen, alternative strategies are needed to provide a stable, sufficient, and timely supply. A strategy that is gaining momentum toward clinical application is pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation. This report summarizes the proceedings of a meeting convened on April 11–12, 2022, by the National Kidney Foundation to review and assess the state of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation as a potential cure for end-stage renal disease.

### Progress in transplantation: will It Be achieved in big steps or by marginal gains? [^e0b22243]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A wish for progress in transplantation assumes that there are needs not met by the currently available therapy and that the barriers to resolving the problems can be surmounted. There are 5 major unmet needs: the potential to avoid transplantation either by prevention of disease or provision of an alternative to natural biological organ replacement; geographic heterogeneity of access to, and quality of, transplantation; availability of transplantation to those in need of it; survival of the patient and the transplant; and the avoidance of adverse effects of immunosuppression. During the past 50 years, there have been advances on at least 4 of these 5 fronts that illustrate the interplay of "big steps" and "marginal gains" in the following areas: surgical technique, testing the immunologic barriers, introduction of chemical and biological immunosuppression, and prophylaxis for microbial infections. The potential for further improvement comes in 5 major areas: blood biomarkers for monitoring of rejection, drug-free transplantation through the development of stable tolerance, eliminating the impact of ischemia-reperfusion injury, xenotransplantation of porcine kidneys, and finally, the possibility of autologous regeneration of functioning kidney tissue to treat advanced kidney disease.

### The role of genetically engineered pigs in xenotransplantation research [^223b9ffd]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

There is a critical shortage in the number of deceased human organs that become available for the purposes of clinical transplantation. This problem might be resolved by the transplantation of organs from pigs genetically engineered to protect them from the human immune response. The pathobiological barriers to successful pig organ transplantation in primates include activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems, coagulation dysregulation and inflammation. Genetic engineering of the pig as an organ source has increased the survival of the transplanted pig heart, kidney, islet and corneal graft in non-human primates (NHPs) from minutes to months or occasionally years. Genetic engineering may also contribute to any physiological barriers that might be identified, as well as to reducing the risks of transfer of a potentially infectious micro-organism with the organ. There are now an estimated 40 or more genetic alterations that have been carried out in pigs, with some pigs expressing five or six manipulations. With the new technology now available, it will become increasingly common for a pig to express even more genetic manipulations, and these could be tested in the pig-to-NHP models to assess their efficacy and benefit. It is therefore likely that clinical trials of pig kidney, heart and islet transplantation will become feasible in the near future.

### Infectious diseases and clinical xenotransplantation [^7e0aae9f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Xenotransplantation, transplantation into humans of vascularized organs or viable cells from nonhuman species, is a potential solution to shortages of transplantable human organs. Among challenges to application of clinical xenotransplantation are unknown risks of transmission of animal microbes to immunosuppressed recipients or the community. Experience in allotransplantation and in preclinical models suggests that viral infections are the greatest concern. Worldwide, the distribution of swine pathogens is heterogeneous and cannot be fully controlled by international agricultural regulations. It is possible to screen source animals for potential human pathogens before procuring organs in a manner not possible within the time available for surveillance testing in allotransplantation. Infection control measures require microbiological assays for surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients and research into zoonotic potential of porcine organisms. Available data suggest that infectious risks of xenotransplantation are manageable and that clinical trials can advance with appropriate protocols for microbiological monitoring of source animals and recipients.

### Normal graft function after pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant [^74b5e0f2]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Thirty-seven million adults in the US have chronic kidney disease (CKD), many of whom will ultimately progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Kidney transplant is the gold-standard therapy for patients with ESKD, yet annually, only 25 000 individuals receive a kidney. The gap between supply and demand is so vast that 40% of listed patients die within 5 years while waiting for a kidney transplant. Although xenotransplant represents 1 potential solution for the kidney shortage, previous reports of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant using a preclinical human brain death model have shown xenograft urine production but not creatinine clearance, a necessary function to sustain life. Thus, no study to date has shown the ability of a xenograft to provide life-sustaining kidney function in a human.

### Engineering equity into the promise of xenotransplantation [^fdb1bb22]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Two of the greatest challenges facing kidney transplantation are the lack of donated organs and inequities in who receives a transplant. Xenotransplantation holds promise as a treatment approach that could solve the supply problem. Major advances in gene-editing procedures have enabled several companies to raise genetically engineered pigs for organ donation. These porcine organs lack antigens and have other modifications that should reduce the probability of immunological rejection when transplanted into humans. The US Food and Drug Administration and transplantation leaders are starting to chart a path to test xenotransplants in clinical trials and later integrate them into routine clinical care. Here we provide a framework that industry, regulatory authorities, payers, transplantation professionals, and patient groups can implement to promote equity during every stage in this process. We also call for immediate action. Companies developing xenotransplant technology should assemble patient advocacy boards to bring the concerns of individuals with end-stage kidney disease to the forefront. For trials, xenotransplantation companies should partner with transplant programs with substantial patient populations of racial and ethnic minority groups and that have reciprocal relationships with those communities. Those companies and transplant programs should reach out now to those communities to inform them about xenotransplantation and try to address their concerns. These actions have the potential to make these communities full partners in the promise of xenotransplantation.

### Physiologic homeostasis in a living human after pig kidney xenotransplantation [^cdcc767d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Screening, inclusion, and ethical considerations for a study participant

A potential xenotransplantation candidate was screened among the kidney transplantation candidates approved for transplant at MGH with ongoing challenges with dialysis, no potential living donor, and an expected waiting time for a deceased donor of longer than 4 years. Sex and gender were not considered in the study design for recipient selection. This study was approved by the MGH Institutional Review Board (IRB #2023P003631). A selected candidate had multiple in-depth discussions with the MGH transplantation team regarding the current medical status and potential risks/benefits of xenotransplantation. Written informed consent was obtained, according to CARE guidelines and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles, both for proceeding with the first pig kidney transplantation into a living recipient under a 'single patient, compassionate use authorization' from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and for publishing potentially identifiable information.

Genetically modified porcine donor

A 1-year-old female Yucatan mini-swine donor (ESUS-1784), carrying 69 genomic edits made using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, was produced and provided by eGenesis, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Detailed information about the donor genetic composition was previously reported. In brief, the donor kidney (EGEN-2784) was engineered to eliminate three known glycan xenoantigens, which could trigger an antibody response in humans, and to express human thrombo-regulatory proteins, complement regulatory proteins, and inflammatory and immunity regulating proteins. In addition, 59 copies of porcine endogenous retroviral elements were inactivated. The study design did not account for sex in the selection of donors. The porcine donor was maintained in a biosecure facility, and underwent regular pathogen screening according to FDA recommendations. The animal procedures were reviewed and approved by Biomere Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; protocol 24–04).

Immunosuppressive regimen

The recipient received an immunosuppressive regimen centered on an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (tegoprubart), informed by successful preclinical non-human primate studies. Induction therapy included rituximab and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with tegoprubart, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody (ravulizumab), tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and corticosteroids.

### The science of xenotransplantation for nephrologists [^7dd896de]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The field of xenotransplantation has seen remarkable progress since its inception with recent preclinical trials in human recipients pushing kidney xenotransplantation one-step closer to clinical reality. In this review, we update practicing clinicians on recent advances in kidney xenotransplantation given the proximity of clinical trials in humans.

Recent Findings

Early studies in the field established the physiologic basis of xenotransplantation and suggested that the pig kidney will support human physiology. Genetic engineering of source pigs has greatly reduced the immunogenicity of kidney grafts, and studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated the viability of kidney xenotransplants for months after transplantation. Finally, a recent study in a novel preclinical human model demonstrated that key findings in NHP experiments are generalizable to humans, namely, the absence of hyperacute rejection.

Summary

Overall, it appears that critical physiologic, immunologic and technical barriers to implementation of clinical trials in humans have been overcome.

### Clinical pig kidney xenotransplantation: how close are we? [^40be3fbf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with ESKD who would benefit from a kidney transplant face a critical and continuing shortage of kidneys from deceased human donors. As a result, such patients wait a median of 3.9 years to receive a donor kidney, by which time approximately 35% of transplant candidates have died while waiting or have been removed from the waiting list. Those of blood group B or O may experience a significantly longer waiting period. This problem could be resolved if kidneys from genetically engineered pigs offered an alternative with an acceptable clinical outcome. Attempts to accomplish this have followed two major paths: deletion of pig xenoantigens, as well as insertion of "protective" human transgenes to counter the human immune response. Pigs with up to nine genetic manipulations are now available. In nonhuman primates, administering novel agents that block the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway, such as an anti-CD40 mAb, suppresses the adaptive immune response, leading to pig kidney graft survival of many months without features of rejection (experiments were terminated for infectious complications). In the absence of innate and adaptive immune responses, the transplanted pig kidneys have generally displayed excellent function. A clinical trial is anticipated within 2 years. We suggest that it would be ethical to offer a pig kidney transplant to selected patients who have a life expectancy shorter than the time it would take for them to obtain a kidney from a deceased human donor. In the future, the pigs will also be genetically engineered to control the adaptive immune response, thus enabling exogenous immunosuppressive therapy to be significantly reduced or eliminated.

### Physiologic homeostasis after pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation [^01acdaf0]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 800 million people worldwide have chronic kidney disease, and > 1 million die each year of kidney failure. In the United States, kidney disease is the 10th leading cause of death and responsible for $87 billion in Medicare-related spending, with renal replacement therapy accounting for most of this expenditure. These statistics are staggering given the gold standard treatment of kidney transplantation was developed 69 years ago. Demand for kidney grafts outpaces supply, and this limits kidney transplantation as a treatment option to few individuals with kidney failure. Radical solutions, like xenotransplantation, provide a means to close the gap between kidney supply and demand.

The largest barrier to implementation of xenotransplantation has been xenograft rejection. Recent advancements in genetic editing tools have allowed the generation of humanized pig kidneys for purposes of human transplantation. Early but promising results from preclinical trials in human decedents have moved xenotransplantation into the realm of reality. Most recently, we performed pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation in a brain-dead research decedent and demonstrated, for the first time, life-sustaining kidney function in an anephric human, as evidenced by production of urine and clearance of creatinine. Although encouraging, these results shed light on only a fraction of post-xenotransplant pig kidney physiology that will be critical to assess and understand before moving into trials in living persons.

### Characterizing coagulation responses in humans and nonhuman primates following kidney xenotransplantation – A narrative review [^507ec90a]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 GLOBAL KIDNEY DISEASE AND XENOTRANSPLANTATION

Kidney disease, affecting over 850 million people globally, is anticipated to become the 5th leading cause of death by 2040. In the United States (US), there are more than 89 000 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list as of May 2024, with approximately more than 25 000 kidney transplants performed annually. The demand far exceeds the supply, as evidenced by the daily death of 17 patients on the waiting list and an annual addition of approximately 34 000 new patients in the US. Current statistics indicate that around 40% of patients on the waitlist are unlikely ever to receive an allograft.

This shortfall has shifted research focus towards kidney xenotransplantation (cross‐species transplantation) as a viable solution. This process, with the goal of transplanting a pig kidney into a human, may unlock an essentially unlimited organ supply and overcome blood type compatibility issues. Pigs as sources of kidneys are preferred over nonhuman primates (NHPs) for a number of reasons(Table 1).

TABLE 1
The advantages and disadvantages of the pig as a potential source of organs and cells for humans.

However, significant challenges remain, such as high rates of antibody‐mediated rejection (estimated to be 42% after xenotransplantation vs. 6% after allotransplantation), acute cellular rejection, physiological incompatibilities, and the risk of cross‐species infection. These various reactions can contribute to abnormal coagulation responses which collectively (through their interconnected nature) may combine to cause graft destruction. Coagulation dysfunction can take the form of thrombosis or bleeding, platelet sequestration, reduced fibrinogen, increased D‐dimer, and prolonged clotting time. Notably, studies in NHPs have resulted in thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the pig graft and consumptive coagulopathy (CC) in the NHP recipient.

### Genetically modified porcine kidneys have sufficient tissue integrity for use in pig-to-human xenotransplantation [^71edc626]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine if genetically modified porcine kidneys used for xenotransplantation had sufficient tissue integrity to support long-term function in a human recipient.

Background

Kidney transplantation remains the best available treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, a shortage of available donor human kidneys prevents many patients from achieving the benefits of transplantation. Xenotransplantation is a potential solution to this shortage. Recent pre-clinical human studies have demonstrated kidneys from genetically modified pig donors can be transplanted without hyperacute rejection and are capable of providing creatinine and other solute clearance. It is unknown whether the porcine kidneys would tolerate the relatively higher resting blood pressure in an adult human recipient compared with the pig donor or non-human primate (NHP) recipients used in translational studies. Furthermore, previous experience in NHPs raised concerns about the tissue integrity of the porcine ureter and post-xenotransplant growth of the porcine kidney.

Methods

Kidneys recovered from porcine donors with 10 gene edits were transplanted into decedent brain-dead recipients who were not eligible for organ donation. Decedents underwent bilateral native nephrectomy before transplant and were followed for 3 to 7 days. Standard induction and maintenance immunosuppression was used as previously reported. Vital signs, including blood pressure, were recorded frequently. Kidney xenografts were assessed daily, serially biopsied, and were measured at implantation and study completion.

Results

Three decedents underwent successful xenotransplantation. Subcapsular hematomas developed, requiring incision of the xenograft capsules to prevent Page kidney. Blood pressures were maintained in a physiologic range for adult humans (median arterial pressures (MAP) 108.5 mm Hg (Interquartile Range (IQR): 97–114 mm Hg), 74 mm Hg (IQR: 71–78 mm Hg), and 95 mm Hg (IQR: 88–99 mm Hg, respectively) and no bleeding complications or aneurysm formation was observed. Serial biopsies were taken from the xenografts without apparent loss of tissue integrity despite the lack of a capsule. Ureteroneocystotomies remained intact without evidence of urine leak. Xenograft growth was observed, but plateaued, in 1 decedent with increased volume of the left and right xenografts by 25% and 26%, respectively, and in the context of human growth hormone levels consistently less < 0.1 ng/ml and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels ranging from 34–50 ng/ml.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest kidneys from 10-gene edited porcine donors have sufficient tissue integrity to tolerate xenotransplantation into a living human recipient. There was no evidence of anastomotic complications, and the xenografts tolerated needle biopsy without issue. Xenograft growth occurred but plateaued by the study end; further observation and investigation will be required to confirm this finding and elucidate underlying mechanisms.

### Physiologic and immunologic hurdles to xenotransplantation [^d212df8c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

The major problem in the field of renal transplantation is currently the shortage of available kidneys. However, the use of animals as a source of kidneys, i.e., xenotransplantation, is increasingly being viewed as a potential solution to this problem. One preeminent hurdle to xenotransplantation is the immune response of the recipient against the graft; other hurdles include the physiologic limitations of the transplant, infection, and ethical considerations. This review summarizes what is currently known regarding the obstacles to xenotransplantation and some potential solutions to those problems.

### Spatiotemporal immune atlas of a clinical-grade gene-edited pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant [^0765055c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Kidney allotransplantation is a life-saving therapy for people with end-stage kidney disease, but there are not enough human kidneys to meet the growing demand. Xenotransplantation is a promising solution to increase organ supply, and enthusiasm around xenotransplantation has recently increased in the wake of several reports of successful pig-to-human xenotransplants –. These key studies have been made possible by advances in gene editing technology that have removed carbohydrate xenoantigens from porcine cells which otherwise provoke binding of preformed antibody in humans and result in hyperacute rejection. While significant progress has recently been made to overcome a major immunologic barrier to successful xenotransplantation in humans, the safest and most effective immunosuppression strategy to control other human immunologic responses to the porcine kidney remains unclear. Nevertheless, this question is important to address prior to embarking on first-in-human clinical trials.

### Xenotransplantation: current understanding of the mechanism of immune-mediated injury [^98f92f2b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The scarcity of transplantable organs represents a worldwide public health crisis, and as a result, thousands of people with kidney failure die waiting for a transplant each year. Xenotransplantation involves transplanting organs from an animal source into humans, offering a potential solution to this significant unmet need. Indeed, if there is a limitless supply of organs, many more patients who do not meet the current criteria for transplant eligibility could also be considered as candidates. Although there are examples of attempts to transplant animal tissues or organs into humans dating back over 300 years, none were successful due to cross-species immunologic incompatibility. Even so, significant advances in genetic engineering and the emergence of novel immunosuppressive agents have spurred impressive improvements in xenograft survival in preclinical studies involving nonhuman primates. Furthermore, recent reports of genetically modified pig kidney and heart xenotransplants in human decedents and living recipients on a compassionate use basis have provided impetus to advancing the field toward first-in-human trials. However, studies in nonhuman primates and humans thus far have described adaptive as well as innate immune-mediated xenograft injury. Understanding the mechanistic aspects of these responses at the cellular and molecular levels is critical to the development of targeted genetic modifications and innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing rejection and inducing tolerance. Moreover, the physiologic components of the bidirectional communication between the human host and pig xenograft must also be understood and manipulated. Here, we review the breakthroughs in kidney xenotransplantation in the past few decades and highlight the immunologic hurdles that have yet to be overcome.

### Kidney xenotransplantation [^36a810a8]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Xenotransplantation using pigs as donors offers the possibility of eliminating the chronic shortage of donor kidneys, but there are several obstacles to be overcome before this goal can be achieved. Preclinical studies have shown that, while porcine renal xenografts are broadly compatible physiologically, they provoke a complex rejection process involving preformed and elicited antibodies, heightened innate immune cell reactivity, dysregulated coagulation, and a strong T cell-mediated adaptive response. Furthermore, the susceptibility of the xenograft to proinflammatory and procoagulant stimuli is probably increased by cross-species molecular defects in regulatory pathways. To balance these disadvantages, xenotransplantation has at its disposal a unique tool to address particular rejection mechanisms and incompatibilities: genetic modification of the donor. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of porcine renal xenograft rejection, and on the significant genetic, pharmacological, and technical progress that has been made to prolong xenograft survival.

### Infectious diseases and clinical xenotransplantation [^b4575a2b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The risk for transmission of infection due to novel pathogens in association with xenotransplantation is unknown. Microbiological screening of source animals may reduce infectious risk; however, unknown porcine pathogens with capacity to infect humans may exist and are unlikely to be identified in the absence of clinical trials. The effect of the activation of PCMV in 1 cardiac recipient demonstrated the importance of herd screening for xenotransplants. Studies in deceased recipients of kidneys and hearts have provided information on metabolic and immunologic aspects (e.g. role of innate immunity), but they have reported limited immunosuppression and are of limited durations (< 2 months) and so are less informative regarding infectious risks. Infection control measures include storage of baseline blood samples from the xenograft donor, persons involved in procurement and transplantation of pig organs, and serial monitoring of the recipient and close contacts for known and possible unknown pathogens. Assays, including metagenomics, for potential pig pathogens need to be developed and validated. Transparency is essential in microbiologic investigations performed in clinical xenotransplantation trials.

### Porcine kidney xenotransplantation in patients with end-stage kidney disease… [^17a7f265]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Twenty patients with ESKD listed for kidney allotransplantation at UAB will be enrolled to receive either one or two porcine kidney xenotransplants from a 10-GE pig donor, contingent on the pig's overall size at the time of procurement. Recruitment and xenotransplantation will occur over a five-year time period. Patients will undergo follow-up of one year post-xenotransplant with study extension if graft survival exceeds one year. Participants will undergo prospective crossmatching with a 10-GE pig to determine histocompatibility prior to xenotransplant. After performance of a negative crossmatch, procurement of the donor pig will occur in a surgical suite at the designated pathogen-free facility near the UAB campus where the donor herd is maintained. Porcine kidney will be transported under sterile and hypothermic conditions to the main UAB hospital.

The porcine kidney will be transplanted into the research subject in standard surgical fashion within the abdomen and immunosuppression will be administered. The induction immunosuppression regimen utilized will mirror that used in human-to-human allotransplantation; this regimen represents current standard-of-care. After transplantation, kidney health will be assessed biochemically, histologically, and radiographically. Subjects will be monitored for potential zoonotic disease transmission and blood-based chimerism as well as thrombocytopenia or indicators of consumptive coagulopathy, development of anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody/alloantibody sensitization.
- Crossmatch compatible with porcine donor
- SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in accordance with most recent CDC guidance
- Willingness to obtain other standard-of-care vaccinations for kidney transplant recipients and for patients receiving eculizumab.
- History of psychiatric hospitalization
- Inability to provide informed consent
- Pre-emptive transplant
- Inability to comply with study protocols and procedures. Study Plan This section provides details of the study plan, including how the study is designed and what the study is measuring.

### Physiologic homeostasis in a living human after pig kidney xenotransplantation [^e42bb290]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Kidney allotransplantation remains the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease, yet donor shortages limit its availability. Xenotransplantation using genetically modified porcine kidneys offers a promising alternative. Here, we report key physiological observations from the first-in-human porcine kidney xenograft over a 51day postoperative follow-up period. The transplanted kidney maintained essential functions, including waste excretion, electrolyte regulation, and production of concentrated urine, while supporting blood pressure and sodium reabsorption despite reduced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Sodium retention required diuretic therapy, and mild hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia occurred in the setting of pre-existing hypoparathyroidism. Markedly increased urinary uric acid excretion led to hypouricemia without evidence of urate nephropathy. This case demonstrates the ability of a porcine kidney to sustain vital metabolic functions in a living human, while highlighting areas for further research. These findings provide a foundation for optimizing post-transplant care and advancing xenotransplantation as a solution to the critical organ shortage.

### Consistent survival in consecutive cases of life-supporting porcine kidney xenotransplantation using 10GE source pigs [^da72c50f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Xenotransplantation represents a possible solution to the organ shortage crisis and is an imminent clinical reality with long-term xenograft survival in pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) heart and kidney large animal models, and short-term success in recent human decedent and clinical studies. However, concerns remain about safe clinical translation of these results, given the inconsistency in published survival as well as key differences between preclinical procurement and immunosuppression and clinical standards-of-care. Notably, no studies of solid organ pig-to-NHP transplantation have achieved xenograft survival longer than one month without CD40/CD154 costimulatory blockade, which is not currently an FDA-approved immunosuppression strategy. We now present consistent survival in consecutive cases of pig-to-NHP kidney xenotransplantation, including long-term survival after > 3 hours of xenograft cold preservation time as well as long-term survival using FDA-approved immunosuppression. These data provide critical supporting evidence for the safety and feasibility of clinical kidney xenotransplantation. Moreover, long-term survival without CD40/CD154 costimulatory blockade may provide important insights for immunosuppression regimens to be considered for first-in-human clinical trials.

### Reshaping transplantation with AI, emerging technologies and xenotransplantation [^770a60f2]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Organ transplantation remains the sole definitive treatment for many forms of end-stage organ failure, yet donor organ shortages impose life-threatening delays for thousands of patients worldwide. Mechanical supports and dialysis provide only temporary respite, while lifelong immunosuppression poses additional risks-including infections, malignancies and considerable healthcare costs. Recent innovations hold promise for overcoming these barriers. Artificial intelligence tools increasingly guide organ allocation decisions by integrating clinical, demographic and immunological data. They also refine rejection monitoring, personalize immunosuppressive regimens and facilitate virtual patient simulations. Meanwhile, xenotransplantation has progressed through multi-gene editing of donor pigs and improved immunosuppressive protocols, edging closer to mitigating hyperacute rejection in kidney, heart and liver grafts. In parallel, regenerative medicine approaches-spanning stem cell therapies, three-dimensional organoids and three-dimensional bioprinting-are poised to create patient-specific tissues that reduce rejection and enhance graft longevity. Biomaterials and cell encapsulation further offer localized immunosuppression, potentially streamlining post-transplant care. Yet widespread clinical adoption requires rigorous validation, ethical frameworks and interdisciplinary collaboration. By combining artificial intelligence-guided diagnostics, innovative organ engineering and advanced immunotherapies, transplant medicine can progress toward a future in which organ scarcity is alleviated, patient outcomes are optimized and healthcare systems operate with greater efficiency.

### Physiologic considerations of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation [^8086d996]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The greatest challenge facing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients is the scarcity of transplantable organs. Advances in genetic engineering that mitigate xenogeneic immune responses have made transplantation across species a potentially viable solution to this unmet need. Preclinical studies and recent reports of pig-to-human decedent renal xenotransplantation signify that clinical trials are on the horizon. Here, we review the physiologic differences between porcine and human kidneys that could impede xenograft survival. Topics addressed include porcine renin and sodium handling, xenograft water handling, calcium, phosphate and acid-base balance, responses to porcine erythropoietin and xenograft growth.

Recent Findings

Studies in nonhuman primates (NHPs) have demonstrated that genetically modified pig kidneys can survive for an extended period when transplanted into baboons. In recent studies conducted by our group and others, hyperacute rejection did not occur in pig kidneys lacking the α1,3Gal epitope transplanted into brain-dead human recipients. These experimental trials did not study potential clinical abnormalities arising from idiosyncratic xenograft responses to human physiologic stimuli due to the brief duration of observation this model entails.

Summary

Progress in biotechnology is heralding an era of xenotransplantation. We highlight the physiologic considerations for xenogeneic grafts to succeed.

### Xenotransplantation of a porcine kidney for end-stage kidney disease [^0d4ff43d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Xenotransplantation offers a potential solution to the organ shortage crisis. A 62-year-old hemodialysis-dependent man with long-standing diabetes, advanced vasculopathy, and marked dialysis-access challenges received a gene-edited porcine kidney with 69 genomic edits, including deletion of three glycan antigens, inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses, and insertion of seven human transgenes. The xenograft functioned immediately. The patient's creatinine levels decreased promptly and progressively, and dialysis was no longer needed. After a T-cell-mediated rejection episode on day 8, intensified immunosuppression reversed rejection. Despite sustained kidney function, the patient died from unexpected, sudden cardiac causes on day 52; autopsy revealed severe coronary artery disease and ventricular scarring without evident xenograft rejection.

### Xenotransplantation: current status and a perspective on the future [^b4b1190d]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2007). Medium credibility.

Xenotransplantation using pigs as the transplant source has the potential to resolve the severe shortage of human organ donors. Although the development of relatively non-toxic immunosuppressive or tolerance-inducing regimens will be required to justify clinical trials using pig organs, recent advances in our understanding of the biology of xenograft rejection and zoonotic infections, and the generation of alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient pigs have moved this approach closer to clinical application. This Review highlights the major obstacles impeding the translation of xenotransplantation into clinical therapies and the potential solutions, providing a perspective on the future of clinical xenotransplantation.

### Consistent survival in consecutive cases of life-supporting porcine kidney xenotransplantation using 10GE source pigs [^20399539]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Xenotransplantation represents a promising solution to the donor organ shortage. The next steps toward broader clinical translation have been outlined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which recently issued guidance on a regulatory path forward for solid organ xenotransplantation. The regulatory framework provided by the FDA has brought increased scrutiny to the field with respect to the consistency of results, the method of organ procurement and preservation, and the use of non-FDA-approved medications in immunosuppression regimens.

Although the FDA has not yet approved clinical trials in kidney xenotransplantation, demonstration of consistent > 6 months survival in consecutive preclinical NHP experiments may be required. While there have been multiple examples of long-term survival in NHP studies, no published case series has shown consistent (> 50%) survival beyond 6 months in consecutive (> 3 recipients) experiments. In most studies, recipients who experience hyperacute xenograft rejection or early adverse outcomes due to technical complications are excluded. However, transparent demonstration of consecutive long-term survival, without exclusion of adverse outcomes, is critical to determining safety and efficacy as we consider xenografts in humans.

Additionally, no published studies have demonstrated long-term porcine kidney xenograft survival after significant cold ischemic time. This raises potential concerns about the feasibility of off-site procurement at a designated pathogen-free (DPF) facility, which will likely be required for clinical trials, as cold ischemic time will be incurred for the transport of the xenograft. While cold ischemic time is well-tolerated in allogeneic kidney transplantation, our recent study has demonstrated that standard-of-care static cold storage of five hours leads to hyperacute graft loss across xenogeneic barriers in pig-to-NHP kidney transplantation.

Finally, the prospect of clinical trials has also renewed debate about whether non-FDA-approved medications, particularly CD40/CD154 costimulatory blocking agents, are necessary. To date, no study has demonstrated long-term solid organ xenograft survival without CD40/CD154 blockade. On the other hand, clinicians have made remarkable progress preventing rejection of allografts transplanted across ABO / HLA incompatible barriers using calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based immunosuppression regimen without CD40/CD154 costimulation blockade. The gulf between effective immunosuppression regimens for human allotransplantation and NHP xenotransplantation experiences raises concerns for the clinical translation of preclinical NHP data.

### Progress in xenotransplantation: overcoming immune barriers [^032378b4]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

A major limitation of organ allotransplantation is the insufficient supply of donor organs. Consequently, thousands of patients die every year while waiting for a transplant. Progress in xenotransplantation that has permitted pig organ graft survivals of years in non-human primates has led to renewed excitement about the potential of this approach to alleviate the organ shortage. In 2022, the first pig-to-human heart transplant was performed on a compassionate use basis, and xenotransplantation experiments using pig kidneys in deceased human recipients provided encouraging data. Many advances in xenotransplantation have resulted from improvements in the ability to genetically modify pigs using CRISPR-Cas9 and other methodologies. Gene editing has the capacity to generate pig organs that more closely resemble those of humans and are hence more physiologically compatible and less prone to rejection. Despite such modifications, immune responses to xenografts remain powerful and multi-faceted, involving innate immune components that do not attack allografts. Thus, the induction of innate and adaptive immune tolerance to prevent rejection while preserving the capacity of the immune system to protect the recipient and the graft from infection is desirable to enable clinical xenotransplantation.

Discussion

The findings from this case series show that pig-to-human xenotransplant provided life-sustaining kidney function in a deceased human with CKD. Future research in living human recipients is necessary to determine long-term xenograft kidney function and whether xenografts could serve as a bridge or destination therapy for ESKD. Because our study represents a single case, generalizability of the findings is limited. This study showcases xenotransplant as a viable potential solution to an organ shortage crisis responsible for thousands of preventable deaths annually.

### Transplantation of decellularized porcine kidney grafts repopulated with primary human cells demonstrates filtration function in pigs [^81820be5]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is defined by reduced quality of life, premature mortality, and is a financial strain to the health care system. With the prevalence of ESRD projected to rise substantially (28–69%) through 2030, innovative and efficacious approaches to renal replacement therapy (RRT) are in desperate need. Kidney transplantation is the preferred curative therapy for ESRD resulting in decreased mortality and improved quality of life compared to dialysis. However, access to this treatment is limited by a chronic shortage of donor organs in addition to restrictive eligibility requirements. Whole-organ bioengineering has the potential to fulfill this unmet need by offering a virtually limitless supply of bioengineered kidney grafts. One approach to whole-organ bioengineering is perfusion decellularization and recellularization of whole organs. The decellularization process utilizes a porcine kidney and produces an acellular scaffold that retains the native extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and tissue microenvironments but lacks cellular and porcine infectious materials. This ECM provides a favorable environment for seeding human parenchymal cells and the native vascular networks critical to sustaining those parenchymal cells with nutrients and oxygen. The scaffolds are clinically sized for human transplant and can then be repopulated with organ-specific human cells using a perfusion-based bioreactor. Successful pre-clinical outcomes with decellularized porcine grafts recellularized with human cells have been demonstrated for transplanted liversand lungs.

### First clinical-grade porcine kidney xenotransplant using a human decedent model [^6162473a]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

A radical solution is needed for the organ supply crisis, and the domestic pig is a promising organ source. In preparation for a clinical trial of xenotransplantation, we developed an in vivo pre-clinical human model to test safety and feasibility tenets established in animal models. After performance of a novel, prospective compatible crossmatch, we performed bilateral native nephrectomies in a human brain-dead decedent and subsequently transplanted two kidneys from a pig genetically engineered for human xenotransplantation. The decedent was hemodynamically stable through reperfusion, and vascular integrity was maintained despite the exposure of the xenografts to human blood pressure. No hyperacute rejection was observed, and the kidneys remained viable until termination 74 h later. No chimerism or transmission of porcine retroviruses was detected. Longitudinal biopsies revealed thrombotic microangiopathy that did not progress in severity, without evidence of cellular rejection or deposition of antibody or complement proteins. Although the xenografts produced variable amounts of urine, creatinine clearance did not recover. Whether renal recovery was impacted by the milieu of brain death and/or microvascular injury remains unknown. In summary, our study suggests that major barriers to human xenotransplantation have been surmounted and identifies where new knowledge is needed to optimize xenotransplantation outcomes in humans.

Xenotransplantation could theoretically provide an unlimited supply of organs for patients living with end-stage kidney disease and other end-stage organ failure, but severe rejection and concerns about possible transmission of zoonotic infections remain important obstacles. In a recent study, investigators used CRISPR-cas9 to generate genetically modified pigs in which all endogenous retroviruses were inactivated. This approach may address one important barrier to the feasibility of clinical trials of xenotransplantation.

### Moral uncertainty and the farming of human-pig chimeras [^1f1b6fc7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

This leaves open the question of how confident we should be before setting out to use human-pig chimeras a source of transplantable organs. One way of unpacking this question would be to imagine that there is some probability X that the chimeric animals have cognitive capacities that are equal to cognitively normal humans, and that the wrongness of killing them would be equivalent to the killing of a child to harvest their organs. The question, then, is what value of X would be sufficiently low for generating chimeras to be acceptable?

Here is another thought experiment:

Low probability infant organ harvesting: It is 2060. The problem of shortage of kidneys for transplantation has been solved. Patients who have kidney failure have stem cells harvested. Those cells are then inoculated into a pig fetus. This is highly likely to generate a viable organ for transplantation, and research has been done that unequivocally shows that the chimeric pigs have no human neural tissue. However, in X% of cases, no viable pig organ is able to be generated. In such a situation, a human fetus is used instead. The human fetus is gestated in a surrogate, born alive and then euthanased at a few minutes of age.

### Xenotransplantation could either be a friend or foe of healthcare equity [^ccfff3ef]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A path to equitable xenotransplantation

The challenges of organ allocation do not have simple solutions. As long as there is a persistent disparity between the number of people on the waitlist and number of available organs, equity issues will be of foremost concern in relation to who, when, and how one receives an organ. Xenotransplantation is not a new technology, but the clinical application is still experimental. Xenotransplantation has the promise of providing more organs at a quicker pace, theoretically significantly increasing access to solid-organ transplantation in racial and ethnic minority groups who historically have had longer waiting times and higher waitlist dropout rates.

Despite the aforementioned advances in genetic pig engineering, several serious ethical considerations have been identified and were the focus of a 2023 American Transplant Congress session entitled, "Ethical Concerns in Pig to Human Xenotransplantation – ". These ethical considerations include animal rights concerns, public health and infectious disease risks, and questions regarding justice and equity in organ access and use of resources –. Not specifically addressed during this session were the implications of xenotransplantation in relation to transplant inequities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. It is not unreasonable to postulate that xenotransplantation could represent one strategy in addressing inequities in organ allocation. However, specifically targeting predominately racial and ethnic minorities for xenotransplantation at the potential risk of inequitable access to human donor transplant (the standard of care) would serve to create a new disparity in transplant care.

### The resurgence of xenotransplantation [^3b7a2c0d]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

There has been an upsurge of interest in xenotransplantation in recent years. This resurgence can attributed to a combination of factors. First, there has been a dramatic improvement in efficacy in several preclinical models, with maximum xenograft survival times increasing to 950 days for islets, 945 days for hearts, and 310 days for kidneys. Second, the rapid development of genome editing technology (particularly the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9) has revolutionized the capacity to generate new donor pigs with multiple protective genetic modifications; what once took many years to achieve can now be performed in months, with much greater precision and scope. Third, the specter of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) has receded significantly. There has been no evidence of PERV transmission in clinical trials and preclinical models, and improved screening methods and new options for the treatment or even elimination of PERV are now available. Balancing these positive developments are several remaining challenges, notably the heavy and often clinically inapplicable immunosuppression required to prevent xenograft rejection. Nonetheless, the potential for xenotransplantation as a solution to the shortage of human organs and tissues for transplantation continues to grow.

### Infectious diseases and clinical xenotransplantation [^e2d2fffa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Xenotransplantation, the implantation of vascularized organs or viable cells from nonhuman species into humans, is under development to address the shortage of human organs for transplantation. Clinical xenotransplantation from swine has become more practical through advances in molecular biology (e.g. CRISPR manipulations) that have enabled the breeding of swine with advantageous immunologic traits coupled with newer immunosuppressive regimens (Figure; Appendix Table 1). Recent porcine cardiac and renal transplants survived for about 2 months in hosts with multiple comorbid conditions and who were not candidates for allotransplantation. Decedent xenografts of hearts and kidneys have been used to demonstrate fundamental functions and immune responses of porcine xenografts in human hosts. Prior experience with xenogeneic (pig, bovine) heart valves, tendons, and skin have generally been fixed or sterilized tissues not carrying viable cells. Regulatory guidelines exist for the clinical use of genetically modified animals but incompletely address microbiologic standards. Experience in allotransplantation indicates that the risk for xenosis or xenozoonosis (transmission of infection from animals to humans from viable cells of organs or cellular transplantation) is determined by epidemiologic exposure of source animals and human recipients, the net state of immunosuppression, and the underlying factors contributing to infectious risk, including the type, intensity and duration of immunosuppression. In human allotransplantation, immunosuppression is largely standardized, the pattern of infections is predictable, and prophylactic regimens are standardized. Some infections are considered routine (human cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]); unexpected infections reflect excess immunosuppression, unusual exposures in the hospital or community, or donor organ–derived infections. Unexpected donor-derived infections are uncommon despite the urgency of screening, given time limitations for organ implantation. Data from microbiologic screening studies are often not available until after implantation.

### Clinical and molecular correlation defines activity of physiological pathways in life-sustaining kidney xenotransplantation [^b3d84afb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 8–16% of the population worldwide and often goes underappreciated until it progresses to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). ESKD patients with refractory symptoms require lifelong kidney replacement, either dialysis or transplantation. Dialysis extends life but dialysis patients have worse outcomes, poorer quality of life, and increased costs as compared to transplantation.

Transplantation provides a potentially curative therapy but demand for donor organs far exceeds current levels of donation. One approach to alleviating this organ shortage is xenotransplantation of porcine kidneys. Porcine kidneys are similar in size, shape, and function to human kidneys, are ethically acceptable and have been used for decades in preclinical non-human-primate (NHP) models of kidney xenotransplantation. The application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) has accelerated efforts to modify the porcine genome and facilitate xenotransplantation. In NHP recipients, gene-edited porcine donors have enabled survival of > 500 daysand multiple groups have now demonstrated lack of hyperacute rejection in recently deceased humans. Given this promising survival data, a new level of scrutiny is warranted and questions about which kidney functions a porcine donor organ can or cannot replace have become more relevant.

Filtration of nitrogenous waste products is a principal and necessary function of the kidney to sustain life. However, kidneys are complex and also participate extensively in various endocrine pathways. This study was designed to evaluate these secondary functions of kidney xenografts in a cohort of long-term surviving NHPs to anticipate complications and inform future clinical trials of porcine xenografts. Specific topics of interest included: (1) porcine xenograft growth, (2) porcine xenograft participation in NHP renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) signaling –, and (3) porcine xenograft maintenance of physiological levels of blood electrolytes by both tubular reabsorption and participation in the calcium-vitamin-D-parathyroid-hormone axis. Here we show minimal xenograft growth, lack of xenograft involvement in the RAAS pathway, and PTH-independent hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia after kidney xenotransplantation.

### Characterizing coagulation responses in humans and nonhuman primates following kidney xenotransplantation – A narrative review [^95838897]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSIONS

Cumulatively, the shortage of human kidneys has catalyzed the exploration of kidney xenotransplantation to address the dire need for transplantable organs and bypass blood type compatibility issues. Despite its promise, managing coagulation dysregulation remains a pivotal concern among high rates of antibody‐mediated rejection, physiological incompatibilities, acute cellular rejection, and the risk of infection between species. The complexity of coagulation, involving intricate interactions between various factors, is further complicated in the xenotransplantation context, particularly by abnormal pig vWF interactions, inefficient pig thrombomodulin, thrombotic microangiopathy, and consumptive coagulopathy. Innovative solutions, such as genetic engineering and the utility of adequate immunosuppressive and anticoagulant drugs, have shown promise in overcoming these hurdles but warrant further investigation.

### Current strategies on kidney regeneration using tissue engineering approaches: a systematic review [^ac112863]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ethical considerations

In recent years, tissue engineering has made significant progress, leading to its first clinical applications. However, there are emerging ethical concerns, particularly related to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the integration of animal scaffolds into humans, and the use of recellularized scaffolds from donors. A recently published systematic review have addressed these ethical challenges and highlighted the numerous obstacles to translating research from the laboratory to practical medical applications. The widespread use of animal organs for the development of acellular scaffolds and the conduction of xenotransplantation have raised numerous religious, cultural, moral, and technical conflicts. Studies have indicated that the use of computational and/or in-vitro models, whenever feasible, can significantly reduce the reliance on animal testing. In cases where animal models are unavoidable, it is recommended to use a single large animal instead of multiple small animals and to conduct all experiments on the same animal, with continuous monitoring of its well-being. Using human tissue and organs also raises similar ethical questions, emphasizing the importance of providing a completely detailed informed consent form to the patients, informing them about the process, further uses, storage of the tissue, and data privacy. Furthermore, patients who are about to receive the organ need a more detailed informed consent, including the advantages and possible risks, importance of long-term follow-up, and alternative treatments in case of transplant failure.

### Opportunities and challenges with the implementation of normothermic machine perfusion in kidney transplantation [^a1524199]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The importance of developing endpoints for the further development of NMP

NMP of kidney grafts can target several unmet needs. As with all innovations in health care, the path from an invention to clinical routine application is long and complex. The definition of a clinical trial path, of endpoints that are both acceptable to the regulating bodies, but also providing a robust indication, the size that makes it reasonable and economically sustainable to perform such a trial, the cost/benefit ratio on the market and many more aspects need to be met for the technology to be successful.

Learning from the evolution of NMP in other organs such as the liver, the pathway towards approval of preservation devices is depending on the temperature at which organs are preserved. While hypothermic preservation devices are class II medical devices (considered moderate risk classification for regulatory approval), normothermic preservation devices, typically used with blood-based preservation solutions, are mostly qualified as class IIb (higher risk within class II, often requiring more detailed evaluations) or III (high risk devices, requires Premarket Approval (PMA), with extensive safety and efficacy testing prior to clinical use). This categorization largely determines the path towards clinical development. The second key determination is the establishment of an indication for use. For currently existing NMP devices, the safety as displayed by a CE mark have been established, but no pivotal trials and hence no indications for its use have been developed. A careful determination of the indication for use, the development of a safe and effective preservation device and perfusion recipe and clarification of logistics together with a robust cost/benefit ratio are the critical factors for success of kidney NMP. Minimizing the cold ischemic injury preservation time is an important objective for the development of NMP. A porcine model showed that protective effects of NMP corresponded with the achieved reduction in cold storage time. DCD grafts not exposed to cold storge but preserved with NMP over a prolonged period had excellent outcomes, comparable to porcine living donor kidney transplantation. Prolonged NMP could exhibit additional benefits: kidney transplantation would eventually be transformed into a semi-elective daytime procedure. In addition, portable NMP devices could allow to shorten or eliminate cold storage times, extend total preservation times and hence enable organ sharing over longer distances. This would be particularly meaningful in the context of hard-to place kidneys where the search for a recipient could be extended without adding cold storage time. The time added to the process would also be beneficial for "hard to transplant patients" such as patients with high panel reactive antibodies. Due to their immunological profile, the pool of donor kidneys that are immunologically compatible with the recipient is much smaller. Hence the travel time for kidneys would often be longer. Also, pretreatment of the recipient through e.g. immunoadsorption could be become possible with NMP. A corresponding measurable endpoint would be the waiting time for hard-to-transplant patients and the utilization rate of hard to place (HTP) kidneys. Such a concept is currently being tested by 34 Lives. In a first clinical trial, HTP kidneys are machine perfused at their center and then shipped to a recipient site after testing and advanced matching (Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06263023). With a similar intention, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network supports a protocol for "accelerated placement of hard-to-place kidneys". In this study, participating centers will offer kidneys with a kidney donor profile index of 75% and higher (indicating that kidneys are of sub-optimal quality), to high priority kidney transplant candidates.

### Design and testing of a humanized porcine donor for xenotransplantation [^eaa77172]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Recent human decedent model studies 1,2 and compassionate xenograft use 3 have explored the promise of porcine organs for human transplantation. To proceed to human studies, a clinically ready porcine donor must be engineered and its xenograft successfully tested in nonhuman primates. Here we describe the design, creation and long-term life-supporting function of kidney grafts from a genetically engineered porcine donor transplanted into a cynomolgus monkey model. The porcine donor was engineered to carry 69 genomic edits, eliminating glycan antigens, overexpressing human transgenes and inactivating porcine endogenous retroviruses. In vitro functional analyses showed that the edited kidney endothelial cells modulated inflammation to an extent that was indistinguishable from that of human endothelial cells, suggesting that these edited cells acquired a high level of human immune compatibility. When transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys, the kidneys with three glycan antigen knockouts alone experienced poor graft survival, whereas those with glycan antigen knockouts and human transgene expression demonstrated significantly longer survival time, suggesting the benefit of human transgene expression in vivo. These results show that preclinical studies of renal xenotransplantation could be successfully conducted in nonhuman primates and bring us closer to clinical trials of genetically engineered porcine renal grafts.

### Spatiotemporal immune atlas of a clinical-grade gene-edited pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant [^696a14e3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Xenotransplantation is a promising conceptual solution to the organ shortage but has been previously limited in its clinical application by significant immunologic barriers between donor and recipient species. However, recent studies suggest that hyperacute rejection due to preformed antibody in humans can be overcome by the humanization of porcine kidneys through specific gene edits, and achievement of this milestone has renewed hope that xenotransplantation may advance to clinical trials soon –. Nevertheless, key questions remain surrounding immunosuppression in human recipients before first-in-human trials can be safely undertaken. Although prior work in NHP models of xenotransplantation has provided important insights into drug regimens which might attenuate immune responses to xenografts, the generalizability of these findings from NHP recipients to humans is limited by the inability to perform crossmatch compatible xenotransplantation in NHPs, which necessitates the use of intensive immunosuppressive regimens that are associated with high mortality rates. There is thus a need for immune investigations in crossmatch-compatible recipients of porcine xenografts both to characterize immune responses to immunosuppressive agents in the setting of xenotransplantation as well as to determine tolerability in the human setting. Ideally, these studies would be performed in a model system where human immune responses to a gene-edited humanized kidney xenograft can be studied in vivo prior to the transplantation of living recipients. Herein, we addressed this knowledge gap by studying the human immune response to a gene-edited porcine kidney xenograft using a brain-dead human decedent model. Notably, we treated the human decedent xenograft recipient with a clinically utilized immunosuppression regimen to determine whether a regimen with a well-established safety and efficacy profile used in allotransplantation might be extended to the xenotransplantation setting.

### Characterizing coagulation responses in humans and nonhuman primates following kidney xenotransplantation – A narrative review [^c31235e0]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

The recent report of the first pig kidney transplant in a living human brings hope to thousands of people with end-stage kidney failure. The scientific community views this early success with caution as kidney xenotransplantation exhibits many challenges and barriers. One of these is coagulation dysregulation. This includes (i) pig von Willebrand Factor (vWF) interaction with human platelets, which can induce abnormal clotting responses, heightening the risk of graft failure, (ii) the inefficiency of pig thrombomodulin in activating human protein C, which emphasizes the species-specific variations that aggravate coagulation challenges, and (iii) the development of thrombotic microangiopathy in the pig grafts and the occurrence of systemic consumptive coagulopathy in the recipients. Indeed, coagulation dysregulation largely results from differences in endothelial cell response and incompatibilities between pig and human coagulation-anticoagulation pathways. These barriers can be resolved by modifications to pig vWF and the expression of human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptors in pig cells, serving as strategic interventions to align the coagulation systems of the two species more closely. These coagulation challenges have clinical implications in how they affect graft survival and patient outcome. Genetic engineering of the organ-source pig and the administration of various drugs have assisted in correcting this coagulation dysregulation. Hence, comprehending and controlling coagulation dysregulation is crucial for progress in xenotransplantation as a viable option for treating patients with terminal kidney disease.

### Islet xenotransplantation: are we really ready for clinical trials? [^2e1bbcc3]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Four clinical trials of porcine islet transplantation have been reported, and there are verbal reports that clinical trials on much larger scales are continuing in centers in China and Russia. The four reported trials are briefly reviewed and, in the light of the present status of experimental islet xenotransplantation, consideration is given to whether such trials are currently justified. The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association has (1) emphasized the need for encouraging studies in non-human primates before clinical trials should be undertaken, (2) mandatory monitoring for the transfer of porcine microorganisms, and (3) careful regulation and oversight by recognized bodies. Other aspects of the topic, such as the need for informed consent, are briefly discussed. We conclude that, at the present time, more data documenting convincing efficacy, focused on clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimens, are needed to justify the initiation of closely monitored clinical trials. A clinical trial may then be justified even though the potential risk to the patients, and possibly for society, will not be zero.

### The time has come: the case for initiating pilot clinical trials of pig kidney xenotransplantation [^0c2f8379]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Representative Immunosuppressive Regimen Used in the TKO Pig-to-NHP Model in the Authors' Laboratories(K. Kinoshita et al, unpublished)

The function of pig kidneys in NHPs has been demonstrated to be sufficient to maintain health – although, in baboons, when both native kidneys have been removed, dehydration and hypovolemia often occur, requiring increased fluid administration. This has been hypothesized to be related to incompletely characterized incompatibilities between species in the function of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Importantly, dehydration does not develop when one native baboon kidney (with the ureter ligated) remains in situ (K. Kinoshita et al, unpublished). Satisfactory pig kidney function is illustrated by the fact that numerous NHPs supported by a single pig kidney have remained healthy for > 1 year, – with one even surviving for almost 4 years. The problem of the rapid growth of the pig kidney after transplantation has been largely overcome either by (1) the use of miniature swine as sources of the organs, or by (2) growth hormone receptor-knockout in the pig.

In summary, TKO pig kidneys, with or without additional transgenes, provide life-supporting renal function in a substantial minority of NHPs for > 1 year, and in vitro data predict that these kidneys are likely to fare better in human recipients Furthermore, clinical pig xenotransplantation offers several advantages relative to preclinical studies in cage-housed NHPs: (1) the patient will be able to communicate and cooperate with his/her caregivers in ways that NHPs cannot, (2) patients can be prescreened and treated for common latent infections, eg, cytomegalovirus (CMV), for which effective prophylactic regimens do not exist in NHPs, and (3) the modern hospital environment enables sophisticated diagnostic modalities (eg, invasive monitoring, imaging), therapeutic interventions (eg, dialysis, plasmapheresis), and intensive care that are not readily available in an animal laboratory. We predict that, for immunological, microbiological, and logistical reasons, human recipients should do significantly better after pig kidney transplantation than NHPs.

Specifically, preclinical data suggest that gene-edited pig kidney transplants in carefully selected, cross-match-negative human patients immunosuppressed with a CD40/CD154 co-stimulation pathway blockade-based regimen would likely function for a year or longer. To test this prediction, the question is which patients might first be offered xenotransplantation in an exploratory pilot clinical trial?

### Clinical islet xenotransplantation: how close are we? [^9c2e2a13]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a major health problem throughout the world. In the U.S. it is estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from T1D. Even when well controlled — by frequent monitoring of blood glucose and administration of insulin, the long-term complications of the disease are significant and include cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Here we review recent progress in preclinical models of pig islet xenotransplantation and discuss the remaining challenges that need to be addressed before the application of this form of therapy can be established in patients with T1D.

During the past decade, islet allotransplantation alone (without previous kidney transplantation) using deceased human donor pancreata has been indicated mainly in patients who have had T1D for > 5 years with life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes and wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Although the initial long-term results were rather disappointing, the results of islet allotransplantation have improved significantly in recent years, with 5-year insulin-independent normoglycemia achieved in > 50% of patients at experienced centers. There is increasing evidence that successful islet allotransplantation greatly reduces the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes and reduces or slows the incidence of late complications of T1D. This may extend the indications for islet transplantation to patients with progressive complications. For example, islet transplantation in a patient with preterminal renal failure may prevent disease progression, possibly avoiding the need for hemodialysis and kidney transplantation, provided that nonnephrotoxic immunosuppressive drug therapy is administered.

Currently, in the U.S. the median waiting time for a kidney allograft from a deceased human donor is > 4 years. However, islets from two deceased human donor pancreata are frequently required to achieve normoglycemia in a diabetic patient. Because of the limited number of suitable deceased donor pancreata, the overall number of treated patients is small, with fewer than 1,000 procedures carried out in Western countries during the past 10 years. It is likely that the demand for this procedure will increase, resulting in a growing need for new sources of islets for transplantation. Although there is a prospect that this need can be filled by islets from pigs (Sus scrofa), it is unlikely that nonhuman primates (NHPs) will be used for this purpose because there are significant concerns associated with ethics, logistics, and, potentially, safety.

### Reappraisal of biosafety risks posed by PERVs in xenotransplantation [^7af70fbc]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Donor materials of porcine origin could potentially provide an alternative source of cells, tissues or whole organs for transplantation to humans, but is hampered by the health risk posed by infection with porcine viruses. Although pigs can be bred in such a way that all known exogenous microorganisms are eliminated, this is not feasible for all endogenous pathogens, such as the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which are present in the germline of pigs as proviruses. Upon transplantation, PERV proviruses would be transferred to the human recipient along with the xenograft. If xenotransplantation stimulates or facilitates replication of PERVs in the new hosts, a risk exists for adaptation of the virus to humans and subsequent spread of these viruses. In a worst-case scenario, this might result in the emergence of a new viral disease. Although the concerns for disease potential of PERVs are easing, only limited pre-clinical and clinical data are available. Small-scale, well-designed and carefully controlled clinical trials would provide more evidence on the safety of this approach and allow a better appreciation of the risks involved. It is therefore important to have a framework of protective measures and monitoring protocols in place to facilitate such initially small scale clinical trials. This framework will raise ethical and social considerations regarding acceptability.

### Xenotransplantation in transition [^8e3d886c]. Human Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The application of xenotransplantation of porcine organs and tissues for treatment of disease, sought for more than a century, might soon be realized. Until now, the immune response of recipients against xenogeneic organs and tissues posed the main obstacle to clinical application. However, decades of research into this immune response and identification of other molecular barriers together with advances in genetic engineering and cloning of large animals and immune therapeutics coalesced to support prolonged survival and function of porcine organ grafts in nonhuman primates. This experimental progress in turn sparks consideration of clinical trials. The papers in this special section provide authoritative views concerning the immune hurdles that still limit and potentially still preclude clinical application of xenotransplantation. Xenoreactive antibodies elicited in T cell-dependent B cell-responses constitute the most important hurdle and control of these responses impels use of intense regimens of immunosuppression. These antibodies pose a danger to xenografts and potentially compromise subsequent allografts. However, new insights into the specificity of these antibodies, the pathways and kinetics of production and genetic determinants of pathogenicity offer novel opportunities for intervention. Likewise, the rapid ability to propose and test new strategies in nonhuman primate models hastens needed advances. However further progress will depend on development and validation of laboratory methods for identification and assay of pathogenic immune responses and evaluation of the response to therapy.

### The promise of xenotransplantation: a challenge [^1f666f15]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

According to many scholars, kidney xenotransplantation promises to mitigate the organ supply shortage. This claim has a certain obviousness to it: by flooding the market with a new source of kidneys, xenotransplantation promises to be a panacea. Our goal is to challenge this claim. We argue that xenotransplantation may increase rather than decrease demand for kidneys, may reduce kidney allotransplants, and may be inaccessible or otherwise unused. By offering the challenge, we hope to show deeper reflection is needed on how xenotransplantation will affect the dearth of available organs.

### Design and testing of a humanized porcine donor for xenotransplantation [^9961de1f]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Xenotransplantation may offer a transformative solution to the worldwide organ shortage crisis –. To proceed to clinical studies, a clinically ready porcine donor must be engineered and its xenograft successfully tested in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model to assess its safety and efficacy.

Over the years, various genetically engineered porcine donors have been created and their kidneys transplanted into Old World monkeys (OWMs) –. Although these donors contributed to our understanding of molecular incompatibilities in xenotransplantation, they are not clinically ready. First, the donors were often created on a commercial pig breed whose heart and kidney sizes are too large for human application. Although elimination of growth hormone receptor gene expression could reduce organ sizes, it comes with other undesired biological consequences. Second, the donors were designed for testing in OWMs. They lacked the α-Gal (galactose-α-1,3-galactose) or the α-Gal and Sd(a) (Sia-α2.3-[GalNAc-β1.4]Gal-β1.4-GlcNAc) glycans but expressed the Neu5Gc (N -glycolylneuraminic acid) glycan to match with Neu5Gc expression in OWMs. However, in vitro analysis suggests that a human-compatible porcine donor should ideally have all three glycans eliminated to match with the absence of the three glycans in humans. Although renal grafts derived from the porcine donors lacking these three glycans and carrying various human transgenes have been tested in OWMs, graft survival was shortor not all human transgenes were expressed. Third, the donors carried porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) sequences in their genome, which present a zoonotic risk, as PERV transmission to human cells in culture and their integration into the human genome have been demonstrated.

Here we created a humanized porcine donor on the Yucatan miniature pig breed and transplanted porcine renal grafts lacking the three glycans with or without PERV knockout (retroviral inactivation (RI)) (referred to as 3KO.RI or 3KO), or 3KO with seven human transgenes with or without RI (referred to as 3KO.7TG.RI or 3KO.7TG, respectively) into cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). We show that a humanized porcine renal graft, combined with a clinically relevant immunosuppressive regimen, supported long-term NHP survival for up to 2 years (758 days).

### Potential strategies in porcine liver xenotransplantation: a bridge to allotransplantation and beyond [^e4f4a767]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Advances in both gene editing of organ-source pigs and novel immunosuppressive therapies have substantially propelled the field of heart and kidney xenotransplantation forward, and have helped in overcoming challenges associated with porcine liver transplantation. In this review, the recent experience with porcine liver xenotransplantation in China for both decedents and living patients is discussed. We suggest that porcine liver xenografts play a much greater role in the management of patients with hepatic failure awaiting or following liver allotransplantation. Additionally, we propose that brain-dead human subjects (decedents) be used to validate the efficacy of porcine livers in supporting split or marginal human liver grafts. These developments are expected to lay the groundwork for clinical trials aimed at improving the outcomes of patients with end-stage liver disease, potentially expanding the pool of transplantable organs and providing new therapeutic options for these patients.

### Paediatric xenotransplantation clinical trials and the right to withdraw [^2fd6cf08]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials of xenotransplantation (XTx) may begin early in the next decade, with kidneys from genetically modified pigs transplanted into adult humans. If successful, transplanting pig hearts into children with advanced heart failure may be the next step. Typically, clinical trials have a specified end date, and participants are aware of the amount of time they will be in the study. This is not so with XTx. The current ethical consensus is that XTx recipients must consent to lifelong monitoring. While this presents challenges to the right to withdraw in the adult population, additional and unanswered questions also linger in the paediatric population. In paediatric XTx, parents or guardians consent not only to the initial treatment of the child but also to lifelong monitoring, thus making a decision whose consequences will remain present as the child develops the capacity for assent, and finally the capacity for informed consent or refusal. This article presents and evaluates unanswered paediatric ethical questions in regard to the right to withdraw from XTx follow-up in the paediatric population.

### Autologous transplantation of ischemically injured kidneys in pigs [^7ac8508c]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Expansion of the organ donor pool can be obtained through novel interventions attenuating ischemic acute kidney injury, which will enable the use of kidneys that suffered prolonged ischemia. In basic science, new therapeutic targets are identified that should be tested in a relevant large animal model before use in human kidney transplantation.

Materials and Methods

The current paper provides a detailed description of the technique of autologous transplantation of ischemically injured kidneys in pigs with special emphasis on perioperative care.

Results

The animal model was validated by showing that renal function after transplantation was proportional to the duration of warm ischemia before organ recovery. The extent of renal dysfunction was reproducible following kidney transplantations with the same warm ischemia time.

Conclusions

Our experience may reduce the learning curves of other research groups taking an interest in the model and improve preclinical testing of novel interventions that modulate renal ischemia and reperfusion injury in kidney transplantation.

### Physiological aspects of pig-to-primate renal xenotransplantation [^5c631674]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Few data exist on the physiological aspects of pig-to-primate renal xenotransplantation.

Methods

Use of organs transgenic for human decay accelerating factor has allowed assessment of the metabolic and hormonal functions of these xenografts.

Results

Porcine renal xenografts largely maintain plasma electrolyte homeostasis. An increase in proteinuria was detected that may result from graft injury. In contrast to allotransplantation a severe anaemia developed requiring recipient treatment with exogenous human erythropoietin.

Conclusions

Our experience provides qualified encouragement for the likely physiological compatibility of pig and primate species, but identifies areas where a xenograft may not match the performance of an allograft.

### Bone marrow and kidney transplant for patients with chronic kidney disease and blood disorders (BMT) [^b161e942]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

The main purpose of this study is to examine the outcome of a combined bone marrow and kidney transplant from a partially matched related donor. This is a pilot study, you are being asked to participate because you have a blood disorder and kidney disease. The aim of the combined transplant is to treat both your underlying blood disorder and kidney disease. We expect to have about 10 people participate in this study. Additionally, because the same person who is donating the kidney will also be donating the bone marrow, there may be a smaller chance of kidney rejection and less need for long-term use of anti-rejection drugs.

### Consistent survival in consecutive cases of life-supporting porcine kidney xenotransplantation using 10GE source pigs [^85e838ef]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

There has been enormous progress in the field of xenotransplantation over the last twenty years, with recent reports of life-supporting pig-to-NHP heart and kidney xenografts enabling survivals of > 6 months. However, there are three major concerns with these data as we approach clinical trials in solid organ xenotransplantation: 1) reports of long-term survivals have been restricted to a small number of recipients, with nearly half of recipients in recent landmark studies rejecting their grafts within the first month after transplantation; 2) procurements and ischemic times are not reflective of the clinical and regulatory realities that will govern clinical trials; and 3) CD40/CD154 costimulatory blockade, which is not currently FDA-approved, has been used in each of these cases. This study is the first of its kind to report durable 220-day (mean) and 261-day (median) survival in a series of six consecutive NHP xenotransplants, procured at a DPF facility and transported with FDA-approved preservation technologies and includes the first demonstration of long-term solid organ xenograft survival without CD40/CD154 blocking agents.

There are a number of reasons for the small sample size in most studies, including the high cost of pig-to-NHP experiments and the limited availability of genetically modified source pigs and NHPs. More concerning is the relatively high rate of early graft loss due to hyperacute rejection, accelerated antibody-mediated rejection, or early death from infection. Hyperacute rejection, which once plagued early attempts at pig-to-NHP transplantation in the era before genetically modified source pigs, still impacts early graft survival; yet, there are no established criteria to guide recipient selection. In a recent published report, Anand and colleagues attribute variable survival to differences between NHPs and humans, as porcine genetic modifications (particularly CMAH inactivation) have been designed for human recipients. While we agree that disparities between recipient species may account for variable immunologic responses to porcine xenografts, we believe that it is critical to validate predictive immunologic screening strategies in the preclinical setting prior to clinical translation.

### Consistent survival in consecutive cases of life-supporting porcine kidney xenotransplantation using 10GE source pigs [^4745c813]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While three to five months have regularly been used as pre-determined endpoints in large animal models of transplantation –, due in part to the challenges inherent to the complex medical management of large animals, survivals have been open-ended in xenotransplantation to allow for greater follow-up. All five low-risk recipients in this study survived beyond the five-month threshold that has recently been used to support the translation of experimental immunosuppressive reagents from preclinical to clinical trials in transplantation –. With enhanced follow-up in this study, we found that two recipients ultimately rejected their grafts: one recipient (B3520) on POD278 with evidence of AMR and another recipient (B0820) on POD285 with evidence of acute cellular rejection. Three recipients lost grafts suddenly after symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and were found on necropsy to have histologic evidence of adenovirus nephropathy. Although the primary focus of zoonosis in xenotransplantation has been on the potential transmission of infection from xenograft to host, zoonosis is bi-directional, and transmission of host infections (including human adenovirus, which has long been understood to infect pig cells,) may also contribute to early graft loss.

Effective xenograft procurement and tolerance of cold preservation time are also critically important for the success of clinical trials. FDA regulations mandate that procurements must occur in a DPF animal facility, and this will require a period of ischemic time as these porcine organs are transported to the recipient transplant center. To our knowledge, no prior studies have described long-term xenograft survival after prolonged (> 3 hours) cold preservation time; in fact, we have previously shown that five hours of static cold storage may precipitate hyperacute graft loss in pig-to-NHP kidney xenotransplantation. In light of these results, we used two FDA-approved devices to evaluate hypothermic machine perfusion during transportation. We are actively investigating the mechanisms of ischemic reperfusion injury associated with static cold storage, and the mechanisms underlying the apparent protective effect of hypothermic machine perfusion.

### A cell-free nutrient-supplemented perfusate allows four-day ex vivo metabolic preservation of human kidneys [^05dec73f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The question whether these kidneys can be transplanted naturally arises, to provide definitive evidence of their suitability for transplantation. Unfortunately, conducting such an experiment is at this stage unfeasible. The human kidneys utilized in our study were formally discarded and are ineligible for transplantation under Eurotransplant regulations. While one could argue that porcine kidney auto-transplantation could serve as substitute, our own investigation into this area showed profound differences in perfusion dynamics between porcine and human kidneys (Supplementary Fig. 6). Because of these differences, we are of the opinion that the outcomes of porcine auto-transplantation following multi-day sNMP will not accurately predict the outcomes of human kidney transplantation. We believe that our current assessment of metabolic and functional preservation of human kidneys following multi-day sNMP lays the groundwork for further exploration of clinical application in transplantation medicine. One option is to follow the legal and ethical framework that has been developed to assess xenograft kidney donor organs that were transplanted in brain death recipients, to assesses function after 4-day sNMP. Alternatively, a step-wise approach may be of interest, starting with relatively short periods and extending perfusion time once safety in small cohorts of recipients has been demonstrated after transplantation. The latter approach is currently being employed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of normothermic kidney perfusion (ISRCTN13292277 and NCT04693325).

In conclusion, our study showcases that using a cell-free nutrient-supplemented perfusate enables extended ex vivo preservation of metabolically active kidneys. By preserving kidneys in a metabolically active state for days rather than hours, we open possibilities for further advancements in transplantation. Existing protocols already direct donor organs through specialized facilities known as Organ Perfusion and Regeneration-units for assessment and potential pre-treatment using short periods of (cold) machine perfusion. Remarkable breakthroughs in liver preservation highlight the vast potential for prolonged graft preservation, such as the successful transplantation of previously discarded livers, transplantation after 3-day ex vivo preservation, immunomodulation during machine perfusion, and even bile duct regeneration through cholangiocyte organoid transplantation. These advances underscore the transformative impact of prolonged organ preservation and demonstrate the game-changing potential in the field of transplantation.

### The time has come: the case for initiating pilot clinical trials of pig kidney xenotransplantation [^f892d269]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In the past 2 years, 2 clinical pig heart transplants were conducted on a "compassionate" basis in patients with end-stage heart failure for whom no alternative therapy was considered possible. These transplants involved hearts from pigs genetically engineered to lack expression of the 3 major glycan xenogeneic antigens against which humans have natural (preformed) antibodies (Table 1) and incorporating multiple human "protective" transgenes. Both patients lived for several weeks but died, most likely from antibody-mediated rejection, although this awaits confirmation in the second patient. The survival of life-supporting pig hearts in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has been limited, with, to our knowledge, no recipient surviving for > 9 months. – Failure to thrive, respiratory illness, primate viral infections, graft hypertrophy, and/or immunologic injury (such as antibody-mediated rejection), to which the demise of long-surviving NHP orthotopic heart recipients was ascribed, are difficult to manage in the preclinical laboratory, but likely could be more accurately evaluated and treated in patients.

TABLE 1
Known Carbohydrate Xenoantigens Expressed on Pig Cells –

In contrast, the results of the transplantation of gene-edited life-supporting pig kidneys in NHPs have improved considerably within the past few years, with an increasing number of recipients surviving for longer than a year. – These advances are associated with the introduction of (1) improved gene-edited pigs as sources of kidneys, and (2) novel agents that block the CD40/CD154 T cell co-stimulation pathway.

Of particular importance has been the introduction of pigs in which expression of 3 known glycan antigens has been deleted by gene-editing — "triple-knockout (TKO) pigs" (Table 1). Some groups believe that organs from TKO pigs alone will be sufficiently resistant to the human immune response and that no additional gene edits are required. However, there is considerable evidence that the introduction into the TKO pig of human "protective" genes, eg, for complement- and coagulation-regulatory proteins, will provide added protection. We, therefore, advocate that TKO pigs with multiple human transgenes are preferred as sources of organs for clinical trials.

### Characterizing coagulation responses in humans and nonhuman primates following kidney xenotransplantation – A narrative review [^5af46880]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Therefore, understanding and managing coagulation dysregulation is essential for advancing xenotransplantation as a sustainable treatment for end‐stage kidney disease. The human or NHP response to a pig kidney graft is complex, involving immune and inflammatory responses (neither of which will be reviewed in detail here), and physiological incompatibilities, including coagulation dysfunction.

During the preparation of this review, the first pig kidney transplant in a 62‐year‐old Richard Slayman and a second in 54‐year‐old Lisa Pisano were announced. Although the former has since passed away and the latter has had the pig kidney removed, and has also passed away, their sacrifices for the medical community enable better understanding of the complex pathologies behind the unsuccessful attempts and remain a promise to thousands of patients with end‐stage kidney disease across the globe. This review will provide a timely update on the current knowledge and challenges associated with coagulation dysregulation while we continue to watch with optimism the success of the first trial.

### Cardiac xenotransplantation: challenges, evolution, and advances [^99dbdc24]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Selecting pigs as donors for human XTx

A lot of effort has been put into overcoming the immunologic barriers for transplantation between different species, but only a few studies have addressed whether porcine organs would function adequately in human hosts from a physiological perspective. Some of the main reasons why pigs were chosen as better organ donors than primates for human XTx were their organ size; similar anatomy, structure, and physiology to humans; and shorter gestational periods with larger litter sizes of 5 to 10 offspring. Additionally, pigs rapidly grow to their adult size, reaching sexual maturity at 5 months, enabling more rapid genetic engineering compared with primates. With respect to their similarities with human tissues and organs, they do have comparable hearts and circulatory system but also kidneys, lungs, liver, pancreas, and skin. As the research in XTx progresses and porcine xenograft survival in NHPs and humans is extended, there are hemodynamic and physiological dissimilarities that will likely be uncovered. As an example, which complicates thoracic xenografts, the blood pressure difference between pigs and primates leads to detrimental xenograft overgrowth. Not only blood pressure but also body temperature differs between pigs and humans, and a decrease of 2°C could potentially induce metabolic derangements in porcine xenografts once transplanted into humans. Another important dissimilarity that has been uncovered with the use of porcine kidney xenografts is the demonstration of less effective heterologous renin to elicit the release of angiotensin compared with homologous human renin, which may have direct consequences on the cardiovascular system. Additionally, serum cholesterol in humans is 3 times higher than what is seen in pigs, which could potentially increase the risk for cardiac graft vasculopathy in the xenograft. Other uncertainties include whether the genetically engineered porcine heart will adapt to cardiometabolic stress during effort and exercise and whether change of blood flow orientation to the lungs from a horizontal to an upright position matters, which might alter quality-of-life gains in humans. Meeting the physiological demands of recipients with transplanted heart xenografts that will function cooperatively with other organs is central to the success of clinical XTx application, and genetic manipulation using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique might be one solution to overcoming such physiological barriers. It is unknown whether other physiological differences between pigs and humans could lead to organ incompatibility.

### Spatiotemporal immune atlas of a clinical-grade gene-edited pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant [^864503b7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this work, we use single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches to investigate the human immune response to a genetically modified pig kidney. Given that safe and effective immunosuppression regimens for compatible pig-to-human xenotransplant recipients are thus difficult to define in incompatible animal models, we develop a preclinical model of pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation to study human immune responses in the porcine kidney after crossmatch-compatible xenotransplantation. Using this model system, we further test the hypothesis that conventional immunosuppression used in allotransplantation would prevent the infiltration and expansion of human immune cells in the xenograft. Using transcriptomics approaches that could discriminate porcine from human cells in serial xenograft biopsy samples, we find that human myeloid cells infiltrated the xenograft cortex in limited numbers three days after transplantation and express an anti-inflammatory gene signature. Meanwhile, human adaptive immune cells are virtually undetectable in the porcine xenograft. Altogether, our study suggests that conventional immunosuppression may effectively control early human immune responses to a porcine kidney xenograft and helps address critical knowledge gaps surrounding the safety and efficacy of immunosuppression regimens in human xenotransplantation.

### Porcine endogenous retroviruses in xenotransplantation [^88aad2b9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs is under development to alleviate the shortage of human donor organs. Meanwhile, remarkably long survival times of pig organs in non-human primates have been reported, as well as the functionality of pig kidneys and hearts in brain-dead humans. Most importantly, two transplantations of pig hearts in patients were performed with survival times of the patients of 8 and 6 weeks. Xenotransplantation may be associated with the transmission of porcine microorganisms including viruses to the recipient. Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are integrated in the genome of all pigs and cannot be eliminated like other viruses can. PERVs are able to infect certain human cells and therefore pose a risk for xenotransplantation. It is well known that retroviruses are able to induce tumors and immunodeficiencies. However, until now, PERVs were not transmitted in all infection experiments using small animals and non-human primates, in all preclinical xenotransplantation trials in non-human primates and in all clinical trials in humans. In addition, several strategies including antiretrovirals, PERV-specific small interfering RNA, vaccines and genome editing using CRISPR/Cas have been developed to prevent PERV transmission.

### Hypothermic machine perfusion prevents hyperacute graft loss in pig-to-primate kidney xenotransplantation after 5-hours of cold ischemia [^821993d5]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that clinically relevant CIT with routine SCS poses a risk for hyperacute graft loss in a pig-to-NHP kidney xenotransplantation model. Clinically relevant CIT (5 h) with SCS uniformly led to hyperacute graft loss after transplantation across xenogeneic barriers; in contrast, kidney xenografts transplanted without CIT in immunologically matched donor-recipient pairs did not result in hyperacute graft loss, and porcine kidney allografts transplanted with clinically relevant CIT and preserved with SCS did not result in hyperacute graft loss.

Existing data in transplantation across xenogeneic barriers indicate that mode of preservation may play a key role: Langin et al. demonstrated that non-ischemic preservation with continuous perfusion was essential for successful orthotopic cardiac xenotransplantation. Additionally, recent multi-omic data from two pig-to-human decedent cardiac xenotransplantation at New York University revealed evidence of ischemia reperfusion injury in one of two xenografts. However, no studies to date have investigated the impact of HMP on graft outcomes in kidney xenotransplantation.

Importantly, we observed significant differences in the outcomes of kidney xenotransplantation based on the preservation method employed during CIT. All kidneys preserved using SCS were lost hyperacutely within 90 min, with clinically apparent vasoconstriction visible minutes after reperfusion and histologic evidence of severe endothelial injury on biopsies obtained one hour after reperfusion. Conversely, all kidneys preserved using HMP reperfused uneventfully with minimal histologic changes on one-hour biopsies and, after an initial elevation in creatinine corresponding to IRI associated with CIT, functioned for more than 14 days.

While the underlying mechanisms for the observed differences between SCS and HMP remain unclear, spatial transcriptomic analyses suggest that HMP may confer benefit through modulation of initial ischemic injury as well as mitigation of reperfusion injury and subsequent inflammation. As far as we are aware, this study presents the first report of transcriptomic analyses with spatial resolution in an in vivo model of ischemia-reperfusion in kidney xenotransplantation.

### What are the harms of refusing to allow living kidney donation? An expanded view of risks and benefits [^a9edd2bb]. American Journal of Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Recent Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policies relating to living kidney donation (LKD)warrant renewed attention to the ethics of transplantation from living donors. These policies focus on risks related to potential donor evaluation, informed consent and follow-up. The ethical basis of living donation is a favorable risk/benefit ratio for the donor, but regulations and research have given less attention to the benefits of donation. Relatedly, the transplant field has also failed to consider potential harms from denying patients the opportunity to donate. These harms may be substantial in the setting of directed kidney donation to a spouse/partner, sibling or child. We argue that complete assessment of donor risks and benefits demands consideration of not only the risks and benefits of donation, but also those of refusing a donor. In contrast to the ever-expanding literature on risks of donation, there are no data describing outcomes for individuals who were turned down as kidney donors. We consider factors contributing to this omission in the transplant literature, argue that current regulations may perpetuate a narrow understanding of relevant risks and benefits in LKD, and identify areas for improvement in research and clinical practice.

### Xenotransplantation and pig endogenous retroviruses [^1ce016ba]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Xenotransplantation, in particular transplantation of pig cells, tissues and organs into human patients, may alleviate the current shortage of suitable allografts available for human transplantation. This overview addresses the physiological, immunological and virological factors considered with regard to xenotransplantation. Among the issues reviewed are the merits of using pigs as xenograft source species, the compatibility of pig and human organ physiology and the immunological hindrances with regard to the various types of rejection and attempts at abrogating rejection. Advances in the prevention of pig organ rejection by creating genetically modified pigs that are more suited to the human microenvironment are also discussed. Finally, with regard to virology, possible zoonotic infections emanating from pigs are reviewed, with special emphasis on the pig endogenous retrovirus (PERV). An in depth account of PERV studies, comprising their discovery as well as recent knowledge of the virus, is given. To date, all retrospective studies on patients with pig xenografts have shown no evidence of PERV transmission, however, many factors make us interpret these results with caution. Although the lack of PERV infection in xenograft recipients up to now is encouraging, more basic research and controlled animal studies that mimic the pig to human xenotransplantation setting more closely are required for safety assessment.

### Infection and clinical xenotransplantation: guidance from the infectious disease community of practice of the American Society of Transplantation [^6c0ede60]. American Journal of Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

This guidance was developed to summarize current approaches to the potential transmission of swine-derived organisms to xenograft recipients, health care providers, or the public in clinical xenotransplantation. Limited specific data are available on the zoonotic potential of pig pathogens. It is anticipated that the risk of zoonotic infection in xenograft recipients will be determined by organisms present in source animals and relate to the nature and intensity of the immunosuppression used to maintain xenograft function. Based on experience in allotransplantation and with preclinical models, viral infections are of greatest concern, including porcine cytomegalovirus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, and porcine endogenous retroviruses. Sensitive and specific microbiological assays are required for routine microbiological surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients. Archiving of blood samples from recipients, contacts, and hospital staff may provide a basis for microbiological investigations if infectious syndromes develop. Carefully implemented infection control practices are required to prevent zoonotic pathogen exposures by clinical care providers. Informed consent practices for recipients and their close contacts must convey the lack of specific data for infectious risk assessment. Available data suggest that infectious risks of xenotransplantation are manageable and that clinical trials can advance with carefully developed protocols for pretransplant assessment, syndrome evaluation, and microbiological monitoring.

### Spatiotemporal immune atlas of a clinical-grade gene-edited pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant [^669ed82b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Important insights into which immunosuppression regimens may be effective in xenotransplantation have previously come from pig-to-non-human primate studies, with several regimens resulting in long-term survival of select animals. Despite these encouraging results, however, only 8 out of 119 NHPs (6.7%) survived for 12 months or more, and the median survival time for all NHP recipients of alpha-Gal knock out pig kidney in the published literature is only 24 days. These outcomes in NHP xenograft recipients thus contrast markedly with the 93% patient and graft survival at one year observed in deceased donor allotransplantationand suggest that immunologic outcomes have yet to be sufficiently optimized in NHPs to apply these immunosuppression strategies directly to human recipients. Nevertheless, a key lesson from the NHP experience that may inform immunosuppression strategies for humans is that many NHPs met humane endpoints because of complications of intense immunosuppression and not xenograft rejection. This is perhaps not surprising given that most if not all pig-to-NHP xenotransplants have been performed in incompatible recipients, as the genetic knockdown of carbohydrate antigens that promotes crossmatch compatibility between pig cells and human sera has not resulted in compatible crossmatches between pig cells and NHP sera. Moreover, limited survival of incompatible NHP recipients has diminished enthusiasm for agents like tacrolimus that are highly effective in controlling T cell responses in compatible human recipients but may nonetheless be less effective in incompatible transplantation where graft damage is driven instead by antibody. It is thus unclear whether intensive immunosuppression regimens used in incompatible NHP models of xenotransplantation will be necessary to control human immune responses in the setting of crossmatch-compatible pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Improving our understanding of human immune responses to crossmatch-compatible porcine xenografts is thus critical to advance the field, as crossmatch-compatible transplantation will likely result in safest outcomes for human xenotransplant recipients.

### Xenotransplantation: infectious risk revisited [^ceff79b8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Xenotransplantation is a possible solution for the shortage of tissues for human transplantation. Multiple hurdles exist to clinical xenotransplantation, including immunologic barriers, metabolic differences between pigs — the source species most commonly considered — and humans, and ethical concerns. Since clinical trials were first proposed almost 10 years ago, the degree of risk for infection transmitted from the xenograft donor to the recipient has been extensively investigated. A number of potential viral pathogens have been identified including porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV). Sensitive diagnostic assays have been developed for each virus. Human-tropic PERV are exogenous recombinants between PERV-A and PERV-C sequences and are present in only a subset of swine. Porcine cytomegalovirus can be excluded from herds of source animals by early weaning of piglets. In contrast, the risks associated with PLHV remain undefined. Microbiologic studies and assays for potential xenogeneic pathogens have furthered understanding of risks associated with xenotransplantation. Thus far, clinical xenotransplantation of pig tissues has not resulted in transmission of viral infection to humans; significant risks for disease transmission from swine to humans have not been confirmed. If immunologic hurdles can be overcome, it is reasonable to initiate carefully monitored clinical trials.

### Physiologic homeostasis in a living human after pig kidney xenotransplantation [^3b92d802]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Additionally, this study lacks inulin-, iothalamate-, or iohexol-based direct measurements of GFR. Lastly, exposure to multiple drugs may have introduced confounding effects, limiting our ability to interpret the xenograft's physiologic regulatory capacity.

This case provides the first in-depth evaluation of a porcine kidney xenograft in a living human, demonstrating functional waste clearance, electrolyte regulation, and hemodynamic stability. While physiological challenges such as sodium retention, ineffective cleavage of human angiotensinogen by porcine renin, hyperphosphatemia, and anemia require further investigation, these findings validate the potential for xenotransplantation to address the critical organ shortage crisis. Ongoing clinical trials with multiple kidney xenograft recipients and longer-term follow-up will be essential to optimize post-transplant care and further investigate the feasibility of xenotransplantation as a scalable solution.

### Consistent survival in consecutive cases of life-supporting porcine kidney xenotransplantation using 10GE source pigs [^cd35d16f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Importantly, this case series includes the first demonstration of long-term solid organ xenograft survival achieved without CD40/CD154 costimulatory blockade. While the essential role of costimulation blockade in xenotransplantation is often attributed to unique immunologic hurdles associated with interspecies transplantation, the CD40/CD154 immunosuppression paradigm may compound the uncertainty associated with the clinical translation of xenotransplantation. Although multiple drugs targeting this pathway are in development with promising early results, no agents have yet demonstrated non-inferiority in clinical trials, and no drugs have yet obtained FDA approval for use in transplantation. This appears to present a difficult choice for regulators, clinicians, and patients: is it safer to use a conventional immunosuppression regimen with a xenograft despite a lack of preclinical evidence in pig-to-NHP solid organ transplantation, or is it safer to use a clinically unproven immunosuppression regimen on the basis of preclinical pig-to-NHP data?

To date, three centers have performed pig-to-human solid organ transplantation, and each center has opted for a different immunosuppression strategy. New York University and The University of Alabama used conventional immunosuppression for their preclinical pig-to-decedent kidney transplants; whereas The University of Maryland included CD40/CD154 blockade, KPL-404 (Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals), which targets the 2C10 binding epitope on CD40, and tegoprubart (Eledon Pharmaceuticals), which targets CD154 (CD40L), for their two clinical pig-to-human heart transplants, respectively. Although early results have been encouraging at all three centers, no long-term (> 180 days) survival data exists in pig-to-human transplantation to provide clarity. Since rejection often occurs beyond 60 days, it is unlikely that decedent studies with extended survivals can conclusively resolve this uncertainty.

### Clinical and molecular correlation defines activity of physiological pathways in life-sustaining kidney xenotransplantation [^c7796372]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Porcine kidney xenotransplantation is accelerating towards clinical translation. However, despite the demonstrated ability of porcine kidneys to remove metabolic waste products, questions remain about their ability to faithfully recapitulate renal endocrine functions after transplantation. Here we analyze xenograft growth and function of two kidney dependent endocrine pathways in seventeen cynomolgus macaques after kidney xenotransplantation from gene edited Yucatan minipigs. Xenograft growth, the renin-angiotensinogen aldosterone-system, and the calcium-vitamin D-parathyroid hormone axis are assessed using clinical chemistries data, renin activity and beta-C-terminal-telopeptide assays, kidney graft RNA-sequencing and serial ultrasonography. We demonstrate that xenografts transplanted from minipigs show only modest growth and do not substantially contribute to recipient RAAS pathway activity. However, parathyroid hormone-independent hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia are observed, suggesting a need for close monitoring and timely intervention during human testing. Further study of these phenotypes is warranted in designing prospective clinical trials.

Results

Patient Characteristics

A 62 year-old man with end-stage kidney disease was selected for porcine kidney xenotransplantation after failing a previous kidney transplant and experiencing significant challenges with dialysis access. His medical history included hypertension, insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, extensive vascular calcification, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. He had also undergone parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism, resulting in undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. At the time of transplantation, he had no residual kidney function.

Blood chemistry analysis of genetically modified pigs

The baseline blood chemistry of Yucatan miniature pigs with the same genotype as the donor pig (ESUS-1784) was assessed to reinforce their suitability as organ donors for electrolyte and metabolic handling post-xenotransplantation (Supplemental Table 1). Compared to wild-type Yucatan pigs (N = 4), these genetically modified pigs (N = 4) exhibited no major differences in electrolyte levels with similar median levels of sodium [138 mmol/L, interquartile range (IQR) 136−140) vs. 137 mmol/L, IQR 135−137 in wild type], potassium (3.9 mmol/L, IQR 3.6–3.9 vs. 4.1 mmol/L, IQR 4.0–4.1 in wild type), chloride (100 mmol/L, IQR 99–102 vs. 98 mmol/L, IQR 97–98 in wild type), bicarbonate (27 mmol/L, IQR 26–28 vs. 26 mmol/L, IQR 25–28 in wild type) concentrations. However, genetically modified pigs had slightly lower baseline creatinine levels (median 0.7 mg/dL, IQR 0.6–0.7 vs 1.2 mg/dL, IQR 1.0–1.4 in wild type).

The genetically modified pigs also exhibited baseline sodium, potassium, magnesium, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels comparable to human reference values, further suggesting the limited risk of metabolic mismatches following xenotransplantation. However, they exhibited a slightly higher bicarbonate concentration (median: 27 mmol/L, IQR 26–27; human mean: 24 mmol/L) and higher serum phosphorus levels (median: 6.2 mg/dL, IQR: 6.0–6.4; human mean: 3.5) relative to humans.

### Emerging technologies and ethics-exogenic chimeric humanized organs [^8f8bc61e]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The issue of violating species' boundaries presents itself in the practice of xenotransplantation. A xenotransplant is defined by any introduction of any animal product (fluids, cells, tissues, or organs) into a human recipient. A recent example, is the transplant of a porcine heart from a gene edited pig into a patient with endstage heart failure. This life‐saving technology in combination with gene editing to modify the immunogenicity of the porcine heart has reinvigorated the use of xenotransplantation for the treatment of endstage, terminal diseases. Likewise, gene‐edited porcine kidneys have recently been transplanted into decedent humans. The initial success of these studies prompts the need for further discussion with regard to species boundaries and the ethics of crossing such boundaries. In these cases, as well as in Maeng et al.the engineering of humanized organs in the pig must be considered in the context of species boundaries. Likewise, the use of xenotransplantation (a primarily pig organ to human) versus exotransplantation (a primarily human organ to human) must be deliberated. In the latter case, the exotransplantation of a human organ developed in a pig and transplanted into a human patient represents an intra‐species chimera as both the donor organ and the recipient are of the same species. It should be noted that intra‐species chimeras are produced regularly when human donor organs are transplanted into human recipients.

### Xenotransplantation: where are we in 2008? [^76c068b2]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Xenotransplantation holds promise to solve the ever increasing shortage of donor organs for allotransplantation. In the last 2 decades, major progress has been made in understanding the immunobiology of pig-into-(non)human primate transplantation and today we are on the threshold of the first clinical trials. Hyperacute rejection, which is mediated by pre-existing anti-alpha Gal xenoreactive antibodies, can in non-human primates be overcome by complement- and/or antibody-modifying interventions. A major step forward was the development of genetically engineered pigs, either transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins or deficient in the alpha1,3-galactosyltranferase enzyme. However, several other immunologic and nonimmunologic hurdles remain. Acute vascular xenograft rejection is mediated by humoral and cellular mechanisms. Elicited xenoreactive antibodies play a key role. In addition to providing B cell help, xenoreactive T cells may directly contribute to xenograft rejection. Long-term survival of porcine kidney- and heart xenografts in non-human primates has been obtained but required severe T and B cell immunosuppression. Induction of xenotolerance, e.g. through mixed hematopoietic chimerism, may represent the preferred approach, but although proof of principle has been delivered in rodents, induction of pig-to-non-human primate chimerism remains problematic. Finally, it is now clear that innate immune cells, in particular macrophages and natural killer cells, can mediate xenograft destruction, the determinants of which are being elucidated. Chronic xenograft rejection is not well understood, but recent studies indicate that non-immunological problems, such as incompatibilities between human procoagulant and pig anticoagulant components may play an important role. Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the currently known obstacles to xenografting: immune and non-immune problems are discussed, as well as the possible strategies that are under development to overcome these hurdles.

Introduction

The world has witnessed several efforts in xenotransplantation involving the implantation of genetically engineered organs derived from pigs into human patients. Specifically, these include two heart and two kidney surgeries in the USA and a liver transplant in China. The heart transplantation patients survived 6 and 8 weeks, the kidney patients 2 months. For the liver transplantation patient from China, there is no news available. 1 Xenotransplantation has also seen initial exemplifications as a subject of policymaking. It marked the first instance in which the precautionary principle was advised in the realm of bioethics. Additionally, xenotransplantation has prompted public consultation projects in several countries as well as an European Union-wide research project on participatory technology assessment. In social research, xenotransplantation serves as an instructive example to illustrate forms of governance and control such as 'pre-emptive' biopolitics and various social relations (including those associated with patienthood, animal ethics, biocapital and expertise).

Xenotransplantation is not a new science and there are documented experiments dating back to at least the 1600s with an intensification of sporadic attempts in the USA especially during the mid-to-late 20th century involving non-human primates as source animals and human patients. Most recently, novel scientific insights have emerged with the development of the gene editing system CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a tool that scientists working in the field of xenotransplantation praise for its technoscientific capacities to overcome previous hurdles like porcine endogenous retroviruses alongside a host of other transspecies immunological challenges. In addition to the recent pig-to-human transplantations, experiments with genetically engineered pig organs have been conducted on brain-dead individuals in the USA and in China, attempting to supplement the preclinical non-human primate model. Yet despite these developments and changes in the scientific and clinical landscape of xenotransplantation, many social and ethical aspects persist.

### Spatiotemporal immune atlas of a clinical-grade gene-edited pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant [^5b049701]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, we find limited infiltration of a gene-edited porcine kidney xenograft by human cells early after xenotransplantation in a brain-dead human decedent model treated with conventional immunosuppression. These observations suggest that the human adaptive and innate immune response to a porcine xenograft early after xenotransplantation may be controlled by currently available genetic and/or conventional pharmacologic interventions. The addition of a human preclinical model of compatible xenotransplantation to existing NHP model systems augments our knowledge of immune responses to porcine xenografts and will likely play a key role in the propulsion of experimental porcine xenotransplantation to clinical reality.

### Clinical islet xenotransplantation: how close are we? [^86f15816]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

HISTORY OF CLINICAL ISLET XENOTRANSPLANTATION

The first scientific attempt to transplant pig islets into patients with T1D by Groth et al. in 1994 resulted in detectable pig C-peptide in urine beyond 300 days and insulin-positive staining of graft biopsies in patients receiving combined human kidney and pig islet transplants. Despite these results, glucose metabolism remained unaltered. In Mexico, pediatric diabetic patients have been transplanted with pig islets that were co-transplanted with Sertoli cells placed in a stainless steel chamber that was implanted under the skin. In New Zealand, pig islets have been encapsulated individually in alginate and transplanted into the peritoneal cavity, an immunoisolating approach that avoids the need for immunosuppressive therapy. A trial of this approach is underway with appropriate regulatory oversight, and publication of the results is anticipated.

Regardless of the results of these xenotransplantation trials, lively discussion about their justification on regulatory and ethical grounds has emerged. Whereas the level of regulatory oversight of the Mexican trial was likely insufficient, the trial in New Zealand is being regulated carefully by that country's Ministry of Health. Nevertheless, none of these clinical studies was preceded by peer-reviewed, preclinical data in NHPs proving the efficacy of the therapy. The World Health Organization and the International Xenotransplantation Association have both stressed that, in addition to the need for strict procedures to guarantee a safe pig product, patients should be exposed to islet xenotransplantation only if there is a relatively high expectation of benefit. Although convincing preclinical data from experiments in NHPs was not required in the past before the introduction of islet allo transplantation, these data remain the best indication of the potential therapeutic benefit of islet xeno transplantation. In recent years, significant progress has been made, with pig islets providing sustained (> 1 year) normoglycemia in a small number of NHPs in which diabetes had been induced.
