## Question

Treatment of non pitting edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of non-pitting edema, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining non-pitting edema and distinguishing it from pitting edema. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies that produce non-pitting edema. Next, I will outline a diagnostic approach to identify the cause. After that, I will map treatment strategies by etiology, including lymphedema, hereditary angioedema, pretibial myxedema, solid persistent facial edema, and cerebral edema. Finally, I will synthesize general principles and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where diuretics are mistakenly used and correcting those misconceptions with evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't anchor incorrectly: non-pitting edema reflects fibrosis and adipose deposition rather than free interstitial fluid, so pressure does not leave a persistent indentation, and this contrasts with pitting edema where indentation persists after release of pressure, indicating fluid accumulation in the interstitium [^112DswHr] [^113EweB2].

> Hold on, I should verify the major etiologic buckets before proposing treatments: non-pitting edema arises from lymphatic failure (primary or secondary lymphedema), bradykinin-mediated angioedema (notably hereditary angioedema), mucin deposition disorders such as pretibial myxedema, chronic inflammatory or fibrotic entities like solid persistent facial edema, and intracranial cerebral edema where management is neurocritical care–specific rather than peripheral edema paradigms [^112DswHr] [^1159hmfG] [^111tphWY] [^117BeuRB] [^116jhr8p].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I'm not missing reversible contributors: I will examine distribution, chronicity, and skin changes; perform a careful pitting test and look for Stemmer's sign; quantify limb volume and consider imaging such as lymphoscintigraphy or ICG lymphography when staging is uncertain; and screen for secondary causes including malignancy, prior surgery or radiation, venous insufficiency, and thyroid disease, because identifying the driver changes therapy entirely [^111fLXhy] [^116Df2kY] [^1152eF2p].

> Now, for lymphedema-related non-pitting edema, I need to ensure I prioritize conservative therapy correctly: complete decongestive therapy with manual lymphatic drainage, compression (short-stretch bandaging then custom garments or adjustable devices), exercise, and meticulous skin care is foundational; sequential pneumatic compression can be added in early stages; and I should confirm that diuretics are not effective for lymphedema itself and may worsen protein concentration in the interstitium, so they should be avoided unless treating a separate cardiorenal cause of fluid overload [^11313SAy] [^114Qayf8] [^112EUAuZ] [^116vKX6S].

> Wait, let me verify surgical sequencing because I recall conflicting algorithms: some centers favor physiologic procedures first for pitting-predominant disease and liposuction for non-pitting fibroadipose disease, whereas others propose liposuction first to debulk and then LVA/VLNT to restore drainage; the key is matching procedure to stage and tissue composition, and both strategies report good outcomes when individualized, so I should present both and tailor to the patient's fibrosis burden and goals [^114GLAan] [^115aGmUS] [^112KJntR].

> I should double-check the role of liposuction in advanced non-pitting lymphedema: suction-assisted protein lipectomy after fluid control yields substantial and durable volume reductions when combined with lifelong compression, with reports of 80–100% or more excess volume reduction and sustained benefit at 5 years, supporting its role in ISL stage II–III non-pitting disease after conservative optimization [^115aGmUS] [^116BQu8K].

> For hereditary angioedema, I need to ensure acute and prophylactic strategies are precise: acute attacks are treated with plasma-derived or recombinant C1-inhibitor, icatibant (bradykinin B2 antagonist), or ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor), while long-term prophylaxis includes C1-inhibitor replacement, lanadelumab (kallikrein monoclonal), or berotralstat (oral kallikrein inhibitor); importantly, epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are ineffective for HAE, so I must not conflate mast cell–mediated angioedema management with bradykinin-mediated disease [^1159hmfG] [^11685w3u].

> But wait, what if the non-pitting edema is pretibial myxedema from Graves' disease: I should confirm that control of hyperthyroidism alone rarely reverses the elephantiasic variant, which is often refractory; topical and intralesional corticosteroids are first-line but frequently limited in effect, and emerging data suggest teprotumumab, an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, may improve refractory cases by targeting fibroblast activation and glycosaminoglycan deposition, so I should consider this in severe, refractory disease [^111tphWY] [^115VnKiP].

> Let me consider solid persistent facial edema, because I recall it behaves differently: this entity reflects chronic lymphatic stasis with fibrosis and mast cell infiltration; isotretinoin may reduce inflammation and lymphangiogenesis, and adding night-time facial compression can produce clinically meaningful improvement, though responses vary and long-term compression may be necessary to maintain gains [^117BeuRB] [^1135kYHj].

> For cerebral edema, I should confirm that peripheral edema principles do not apply: management is neurocritical care–specific, with head-of-bed elevation, brief hyperventilation for intracranial pressure spikes, osmotherapy, and CSF diversion as indicated; importantly, non-pharmacologic measures reduce ICP mechanically but do not directly treat brain swelling, so I must avoid extrapolating limb edema strategies to the brain [^116jhr8p] [^116hsCDU].

> I need to ensure general principles are explicit and accurate: treatment must target the underlying cause rather than the edema phenotype alone; diuretics are appropriate for cardiorenal or hepatic fluid overload but are ineffective and potentially harmful in pure lymphedema; compression is a cornerstone in lymphedema; and early, accurate diagnosis with staging guides the sequence of conservative versus surgical interventions, improving outcomes and avoiding futile therapies [^115GytUr] [^116vKX6S] [^11313SAy] [^111fLXhy].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence: first, confirm non-pitting versus pitting and stage lymphedema if present; second, identify the etiology with history, exam, and targeted imaging; third, initiate etiology-specific therapy — CDT and compression for lymphedema, targeted HAE therapies for bradykinin angioedema, thyroid-directed and possibly teprotumumab for pretibial myxedema, isotretinoin plus compression for solid persistent facial edema, and neurocritical care protocols for cerebral edema; fourth, reserve surgical options such as LVA/VLNT and liposuction for refractory or advanced lymphedema after optimized conservative care; and fifth, embed longitudinal monitoring of limb volume and skin health to track response and adjust the plan [^112DswHr] [^1159hmfG] [^115VnKiP] [^117BeuRB] [^116jhr8p] [^115aGmUS] [^111fLXhy].

---

Non-pitting edema reflects **fibrotic or mucinous tissue changes** [^112DswHr] and does not respond to diuretics or elevation; management must target the underlying cause [^115GytUr]. The cornerstone is **complete decongestive therapy** (CDT) with manual lymphatic drainage, compression, exercise, and skin care [^11313SAy] [^115w5mEf]. For refractory lymphedema, liposuction or lymphaticovenous anastomosis may be considered [^115aGmUS] [^112KJntR]. In bradykinin-mediated angioedema, use C1-inhibitor, icatibant, or ecallantide acutely [^1159hmfG]; for pretibial myxedema, topical/intralesional steroids or teprotumumab may help [^115VnKiP]. Diuretics are ineffective and may worsen fibrosis; address the cause directly and maintain lifelong compression to prevent recurrence [^116vKX6S].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical significance

Non-pitting edema reflects **interstitial fibrosis, mucin deposition, or lymphatic obstruction**, distinguishing it from pitting edema, which is primarily fluid [^112KJntR] [^115qYa7T] [^113EweB2]. Common causes include:

- **Lymphedema**: Primary or secondary to malignancy, surgery, radiation, or infection [^116BQu8K] [^1152eF2p].
- **Angioedema**: Bradykinin-mediated (e.g. hereditary angioedema) [^1159hmfG].
- **Pretibial myxedema**: Thyroid-associated mucin deposition [^111tphWY].
- **Solid persistent facial edema**: Chronic inflammatory fibrosis [^117BeuRB].

Non-pitting edema is clinically significant because it is often **chronic, progressive, and disfiguring**, with a high risk of infection, functional impairment, and psychosocial impact [^116WD6YZ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and staging are essential for management. Use the **ISL staging system** (stages 0–3) to guide therapy [^112DswHr] [^116Df2kY]. Objective swelling quantification (circumference, volume, bioimpedance) is recommended to monitor response [^111fLXhy]. Imaging (lymphoscintigraphy, MRI, ultrasound) helps confirm lymphedema and exclude other causes [^116Df2kY] [^111fLXhy].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative therapy is **first-line** and includes:

- **Complete decongestive therapy (CDT)**: Manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandages/garments, exercise, and skin care [^116BQu8K].
- **Compression therapy**: Graduated garments (20–60 mmHg) or adjustable devices; lifelong use prevents recurrence [^11313SAy] [^114Qayf8].
- **Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)**: Essential in early lymphedema to reduce volume and fibrosis [^116BgHqz] [^116EeXdc].
- **Exercise and weight management**: Reduce lymph load and improve mobility [^112veHNn].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacologic therapy is limited and generally ineffective for non-pitting edema. Diuretics are **not recommended** because they do not address fibrosis or lymphatic obstruction and may worsen protein concentration in the interstitium [^116vKX6S] [^117PkEax]. For bradykinin-mediated angioedema, acute treatment includes C1-inhibitor replacement, icatibant, or ecallantide [^11685w3u]. For pretibial myxedema, topical or intralesional corticosteroids may reduce inflammation; teprotumumab shows promise in refractory cases [^115VnKiP].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** or when conservative therapy fails:

- **Liposuction (suction-assisted protein lipectomy)**: Removes fibroadipose tissue after fluid control; durable volume reduction with compression [^115aGmUS] [^116BQu8K].
- **Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA)**: Microsurgical bypass to improve lymphatic drainage; best for early-stage disease with functional lymphatics [^114GLAan] [^116WD6YZ].
- **Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT)**: Restores lymphatic function in advanced lymphedema [^114GLAan].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **ICG-guided liposuction** to preserve functional lymphatics during debulking [^116Zauks] and investigational agents targeting lymphangiogenesis and fibrosis, though evidence remains limited [^116vKX6S].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Patient education is critical for adherence and outcomes. Emphasize **lifelong compression**, skin care, weight control, and early treatment of infections [^11313SAy] [^113uJsrD]. Psychological support addresses body image and quality-of-life issues [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Non-pitting edema is **chronic and progressive** without treatment. Lifelong compression and risk-factor control are essential to prevent recurrence [^11313SAy] [^117PkEax].

---

Non-pitting edema requires a **cause-specific, multimodal approach** centered on CDT and compression, with surgery for refractory cases. Diuretics are ineffective; addressing the underlying cause and maintaining lifelong compression are key to preventing recurrence [^116vKX6S].

### Current and emerging therapeutics in hereditary angioedema [^1159hmfG]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is characterized by transient movement of fluid from the vasculature into the interstitial space leading to subcutaneous or submucosal non-pitting edema. Current evidence suggests that most angioedema conditions can be grouped into 2 categories: mast cell-mediated (previously termed histaminergic) or bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Although effective therapies for mast cell-mediated angioedema have existed for decades, specific therapies for bradykinin-mediated angioedema have more recently been developed. In recent years, rigorous studies of these therapies in treating hereditary angioedema (HAE) have led to regulatory approvals of medication for HAE management thereby greatly expanding HAE treatment options.

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema: an emergency medicine perspective [^11685w3u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and often debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the absence of appropriate intervention. An underlying deficiency in functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein induces a vulnerability to unchecked activation of the complement, contact, and coagulation/fibrinolytic systems. The clinical consequence is a pattern of recurring attacks of non-pitting, non-pruritic edema, the urgency of which varies by the affected site. Laryngeal edema can escalate rapidly to asphyxiation, and severe cases of abdominal swelling can lead to hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

This report reviews the emergency diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema and the impact of recently introduced treatments on treatment in the United States.

Discussion

Until recently, emergency physicians in the United States were hindered by the lack of rapidly effective treatment options for HAE attacks. In this article, general clinical and laboratory diagnostic procedures are reviewed against the backdrop of two case studies: one patient presenting with a known history of HAE and one with previously undiagnosed HAE. In many countries outside the United States, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate has for decades been the first-line treatment for acute attacks. The end of 2009 ushered in a new era in the pharmacologic management of HAE attacks in the United States with the approval of two new treatment options for acute treatment: a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate and a kallikrein inhibitor.

Conclusion

With access to targeted and effective treatments, emergency physicians are now better equipped for successful and rapid intervention in urgent HAE cases.

Lymphedema evaluation — swelling quantification and AFTD-pitting test emphasize objective measurement at baseline and follow up and describe a consensus tool with a duration threshold. The page states that to evaluate treatment one "has to be able to quantify the amount of swelling at initial visit and during follow up", and because swelling is the presenting symptom it is "important to have an objective measure of initial swelling… and progressively evaluate whether the treatment reduces swelling". Practicality and standardization concerns are noted, yet a consensus "advocated the use of the AFTD-pitting test… using edema of > 3 months duration as a surrogate for lymphedema", although "low inter-observer reliability was reported in another cohort with milder lymphedema". For diagnostic confidence in early disease, "some of the experts consider additional assessment such as limb volume, physiologic changes, or lymphatic imaging necessary to make a confident diagnosis of Stage 0 and 1 lymphedema", and "Patients want to have confidence in their diagnosis… some are interested" in imaging to increase diagnostic confidence.

Liposuction or suction-assisted protein lipectomy (SALP) — Patients selected for this procedure typically present with late ISL Stage II or III non-pitting lymphedema after the lymph fluid component has been reduced by various compression methods. In a prospective comparative study of 28 patients, combined liposuction and compression demonstrated a 104% decrease in limb volume versus the contralateral side, whereas compression garments alone produced only a 47% reduction. In another prospective study of 105 patients, a mean extremity volume reduction of 117% compared to the contralateral limbs was observed at 5 years following combined liposuction and compression. Pre-surgical limb volume was 44.2% for arms and 47.3% for legs and decreased to 3.6% for arms and 4.3% for legs 6 months after surgery; all patients reported improved function and symptoms and patient-reported outcomes were statistically significant. A systematic review of lower limb liposuction studies published between 2006 and 2018 identified 129 articles with only 13 studies meeting inclusion criteria, found edema was significantly decreased in all patients with maximum reduction after 4–5 years, and concluded that liposuction should be reserved for patients who fail conservative compression therapy with no reduction of lower limb volume and who are classified as ISL stages II or III.

### Successful treatment of solid persistent facial edema with isotretinoin and compression therapy [^117BeuRB]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients with solid persistent facial edema often have a history of acne or another skin condition that was present 2 to 5 years before the development of facial edema. Clinically, there is characteristic firm, non-pitting edema and erythema of the centrofacial and periorbital area, including the forehead, glabella, eyelids, nose, and cheeks. Initially, the edema may be pitting, but subsequently may become firm, non-pitting edema as a result of chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

It is thought that chronic inflammation may lead to lymphatic stasis, as well as an imbalance between the production and drainage of lymphatic fluid. Mast cells within the inflammatory infiltrate may contribute to fibrosis. Histopathologic findings of patients with solid persistent facial edema have included dermal edema, dilated lymphatic and blood vessels, lymphohistiocytic perivascular and perifollicular infiltrate, and several mast cells within the thickened and fibrotic dermis. The differential diagnoses of solid persistent facial edema include Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, as well as lupus erythematosus, contact dermatitis, chronic actinic dermatitis, sarcoidosis, dermatomyositis, erysipelas, mycobacterium infections, thyroid disease, and lymphoma.

Complications of solid persistent facial edema include deformity that may lead to visual obstruction, constant tearing from the affected eye, functional problems, and diminished self-esteem as a result of cosmetic disfigurement. Patients often have no other symptoms other than deformity.

Solid persistent facial edema represents a treatment challenge. Treatments used for this condition have included isotretinoin, antihistamines, corticosteroids, antibiotics, interferon gamma, thalidomide, lymphatic massage, compression garments, radiation, and surgical management (including blepharoplasties, lymphatic drainage surgeries, carbon dioxide lasers, and local steroid injections), with varying degrees of response. However, treatment options, including surgical intervention, often provide only partial or temporary treatment response. Boparai et alfound that longer periods of antibiotic management correlated with response to treatment and stated that patents may benefit from a 4- to 6-month duration of tetracycline-based antibiotics. However, isotretinoin, oral corticosteroids, and combinations of therapies did not correspond to treatment response.

### Review of current surgical treatments for lymphedema [^112KJntR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The current mainstay of lymphedema therapy has been conservative nonsurgical treatment. However, surgical options for lymphedema have been reported for over a century. Early surgical procedures were often invasive and disfiguring, and they often had only limited long-term success. In contrast, contemporary surgical techniques are much less invasive and have been shown to be effective in reducing excess limb volume, the risk of cellulitis, and the need for compression garment use and lymphedema therapy. Microsurgical procedures such as lymphaticovenous anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer lymphaticolymphatic bypass can treat the excess fluid component of lymphedema swelling that presents as pitting edema. Suction-assisted protein lipectomy is a minimally invasive procedure that addresses the solid component of lymphedema swelling that typically occurs later in the disease process and presents as chronic nonpitting lymphedema. These surgical techniques are becoming increasingly popular and their success continues to be documented in the medical literature. We review the efficacy and limitations of these contemporary surgical procedures for lymphedema.

Methods

A Medline literature review was performed of lymphedema surgery, vascularized lymph node transfer, lymphaticovenous anastomosis, lymphatic liposuction, and lymphaticolymphatic bypass with particular emphasis on developments within the past 10 years. A literature review of technique, indications, and outcomes of the surgical treatments for lymphedema was undertaken.

Results

Surgical treatments have evolved to become less invasive and more effective.

Conclusions

With proper diagnosis and the appropriate selection of procedure, surgical techniques can be used to treat lymphedema safely and effectively in many patients when combined with integrated lymphedema therapy.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116hsCDU]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for the Non-pharmacological Treatment of Cerebral Edema

We suggest that elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees (but no greater than 45 degrees) be used as a beneficial adjunct to reduce intracranial pressure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel rated the quality of available evidence as very low. However, this intervention has been used extensively in the clinical setting and the risk of elevating the head of the bed is generally very low and may be beneficial.
2 We recommend that brief episodes of hyperventilation can be used for patients with acute elevations in intracranial pressure (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel rated the quality of available evidence was very low. However, a strong recommendation was felt to be appropriate given the extensive amount of practical experience with this therapeutic strategy. Clinicians should be mindful of the limitations of acute hyperventilation related to cerebral blood flow and the extent of PaCO₂ reduction. Clinicians should also maintain careful awareness of the duration of therapy to avoid deleterious changes in cerebral perfusion.
3 We suggest that the use of CSF diversion be considered as a beneficial adjunct to reduce intracranial pressure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low. Clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of CSF diversion using patient-specific factors.
4 While non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for acute elevations in intracranial pressure, there is insufficient evidence that non-pharmacological interventions are effective for the treatment of any specific physiological changes that produce brain swelling related to cerebral edema.

The panel evaluated whether non-pharmacologic therapies such as hyperventilation, head of the bed elevation, and CSF diversion can be used to reduce ICP and cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients (Table 1, Question 16). It must be noted that these non-pharmacological interventions decrease ICP through mechanical or structural changes without actually having any impact on cerebral edema and brain swelling. Other non-pharmacologic therapies such as surgical decompression and therapeutic hypothermia were not included, as they are adequately addressed by other guidelines. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 14).

### Peripheral edema [^115bmCRU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema: description of a new entity by canRIO [^11542hbm]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) is characterized by symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema and negative rheumatoid factor (RF). It has been described in a setting of malignancy, suggesting a paraneoplastic association. With the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of cancers and emergence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), our objective was to identify and describe cases of ICI-associated RS3PE (ICI-RS3PE) and compare them to non-ICI-RS3PE.

Methods

The Canadian Research Group of Rheumatology in Immuno-Oncology (CanRIO) network is a collaboration of Canadian rheumatologists with experience in the management of patients with rheumatic irAEs (Rh-irAEs). Standardized data on adult patients with Rh-irAE have been collected as part of retrospective and prospective cohorts. In this study, detailed information on all cases of ICI-RS3PE from both cohorts were extracted and analyzed.

Results

We identified 11 cases of ICI-RS3PE. The most frequently observed malignancy was nonsmall cell lung cancer (4 of 11), followed by malignant melanoma (2 of 11) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (2 of 11). The median time to onset of ICI-RS3PE was 26 weeks from ICI start and 52 weeks from diagnosis of malignancy. Seven patients had stable cancer prior to onset of ICI-RS3PE, 3 had partial response, and 1 had complete response. All patients received glucocorticoids. Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) were needed in 10 patients.

Conclusion

ICI-RS3PE may be an independent Rh-irAE, separate from paraneoplastic RS3PE. The symptoms of ICI-RS3PE responded well to glucocorticoids, but concomitant treatment with csDMARDs may be necessary.

### Edema: diagnosis and management [^113EweB2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^113uJsrD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Just as with LF-induced lymphedema, any increase in awareness of the causes and management of lymphedema helps to reduce the mental health issues associated with stigma and social exclusion. Monitoring of cases can be performed by health workers trained in reliable and repeatable measures such as circumference and the "pitting" test for edema. These simple measures can determine the level of free fluid present for monitoring individualized self-care programs and offer realistic expectations on the potential to reverse limb size. The longer the disease has been present, the longer health service support will be required, but a prospective surveillance and early intervention strategies can minimize the number of new cases that require future care. As a rule, to reverse severe skin and tissue changes, daily treatment is required for at least 1 year for every year the swelling has been present, up to about 5 years, by which time everyone should see visible improvement. Nevertheless, stopping the pathological changes by adopting rigorous EPC is likely to have a positive effect on all individuals, with a more rapid positive effect in those with less advanced tissue changes than in those who have had the condition for longer terms and thus have more fibrosis and more dermal pathology. Thus, people who have had lymphedema for a long time need to be patient and maintain daily self-care even when they will not see much daily change. In contrast, those who have noticed swelling for only a few months or less may achieve complete resolution after a year or so of self-care and require no further treatment. Including people who have only mild swelling in lymphedema-care services and packages ensures that the future cost of lymphedema service delivery will be reduced.

### Lymphedema techniques to manage edema after SCI: a retrospective analysis [^113KYMy5]. Spinal Cord (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of treatment data for a cohort of clients with spinal cord injury (SCI) who received therapy for management of edema.

Objective

To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and benefit of a modified lymphedema treatment approach for treatment of chronic lower extremity edema in persons with SCI.

Setting

A specialty rehabilitation hospital in Atlanta, GA, USA.

Methods

Certified lymphedema therapists with experience in SCI rehabilitation modified standard complete decongestive therapy (CDT) techniques to accommodate sensory and motor impairments and ensure skin safety. Therapists applied the modified CDT (mCDT) approach as part of treatment in 59 adults with SCI and lower extremity edema. Limb volume was measured using standardized volumetric measurement, pitting was scored using a standardized scale (range 0–4), and edema characteristics were determined to be present or absent. Outcomes of the mCDT intervention were analyzed for 105 lower extremities.

Results

Outcomes indicated that mCDT was associated with significant reduction in limb volumes, with a mean decrease of 11 ± 7.6%. Significant decreases were also observed in pitting edema and edema-specific characteristics, mean pitting scale score was reduced from a 3/4 to a 1/4. Minor adverse events were identified in a small number of patients.

Conclusions

We found the mCDT approach to be safe and well-tolerated by the patients with SCI. The intervention was associated with decreased edema, and was feasible for use in a clinical setting. We recommend considering this mCDT approach for management of edema in individuals with SCI, while remaining vigilant about skin inspection.

ISL lymphedema clinical staging — The "ISL Consensus Document describes three clinical stages of lymphedema: Stage 1 is early edema, which is relatively high in protein content and usually improves with leg elevation"; "Stage 2 represents pitting edema that fails to improve with elevation alone"; and "Stage 3 encompasses lymphostatic elephantiasis where pitting is absent, fibroproliferative deposition and trophic skin changes such as acanthosis, fat deposits, and warty overgrowths develop". In addition, "The ISL also recognizes a latent or subclinical condition (stage 0) where impaired lymphatic transport (as illustrated by lymphoscintigraphy) may manifest in the absence of swelling as 'subtle changes in tissue/fluid composition and changes in subjective symptoms'.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116jhr8p]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care cerebral edema — non-pharmacologic management recommendations: We recommend that brief episodes of hyperventilation can be used for patients with acute elevations in intracranial pressure (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest that the use of CSF diversion be considered as a beneficial adjunct to reduce intracranial pressure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should be mindful of the limitations of acute hyperventilation related to cerebral blood flow and the extent of PaCO₂, reduction and clinicians should also maintain careful awareness of the duration of therapy to avoid deleterious changes in cerebral perfusion. Clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of CSF diversion using patient-specific factors. While non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for acute elevations in intracranial pressure, there is insufficient evidence that non-pharmacological interventions are effective for the treatment of any specific physiological changes that produce brain swelling related to cerebral edema. It must be noted that these non-pharmacological interventions decrease ICP through mechanical or structural changes without actually having any impact on cerebral edema and brain swelling. Other non-pharmacologic therapies such as surgical decompression and therapeutic hypothermia were not included, as they are adequately addressed by other guidelines, and the overall quality of evidence was very low.

### Successful treatment of solid persistent facial edema with isotretinoin and compression therapy [^1135kYHj]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 24-year-old white man with no history of significant acne vulgaris, rosacea, or visual complaints presented with an 8-month history of persistent left periorbital swelling. He had previously been evaluated by multiple physicians, including an allergist and ophthalmologist, without a definitive diagnosis or response to treatment with corticosteroid ophthalmic solutions or oral antihistamines.

Physical examination revealed non-erythematous, non-pitting edema of the left periorbital aspect of the face, with no conjunctival inflammation (Fig 1). He received a diagnosis of "persistent localized edema", and was treated with a combination of loratadine, cetirizine, and doxepin. Subsequent evaluation included paranasal radiography and maxillofacial computed tomography scan, revealing only periorbital soft tissue swelling, negative result for North American Standard Series patch testing, a negative tuberculin skin test result, and histology showing numerous dermal ectatic blood vessels and lymphatics and a sparse infiltrate of lymphocytes (Fig 2).

A diagnosis of solid persistent facial edema was made, and after a 2-month course of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) and antihistamine therapy did not result in improvement, these medications were discontinued, with the addition of isotretinoin 40 mg/day because of patient frustration and desire for alternate therapy. After 3 months of therapy with isotretinoin, there was mild clinical improvement, and night compression therapy was initiated, consisting of a full facial plastic mask with elastic compression straps produced by a physical therapy clinic. Within 2 months, there was significant clinical improvement, and the isotretinoin dose was decreased to 40 mg every other day. Sustained clinical improvement was achieved during the subsequent 15 months (Fig 3), at which time isotretinoin was discontinued, and clinical improvement has been maintained with continued night compression therapy alone.

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^11534jRC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

PIL diagnosis is usually made by endoscopic, and histopathologic findings of the small intestines, showing the typical dilated lymphatic vessels in the lamina propria and submucosa. Limb lymphatic vessels can be examined by various radiographic techniques, which can aid in the diagnosis, and to rule out secondary causes of limb lymphedema or chylous effusions. Examples include lymphoscintigraphy, lymphangiography, and magnetic resonance lymphangiography.

Treatment focuses mainly on dietary modification. dietary fat induces dilation of lymphatics even in the normal intestines. Therefore, avoidance of fat decreases excessive dilation and risk of rupture in lymphangiectasia. High MCT containing formulas, and fat restriction along with high protein diet are the cornerstones of treatment for infants, and older children respectively. MCTs are absorbed directly into the portal venous circulation and do not require lymphatic flow for absorption. Octreotide use for the treatment of chylous effusions has been described in the literature. Its effect on the intestines is unclear, but it is hypothesized that it decreases triglycerides absorption, and induces splanchnic vasoconstriction. Albumin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions are frequently indicated as replacement therapies, depending on the levels and clinical scenarios. Other treatment measures include managing any nutritional deficiencies, specifically fat-soluble vitamins.

The most serious but rare long-term complication reported in PIL is intestinal B cell lymphoma. Other complications include nutritional deficiencies, lower extremity cellulitis, and the effects of chronic foot swelling on quality of life.

In conclusion, PIL is a rare disorder that typically presents with protein-losing enteropathy, diarrhea, and bilateral lower limb edema. Nonetheless, unilateral lower limb edema (non-pitting more so than pitting) should not preclude the diagnosis of a systemic disorder, and a high index of suspicion is required in atypical presentations. A good knowledge about PIL, and physical examination skills to differentiate edema or lymphedema from tissue overgrowth can significantly aid in the diagnosis. PIL responds well to dietary modification, but needs long-term monitoring into adulthood, for potentially serious complications.

### Segmental bioimpedance for measuring amlodipine-induced pedal edema: a placebo-controlled study [^111HYVZB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The development of antihypertensives requires efficient and accurate tools for identifying pedal edema. Methodologies used to gauge the potential of an agent to induce pedal edema in short-term (< 4-week) clinical trials have not been reported in the literature.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify a robust and practical method for measuring drug-induced pedal edema for use in the clinical development of antihypertensives. The efficacy of segmental bioimpedance in the detection of increased pedal edema was compared with that of clinical pitting assessment, ankle circumference, and water displacement volumetry.

Methods

The study population consisted of male and female healthy subjects and patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension who were otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine 10 mg or placebo once daily in this 6-week, double-blind, parallel-group study. Amlodipine was used as a means of inducing ankle edema, and not for the treatment of hypertension. Patients with hypertension were required to undergo a washout of antihypertensive therapies. Edema was evaluated using segmental bioimpedance at 10 kHz, clinical pitting assessment, ankle circumference, and water displacement at weeks 2, 4, and 6. The ANOVA model used included treatment and baseline values as covariates, with treatment pairs compared via t tests derived from the model.

Results

A total of 47 individuals were randomized (49% male; 29 [62%] with hypertension; mean [SD] age, 59 [5.9] years; baseline body mass index, 28.6 kg/m² [2.8]; blood pressure 146.6 [10.7]/93.5 [6.5] and 139.3 [8.3]/89.5 [4.5] in individuals with and without hypertension, respectively; amlodipine 10 mg, n = 24; placebo, n = 23). At weeks 2, 4, and 6, statistically significant treatment differences in changes from baseline were detected using water displacement (mean [90% CI] treatment differences, +39.0 g [+17.9 to +60.1], +61.9 g [+36.1 to +87.6], and +72.2 g [+42.3 to +102.1], respectively; all, P ≤ 0.001), ankle circumference (+4.74 mm [+2.38 to +7.11; P < 0.001], +2.92 mm [+0.33 to +5.49; P = 0.032], and +5.16 mm [+2.21 to +8.11; P = 0.002]), and bioimpedance (-11.7 Ω [-18.1 to -5.4], -18.3 Ω [-26.2 to -10.4], and -20.9 Ω [-29.7 to -12.0]; all, P ≤ 0.001), but no significant differences were detected using clinical assessment of pitting.

Conclusion

In this population of healthy subjects and patients with hypertension, segmental bioimpedance was comparable to water displacement and ankle circumference and outperformed clinical assessment of pitting for the detection of ankle edema, supporting the use of segmental bioimpedance as a drug-development tool to objectively quantify amlodipine-induced pedal edema.

### Immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower-limb lymphedema [^112veHNn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Skin symptoms: skin stiffness and pitting edema

Although no significant improvement of skin stiffness (high-load AECT, P = 0.16; low-load AECT, P = 1.00; and CT, P = 1.00) was seen with any interventions from pre- to post-intervention, a significant difference in pitting edema (high-load AECT, P = 0.03; low-load AECT, P < 0.05; CT, P = 0.03) was observed with all interventions.

No significant differences in LSM percentage change in skin stiffness or pitting between the three interventions (P = 0.47 and P = 0.84) (Table 1) and periods (P = 0.47 and P = 0.42) were observed.

Figure 2 shows that the severity of pre-intervention skin stiffness correlated significantly with changes in lower-limb volume with high-load (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and low-load AECT (r = 0.53, P < 0.01), but not with CT (r = −0.04, P = 0.86), while severity of pre-intervention pitting correlated significantly with changes in lower-limb volume under high-load (r = 0.47, P = 0.02) and low-load AECT (r = 0.45, P = 0.03), but not under CT (r = −0.31, P = 0.15).

### Edematous lower extremities with overlying verrucous plaques [^111tphWY]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is true regarding elephantiasic pretibial myxedema?
A. The disease is most often found in association with hypothyroidism
B. While there are different presentations of pretibial myxedema, the most uncommon is the elephantiasic variant
C. The disease is often responsive to topical corticosteroids and supportive treatment
D. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema resolves after control of underlying thyroid disease
E. The main cause of elephantiasic pretibial myxedema is chronic lymphedema

Answers:

A. The disease is most often found in association with hypothyroidism – Incorrect. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema is typically a result of long-standing GD with associated hyperthyroidism. However, in rare cases, it may be associated with non-thyrotoxic GD or Hashimoto thyroiditis.
B. While there are different presentations of pretibial myxedema, the most uncommon is the elephantiasic variant – Correct. There are four distinct variants of pretibial myxedema: non-pitting, plaque-like, nodular, and elephantiasic. The elephantiasic variant is the most uncommon and it occurs in less than 1% of patients with pretibial myxedema.
C. The disease is often responsive to topical corticosteroids and supportive treatment – Incorrect. The initial management of elephantiasic pretibial myxedema involves topical and intralesional corticosteroids. However, the disease is often treatment refractory.
D. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema resolves after control of underlying thyroid disease – Incorrect. While mild cases of pretibial myxedema may improve with control of underlying thyroid disease, the elephantiasic variant is typically treatment refractory. Further, there is no demonstrable relationship between the management of thyrotoxicosis and the improvement of elephantiasic pretibial myxedema.
E. The main cause of elephantiasic pretibial myxedema is chronic lymphedema – Incorrect. Elephantiasis refers to the enlargement and hardening of an anatomic region, which may have various pathogenic causes. While lymphedema contributes to many forms of elephantiasis, it does not contribute significantly to elephantiasic pretibial myxedema.

### Indocyanine green-guided liposuction for patients presenting with residual nonpitting edema after lymphovenous anastomosis [^116Zauks]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lymphovenous anastomoses (LVA) techniques for the treatment of lymphedema are well defined, and results restoring lymph function are reported in the literature. However, unsatisfactory results (poor-responders) are common, leading to persistent nonpitting edema. Blind liposuction eliminates fat and fibrous tissue but may result in inadvertent damage to the lymph vessel system. Indocyanine green imaging of the lymphatic system provides the potential preservation of functioning lymphatics while conducting liposuction to address the excess adipose and fibrous tissue in these patients. Our study reports the results of a prospectively conducted technique in patients with nonpitting edema after failing previous LVA. It consists of indocyanine green-guided liposuction.

Patients and Method

Twenty poor-responders patients to LVA who presented with persistent nonpitting edema were operated with liposuction. Limb volume measurements, SPECT-CT/lymphoscintigraphy, and ICG lymphography were recorded and complemented with a satisfaction inquiry.

Results

The overall percentage of volume reduction was 46.2% after liposuction (p = 0.001). None of our patients reported any set back with respect to the improvements they had achieved after LVA nor new infections. Satisfaction showed a mean improvement of 5 points in a 20-point scale. SPECT-CT/lymphoscintigraphy showed further improvements in 17 cases after liposuction, such as dermal back-flow reduction, spots along the lymphatic system, or lymph nodes not described in preoperative reports, without showing significant differences when compared with overall volume reduction (p = 0.12).

Conclusion

Controlled liposuction with ICG seems to be an effective technique for the reduction of residual non-pitting edema in poor responder patients after LVA. Overall, volume excess reduction after liposuction was 42.6%.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^115PuJDW]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Cerebral edema — evidence quality and research priorities — "Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials", and "The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments". Accordingly, "There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema". Research goals "should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures", and efforts "should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on clinical outcomes".

### Improvement of pretibial myxedema following administration of teprotumumab [^115VnKiP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pretibial myxedema (PTM) is a rare complication of Graves' disease. It is characterized by non-pitting edema with hyperpigmented hyperkeratotic papules and plaques on bilateral lower legs. Effective treatments for patients with PTM are lacking. The etiology of PTM is unknown; however, it may be similar to the mechanism of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Activated fibroblasts produce inflammatory cytokines and synthesize excessive glycosaminoglycans (GAG) that accumulate in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. A recent, novel pathway implicates IGF-1 receptor as a mediator in this process. We present two patients with refractory PTM that improved following treatment with teprotumumab, an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor approved for use in TAO. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(11):1252–1254. doi:10.36849/JDD.6854.

### Edema of the face and extremities secondary to pemetrexed [^115jm6au]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case

A 54-year-old Dominican male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung was initially treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to brain metastases and 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab. He responded well without significant toxicity and began maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Four months later, a new brain metastasis was found, and he received a second treatment of SRS and 6 months of bevacizumab. Pembrolizumab and pemetrexed were continued during and after these additional treatments. Of note, the patient was given dexamethasone with all pemetrexed infusions.

Thirty-seven months after initiating pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, the patient presented to his oncologist with 1 week of non-tender edema and erythema of his right upper extremity. Ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis, and the patient was prescribed a 5-day course of cephalexin for suspected cellulitis. No improvement was noted after the antibiotics, and mild edema was appreciated in his left upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities. His malignancy was stable, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 month after first reporting symptoms showed no evidence of new metastatic disease.

Two months after edema onset, the patient was referred to the Skin Toxicities Program. He reported new pain in the upper extremities. On exam, there was significant bilateral periorbital edema, central forehead pitting edema with blanching erythema, pitting and doughy edema of the bilateral hands, forearms, and distal upper arms, peau d'orange changes on the proximal forearms, and edema with blanching erythema of bilateral feet and lower legs (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3).

### Diuretic resistance [^1135CumH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Diuretic resistance is defined as a failure to achieve the therapeutically desired reduction in edema despite a full dose of diuretic. The causes of diuretic resistance include poor adherence to drug therapy or dietary sodium restriction, pharmacokinetic issues, and compensatory increases in sodium reabsorption in nephron sites that are not blocked by the diuretic. To illustrate the pathophysiology and management of diuretic resistance, we describe a patient with nephrotic syndrome. This patient presented with generalized pitting edema and weight gain despite the use of oral loop diuretics. Nephrotic syndrome may cause mucosal edema of the intestine, limiting the absorption of diuretics. In addition, the patient's kidney function had deteriorated, impairing the tubular secretion of diuretics. He was admitted for intravenous loop diuretic treatment. However, this was ineffective, likely due to compensatory sodium reabsorption by other tubular segments. The combination of loop diuretics with triamterene, a blocker of the epithelial sodium channel, effectively reduced body weight and edema. Recent data suggest that plasmin in nephrotic urine can activate the epithelial sodium channel, potentially contributing to the diuretic resistance in this patient. This case is used to illustrate and review the mechanisms of, and possible interventions for, diuretic resistance.

### Efficacy study of lymphaticovenular anastomosis via the lymphosome-based four-incision approach for lower limb lymphedema [^116WD6YZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The lymphatic system has a primary function, which is to return protein deposits and the excess interstitial fluid that is discharged from capillaries back to the bloodstream and then into the circulatory system. In this way, it maintains fluid homeostasis in the body. LLL is a chronic condition. It is characterized by swelling in the lower extremities due to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in tissues, resulting from the lymph's inability to flow back into the bloodstream. Lymphedema can be classified into two types based on its etiology: primary lymphedema and secondary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema is caused by congenital or hereditary factors, leading to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in local tissues and resulting in dysplasia or dysfunction of the lymphatic system. The incidence of primary lymphedema in the lower limbs is higher than that in the upper limbs and the genital area. On the other hand, secondary lymphedema is caused by external factors that damage or impair the lymphatic system, causing the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in local tissues. In contrast to primary lymphedema, secondary LLL is commonly caused by postoperative complications following gynecologic malignancies. Sandra et al found that the incidence of secondary LLL after gynecologic malignancy surgery can be as high as 45%.

The clinical manifestations of LLL are as follows: progressively worsening non-pitting edema, sclerosis and thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and skin discoloration, accompanied by pain and a feeling of heaviness. These symptoms usually lead to restricted mobility and an increased risk of infection, and may finally result in irreversible tissue fibrosis. Because these manifestations not only damage physical function but also have a significant impact on psychological well-being and quality of life, early identification and treatment are crucial for effectively controlling the condition and enhancing overall quality of life.

With the application of supermicrosurgical techniques, LVA has been increasingly demonstrated to achieve good therapeutic outcomes across different stages of lymphedema and in various body regions. LVA has been shown to reduce limb swelling, slow disease progression, and decrease the recurrence of cellulitis. The core principle of LVA lies in surgically connecting small lymphatic vessels directly to veins, thereby creating a bypass that allows lymphatic fluid to flow into the venous system, bypassing the obstruction in the lymphatic pathways. This alleviates the retention of lymphatic fluid in the tissues. Although LVA has already become a first-line treatment option in many centers, there is currently no established standard regarding the selection of incision sites or the number of lymphatic-to-venous anastomoses performed.

### Adrenocortical carcinoma presenting as bilateral pitting leg oedema [^114dhV6L]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a 54-year-old woman presented with bilateral pitting leg oedema. Initial workup for common aetiologies was unrevealing and diuretic therapy was ineffective. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated left adrenal mass with direct invasion of the adrenal vein and inferior vena cava with direct extension to the right atrium. Adrenocortical carcinoma was confirmed in biopsy and the patient was operated within several days. Fifteen months postoperation, the patient is doing well with good performance status and still in oncological treatment and follow-up. When the common causes of bilateral oedema have been ruled out, no delay should be experienced seeking abdominal mass with vascular invasion potential, as early diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving.

### Rate and time of recovery and its predictors among children aged 6–59 months admitted to inpatient therapeutic feeding centers for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in sana' a, Yemen: a prospective cohort study [^112VL9n2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Recovery definitions

Recovery from complicated SAM was assessed in two ways.

Clinical recovery: Stabilization of medical complications, return of appetite, reduce edema and transfer from TFC to OTP in accordance with WHO inpatient care guidelines.
Anthropometric recovery: Defined as achieving WHZ ≥ − 2 or MUAC ≥ 12.5 cm and no edema at discharge, based on the same anthropometric criterion used at admission.

For contextual reference, treatment outcomes were also evaluated against SPHERE Minimum Standards, which define acceptable program performance as a recovery rate ≥ 75%, mortality < 10%, default rate < 15%, and average weight gain ≥ 8 g/kg/day.

Weight gain

The grams of weight gained per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/day) from admission to discharge at TFCs. It was calculated using the following formula.

Type of complicated SAM

As marasmus (non-edematous severe acute malnutrition (i.e. weight for height Z score (WHZ) < − 3 SD or upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 11.5 cm), kwashiorkor (edematous i.e. a child had bilateral pitting edema) without severe wasting (i.e. WHZ > −3 or MUAC > 11.5 cm), and marasmic-kwashiorkor (a child had bilateral pitting edema and severe wasting(i.e. WHZ < −3 or MUAC < 11.5 cm).

Vaccination status

Was categorized based on the child's age and the national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule. Children were classified as "vaccinated as per EPI schedule for their age" if they had received all vaccine doses recommended for their specific age group at the time of assessment. Children who missed one or more age-appropriate vaccine doses were classified as "not vaccinated as per EPI schedule. "

Hypoglycemia in children with SAM is diagnosed when the blood glucose level is < 54 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L). Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level below 11 mg/dl for children 6 to 59 months of age.

### Combined liposuction and physiologic treatment achieves durable limb volume normalization in class II-III lymphedema: a treatment algorithm to optimize outcomes [^114GLAan]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Outcomes of surgical lymphedema treatment are currently suboptimal. Physiologic procedures including lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) and vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) reestablish lymphatic flow but cannot correct fibroadipose deposition, whereas liposuction alone cannot prevent disease progression. We propose a treatment algorithm combining liposuction with LVA or VLNT that can achieve normal limb volumes and prevent disease progression in stage II-III lymphedema.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing liposuction and physiologic lymphedema operations at our institution between January 2016 and June 2019. Patients were assigned to treatment groups according to their clinical presentation: physiologic first, followed by no further treatment (physiologic only) or liposuction (physiologic then liposuction); liposuction then physiologic; or simultaneous. Preoperative patient characteristics and sequence of operations were recorded. Compression garment usage was self-reported. Limb volumes were approximated as a truncated cone.

Results

Twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The liposuction then physiologic group had significantly higher stage and excess limb volume at baseline, whereas the physiologic first groups had lower excess volume. While the physiologic only group had predominantly stage I disease, the patients who later required liposuction (physiologic then liposuction group) all had stage II disease. All groups achieved 82% to 106% mean excess volume reduction, and volume reduction was maintained for up to 2.4 years. Compression garment class was not reduced, but mean postoperative compression duration decreased from 12.5 to 7.5 h/d (P = 0.003). Ten of 11 patients with history of cellulitis had no further recurrence.

Conclusion

Lymphedema represents a continuum of fluid and fibroadipose disease. Accurate staging and timely treatment with physiologic procedures and liposuction can normalize limb volume. We propose a treatment algorithm to optimize outcomes. Patients with predominantly nonpitting presentation benefit from liposuction to maximize removal of fibroadipose tissue and optimize postoperative compression, followed by LVA or VLNT to improve lymphatic drainage. Patients with primarily pitting edema are best treated with physiologic procedures initially, reserving selective liposuction as a second stage. Patients with mixed presentation are best served by single-stage combination procedures.

### Edematous lower extremities with overlying verrucous plaques [^115qYa7T]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa – Incorrect. While this patient's clinical presentation closely resembles elephantiasis nostras verrucosa with enlarged, disfigured extremities with a fibrotic, cobblestone-like appearance, the presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos hints toward a different diagnosis.
B. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema – Correct. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema presents with verrucous papules and plaques, most commonly on the anterior aspects of the lower legs, on a background of non-pitting edema. The presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos further supports a diagnosis of underlying GD. Histological examination demonstrates abundant mucin accumulation in the dermis, collagen attenuation, and stellate fibroblasts.
C. Lymphatic filariasis – Incorrect. Filariasis is a parasitic infection, common in tropical countries, and caused by the filarial parasites Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi/timori, presenting as elephantiasis. While clinically, the condition may be similar to the one presented here, the patient's history does not support a diagnosis of filariasis.
D. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides – Incorrect. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides describes a form of verrucous carcinoma, secondary to the human papilloma virus, which presents as verrucous papules and plaques involving the lower extremities. While the clinical appearance may be similar to the condition presented here, the disease is often unilateral and asymmetric, and the histologic findings in this case do not support the diagnosis of papillomatosis cutis carcinoides.
E. Lymphedema not otherwise specified – Incorrect. Lymphedema not otherwise specified can present with unilateral and bilateral lower extremity swelling. Without proper treatment, it may take on a similar presentation. However, the histopathologic findings do not support this diagnosis.

### Adrenomedullin haploinsufficiency predisposes to secondary lymphedema [^116VJTvs]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Secondary lymphedema is a phenotypic feature of adult Adm AM haploinsufficient mice, and it is reversible upon exogenous AM supplementation

To evaluate a role for endogenously produced AM in secondary lymphedema development, we used an established experimental model of hind limb skin incision surgery. Adm mRNA expression in the skin was increased after surgery in both Adm AM+/+ and Adm AM+/Δ mice (Supplementary Figure S2 online), suggesting a functional role for AM during tissue injury. We used osmotic minipump (effective in the range 10⁻⁸ to 10⁻⁶ mol/l) to restore circulating AM levels in Adm AM+/Δ mice (Figure 1b).

Following hind limb skin incision, adult Adm AM+/Δ but not Adm AM+/+ mice developed symptoms and functional changes associated with lymphedema. First, Adm AM+/Δ mice showed impaired ability to move, swelling of the limb, and pitting (or non-pitting in severe cases) edema (Figure 2a and b; Supplementary Figure S3a and b online and Supplementary Table S2 online). These changes in the Adm AM+/Δ mice were accompanied by decreased accumulation of Evans blue in inguinal lymph nodes after intradermal injection of the dye into the hindlimb footpads (Figure 2c and d), suggesting that edema was accompanied by aberrant lymph flow and fluid uptake by regional lymphatics. All acquired changes were partially, but significantly, prevented upon AM supplementation (Figure 2).

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^116Df2kY]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to these primary types, lymphedema can be further sub-categorized into different stages. The International Society of Lymphology categorizes these stages as follows. In Stage 0 lymphedema, there are no signs readily apparent in a clinical examination, although there is still abnormal lymphatic flow and drainage. Stage 1 is characterized by mild swelling which can be mitigated by limb elevation; pitting may also be present at this stage. Stage 2 lymphedema can no longer be alleviated by limb elevation. Early phases of Stage 2 are also characterized by pitting edema, while late phases of Stage 2 may or may not involve pitting but do result in fibrosis and irreversible damage to the tissue. Stage 3 consists of lymphostatic elephantiasis, the most severe form of lymphedema. At this point, swelling is extreme, resulting in large limbs and trophic skin changes, such as leathery, and potentially warty, skin.

Although, in many instances, lymphedema can be diagnosed through physical examination, its manifestation cannot be confirmed without the use of a more specific diagnostic test, typically one that is imaging-based. This confirmation can be especially important in improving patient outcomes because lymphedema is often misdiagnosed in initial screenings. In fact, a 2011 study by Schook et al. found that approximately one-fourth of all pediatric patients referred to their clinic with "lymphedema" were suffering from a different condition. A 2015 study by Maclellan et al. noted a similar prevalence of initial misdiagnosis in a pediatric and adult patient population. The use of diagnostic tests can also help illustrate the pathophysiology of each patient's lymphedema, helping stage the disease and affecting treatment choice.

The current "gold-standard" for diagnosis confirmation is lymphoscintigraphy. If the lymphatics are functioning normally, then the colloid will be taken up by lymphatic vessels and drain to downstream nodes. Lymphoscintigraphy can be used qualitatively or quantitatively to assess lymphatic function. Qualitative approaches rely on making a diagnosis based on visual assessment of lymphatic vasculature and nodes, and their ability to uptake the radiotracer. In contrast, quantitative approaches utilize the use of more defined metrics such as time of uptake and clearance of the radiotracer from the limb of interest or from the injection site.

### Long-term efficacy of a combination of amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil ± hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension stratified by age, race and diabetes status: a substudy of the COACH trial [^112QFHRp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Efficacy variables

The efficacy assessments in the OLE included the mean SeSBP and mean seated DBP (SeDBP) by scheduled visit week (Week 8 to Week 52), the effect of dosage titrations or addition of HCTZ on change in SeSBP and SeDBP, and the number and percentage of patients achieving BP treatment goal (< 140/90 or < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) by scheduled week and treatment regimen and at Week 52/early termination (Week 52/ET).

The Week 52/ET measurement of BP was defined as the value at the end of the study. For patients who terminated before Week 52, the last measurement obtained for that patient was carried forward and used in the Week 52/ET summaries. The treatment titration effect was calculated as the BP value at the last visit on the new dosing regimen subtracted from the BP value at the last visit of the previous dosing regimen.

Safety assessments and evaluation of edema

Safety was monitored by assessing the incidence of adverse events at each visit. The occurrence and severity of peripheral edema were assessed at all scheduled clinic visits using a unique case report form. When an increase in edema category occurred, investigators were encouraged to report this as an adverse event. If peripheral edema was present, the investigators rated its severity on a case report form using the following 5-point scale: (0) no edema; (1) mild pitting edema/slight indentation; (2) moderate pitting edema/moderate indentation; (3) deep pitting edema/indentation remains and (4) leg remains swollen. If a patient complained of edema, this complaint would be reported as an adverse event, even if the physical assessment did not see a difference from the previous evaluation (reported including the terms edema; edema, peripheral; pitting edema; generalized edema and localized edema).

### Liposuction for advanced lymphedema in a multidisciplinary team setting in Australia: 5-year follow-up [^116BQu8K]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a condition of persistent swelling with associated skin and tissue changes that can be of either primary and secondary origin. Secondary extremity lymphedema in the Western world is often a result of lymph node dissection and radiation therapy for breast or gynecologic cancer leading to arm or leg lymphedema, with a postoperative incidence of around 20% in both conditions. The mainstay for conservative lymphedema treatment is complex (or complete) decongestive therapy, which includes education, skin care, exercise, compression therapy, and manual lymphatic drainage. It has been shown that chronic inflammation leads to adipose tissue deposition in lymphedema, which is unresponsive to conservative treatment. –

The International Society of Lymphology classifies lymphedema into three stages. Stage 1 is defined as "an early accumulation of fluid relatively high in protein content, which subsides with limb elevation". Stage 2 involves "more changes in solid structures". Later in stage 2, "the limb may not pit as excess subcutaneous fat and fibrosis develop". Stage 3 "encompasses lymphostatic elephantiasis where pitting can be absent and trophic skin changes such as acanthosis, alterations in skin character and thickness, further deposition of fat and fibrosis, and warty overgrowths have developed". In these later stages, liposuction combined with controlled compression therapy enables complete long-term excess volume reductions in affected limbs. –

### Lymphedema outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer [^112mPERs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe the presentation of external head and neck lymphedema in patients treated for head and neck cancer and to examine their initial responses to complete decongestive therapy.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Subjects and Methods

The charts of patients who were evaluated for head and neck cancer at MD Anderson Cancer Center after treatment (January 2007-January 2013) were retrospectively reviewed. Response to complete decongestive therapy was evaluated per changes in lymphedema severity rating or surface tape measures. Predictors of therapy response were examined on the basis of regression models.

Results

The cases of 1202 patients were evaluated. Most patients (62%) had soft reversible pitting edema (MD Anderson Cancer Center stage 1b). Treatment response was evaluated for 733 patients; 439 (60%) improved after complete decongestive therapy. Treatment adherence independently predicted complete decongestive therapy response (P < .001).

Conclusions

These data support the effectiveness of a head and neck cancer-specific regimen of lymphedema therapy for cancer patients with external head and neck lymphedema. Our findings suggest that head and neck lymphedema is distinct from lymphedema that affects other sites, thus requiring adaptations in traditional methods of management and measurement.

### The impact of obesity on chronic oedema / lymphoedema of the leg-an international multicenter cross-sectional study (LIMPRINT) [^113B5PPY]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Countries and study sites

Participants were recruited from 38 centers across Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Turkey and UK. The majority of patients were treated in specialist lymphoedema centers (75.9%), fewer were recruited from general hospital services (17.0%), community health services (1.6%) and other services (5.5%).

Demographics

A total number of 7397 patients were included with chronic leg oedema; of which 43.3% (3205/7397) were classified as normal weight, 35.7% with class I or II obesity (2639/7397) and 21.0% with class III obesity (1552/7397). The percentage of patients with class III obesity greatly varied; from to 0.9% in Italy to 47.1% in Canada, Table 1. The mean age was 65.2 years of age with nearly three quarters being women (70.5%). A total of 81.0% of patients had secondary lymphoedema (5863/7241) while the rest had primary lymphoedema as defined by clinicians. Among patients with secondary lymphedema 17.5% were judged as related to cancer or its treatment, while the rest had non-cancer related oedema (82.5%); 49.2% due to venous diseases, 37.2% due to immobility, 30.7% due to obesity and 0.2% due to filariasis. Patients were able to have a number of co-contributing factors within the classification of their chronic oedema. Further demographic data is depicted in Table 2.

### Guidelines for the management of center-involving diabetic macular edema: treatment options and patient monitorization [^113xND82]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

In terms of ocular treatment, there are presently a variety of pharmacological and non-drug options available, albeit none of them cure the diseases, but only ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression. The most current and available treatment options are laser photocoagulation, pharmacological agents injected in the vitreous body, namely anti-VEGF and corticosteroids, and vitrectomy.

Laser photocoagulation was one of the first non-invasive treatments to have a low rate of complications and a high rate of success. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) was a landmark clinical trial that demonstrated the efficacy of the focal macular laser in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema (DME). The criteria for treating "clinically significant macular edema" (CSME) were defined in this study, and they were used to determine which patients should be treated with macular laser. According to the ETDRS, laser photocoagulation reduced the probability of moderate vision loss by around 50% and improved the vision of around 30% of the patients. However, despite photocoagulation treatment, patients still experience vision loss. To date, there has been a substantial shift in the type of laser treatments from traditional lasers to more advanced technologies, such as micropulses, which have increased the therapeutic benefits of laser use while reducing retinal damage. Unlike conventional lasers, subthreshold micropulse laser treatment does not damage neurosensorial retinal cells. The importance of laser photocoagulation complications has lessened with the development of newer lasers, but the principle of thermal destruction of retinal cells has stayed unchanged. Several investigations have shown that subthreshold micropulse laser treatment is safe and does not damage the retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptors.

### Lymphoedema: a paradoxical effect of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors-case report and review of literature [^116UdFui]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This report describes the development of lymphoedema in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who was treated with tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibitors. The patient was a 62-year-old woman with a long-standing history of RA that had been uncontrolled with steroids and methotrexate. Eight months after initiation of treatment with TNFα inhibitors she developed progressive symmetrical ascending non-pitting oedema of both legs with extensive keratinisation. A diagnosis of lymphoedema was made based on the clinical presentation and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Skin biopsy showed dermatosclerosis consistent with lymphoedema. The temporal relationship suggested a link between the initiation of TNFα inhibitors and the development of lymphoedema. TNFα inhibitors are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases including lymphoedema. Paradoxically, there are reports suggesting the appearance of psoriasis, vasculitis and other inflammatory cutaneous conditions after the use of TNFα inhibitors. A review of literature is also presented.

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^114vpJaJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is an exceedingly rare disorder. Epidemiology is unknown. It usually presents with lower extremity swelling, diarrhea, ascites, and protein-losing enteropathy. Since the pathogenesis of edema is usually due to hypoalbuminemia; both extremities are typically involved. The edema can rarely be due to abnormal lymphatic circulation, causing lymphedema, which usually involves both extremities as well. Diagnosis is made by the constellation of clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histological findings. Treatment involves dietary modification, to reduce lymphatic dilation in response to dietary fat. Other pharmacologic (e.g. octreotide) and replacement measures may be indicated as well. The most serious long-term complication is intestinal lymphoma. Herein is a case of Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting with unilateral lower limb swelling.

Case presentation

A 4-year-old boy presents with left foot swelling since the age of 4 months, in addition to intermittent diarrhea, and abdominal swelling. The foot swelling had been evaluated by different health care professionals in the past, and was mislabeled as either cellulitis, or congenital hemihyperplasia. Physical examination revealed mild ascites, and a non-pitting foot edema with a positive Stemmer's sign (lymphedema). Blood work revealed hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2 g/dl), and hypogammaglobulinemia. Endoscopy showed dilated lacteals throughout the duodenum. Histopathologic examination revealed massively dilated lamina propria lymphatics in the duodenal biopsies. The patient was diagnosed with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia. He was treated with high-protein and low-fat diet, and supplemental formula high in medium chain triglycerides. On follow-up, the patient's diarrhea completely resolved, and his ascites and edema improved significantly.

Conclusions

The presence of unilateral lower limb edema should not preclude the diagnosis of systemic disorders, and a high index of suspicion is required in atypical presentations. A good knowledge about Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia manifestations, and physical examination skills to differentiate edema or lymphedema from tissue overgrowth can significantly aid in the diagnosis.

### The impact of obesity on chronic oedema / lymphoedema of the leg-an international multicenter cross-sectional study (LIMPRINT) [^114pNSGP]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Characterization of patients with obesity (multivariate analysis)

The following ten factors remained independently associated with increased weight categories: diabetes (OR 2.4), secondary lymphoedema (OR 2.7), cellulitis within 12 months (OR 1.2), bilateral lymphoedema (OR 3.6), compression therapy (OR 2.1), increased swelling duration (reference being < 1 year; 1–2 years OR 1.3, 2–5 years OR 2.5, 5–10 years OR 3.6, > 10 years OR 3.5) decreased mobility (walking with aid OR 1.9, being chair bound OR 1.2) and age (reference being < 45 years; being 45–64 years OR 1.5, 75–84 years OR 0.6, being 85+ years OR 0.2). Patient's with increased weight categories had significantly lower presentation of peripheral arterial disease (OR 0.7) and poorer control of chronic oedema (OR 0.8) compared to normal weight. Detailed results are reported in Table 4.

Table 4
Ordinal logistic regression analysis: independent factors associated with level of obesity in patients with chronic leg oedema (n = 6706).

Severity of chronic oedema/lymphoedema (univariate analysis)

In a sub-group of patients (n = 918) the severity of chronic oedema was also assessed, Table 5. With increased weight categories, the skin was significantly more likely to be non-pitting, more hard/fibrotic and Stemmer's sign was more often positive. Patients with increased weight had more advanced stages of chronic oedema when assessed by ISL-staging, e.g. 13.8% of patients being normal weight had ISL stage III chronic oedema, increasing to 17.8% in patients with class I or II obesity and 38.5% in the class III obesity.

### Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in diabetic amputation ulcers: case series evaluating wound healing quality [^116Avwia]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Initial Clinical Evaluation

4.1 Patient 1

The patient was alert and oriented, with a glycated hemoglobin level of 7%. He appeared hydrated, afebrile, non‐cyanotic, and non‐icteric, ambulating with difficulty and utilizing crutches due to the amputation. The amputation site exhibited a lesion measuring 53.9 cm², featuring regular edges and a substantial amount of serous and bloody exudate, along with a slight odor. The wound bed comprised 90% granulation tissue and 10% slough, with edema assessed at (++/++++). Edema was assessed using the Godet sign (pitting edema), classified on a scale from 1+ to 4+, based on the depth and duration of the skin depression after pressure is applied. The grades are as follows: 1+ indicates mild edema (≈2 mm depression, immediate rebound), 2+ indicates moderate edema (≈4 mm, short rebound time), 3+ indicates moderately severe edema (≈6 mm, prolonged rebound), and 4+ indicates severe edema (≈8 mm, very delayed rebound). The perilesional area displayed dryness, scaling, and the presence of ochre dermatitis. The patient reported experiencing intense pain (Figure 1A).

### In vivo imaging of acute physiological responses after treatment of cancer with near-infrared photoimmunotherapy [^116AwE2F]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a new cancer phototherapy using an antibody-photosensitizer conjugate (Ab-IR700). By NIR light irradiation, Ab-IR700 forms a water-insoluble aggregation on the plasma membrane of cancer cells, leading to lethal membrane damage of cancer cells with high selectivity. However, IR700 produces singlet oxygen, which induces non-selective inflammatory responses such as edema in normal tissues around the tumor. Understanding such treatment-emergent responses is important to minimize side effects and improve clinical outcomes. Thus, in this study, we evaluated physiological responses during NIR-PIT by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).

Procedures

Ab-IR700 was intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice with two tumors on the right and left sides of the dorsum. At 24 h after injection, a tumor was irradiated with NIR light. Edema formation was examined by T1/T2/diffusion-weighted MRI and inflammation was investigated by PET with 2-deoxy-2-¹⁸F-fluoro-D-glucose (¹⁸F-FDG). Because inflammation can increase vascular permeability via inflammatory mediators, we evaluated changes in oxygen levels in tumors using a hypoxia imaging probe, ¹⁸F-fluoromisonidazole (¹⁸F-FMISO).

Results

The uptake of ¹⁸F-FDG in the irradiated tumor was significantly decreased compared to the control tumor, indicating the impairment of glucose metabolism induced by NIR-PIT. MRI and ¹⁸F-FDG-PET images showed that inflammatory edema with ¹⁸F-FDG accumulation was present in the surrounding normal tissues of the irradiated tumor. Furthermore, ¹⁸F-FMISO accumulation in the center of the irradiated tumor was relatively low, indicating the enhancement of oxygen supply due to increased vascular permeability. In contrast, high ¹⁸F-FMISO accumulation was observed in the peripheral region, indicating enhancement of hypoxia in the region. This could be because inflammatory edema was formed in the surrounding normal tissues, which blocked blood flow to the tumor.

Conclusions

We successfully monitored inflammatory edema and changes in oxygen levels during NIR-PIT. Our findings on the acute physiological responses after light irradiation will help to develop effective measures to minimize the side effects in NIR-PIT.

### Diuretic usage in heart failure: a continuing conundrum in 2005 [^111EHpkL]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Several large well-designed clinical trials have shown that the use of diuretics is beneficial in patients with hypertension. However, similarly robust data regarding their role in chronic heart failure are lacking. Historically, diuretics were developed for treatment of sodium and water retention in oedematous disorders and clinically, they remain the most potent drugs available to relieve symptoms and eliminate oedema in the congested patient with heart failure. In the non-congested patient, however, diuretics continue to be used on a purely clinical basis without sufficient characterization of benefits, adverse effects, and potential influence on mortality. There are also concerns that chronic diuretic usage can cause adverse vascular effects, unfavourable neuroendocrine activation, electrolyte imbalances, and life-threatening arrhythmias. In this article, we review the limited evidence available regarding the benefits and perils of using diuretics in heart failure.

### Quantitative clinical outcomes of therapy for head and neck lymphedema [^115wF8wp]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical assessment of lymphedema

Thirty-four patients were referred to a single, certified, lymphedema therapist with specialty training in head and neck cancer by the radiation oncologist after completion of radiation treatment and healing of acute toxicity (typically 1–3 months). Patients were referred early in their course of recovery because they were deemed high risk. Although formal baseline MD Anderson or Foldi lymphedema assessments were not recorded, these patients typically have MD Anderson 1a (soft nonpitting edema) or 1b (reversible pitting edema) lymphedema. Patients underwent at least 3 months of manual lymphatic decongestion and skilled fibrotic techniques (Range, 3–12 months; median: 6 months).

Complete decongestive therapy was done by a single, hospital-based, occupational therapist/Lymphology Association of North America-certified lymphatic therapist with specialty training in treatment for head and neck lymphedema. The complete decongestive therapy program includes manual lymphatic decongestion per anterior and posterior pathways (dependent on the presentation of the head and neck congested areas), head and neck compression, skin care education, neck range of motion, and skilled techniques to decrease fibrosis, decrease pain, and increase range of motion. Manual lymphatic decongestion for the patient was conducted by using anterior and posterior sequences. The completion of therapy was determined either by durable long-term improvement confirmed by the lymphedema therapist or by patient choice and compliance.

Patients who underwent lymphedema therapy were assessed at the beginning and end of treatment as well as at various monthly intervals. Superior, middle, and inferior circumferential neck measurements were taken using the MD Anderson Cancer Center Head and Neck Tape Measurement Protocol. Cervical range of motion was measured using a goniometer as the number of degrees the patient was able to rotate to the left and right from midline. Changes were calculated from the beginning to the last date of treatment. Pain scores using a visual analogue scale of 0 to 10 were assessed as part of routine clinical management and obtained from patients' charts. The institutional review board approved the retrospective review of the results.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^113ecTya]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Medical and surgical management of diabetic retinopathy — Management recommendations are described according to severity of the retinopathy and the presence and type of diabetic macular edema (DME), which should be classified as either center-involved (CI-DME) or non-center-involved DME (NCI-DME). DME can be present in all stages of DR. Clinicians need to consider treatment interactions; for example, DME can worsen following PRP for PDR, there have been case reports of idiosyncratic macular edema temporally associated with the glitazone class of oral antihyperglycemic agents, and the severity of DR can improve in eyes receiving anti-VEGF treatment for DME. Follow-up recommendations and treatment options based on severity are summarized in Table 5, and Table 6 summarizes side effects and complications associated with currently available treatments.

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^111D7Anp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is another mechanism of edema in PIL, which in fact, is more common than lymphedema. The underlying pathophysiology is lymph loss in bowel lumen, from excessive dilation and eventually rupture of the already ectatic lymphatic vessels of small bowels. Intestinal lymph is rich in long chain triglycerides, lymphocytes, and proteins. The result of excessive lymph loss is the characteristic steatorrhea, lymphopenia, edema, and hypoproteinemia including hypogammaglobulinemia. Interestingly, the case herein predominantly had a combined pitting and non-pitting unilateral edema, despite presenting with systemic manifestations and visceral involvement (PIL and ascites).

The most common clinical presentation in PIL includes bilateral lower extremity edema and intermittent or chronic diarrhea. As discussed earlier, The edema is mainly pitting; due to hypoalbuminemia, but could rarely be non-pitting as well, when it is due to lymphedema. It is oftentimes difficult to distinguish them, especially when both are present. Stemmer's sign can be helpful in such cases, where a positive sign (the inability to pinch the skin at the dorsum of the second toe) indicates lymphedema, rather than pitting edema. Other clinical manifestations of PIL including abdominal mass, chylous effusion (ascitic, pleural, or pericardial), generalized anasarca, and intestinal mechanical obstruction have been rarely reported.

### Treatment of edema [^115GytUr]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Edema is the result of an imbalance in the filtration system between the capillary and interstitial spaces. The kidneys play a key role in regulating extracellular fluid volume by adjusting sodium and water excretion. Major causes of edema include venous obstruction, increased capillary permeability, and increased plasma volume secondary to sodium and water retention. A systematic approach is warranted to determine the underlying diagnosis. Treatment includes sodium restriction, diuretic use, and appropriate management of the underlying disorder. Leg elevation may be helpful in some patients. Loop diuretics often are used alone or in combination. In patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV congestive heart failure, spironolactone has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites is treated with paracentesis and spironolactone. Dihydropyridine-induced edema can be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Lymphedema occurs when a protein-rich fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Compression garments and range-of-motion exercises may be helpful in patients with this condition.

Diagnosis and measurements of lymphedema

The texture of skin and subcutaneous tissue of the whole arm was palpated, and circumferential measurement of both arms was performed. The physiatrist measured the circumference of the bilateral upper limbs at the metacarpophalangeal joint, the wrist, 10 cm distal to the antecubital fossa of the elbow, the elbow, and 10 and 20 cm proximal to the elbow. Patients exhibiting CDs between both arms ≥ 1 cm, or those showing CD < 1 cm but with evident pitting edema or subcutaneous tissue hardening were defined as having lymphedema. The degrees of lymphedema were classified as mild, moderate, or severe if the CDs of any measured site were ≦ 2 (n = 190), 2.1–3 (n = 88), or > 3 cm (n = 64), respectively. Patients with BCRL were treated and followed up in surveillance clinics.

Definition of transient and persistent lymphedema

Transient lymphedema was defined as cases that fulfill all three of the following conditions: (1) decreasing CD of both arms after the onset of arm swelling, (2) no subcutaneous tissue fibrosis or pitting edema, and (3) no subjective symptoms of arm swelling. Persistent lymphedema was defined through the following symptoms: (1) having increasing CD or maintaining the same CD between both arms and (2) having any one of the following conditions: texture hardening of the subcutaneous tissue, subjective feeling of arm swelling or discomfort even after edema treatment, and experiencing flare-up of swelling during follow-ups.

Lymphedema treatment

Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) was the standard treatment for all patients with BCRL. For those who could not tolerate short-stretch bandages, pressure garments were applied. For patients with a lymphedema flare-up, another course of CDT was performed depending on the severity.

### Radiation-induced edema after single-fraction or multifraction stereotactic radiosurgery for meningioma: a critical review [^114wMFv3]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Potential dosimetric and clinicopathologic predictors of radiation-induced brain edema after single-fraction or multifraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for non-base of skull (non-BOS) meningiomas are summarized based on a systematic review of the published literature.

Methods and Materials

Reviewed studies (PubMed indexed from 1998 through 2017) included all or some non-BOS meningioma patients, reported risks of edema after SRS, and correlated dosimetric and/or nondosimetric measures with the magnitude of risk.

Results

Twenty-six studies reporting risks of edema after SRS for meningioma are reviewed. The treatment techniques as well as distribution of tumor locations, target dosing, and target volume varied across studies. Among 13 studies that included only non-BOS tumors or separately grouped non-BOS tumors, symptomatic edema occurred in 5% to 43% of patients and any edema occurred in 28% to 50%. The reported average time to onset of edema ranged from approximately 3 to 9 months in most studies. Factors reported to significantly correlate with increased risks of edema and/or symptomatic edema after SRS for meningioma include the following: greater tumor margin and/or maximum dose, greater tumor size and/or volume, non-BOS (particularly parasagittal) location, no prior resection for meningioma, and presence of pretreatment edema. Nevertheless, the extent and significance of these factors were inconsistent across studies. Potentially important dosimetric factors, such as volume of brain or tissue receiving single-fraction doses > 10 to 12 Gy, are not well studied.

Conclusions

The variability in risks of edema and in factors impacting those risks is likely a result of differences across studies in the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patient populations, as well as differences in treatment modalities and SRS planning and delivery parameters. More studies on pooled populations, grouped by potential prognostic factors such as tumor location and prior therapy, are needed to better understand dosimetric and nondosimetric factors predictive of edema risk after SRS for meningioma.

### Magnitude of and characteristics associated with the treatment of calcium channel blocker-induced lower-extremity edema with loop diuretics [^113fTvWe]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations to note. Certain loop diuretics may be available at community pharmacies at prices below insurance copayments. This may result in missing claims if loop diuretics were paid for out of pocket. Patients who developed DH CCB–induced edema may have been misdiagnosed as having heart failure within 360 days before or after initiation of DH CCBs and were therefore excluded; on the other hand, patients with heart failure may not have been diagnosed (although the diagnosis of heart failure has been validated with specificity of ≥ 95%), also resulting in the potential for misclassification. The diagnosis of edema has not been validated and is likely underdocumented; therefore, we incorporated negative controls, restricted exposure windows, and stratified on number of antihypertensive medications to evaluate excess loop diuretic use in the context of other valid indications.

### Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis: clinical features, differential diagnosis, and management [^1125XcYS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare, acute, severe cutaneous adverse reaction mainly attributed to drugs, although other triggers, including infections, vaccinations, ingestion of various substances, and spider bites, have also been described. AGEP is characterized by the development of edema and erythema followed by the eruption of multiple punctate, non-follicular, sterile pustules and subsequent desquamation. AGEP typically has a rapid onset and prompt resolution within a few weeks. The differential diagnoses for AGEP are broad and include infectious, inflammatory, and drug-induced etiologies. Diagnosis of AGEP depends on both clinical and histologic criteria, as cases of overlap with other disease processes have been reported. Management includes removal of the offending drug or treatment of the underlying cause, if necessary, and supportive care, as AGEP is a self-limited disease. This review aims to provide an overview and update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, reported precipitating factors, differentials, diagnosis, and management of AGEP.

### Performance of calf circumference in identifying sarcopenia in older patients with chronic low back pain: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^1111nkbq]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

This study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Republic of Korea (IRB No. 4–2024–0094). In our previous studies, we have observed that low handgrip strength and high fat infiltration of paraspinal muscles resulted in poor treatment outcomes in older patients with CLBP. Therefore, in 2022, we began sarcopenia screening and diagnosis for older patients with chronic pain at their initial visit to our pain clinic. The present study employs a retrospective cross-sectional observational design. Specifically, it is a retrospective audit of CLBP patients who completed sarcopenia assessment based on the AWGS 2019 diagnostic protocol. Patients who visited our clinic seeking treatment for low back pain from January to December 2022 were enrolled in the study. Based on the patho-anatomical approach of CLBP used for confirmation, adult patients aged 65 years and above diagnosed with degenerative lumbar spinal disease, such as spondylolisthesis, herniated disc, spinal/foraminal stenosis, and facet joint arthropathy, confirmed by radiological evaluation within one year from the date of initial visit were included. Pain duration of three months or longer was used to define chronicity. Non-ambulatory patients or patients with severe cognitive impairment that precluded completion of the sarcopenia assessment protocol were excluded. Patients with abnormal calf asymmetry with a difference in circumference greater than 2.0 cm between calves or pitting edema of the lower limbs were excluded. To assess lower limb pitting edema, visual inspection for swelling or skin changes, gentle palpation to assess skin indentation, and observation for persistence of indentation after pressure release were conducted. In addition, patients with incomplete medical records for this study were excluded.

### Evaluation and selection of lower limb lymphedema patients for lymphaticovenular anastomosis: a prospective study [^116QnxVe]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) with supramicrosurgical technique has recently gained popularity as a treatment method for patients with lymphedema. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate objective changes in leg volume in patients operated with LVA for lymphedema in the lower extremity, and to find positive predictors for the treatment method to facilitate the location of the venules and lymphatic vessels.

Patients & Methods

31 consecutive patients with lymphedema in the lower extremity and positive pitting test were examined with lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography. The causes of the lymphedema were either cancer or unknown cause/primary lymphedema. Fourteen of the patients with pathological lymphangiographic patterns were chosen for surgery and 12 of them were operated with one to four LVAs each. The lymphedema volume in the lower extremity was measured preoperatively, 6- and 12 months after surgery according to the truncated cone formula with the patient´s contralateral leg used as control. Ten patients had unilateral lymphedema and two patients had bilateral lymphedema.

Results

Five of 12 patients showed between 1–8% edema reductions in the lower extremity after 12 months. With examination considering edema duration, number of anastomoses, radiotherapy and lymph node dissection we found a 6,2% difference in edema reduction between patients who had undergone lymph node dissection and those who had not (p = 0.03).

Conclusions

The current study indicates that supramicrosurgery with LVA may reduce edema volumes, where the most distinctive positive predictor for edema reduction with LVAs was previous lymph node dissection.

### Loop diuretic therapy with or without heart failure: impact on prognosis [^112XggoX]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Current consensus guidelines state that the symptoms and signs of congestion are essential diagnostic criteria for HFand strongly recommend loop diuretics for their treatment. In the current analysis, many patients with a diagnostic label of HF were not treated with loop diuretics. These patients had often had MIs, had reduced LVEF, and were prescribed renin–angiotensin system inhibitors and beta-blockers. The relatively favourable prognosis of patients with HF who were not treated with loop diuretics may reflect the effective deployment of guideline-recommended therapies that prevent or reverse the development of congestion, rendering treatment with loop diuretics unnecessary. However, the decision not to initiate loop diuretics suggests that these patients had few or no symptoms or signs of congestion and may not have fulfilled current guideline criteria for a diagnosis of HF.

That there is an association between taking loop diuretics and an adverse prognosis in patients with HF is not surprising. Loop diuretics are used to treat symptoms and signs of congestion, which is associated with more severe cardiac and renal dysfunction and a higher mortality. For patients with severe congestion, loop diuretics are almost certainly life-saving in the short term, but the longer-term adverse consequences, including activation of neuroendocrine systems, electrolyte disturbances, and increased calcium excretion, might increase morbidity and mortality. The overall prognosis of patients taking loop diuretics will reflect the average prognosis for each of the diverse reasons for their use. Patients who received loop diuretics for ankle swelling in the absence of serious underlying disease might have a good prognosis, and therefore, for other patients within this diverse group, it must be much worse. It is also possible that prognosis is driven primarily by problems other than HF, such as lung disease or cancer, for which loop diuretics might do more harm than good. Further research is required to determine how often loop diuretic prescription is simply a bystanding marker of a poor outcome or associated with symptoms and signs due to cardiac dysfunction — in other words, HF.

### Changes on noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging following lymphatic surgery for upper extremity secondary lymphedema [^115Ygk1h]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective observational study
- **Key Findings**: In 34 patients with upper extremity secondary lymphedema, there was decreased subcutaneous tissue thickness after debulking lipectomy, but not for vascularized lymph node transplant (VLNT) at 1 year after surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based edema scores worsened after debulking, although quality-of-life scores were improved; there was no change in patients who underwent VLNT.
- **Take Home Message**: There is decreased soft tissue thickening but increased edema score on 1-year follow-up MRI after debulking lipectomy for lymphedema, although longer-term follow-up may be needed before changes are seen on MRI after VLNT.

Lymphedema severity is assessed commonly using the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) scoring system, which is based on physical examination findings, with stage 0 as negative, stage 1 as mild edema that improves with elevation, stage 2 as pitting without improvement with elevation, and stage 3 with fibroadipose deposition and skin thickening. This lacks anatomical precision. Lymphedema Quality of Life (LYMQOL) are limited by subjectivity. There is a need for predictive, sensitive, and precise measures of lymphatic status and lymphedema severity to track post-treatment changes. This metric is necessary to track disease progression or detect treatment failure as early as possible. Medical imaging can potentially provide a way to track lymphedema progression or response to treatment, although there is a lack of standardization and imaging is often tailored for initial diagnosis only. Standard imaging techniques such as lymphoscintigraphy are known to be highly sensitive and even able to detect subclinical disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows high-resolution evaluation of soft tissues with the ability to detect edema and its spatial distribution with very high sensitivity. In addition, MRI can also show the distribution of adipose tissue and can be combined with vascular and even direct lymphatic assessment. However, MRI is not used typically in the assessment of patients after surgery.

### Guidelines for the management of center-involving diabetic macular edema: treatment options and patient monitorization [^116Aii2S]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

It should be noted, therefore, that the morphological improvement is greater than the functional improvement and because of this, pharmacological treatments such as anti-VEGF and corticosteroids are often considered for DME, with functional benefits superior to subthreshold micropulse laser treatment. According to Euretina guidelines, laser photocoagulation is not recommended for the treatment of DME. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, subthreshold micropulse laser treatment may be considered when other therapies are unavailable or contraindicated, such as during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or when other treatments are ineffective.

The development of new treatment options and diagnostics tools has significantly improved the management of DME.

The pharmacological treatments primarily include anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications and corticosteroids. The former includes aflibercept (Eylea ®; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Tarrytown, NY, USA, and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Berlin, Germany), ranibizumab (Lucentis ®; Genentech Inc. South San Francisco, CA, USA), and bevacizumab (Avastin ®; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA/Roche, Basel, Switzerland), which is an off-label therapy.VEGF inhibition has been widely used and has established itself as the gold standard for the treatment of DR associated with DME.

Aflibercept, also known as VEGF-Trap, is a fusion protein that combines the ligand-binding components of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 extracellular domains with the Fc part of IgG. This anti-angiogenic inhibits tumor growth and vascularization. Furthermore, this anti-VEGF binds to all VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF isoforms.

Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) generated in an Escherichia coli production system (and thus not glycosylated). It was genetically modified to maximize its affinity for binding and inhibition of VEGF-A, and it was specially developed to be used intravitreally, having been licensed by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of several retinal disorders.

Bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colon, rectum, or breast cancer, as well as individuals with non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. However, it is utilized off-label in ophthalmology. It is a full-length recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody with both Fc and Fab regions that is three times larger than ranibizumab being generated in the mammalian expression system (glycosylated molecule). The Fc antibody domain contributes to immune activation.

The decision on whom to offer surgical interventions for lymphedema requires collaboration and input from all involved specialists and should address patients' expectations, invasiveness of procedures, and disease severity. There is no consensus on what constitutes success or failure of complex decongestive therapy and when to pursue surgical intervention. Surgery has the potential to fundamentally affect the pathophysiology of the disease state and can be a powerful tool when used correctly. The dogma of which surgery to offer for a given clinical situation has been undergoing revision and is an area of ongoing research.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^116vKX6S]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Optimal treatment for lymphedema begins with an accurate diagnosis as delineated above. Management of lymphedema includes both surgical and nonsurgical approaches, with the latter categorized into physiological and debulking procedures. Patients are initially referred for conservative management, and those who meet criteria may then proceed to surgical intervention.

Nonsurgical Management

Pharmacologic Treatment

Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of medications for treating lymphedema. Various pharmaceutical agents, including diuretics, coumarin, vitamin E, and steroids, have been discussed, but none have demonstrated compelling efficacy in managing lymphedema.

While diuretics may reduce limb volume, this effect is largely anecdotal and likely results from their action on swelling caused by conditions such as heart failure or venous stasis, rather than from treating lymphedema itself. In fact, some authors have raised concern that diuretics may exacerbate the condition by increasing the concentration of high protein fluid in the interstitial space. Similarly, coumarin, vitamin E, and pentoxifylline have been explored for their potential in preventing or treating lymphedema, but there is no supporting evidence for their effectiveness. Steroids have been shown to have a temporary benefit in lymphedema treatment, however, this effect is short-lived, and was not shown to extend beyond a month.

### Novel treatment targets for cerebral edema [^111WidRr]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema is a common finding in a variety of neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, and neoplasia. With the possible exception of neoplasia, most pathological processes leading to edema seem to share similar molecular mechanisms of edema formation. Challenges to brain-cell volume homeostasis can have dramatic consequences, given the fixed volume of the rigid skull and the effect of swelling on secondary neuronal injury. With even small changes in cellular and extracellular volume, cerebral edema can compromise regional or global cerebral blood flow and metabolism or result in compression of vital brain structures. Osmotherapy has been the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy and is typically administered as part of an escalating medical treatment algorithm that can include corticosteroids, diuretics, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression. Novel treatment targets for cerebral edema include the Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ co-transporter (NKCC1) and the SUR1-regulated NC(Ca-ATP) (SUR1/TRPM4) channel. These two ion channels have been demonstrated to be critical mediators of edema formation in brain-injured states. Their specific inhibitors, bumetanide and glibenclamide, respectively, are well-characterized Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with excellent safety profiles. Directed inhibition of these ion transporters has the potential to reduce the development of cerebral edema and is currently being investigated in human clinical trials. Another class of treatment agents for cerebral edema is vasopressin receptor antagonists. Euvolemic hyponatremia is present in a myriad of neurological conditions resulting in cerebral edema. A specific antagonist of the vasopressin V1A- and V2-receptor, conivaptan, promotes water excretion while sparing electrolytes through a process known as aquaresis.

### Understanding negative pressure pulmonary edema [^117AJhfg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of NPPE generally includes maintaining a patent airway, and oxygen supplementation with addition of positive end-expiratory pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) as guided by physical examination and arterial blood gas analysis. Mechanical ventilation should be reserved for severe patients who do not respond to NIV. Diuretics are often used; however, there is no evidence of their utility, and they may exacerbate hypovolemia and hypoperfusion. Ultimately, NPPE usually has a rapidly resolving clinical course in 12–48 h when recognized early and treated immediately.

Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to PE can help in distinguishing NPPE from other causes of noncardiogenic PE, thus preventing use of inappropriate and dangerous treatment for patients with NPPE.

A 33‐month‐old boy was referred for a 2‐month history of a diffuse rash, unsuccessfully treated with oral dexamethasone and fluconazole. He was delivered at term with normal birthweight. His immunizations were up‐to‐date. According to his parents, he recently began to lose previously acquired motor and verbal skills. There was no family history of rheumatologic or hematologic diseases. On admission, the child was irritable, non‐verbal, but had normal vital signs. Physical exam was remarkable for mild hepatomegaly and an inability to walk. Skin examination showed hair depigmentation (Figure 1); a sharply marginated erythematous dermatitis with irregular raised borders on the limbs, trunk, and perianal region (Figures 2 and 3), and pitting edema in both feet (Figure 3).

### Frontal edema due to mesotherapy for androgenetic alopecia: a case series [^114SspvV]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of non-cicatricial alopecia in both genders. Currently approved drugs for the treatment of AGA include topical minoxidil in women and topical minoxidil and oral finasteride in men. Other routes of administration of approved drugs have been proposed to enhance therapeutic results for AGA, including intradermal injections, known as mesotherapy. Mesotherapy-or intradermotherapy-is a non-surgical procedure, consisting of multiple intradermal injections of pharmacological substances diluted in small doses. Although minimally invasive, mesotherapy may be related to mild side effects like burning, erythema and headaches, as a few reports indicate. Among the most serious adverse events, subcutaneous necrosis, scalp abscesses, and angioedema have been described. This multicenter retrospective, descriptive study aims to report 14 cases of frontal edema resulting from mesotherapy for AGA treatment. In our patients, the edema mostly arose in the first two sessions and lasted between 1 and 4days, with a favorable outcome after a local cold compress. In all our cases of edema, lidocaine was the anesthetic used. Minoxidil and dutasteride might also play a role as causative agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series focused on frontal edema after mesotherapy for AGA and gives clinicians helpful information for when performing this technique. Dermatologists should already consider and be conscious of this possible mesotherapy side effect, as it can be remarkably disruptive to affected patients.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^116DhPtB]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Salt intake

Another non-pharmacologic treatment is to monitor and adjust as needed the amount of salt that the patient is ingesting. Because salt is typically seen as a negative dietary component, patients may try to remove or at least reduce salt from their diet. However, many patients who suffer orthostatic symptoms have an inadequate intake of salt. This can be verified by checking the 24-h urinary sodium (in patients who are not taking diuretics or fludrocortisone, urinary sodium > 100 mEq/24 h indicates salt repletion). For the patient with nOH, it is recommended that they add up to 1–2 teaspoons (2.3–4.6 g) of salt per day to their normal diet. Patients at risk for heart failure or severe peripheral edema must be closely monitored for worsening symptoms and salt intake adjusted downward accordingly. The long-term risks associated with greater salt intake (e.g. increased intravascular volume, worsening edema, worsening heart failure, increased blood pressure) need to be weighed against the short-term risks of nOH resulting in fall injury and the negative impact on activities of daily living. The long-term risks of high sodium diets in individuals with orthostatic hypotension have not been well studied.

Physical conditioning

Lower body strength training and moderate, non-strenuous activities may be incorporated into standard treatment for patients with nOH. Deconditioning occurs very quickly in bed bound or hospitalized patients and will exacerbate the magnitude of the blood pressure drop in patients with nOH. We advocate the use of exercise that is not gravitationally challenging, such as a stationary recumbent bicycle, rowing machine, or water-based activities. Upright exercise, such as treadmill walking or running, should be avoided in some patients because of the risk of falls due to nOH. Patients should be cautioned that strenuous activity may temporarily exacerbate symptoms of nOH due to increased core body temperature and peripheral vasodilation as described below. To help mitigate against this occurring, patients should be well hydrated prior to exercise and should be careful when standing after an exercise session.

The panel reached consensus that "cancer, infection, chronic venous disease, and surgery are risk factors for secondary lymphedema", and that "clinical examination is adequate for diagnosing lymphedema and that all patients with chronic venous insufficiency (C3–C6) should be treated as lymphedema patients". "No consensus was reached regarding routine clinical practice use of radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy as a mandatory diagnostic tool", but consensus supported "the importance of quantifying edema in all patients (93.6% in favor)". For treatment, consensus favored "the regular use of compression garments to reduce lymphedema progression (89.4% in favor, 10.6% against; mean score of 79)".

### Macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis: pathophysiology, etiology, prevalence, impact and management challenges [^113FKtdB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Medically induced ME

Taxane-induced ME often needs withdrawal of treatment as topical dorzolamide has little effectiveness and anti-VEGF agents do not seem to have better results.ME in this condition is probably related to aquaporin interaction rather than inflammatory reactions. This might explain the reason that only the first injection of subconjunctival triamcinolone is effective, whereas the second one does not seem to be beneficial.

Fingolimod, commonly used nowadays in MS, has the particularity to induce ME usually a few months after initiation in approximately 0.5% of patients. Withdrawal of treatment is not always necessary, as steroid or non-steroid treatment can be effective with continued Fingolimod use.

Patients with UME should be monitored closely initially. It is important to examine them 4–6 weeks after steroid treatment initiation to check intraocular pressure and the effectiveness of the treatment. A collaborative follow-up with a rheumatologist or immunologist is recommended in case of auto-immune disease. OCT monitoring and angiography should be repeated in conjunction with a regular VA assessment and complete slit lamp examination.

A summary of the most important studies and the algorithm involving the treatment of non-infectious UME is depicted in Table 3 and Figure 3, respectively.

### Macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis: pathophysiology, etiology, prevalence, impact and management challenges [^112KGQ3p]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

In case of failure (due to ineffectiveness or side effects), the more recent anti-TNF alpha treatment can be used as first line or rescue treatment (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) as the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of non-infectious uveitis.–Infliximab (a mouse-human chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, administered intravenously) and adalimumab (a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha administered subcutaneously) have proven their efficiency to reduce steroids dependence even in cases refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy for sarcoidosis, whereas etanercept seems to be less effective than Infliximab for ocular inflammations. Systemic administration of anti TNF-alpha agents has been linked with serious adverse events, including malignancies, infections (ie tuberculosis) and autoimmune diseases.

Intravitreal administration of methotrexate can also be considered according to a British study published in 2009, but this was reported prior to the arrival of the new immunomodulatory agents.

In cases of persisting UME to conventional pharmacological treatment, pars plana vitrectomy (with or without internal limiting membrane peeling) may be indicated. Although the mechanism of UME regression following surgical intervention is not fully understood, there is some evidence that reduction of inflammatory mediators in the vitreous body leads to reduction of antigen presentation.

ME related to ocular diseases

Retinitis pigmentosa might be associated with uveitis and ME at any stage of the disease. The pathophysiology of this edema is poorly understood, it might be related to inflammatory reaction due to autoantibodies and abnormal vascular permeability. Topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are used as first-line treatment and in case of resistance intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has shown good results.

Birdshot retinopathy usually responds to systemic steroids, but sometimes resistance even to immunosuppressive agents might threaten the visual outcome. More recent anti-TNF alpha agents can be good alternative therapeutic options in those situations. However, even these anti -TNF alpha agents might fail to achieve a resolution of ME. Recently, Leclercq et al reported the effectiveness of tocilizumab in refractory birdshot UME cases.

### The treatment of lymphedema related to breast cancer: a systematic review and evidence summary [^117PkEax]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

To provide an evidence summary report on the question: What are the treatment options for women with lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer?

Methods

Cancer Care Ontario's Supportive Care Guidelines Group (SCGG) employed systematic review methodology to produce an evidence summary on this topic. Evidence-based opinions were formulated to guide clinical decision making, and a formal external review process was conducted to validate the relevance of these opinions for Ontario practitioners.

Results

The systematic review search strategy identified ten randomized controlled trials which form the basis of this evidence summary report. Four key opinions offered by the SCGG are outlined below. Responses from the practitioner feedback process supported the validity of these opinions in Ontario. (1) There is some evidence to suggest that compression therapy and manual lymphatic drainage may improve established lymphedema, but further studies are needed. Compression garments should be worn from morning to night and be removed at bedtime. Patients should be advised that lymphedema is a lifelong condition and that compression garments must be worn on a daily basis. Patients can expect stabilization and/or modest improvement of edema with the use of the garment in the prescribed fashion. (2) There is no current evidence to support the use of medical therapies, including diuretics. (3) Additional efforts to define relevant clinical outcomes for the assessment of patients with lymphedema would be valuable. (4) These opinions are appropriate for patients with more than mild lymphedema, where the signs and symptoms are considered significant from the patients' perspective.

### Oedema in obesity; role of structural lymphatic abnormalities [^116aUX5r]. International Journal of Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

Oedema is a common finding in obesity and its cause is not always clear. Possible causes include impairment of cardiac, respiratory and/or renal function, chronic venous insufficiency and lymphatic problems. Lymphoscintigraphy is the best method to detect structural lymphatic abnormalities that can cause lymphoedema. We reviewed 49 female subjects with pitting oedema who had undergone lymphoscintigraphy, divided in three groups. The first group was comprised of severely obese patients in whom cardiorespiratory causes for oedema had been excluded. The second group consisted of non-obese patients with recognized causes for oedema and the third group was non-obese patients with 'idiopathic' oedema. A standard classification was used to interpret lymphoscintigraphy results. The frequency and severity of lymphoscintigraphic abnormalities was greatest in patients with clinical diagnoses of oedema related to 'recognized causes' (any abnormality in 50% of legs with obstruction in 22%). Obese patients and those with 'idiopathic'oedema had fewer (P = 0.02 for both) and milder lymphoscintographic abnormalities (any abnormality 32 and 25%, respectively, obstruction 5 and 3%, respectively), and although the clinical oedema was invariably bilateral, the lymphoscintigraphy abnormalities were usually unilateral. In conclusion, structural lymphoscintigraphic abnormalities are uncommon in obesity and do not closely correlate with the clinical pattern of oedema.

### Review of the evidence of lymphedema treatment effect [^115w5mEf]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Lymphedema treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, and reduce risk for skin infection. Mainstream treatment options have been investigated in more than 160 studies. Findings from these studies have been included in at least 1 of more than 20 literature reviews. A critique of these reviews was undertaken to summarize efficacy findings. The quality of the reviews was evaluated, and gaps in the research were identified to better guide clinical practice. Overall, there was wide variation in review methods. The quality of studies included in reviews, in study design and reporting overall, has been poor. Reviews consistently concluded that complex physical therapy is effective at reducing limb volume. Volume reductions were also reported after the use of compression garments, pumps, and manual lymphatic drainage. However, greatest improvements were reported when these treatments formed a combined treatment program. Large, well-designed, evaluated, and reported randomised, controlled trials are needed to evaluate and compare treatments. Consistent outcome measures will allow better quality reviews and meta-analysis in the future.

### Treatment of edema… [^111zdLmc]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment PRINCIPLES OF THERAPY Treatment of edema consists of reversing the underlying disorder, restricting dietary sodium to minimize fluid retention, and, usually, employing diuretic therapy. 3 This approach highlights the need to establish a diagnosis and to use nonpharmacologic approaches when appropriate, rather than resorting to the immediate use of diuretics. Not all patients with edema will require drug treatment; in some patients, sufficient sodium restriction and elevation of the lower extremities above the level of the left atrium are effective. However, diuretics are required in most patients in addition to nonpharmacologic treatments, especially continued restriction of salt. The choice of diuretic, route of administration, and dosing regimen will vary based on the underlying disease, its severity, and the urgency of the problem.

Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the various agents is essential. CIRRHOSIS Most of the principles of diuretic use and sodium restriction apply in the treatment of ascites and edema associated with cirrhosis. Ascites is a common complication of cirrhosis and is associated with a worse prognosis. Paracentesis is the treatment of choice in patients with grade 3 ascites and should be complemented by sodium restriction and diuretic therapy. 21 In patients with refractory ascites, the use of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be considered. In a randomized study, 22 TIPS was superior to large-volume paracentesis in relieving ascites and prolonging survival. Many patients with ascites and cirrhosis eventually become candidates for hepatic transplantation.

In another randomized study 23 comparing TIPS with paracentesis and albumin, replacement resulted in greater survival rates at two years without transplantation. 34 The use of range-of-motion exercises; skin care; compression wrapping; and comprehensive decongestive physiotherapy, a two-phase process of specialized manual lymph massage and drainage, may be effective. Diuretics may be of benefit early in the course of the disease but rarely are effective on a long-term basis. Surgical treatment is of little benefit, although it may play a debulking role in patients with advanced elephantiasis. 35.
