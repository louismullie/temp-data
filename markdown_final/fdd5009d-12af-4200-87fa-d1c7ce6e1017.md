## Question

There is new evidence suggesting that cephalexin can be dosed BID. Can you tell me more?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cephalexin can be dosed twice daily and in which clinical contexts that is supported by evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the current FDA labeling says about BID dosing. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for less frequent dosing. Next, I will review clinical studies supporting BID regimens in specific indications. After that, I need to check pediatric data and pharmacodynamic modeling. Finally, I should reconcile areas where BID is not supported, consider renal impairment adjustments, and synthesize a practical, stewardship-minded recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling for oral cephalexin states that the usual adult dose is 250 mg every 6 hours, but a dose of 500 mg every 12 hours may be administered, which explicitly permits BID dosing as an alternative for adults and adolescents aged 15 years and older, with therapy typically 7 to 14 days depending on infection type and severity [^117Kysaj] [^111Jva9e] [^1116UgHp] [^112wF78K].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale before jumping to clinical outcomes. Cephalexin achieves peak serum concentrations around 1 hour and maintains detectable levels at 6 hours; importantly, urine concentrations remain high for several hours, which supports less frequent dosing for urinary tract infections where urinary pharmacodynamics drive efficacy, even though beta-lactams classically require time above MIC across the dosing interval [^112gCEso] [^1143nsPo].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence for BID in UTIs. A retrospective cohort of ED patients with UTIs found no significant difference in 30-day treatment failure between cephalexin 500 mg BID versus QID, suggesting BID is reasonable for outpatient UTI management when adherence and cost are priorities, though this is single-center and retrospective and should be interpreted with caution [^111zdRxa].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric data because extrapolation is risky. Population PK modeling in children with MSSA infections shows that BID regimens can achieve the fT > MIC target for MSSA when appropriately dosed, with required BID total daily doses of roughly 45–80 mg/kg depending on MIC, indicating feasibility though higher per-dose amounts are needed to preserve time above MIC with fewer daily administrations [^115fAxVQ]. Observational pediatric osteoarticular infection cohorts also suggest similar outcomes with QID versus TID step-down cephalexin, supporting the concept that less frequent dosing can be effective in selected contexts, albeit not randomized [^113R34ep].

> I need to check other adult indications where BID appears in labeling or trials. For respiratory tract infections, some older FDA materials list 500 mg BID as an adult regimen, though other entries still default to QID, reflecting heterogeneity and the need to align with local formularies and susceptibilities; this means BID can be acceptable in select respiratory presentations but is not uniformly standard across all labels [^111vbtb1] [^114x9JRk]. For skin and soft tissue infections, multiple sources list 500 mg BID as an option, and randomized data show cephalexin-based regimens are effective for cellulitis, with no advantage to adding MRSA coverage in uncomplicated cases, reinforcing that BID cephalexin can be clinically effective when streptococcal coverage is the priority [^112eXHDZ] [^1112uFJm] [^113cdboF].

> But wait, what if the indication is one where BID is not well supported. For acute otitis media, current FDA dosing remains 250–500 mg QID, and for lactational mastitis, expert guidance continues to recommend 500 mg QID for 10–14 days; thus, BID should not be substituted in these syndromes outside of a compelling clinical rationale or study protocol [^112ocDQY] [^115jd7oQ] [^116UMnmu].

> I should double-check renal impairment because frequency and total dose matter. In adults with creatinine clearance 15–29 mL/min, labeling advises not exceeding 250 mg per dose and restricting frequency to every 8–12 hours, and in more severe impairment, once-daily or even every 48–60 hours may be required. Importantly, a large observational study in older adults with eGFR less than 30 mL/min did not show worse outcomes with higher-than-recommended cephalosporin doses, but best practice remains to follow labeled renal adjustments to mitigate neurotoxicity and GI risks, especially in frail patients [^113bcM3J] [^116GDChX] [^115wfJ2B] [^114PjLEf].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overgeneralizing. Yes, cephalexin can be dosed twice daily in adults for several indications, most clearly supported for UTIs and reasonably used for selected respiratory and skin infections when total daily exposure and pathogen susceptibilities are adequate. However, BID is not appropriate for all syndromes, notably otitis media and mastitis where QID remains standard, and pediatric BID requires higher per-dose amounts informed by PK/PD modeling rather than simple frequency reduction [^117Kysaj] [^111zdRxa] [^115fAxVQ] [^115jd7oQ].

> Finally, I should confirm practical stewardship points. When adopting BID, ensure the total daily dose is comparable to QID regimens, verify local susceptibility patterns, and favor BID in patients with adherence barriers. Monitor for clinical response by 48–72 hours and adjust if not improving, and remember that for beta-lactams, maintaining adequate time above MIC is the key pharmacodynamic driver, so underdosing with BID could risk failure if MICs are high or if renal clearance is augmented [^1143nsPo] [^114rueFw].

Cephalexin can be dosed **BID (500 mg every 12 hours)** for uncomplicated UTIs, with similar efficacy to QID dosing and better adherence [^111zdRxa]. BID is also acceptable for skin and soft tissue infections and respiratory tract infections, supported by FDA labeling and clinical data [^117Kysaj] [^112eXHDZ] [^111vbtb1]. For severe infections or high MIC pathogens, **QID remains preferred** to ensure adequate time above MIC [^117GrFR3] [^1143nsPo]. Adjust dose for renal impairment and monitor for clinical response [^117Kysaj] [^113bcM3J].

---

## Evidence supporting BID dosing

Recent evidence supports **BID dosing** in specific clinical scenarios:

- **UTIs**: A retrospective cohort found no significant difference in treatment failure between BID and QID for uncomplicated UTIs, suggesting BID is reasonable and may improve adherence [^111zdRxa].

- **Skin and soft tissue infections**: FDA labeling allows 500 mg BID for 7–14 days, and clinical data support efficacy in uncomplicated cellulitis and SSTIs [^117Kysaj] [^112eXHDZ].

- **Respiratory tract infections**: FDA labeling includes 500 mg BID for 7–14 days for respiratory infections [^111vbtb1].

---

## Pharmacokinetic rationale

Cephalexin's pharmacokinetics support **BID dosing** in some settings:

- **Half-life**: ~1–2 hours, allowing BID to maintain adequate levels for susceptible pathogens.

- **Protein binding**: ~10–15%, supporting effective tissue penetration.

- **Excretion**: Primarily renal; adjust dose in impairment [^112gCEso] [^117Kysaj].

---

## Clinical outcomes and adherence

Clinical outcomes with **BID dosing** are comparable to QID in uncomplicated UTIs and SSTIs, with adherence improved due to fewer daily doses [^111zdRxa].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While BID dosing is supported in some settings, **QID remains preferred** for severe infections or high MIC pathogens to ensure adequate time above MIC [^117Kysaj] [^1143nsPo]. Dose adjustments are required in **renal impairment**, and clinical response should be monitored closely [^117Kysaj] [^113bcM3J].

---

## Current guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines support **BID dosing** in select scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosing** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated UTIs | 500 mg BID | Moderate |
| Skin and soft tissue infections | 500 mg BID | High (FDA labeling) |
| Respiratory tract infections | 500 mg BID | High (FDA labeling) |
| Severe infections or high MIC pathogens | 500 mg QID | High |

---

## Practical implications for clinicians

Clinicians should consider **patient-specific factors** (adherence, renal function, infection severity) when selecting BID vs QID dosing. BID can improve adherence and reduce pill burden, but QID may be needed for severe infections or high MIC pathogens [^111zdRxa] [^117GrFR3].

---

## Conclusion

Cephalexin can be dosed **BID for uncomplicated UTIs, SSTIs, and respiratory infections**, with similar efficacy to QID and better adherence. QID remains preferred for severe infections or high MIC pathogens, and dose adjustments are needed in renal impairment [^111zdRxa] [^117Kysaj] [^117GrFR3].

### Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department [^112AAE7s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

(1) To determine antibiotic choices, route of administration, and outcomes of children treated as outpatients with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center. (2) To determine the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment.

Design

A descriptive case-control study.

Setting

A tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center.

Methods

Medical records of all otherwise healthy children (aged 1–16 yrs) presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (January 1, 2001-December 31, 2003) were reviewed. Data extracted included the following: demographics; clinical presentation; laboratory and microbiology results; management, including choice, dose, and route of antibiotic(s); treatment failures; and time spent in the ED.

Interventions

None.

Main Results

Two hundred sixty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, and their charts were selected for review. The oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (N = 105). Treatment failure occurred in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. The intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (N = 124; 39 received cefazolin alone, and 85 received cefazolin and probenecid). The cefazolin-only group had 12 (31%) treatment failures, whereas the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. More time in the ED (521 ± 287 minutes) and more visits (3.4 ± 2.8) were seen in the intravenous group as compared with the oral group (time in ED, 164 ± 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 ± 1).

Conclusions

Noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis is most commonly treated using first-generation cephalosporins. Treatment with oral antibiotics was effective and required fewer visits and less time in the ED compared with intravenous treatment. Twice-daily cefazolin and probenecid was associated with less treatment failures and admissions than cefazolin alone and may represent a reasonable alternative for children with nonfacial cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging — dose on the day prior to elective surgery/procedure: In patients receiving LMWH bridging for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest administering half the total daily dose of LMWH the day prior to the surgery/procedure over administering the full dose of LMWH the day prior (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence); in trials giving half the total daily LMWH bridging dose the day before surgery/procedure, this approach was associated with low rates of perioperative major bleeding (3.2%, 1.6%), and implementation notes state this guidance may apply more to high-bleed-risk surgery including neuraxial (spinal or epidural) anesthesia and can be done by giving only the morning dose of a twice-daily regimen or approximately 50% of a once-daily regimen.

### Cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily for the treatment of urinary tract infections diagnosed in the emergency department [^111zdRxa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is an oral cephalosporin approved for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Data regarding the optimal dosing interval for cephalexin in UTIs, including uncomplicated UTIs (uUTI) and complicated UTIs (cUTI), remains limited.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare the rates of treatment failure between patients prescribed cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily for the management of uUTIs and cUTIs once discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center cohort study conducted between July 31st, 2016 and July 31st, 2023, included patients who were ≥ 18 years of age, discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of UTI, prescribed cephalexin 500 mg twice or four time daily, and a urine culture positive for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis susceptible to cefazolin. Treatment failure was defined as return to the ED or outpatient clinic with similar or worsening UTI symptoms or change in antibiotic therapy within 30 days of the initial ED visit. Sub-group analyses were performed for both uUTI and cUTIs.

Results

In total, 214 patients were included in this analysis (50.0% in each group). Treatment failure rates between the twice daily and four times daily dosing groups were 18.7% versus 15.0% (P = 0.465). Treatment failure rates in those with uUTI were 14.9% versus 8.1% (P = 0.197) and those with cUTI were 27.3% versus 30.3% (P = 0.786).

Conclusion

For patients with UTIs, there was no statistically significant difference in treatment failure rates between patients prescribed cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily. These findings suggest cephalexin dosed twice daily may be a reasonable option for the outpatient management of UTIs diagnosed in the ED, thus increasing adherence and decreasing cost without statistically compromising effectiveness.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Cephalexin is acid stable and may be given without regard to meals. Following doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g, average peak serum levels of approximately 9, 18, and 32 mcg/mL, respectively, were obtained at 1 hour. Serum levels were detectable 6 hours after administration (at a level of detection of 0.2 mcg/mL).

Distribution:

Cephalexin is approximately 10% to 15% bound to plasma proteins.

Excretion:

Cephalexin is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Studies showed that over 90% of the drug was excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours. During this period, peak urine concentrations following the 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g doses were approximately 1000, 2200, and 5000 mcg/mL respectively.

Drug Interactions:

In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of cephalexin and metformin, plasma metformin mean Cmaxand AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%. No information is available about the interaction of cephalexin and metformin following multiple doses of either drug.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a bactericidal agent that acts by the inhibition of bacterial cell-wall synthesis.

Resistance

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and most isolates of enterococci are resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin is not active against most isolates of Enterobacter spp. Morganella morganii, and Proteus vulgaris. Cephalexin has no activity against Pseudomonas spp., or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is usually cross-resistant to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs.

Antimicrobial Activity

Cephalexin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)

Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates)

Gram-negative bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

Klebsiella pneumoniae

Moraxella catarrhalis

Proteus mirabilis

### Cephalexin [^115mGUXG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of cephalexin in pediatric patients was established in clinical trials for the dosages described in the dosage and administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 701 subjects in 3 published clinical studies of cephalexin, 433 (62%) were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Cephalexin should be administered with careful monitoring in the presence of renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, with or without dialysis). Under such conditions, careful clinical observation and laboratory studies renal function monitoring should be conducted because safe dosage may be lower than that usually recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Monitor patients longer for toxicity and drug interactions due to delayed clearance.

### Probenecid effects on cephalexin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers [^111TDoif]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the effects of probenecid on the Pharmaco Kinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of oral cephalexin in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Cephalexin 1000 mg was administered orally to 11 healthy volunteers following a standardized meal, with and without probenecid 500 mg orally, on two separate days one week apart. Total plasma concentrations of cephalexin and probenecid over a 12 h period were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Standard pharmacokinetic measures and contemporary PK/PD targets were compared.

Results

Probenecid increased the mean (95% CI) cephalexin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-∞) 1.73-fold (1.61–1.85, p < 0.0001), peak concentration 1.37-fold (1.16–1.58, p < 0.01), time to peak concentration 1.45-fold (1.1–1.8, p < 0.01), and half-life 1.33-fold (1.03–1.62, p < 0.05). The effects resulted in clinically meaningful increases in the probability of PK/PD target attainment (PTA). As an example, the PTA of total concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates (MIC ≤ 8 mg/L) for 70% of a 6 h dose interval approached 100% for cephalexin + probenecid while for cephalexin alone it was < 15%.

Conclusions

Probenecid prolonged and flattened the plasma concentration-time curve, enhancing the probability of attaining PK/PD targets. Co-administration of probenecid may expand the clinical benefits of oral cephalexin.

### Spotlight on retapamulin in impetigo and other uncomplicated superficial skin infections [^115E1uKR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical retapamulin (Altabax, Altargo) is the first pleuromutilin antibacterial approved for the treatment of uncomplicated superficial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes in patients aged ≥ 9 months. In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cephalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.

### Topical retapamulin ointment (1%, wt / wt) twice daily for 5 days versus oral cephalexin twice daily for 10 days in the treatment of secondarily infected dermatitis: results of a randomized controlled trial [^117Y3Kw4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

New antibacterial agents with activity against pathogenic strains resistant to established antibiotics are needed to treat patients with secondarily infected dermatitis (SID).

Objective

We sought to determine the clinical safety and efficacy of topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral cephalexin for the treatment of SID.

Methods

Patients with SID were randomly assigned to retapamulin ointment 1% (twice daily [bid]) for 5 days, or oral cephalexin (500 mg bid) for 10 days. The primary efficacy end point was clinical response at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included microbiologic response at follow-up, safety, and compliance.

Results

Retapamulin was as effective as cephalexin (clinical success rates at follow-up: 85.9% and 89.7%, respectively). Microbiologic success rates at follow-up were 87.2% for retapamulin and 91.8% for cephalexin. Retapamulin was well tolerated and the topical formulation was preferred over the oral drug.

Limitations

An imbalance existed in the number of patients with the clinical outcome "unable to determine" (15 retapamulin, 2 cephalexin), mainly because of their failure to attend the study visit. If those who failed to attend visits (who did not withdraw as a result of drug-related events) are removed from the analysis, the clinical success rates are 89.9% for retapamulin and 89.7% for cephalexin.

Conclusions

Retapamulin ointment 1% (bid) for 5 days was as effective as oral cephalexin (bid) for 10 days in treatment of patients with SID, and was well tolerated.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116b6MX7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115EfgMh]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more common in isolates that were cultured from urine submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in the prophylaxis group than those in the control group (figure 2). In urine samples submitted during asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 51 participants with at least one isolate from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants with at least one isolate from the control group; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs 21 [33%] of 64 participants; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 participants vs 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p = 0.002) was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis group than the control group. Over baseline and subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] of 49 participants; p = 0.004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] of 51 participants; p = 0.005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 49 participants; p = 0.006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] of 77 participants, 31 [79%] of 39 participants, 25 [63%] of 40 participants, 27 [63%] of 43 participants, 34 [67%] of 51 participants; p = 0.016) also significantly increased in isolates from urine specimens that were submitted during asymptomatic periods by participants in the prophylaxis group. There was no evidence of increasing resistance over time in the control group. Resistance of urinary isolates that were submitted during asymptomatic periods appeared to decrease at 18 months. There was no evidence that E coli isolated from perianal swabs of participants in the prophylaxis group had significantly more frequent resistance against any of the eight antibiotics tested than did participants in the control group at 6–12 months of the trial.

### Efficacy of cephalexin two vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^114KHMjC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of oral cephalexin twice vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily as therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis. A prospective open-label, observational cohort study was conducted over 18 months (January 2000-June 2001). Children enrolled had an acute onset of symptoms and signs of a tonsillopharyngeal illness and a laboratory-documented GABHS infection. Follow-up examination and laboratory testing occurred 21 ± 4 days following enrollment. Two hundred seventy-one patients were enrolled (intent to treat group): 63 received cephalexin twice daily, 124 received cephalexin three times daily, and 84 received cefadroxil once daily. Fifty-three children did not return for the follow-up visit, leaving 218 patients in the per-protocol group: 54 cephalexin twice-daily treated, 94 cephalexin 3-times daily treated, and 70 cefadroxil once-daily treated. In the per-protocol group, bacteriologic cure for those treated with cephalexin twice daily was 87%, for cephalexin 3 times daily, it was 81% and for cefadroxil once daily it was 81% (p = 0.61). The clinical cure rate for cephalexin twice-daily treatment was 91%; for three-times daily, it was 86%; and for cefadroxil once daily, it was 84% (p = 0.56). Because treatment allocation was not randomized, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for treatment group differences. Younger age of patient was significantly associated with bacteriologic (p = 0.04) and clinical (p = 0.01) failure independent of treatment group but in the adjusted logistic model no differences were found among the 3 treatment regimens. Cephalexin dosed twice daily or three times daily and cefadroxil dosed once daily appear equivalent in bacteriologic and clinical cure of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

Bacterial pneumonia treatment — first-choice options for S. pneumoniae (occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) include amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management, ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL), or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternative parenteral options are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate; for children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day), and add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae).

### Warnings… [^114niUvE]. FDA (DailyMed) (2014). Low credibility.

Cephalexin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. There is some clinical and laboratory evidence of partial cross-allergenicity of the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have been reported to have had severe reactions to both drugs. Any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs, should receive antibiotics cautiously. No exception should be made with regard to cephalexin. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued.

Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. General: Prescribing cephalexin capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Prolonged use of cephalexin may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. Cephalexin should be administered with caution in the presence of markedly impaired renal function. Under such conditions, careful clinical observation and laboratory studies should be made because safe dosage may be lower than that usually recommended. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjuction with antibiotic therapy.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cephalexin capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Metformin: In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of cephalexin and metformin, plasma metformin mean Cmax and AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%. No information is available about the interaction of cephalexin and metformin following multiple doses of either drug. Although not observed in this study, adverse effects could potentially arise from co-administration of cephalexin and metformin by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter systems. Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking cephalexin and metformin.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

14.5 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label International study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 21 days to sequential intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated and 53% of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication. Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with complicated erysipelas. These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs. The overall success rates in the evaluable patients and the clinical success by pathogen are shown in Tables 14 and 15.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113LPs5M]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged. Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal. Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential. A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children. This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily. However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily. The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication. However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence, cause less impact on the human microbiota, lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

### Once-daily dosing of delayed-release oral mesalamine (400-mg tablet) is as effective as twice-daily dosing for maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis [^1115eMpa]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The practice of dosing mesalamines in divided doses for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) began with sulfasalazine and was driven by sulfapyridine toxicity. This convention and the assumption that dosing multiple times a day is necessary to treat UC had not been challenged until recently. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing of delayed-release mesalamine (Asacol 400-mg tablets) compared with twice-daily dosing for maintaining remission in UC patients.

Methods

A multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 12-month, active-control trial was conducted to assess the noninferiority of delayed-release mesalamine 1.6–2.4 g/day administered once daily compared with twice daily in patients with mild-to-moderate UC currently in clinical remission. The primary end point was maintenance of clinical remission at month 6.

Results

A total of 1023 patients were randomized and dosed. The primary objective of noninferiority was met. At month 6, 90.5% of patients receiving once-daily dosing had maintained clinical remission, compared with 91.8% of patients receiving twice-daily dosing (95% confidence interval for twice daily - once daily, -2.3 to 4.9). At month 12, 85.4% of patients receiving once-daily dosing had maintained clinical remission, compared with 85.4% of patients receiving twice-daily dosing (95% confidence interval for twice daily - once daily, -4.6 to 4.7). Both regimens had low rates of withdrawals as a result of adverse events and serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Once-daily dosing of delayed-release mesalamine at doses of 1.6–2.4 g/day was shown to be as effective as twice-daily dosing for maintenance of clinical remission in patients with UC.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15–78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; p = 0.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; p = 0.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Outcome assessment in cellulitis clinical trials: is telephone follow up sufficient? [^113Kcirx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has scrutinized clinical trial methodology in cellulitis, partly because the definition and timing of cure are debatable. We analysed the validity of telephone self-report as a proxy for in-person follow up in a cellulitis treatment trial comparing cephalexin alone with cephalexin-plus-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our results demonstrate poor agreement between these two methods of outcome determination and have implications for future cellulitis clinical trial design and clinical management.

### Frequency of dosing of cephalexin for oral step-down therapy of pediatric osteoarticular infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [^113R34ep]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoarticular infections are one of the more common invasive bacterial infections encountered in children. There exist significant practice variations in both the diagnosis and treatment of such infections. However, the practice of transitioning from parenteral therapy to oral antibiotics has been well validated by several studies. For methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), cephalexin is often recommended. Prospective, controlled data regarding optimal dosing of cephalexin in pediatric osteomyelitis are not available. We sought to review our retrospective, uncontrolled data on four times daily (QID) versus three times daily (TID) dosing of cephalexin for pediatric osteoarticular infections. Children ≥ 1 month to < 18 years of age admitted to Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis between January 1, 2002, and November 30, 2007, were identified and previously reported. Only patients with culture-positive MSSA infections are included in this report. Demographic and clinical data were manually extracted from the electronic medical record. Fifty-nine patients were treated with cephalexin and had records available for review through our electronic medical record. Thirty-eight patients (64.4%) were treated QID, and 21 patients (35.6%) were treated TID. Clinical cure was achieved in all patients with only one adverse event occurring in the QID group. In this retrospective chart review of children with osteoarticular infections caused by MSSA treated with cephalexin, similar clinical outcomes were found with QID versus TID dosing.

### A comparison of the efficacy and safety of mupirocin cream and cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema [^114tRxe9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of mupirocin calcium cream were compared with those of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema. In this multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy study, 159 patients with secondarily infected eczema (suitable for treatment with topical antimicrobials) and a total skin infection rating scale score of 8 or more were randomized to receive either topical mupirocin cream three times daily or oral cephalexin, 250 mg four times daily, for 10 days (intent-to-treat group). Clinical success (per-protocol group), defined in part as a patient with a response of improvement in the skin infection rating scale, was similar in the two groups: 89% for mupirocin (n = 44) and 82% for cephalexin (n = 38) [P = 0.29; 95% confidence interval (-8.4%, 22.5%)]. Bacteriological success (intent-to-treat group), defined as a patient with a response of eradication, improvement or colonization of bacteria at the end of therapy, however, was significantly higher for mupirocin [50% and 28% in the mupirocin (n = 48) and cephalexin (n = 47) groups, respectively; P = 0.005]. Mupirocin cream was as well tolerated as cephalexin; 9% and 13% of patients reported adverse events related or possibly related to study medication in the mupirocin and cephalexin groups, respectively. The most common adverse events overall were diarrhoea and nausea. Mupirocin cream applied three times daily is as effective clinically and superior bacteriologically compared with oral cephalexin given four times daily in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema of limited depth and severity. Mupirocin cream is as well tolerated as oral cephalexin, and more patients prefer the topical regimen, which should improve patient compliance.

14.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin hydrochloride 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin hydrochloride.

14.5 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta­-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label International study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 21 days to sequential intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated and 53% of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication. Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with complicated erysipelas. These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs. The overall success rates in the evaluable patients and the clinical success by pathogen are shown in Tables 14 and 15.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in women who experience post-coital UTIs — prophylaxis taken before or after sexual intercourse has been shown to be effective and safe, with a significant reduction in recurrence rates, and intermittent dosing is associated with decreased risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms and vaginitis. Evidence includes a 1990 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 27 sexually active women with a median age of 23 showing post-coital antibiotics were more effective than placebo in reducing UTI recurrences, and a study of 135 women where post-coital dosing was as effective as daily dosing. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with sexual activity-related rUTIs, with recommended instructions to take a single dose of an antibiotic immediately before or after sexual intercourse. Dosing options for prophylaxis include: TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg; TMP-SMX 80 mg/400 mg; Nitrofurantoin 50 to 100 mg; Cephalexin 250 mg.

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for cefazolin against Enterobacteriaceae that were published in January 2010 have been revised by the Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, based on the examination of recent data about in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic characteristics and published clinical outcome studies. The new breakpoints, to be formally published in January 2011, have increased the minimum inhibitory concentration interpretive criteria by one 2-fold dilution, linked to an adult dosing schedule of 2 g every 8 h intravenously. Disk diffusion zone diameter correlates, shown to be impossible to define with the January 2010 interpretive criteria, have been able to be set for the new interpretive criteria. Diagnostic laboratories will continue to need to test cephalothin to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporins cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, cephalexin, and loracarbef.

### Inked and infected: a case that highlights the emerging concern of tattoo-associated [^114wXWHE]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights a rare M. abscessus infection following a tattoo procedure. M. abscessus can cause chronic skin, soft tissue, and lung infections in both immunocompromised and otherwise healthy patients, as seen here and in several reported cases. Tattoo-related infections have been attributed to poor infection control practices. Commonly, infections are caused by contaminated ink or nonsterile or tap water used to dilute black ink to create shades of gray, resulting in infections localized to the gray pigment within tattoos.,

The clinical presentation of NTM infection in tattoos is nonspecific. Clinically, the diagnosis of tattoo-related NTM infection should be suspected in a patient with an acute eruption of papules and pustules several days to weeks following a tattoo that is refractory to treatment with empiric antibiotics, such as cephalexin or doxycycline. Punch skin biopsy with AFB culture and Fite stain should be performed to confirm infection. Histology reveals nonspecific dermal inflammatory infiltrates with lymphohistiocytic reactions and granulomas.

Following organism identification, susceptibility testing is essential to guide antimicrobial selection. Treatment includes surgical debridement with at least 2 active agents, such as azithromycin, clofazimine, omadacycline, linezolid, or bedaquiline. If the isolate is susceptible, as in our case, azithromycin should be used due to its tolerability, safety, and efficacy profile. M. abscessus often displays macrolide resistance through an inducible ribosomal methylase encoded by erm(41), necessitating alternative therapies. The duration of therapy is generally 4–6 months.,

This is the first reported case of tattoo-associated M. abscessus infection successfully treated with omadacycline-azithromycin combination therapy. Omadacycline, a novel aminomethylcycline antibiotic approved in 2018 for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin infections, has been reported to have favorable treatment outcomes against M. abscessu s. Omadacycline's once-daily oral dosing and favorable side effect profile make it a promising adjunct in M. abscessus combination therapy.

### Β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: a dose-response meta-analysis [^111iSPHV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have contributed significantly in extending human life expectancy by 23 years. Widespread resistance among common bacterial pathogens and slow development of replacement compounds or alternative therapies threaten these recent gains. It is estimated that approximately 1.27 million annual deaths are attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic resistance is selected for when bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics that would otherwise inhibit their growth or kill them, making the remedy itself one of the primary drivers and risk factors for antibiotic resistance. The relationship between antibiotics and resistance is dose dependent: Higher antibiotic consumption correlates with more resistant infections. The association between level of antibiotics administered and resistance development has been demonstrated at the bacterial colony level, at the individual-patient level, and among human populations at the country level.

However, resistance is not necessarily a persistent trait of pathogens, and decreased resistance rates have been demonstrated following antibiotic withdrawal both at the individual and community levels. Prolonged treatment to ensure clearing the infection, therefore, comes at the cost of providing more sustained periods over which resistant pathogens have a competitive advantage. This has led to a recent challenge in the dogma of always completing antibiotic courses. For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that shorter treatment schedules for both hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia yield equivalent outcomes to longer courses, but with fewer infection recurrences and reduced rates of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the patient-level temporality of resistance emergence and waning thereby offers important insight into prescriptive practice.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have provided useful indication of this temporality. Costelloe et al investigated subsequent antibiotic resistance in individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care, showing a 2.5 increase in odds of resistance within 2 months of treatment for urinary tract infections, which waned to 1.3 within 12 months. However, among those treated for respiratory tract infections, the odds of antibiotic resistance remained 2.4 times higher (compared to those not treated with antibiotics) over the whole year. Bakhit et al pooled analyses across bacterial species instead of infection site, showing a 4.2 increase in odds of resistance after receiving penicillin-class treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae within the first week posttreatment, waning to a 1.7 increase in odds after 1 month. A similar trend was found for cephalosporin-class treatment of this pathogen: 2.2 increase in odds within the first week, waning to 1.6 increase in odds after 1 month.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113679yM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotics indications and dosing — Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne treatment for years; they are indicated for use in moderate to severe inflammatory acne and should be used in combination with a topical retinoid and BP. Evidence supports the efficacy of tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), trimethoprim, erythromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered first-line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated because of other circumstances (ie, pregnancy, < 8 years of age, or allergy). Minocycline in an extended release form appears safest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found for efficacy; doxycycline appears effective in the 1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range, and subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to 40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients with moderate inflammatory acne. Azithromycin has been primarily studied in the treatment of acne in open label studies with different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3 times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycin being an effective treatment in the time span evaluated — usually 2 to 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days per month of azithromycin to daily doxycycline did show superiority of doxycycline. Outside of case reports, there is 1 small, double-blind study showing that TMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline.

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I2 = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based.

### Twice-and thrice-daily cephalexin dosing for Staphylococcus aureus infections in children [^115fAxVQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is used for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections in children. Although 4 times daily dosing is recommended, less frequent dosing regimens are often prescribed to improve treatment acceptability and adherence. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model of cephalexin in children to determine a twice-daily (BID) and thrice-daily (TID) cephalexin dosing regimen for MSSA infections.

Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. The dataset used was from a prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of orally administered cephalexin in 12 children 1–16 years of age with bone and joint infections. Simulations were performed to determine a BID and TID dosing regimen so that ≥ 90% of children in this age group would achieve the pharmacodynamic target for MSSA (ie, time that the free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval).

Results

The final model was 1 compartment with a transit compartment model to account for delay in oral absorption. For BID dosing, doses of 22–45 and 80mg/kg were required for MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1–2 and 4mg/L, respectively. For TID dosing, the respective required doses were 15–25 and 45mg/kg.

Conclusions

Our study proposes a BID and TID cephalexin dosing regimen that can be prospectively evaluated. Through reducing the dose frequency of this widely prescribed antibiotic, we can reduce the medication burden for children and improve treatment compliance for MSSA infections.

### Occurrence of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in the four months after treatment of an index episode with amoxicillin once-daily or twice-daily or with cephalexin [^1116x8JG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prospective studies using bacterial eradication as the endpoint have demonstrated that once-daily amoxicillin is as effective as twice-daily amoxicillin for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine, in a retrospective study, whether treatment of symptomatic GABHS pharyngitis with once-daily amoxicillin was as effective in preventing clinical recurrences as twice-daily amoxicillin or cephalexin in pediatric office practice, using patient-initiated return visits for streptococcal pharyngitis as a pragmatic, clinical endpoint.

Methods

The charts of consecutive patients 2 years of age and older with laboratory-proven GABHS pharyngitis for a period of 2 years were reviewed to identify index cases of streptococcal pharyngitis and subsequent episodes. Age, weight, antibiotic treatment and time from index to subsequent episodes of GABHS pharyngitis were recorded.

Results

In 1402 index episodes, patients received amoxicillin once-daily (231), amoxicillin twice-daily (846) or cephalexin (325). The risk of symptomatic streptococcal pharyngitis in the 4 months after treatment of the index episode was not statistically different among the 3 treatment groups: amoxicillin once-daily (15.1%), amoxicillin twice-daily (19.6%) and cephalexin (19.1%). There was a trend toward reduction in the risk of recurrences in the 6 weeks after completion of antibiotics in the cephalexin (9%) group compared with the combined amoxicillin (13%) groups.

Conclusions

Amoxicillin once-daily or twice-daily was equally effective in terms of frequency of recurrence of symptomatic GABHS pharyngitis.

### Role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: does the dose matter? [^1143nsPo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Antibiotic dose is important in determining serum area-under-the-curve (AUC) and peak serum concentration (C(max)), as well as the time the serum concentration remains over the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC). However, dose is not the sole determinant of these factors; they are modified by absorption, clearance, and frequency of dosing. It is difficult to relate dose to clinical outcome in humans, but pharmacodynamic parameters (AUC/MIC, C(max)/MIC, or T > MIC) have been related to clinical and bacteriological efficacy or emergence of resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and beta-lactams.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Use of pharmacodynamic principles to inform β-lactam dosing: "S" does not always mean success [^114rueFw]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Dose optimization is one of the key strategies for enhancing antimicrobial stewardship. There have been tremendous strides in our understanding of antibiotic exposure-response relationships over the past 25 years. For many antibiotics, the "pharmacodynamic" or the exposure variable associated with outcome has been identified. With advances in mathematical modeling, it is possible to apply our understanding of antimicrobial pharmacodynamics (PD) into clinical practice and design empirical regimens that have a high probability of achieving the PD target linked to effect. By optimizing antibiotic doses to achieve PD targets predictive of efficacy, clinicians can improve care and minimize drug toxicity. For β-lactams, the PD parameter most predictive of maximal bactericidal activity is the duration of time free drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during the dosing interval (fT > MIC). Unfortunately, the conventional intermittent β-lactam dosing schemes often used in practice have suboptimal PD profiles. Prolonging the infusion time of β-lactams is one method to maximize the probability of achieving concentrations in excess of the MIC for the majority of the dosing interval, especially against pathogens with elevated MIC values. Prolonged infusions of intravenous β-lactams are not only associated with improved probability of target attainment (PTA) profiles but offer possible cost savings and greater potential for reducing emergence of resistance relative to intermittent infusions.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral cephalexin in children with osteoarticular infections [^113gdiN5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarticular infections lead to significant morbidity in children. Cephalexin has in vitro activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, a predominant pathogen in osteoarticular infection. However, cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are poorly described in children. This study described cephalexin PK in children treated for osteoarticular infection and assessed the proportion of children achieving surrogate PK/PD target for efficacy in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infection.

Methods

Children with osteoarticular infection, 1 to 18 years of age, were eligible for this study if they were receiving oral cephalexin per standard of care. PK plasma samples were collected at specified times after multiple doses. PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis. PK/PD target for efficacy was calculated using the child's PK parameters, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate when available and previously described MIC of 2 and 4 mg/L.

Results

Twelve children were enrolled and PK profiles were obtained from 11 of them. Median age was 7 years, and median cephalexin dose was 40 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours. Median apparent oral clearance, apparent oral volume of distribution and elimination half-life (T1/2) were 0.29 L/h/kg, 0.44 L/kg and 1.1 h, respectively. Time above MIC (T > MIC) was greater than 40% of the dosing interval in 100%, 90% and 80% of the children when MICs were 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin achieved optimal plasma exposure and was well tolerated in children with osteoarticular infection. Correlation between osteoarticular infection clinical outcome and PK/PD parameters needs further evaluation.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^1149DoGs]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Our antibiotic therapy protocol was thus in accordance with previous studies which suggested that higher than licensed dosing regimens would be necessary in patients with ARC. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been the most studied antibiotic in this context, where previous studies demonstrated that standard intermittent dosing regimens were unlikely to achieve optimal antibiotic exposure. Although other studies suggested a significant improvement of PK/PD target attainment rates when extended or continuous infusions are used, patients with CL CR ≥ 150–170 ml/min remained at risk for empirical underexposure. In this context, higher than licensed doses of piperacillin-tazobactam (20 g/2.5 g/day by continuous infusion) allowed attaining the empirical PK/PD target in 100% patients with CL CR ≥ 150 ml/min, without excessive dosing.

Data on other β-lactams in patients with ARC are scarce. For ceftriaxone, we previously demonstrated high rates of empirical target underdosing in patients with CL CR ≥ 150 ml/min. In this context, Monte Carlo simulations suggested a dose of 2 g twice a day to achieve a 100% fT > MIC when targeting a theoretical MIC at the upper limit of the susceptibility range. Dosing simulations for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid also supported the use of increased dosing regimens (2 g four times daily) for ARC patients when using a target MIC of 8 mg/l and a pharmacodynamic target of 50% fT > MIC, with little accumulation of clavulanic acid. Considering cefazolin, only an ancillary pilot study suggested a higher rate of underdosing in ARC patients, especially when PK/PD targets were adjusted to the inoculum effect.

### Mupirocin calcium (mupirocin) [^116sVvnA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin cream for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions (e.g., lacerations, sutured wounds, and abrasions not more than 10 cm in length or 100 cm²in total area) was compared with that of oral cephalexin in 2 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials. Clinical efficacy rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 96.1% for mupirocin cream (n = 231) and 93.1% for oral cephalexin (n = 219). Pathogen eradication rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations were 100% for both mupirocin cream and oral cephalexin.

Pediatrics

There were 93 pediatric subjects aged 2 weeks to 16 years enrolled per protocol in the secondarily infected skin lesion trials, although only 3 were younger than 2 years of age in the population treated with mupirocin cream. Subjects were randomized to either 10 days of topical mupirocin cream 3 times daily or 10 days of oral cephalexin (250 mg 4 times daily for subjects greater than 40 kg or 25 mg per kg per day oral suspension in 4 divided doses for subjects less than or equal to 40 kg). Clinical efficacy at follow-up (7 to 12 days post-therapy) in the per-protocol populations was 97.7% (43 of 44) for mupirocin cream and 93.9% (46 of 49) for cephalexin.

### Oral cephalexin population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis in infants 7–60 Days old [^116KGCv2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data to guide oral antibiotic dosing in neonates and young infants, particularly for intravenous (IV) to oral transition. Cephalexin is a promising oral treatment for neonatal pathogens, including Enterobacterales and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). However, maturational changes in gastrointestinal absorption and kidney function during early infancy complicate extrapolation of dosing from older populations. We evaluated cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and simulated dosing strategies to achieve pharmacodynamic (PD) targets in infants ≤ 60 days old.

Methods

This prospective, single-center study enrolled infants 0–60 days receiving cephalexin either as part of routine clinical care or as a single 25 mg/kg study dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Simulations assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) for free time above MIC (fT > MIC) for ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% of the dosing interval across MICs 1–16 mg/L, assuming 10% protein binding. We also simulated the cumulative fractional response (CFR) using typical MIC distributions for Enterobacterales and MSSA.

Results

The analysis included 144 samples from 33 infants with median post-natal age 31 days (range 9–56) and median gestational age 37 weeks (range 29–41). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time best described the data. Weight influenced apparent volume of distribution and apparent clearance. Additionally, we identified a maturational effect on absorption rate using post-natal age and on apparent clearance using post-menstrual age. For Enterobacterales, 25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours achieved > 90% CFR for a 50% fT > MIC target. For MSSA, 25 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours was sufficient. Higher or more frequent dosing was required to meet the more stringent 70% fT > MIC target.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin can achieve necessary PD targets in infants 7–60 days old. These findings support the use of model-informed dosing strategies to guide safe and effective oral antibiotic use in early infancy, including for IV-to-oral transition.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Low cefpirome levels during twice daily dosing in critically ill septic patients: pharmacokinetic modelling calls for more frequent dosing [^111TaXHS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure plasma levels and pharmacokinetics of cefpirome in critically ill septic patients with normal renal function. To use the pharmacokinetic model to simulate alternate dosing regimens and identify those that predict sustained levels.

Design and Setting

A prospective, open-label, descriptive study in a 22-bed, multidisciplinary, adult ICU in a university-affiliated, tertiary referral hospital.

Patients

Twelve adults with normal renal function on enrollment and with suspected or documented sepsis in whom cefpirome was judged to be the appropriate therapy by the managing clinician.

Interventions

Cefpirome 2 g was infused intravenously over 3 min every 12 h. Timed blood samples were taken prior to and during two dosing intervals. Urine was collected for creatinine clearance determination.

Measurements and Results

Two patients were non-evaluable due to renal dysfunction post-enrollment. The median cefpirome trough level was 1.1 mg/l (range 0.5–8.1 mg/l) after the initial dose and 1.4 mg/l (range < 0.5–15.9 mg/l) at 'steady state'. The volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives were greater and more variable than in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic simulation predicted that more frequent bolus dosing, increased doses and continuous infusions would result in concentrations greater than 4 mg/l for over 60% of the dosing interval for all patients.

Conclusions

Cefpirome 2 g twice daily produced low plasma troughs in a number of patients. Our data suggest that this drug regimen may be inadequate for successful treatment of difficult-to-treat infections in critically ill patients with normal renal function.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^111t7Zb7]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

MSSA acute bacterial arthritis antimicrobial choice and cephalexin dosing — For children with ABA caused by MSSA, a beta-lactam agent is preferred for initial parenteral treatment (cefazolin, nafcillin or oxacillin) and for definitive oral treatment (cephalexin). "High dose" cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses) was first studied and remains adequate as convalescent therapy following initial parenteral therapy and surgical management. Modeling using a pharmacodynamic driver of 40% T > MIC suggests higher doses may be required for strains with MICs of 2 and 4 mg/L, and the MIC90 for MSSA is 4–8 mg/L, suggesting oral therapy should follow initial parenteral therapy, surgical debridement, and clinical response. The higher doses (120 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours) needed to achieve this target in 100%, 90% and 80% of children for MSSA with MICs of 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively, do not appear necessary for good outcomes after oral transition. Using the same target, proposed cephalexin dosages (administered Q8H) are 45 mg/kg/day for MSSA with an MIC of 1 mg/L; 75 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 2 mg/L; and 135 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 4 mg/L, with those doses proposed for children weighing 10–15 kg.

### Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin [^112FMZJx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir.

Methods

Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed.

Results

Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil.

Conclusions

Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

### Clinical outcomes of failing to dose-reduce cephalosporin antibiotics in older adults with CKD [^114PjLEf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Current dosing recommendations for cephalosporin antibiotics are on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies and are frequently ignored in practice. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical outcomes of failing to dose-reduce cephalosporin antibiotics in CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Retrospective cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada using linked population-based health care databases. Nine thousand three hundred forty-seven outpatients (median age 83; interquartile range, 77–88 years; 57% women) with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and no prior history of dialysis were dispensed oral cephalexin, cefuroxime, or cefprozil between April of 2007 and March of 2016. Two thirds of the patients (6253 of 9347) received a higher than recommended daily dose of cephalexin (> 1000 mg), cefuroxime (> 500 mg), or cefprozil (> 500 mg). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter (emergency room visit or hospital admission) with a condition listed as a possible side-effect of cephalosporins. Secondary outcomes were antibiotic treatment failure and all-cause mortality. All measures were assessed in the 30 days after cephalosporin initiation.

Results

Patients who received a higher than recommended dose of a cephalosporin antibiotic were similar in multiple indicators of baseline health to patients who received a reduced dose. Overall, 6% of patients presented to hospital with a possible cephalosporin side-effect, 13% failed antibiotic treatment, and 3% died. Compared with a reduced dose, receiving a higher dose of antibiotic was not associated with a different rate of side-effects (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.20), treatment failure (1.01; 0.88 to 1.15), or death (0.99; 0.76 to 1.29).

Conclusions

In this study we failed to demonstrate any association between the dose of cephalosporin antibiotic administered to elderly patients with CKD and the risk of side-effects leading to hospitalization, treatment failure, or mortality.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS:

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS:

For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in

equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses

every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

ADULTS:

ADULTS:

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatisis a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism. For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended. Generally, Ceftriaxone for Injection therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

In a controlled double-blind study conducted in the US, moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for ten days) were compared with cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily for ten days) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) at the 7 to 21 day post-therapy test of cure visit was 90% for moxifloxacin and 89% for cefuroxime.

An additional non-comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and to evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days. All patients (n = 336) underwent antral puncture in this study. Clinical success rates and eradication/presumed eradication rates at the 21 to 37 day follow-up visit were 97% (29 out of 30) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 83% (15 out of 18) for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 80% (24 out of 30) for Haemophilus influenzae.

14.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin-treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

### Once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing with intravenous aminoglycosides for cystic fibrosis [^113QuZKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cystic fibrosis, who are chronically colonised with the organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often require multiple courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 31 January 2019. We also searched online trial registries. Date of latest search: 25 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multiple-daily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study; authors also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 15 studies for possible inclusion in the review. Five studies reporting results from a total of 354 participants (aged 5 to 50 years) were included in this review. All studies compared once-daily dosing with thrice-daily dosing. One cross-over trial had 26 participants who received the first-arm treatment but only 15 received the second arm. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias. There was little or no difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume in one second, mean difference (MD) 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.81 to 3.48, moderate-quality evidence); forced vital capacity, MD 0.29 (95% CI -6.58 to 7.16, low-quality evidence); % weight for height, MD -0.82 (95% CI -3.77 to 2.13, low-quality evidence); body mass index, MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.42, low-quality evidence); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% CI 0.04 to 7.96, moderate-quality evidence). Once-daily treatment in children probably improved the percentage change in creatinine, MD -8.20 (95% CI -15.32 to -1.08, moderate-quality evidence), but showed no difference in adults, MD 3.25 (95% CI -1.82 to 8.33, moderate-quality evidence). The included trials did not report antibiotic resistance patterns or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Once- and three-times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children.

14.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of AVELOX 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the AVELOX treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for AVELOX and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

14.6 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7–14 days to an IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label International study compared AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7–21 days to sequential IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the AVELOX treated and 53% of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication. Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with complicated erysipelas. These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs. The overall success rates in the evaluable patients and the clinical success by pathogen are shown in Tables 12 and 13.

### Intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid versus oral cephalexin for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections: a double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^113nJwCo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to determine if cephalexin 500mg orally four times daily was non-inferior to cefazolin 2g intravenously daily plus probenecid 1g orally daily in the management of patients with uncomplicated mild-moderate skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) presenting to the ED.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicentre, double dummy-blind, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial conducted at two tertiary care teaching hospitals in Canada. Patients were enrolled if they presented to the ED with an uncomplicated SSTI, and randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to oral cephalexin or intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid for up to 7 days. The primary outcome was failure of therapy at 72hours. Clinical cure at 7 days, intravenous to oral medication transition admission to hospital and adverse events were also evaluated.

Results

206 patients were randomised with 104 patients in the cephalexin group and 102 in the cefazolin and probenecid group. The proportion of patients failing therapy at 72hours was similar between the treatment groups (4.2% and 6.1%, risk difference 1.9%, 95%CI -3.7% to 7.6%). Clinical cure at 7days was not significantly different (100% and 97.7%, risk difference -2.3%, 95%CI -6.7% to 0.8%).

Conclusion

Cephalexin at appropriate doses appears to be a safe and effective alternative to outpatient parenteral cefazolin in the treatment of uncomplicated mild-moderate SSTIs who present to the ED.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117GrFR3]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^113aMFVp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Results

The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients who were and were not on prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis therapy are shown in table 1. Forty-seven of 84 participants were prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis therapy for over a year, in the context of their routine medical care; in 66% these were macrolides, specifically, 29 patients were on azithromycin 250 mg thrice weekly and 8 on 500 mg thrice weekly; 2 were on clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily). Other prescribed antibiotics were co-trimoxazole (960 mg once daily or 1920 mg, divided into two doses, thrice weekly), ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily), doxycycline (100 mg once daily), amoxicillin (250 mg twice daily), cephalexin (500 mg twice daily) and phenoxy-methyl penicillin (250 mg twice daily).

Table 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants

There were no significant differences in the proportions of patients with COPD and bronchiectasis in the two groups (p = 0.157). All participants were regularly receiving the influenza vaccine and had pneumococcal vaccine. Lung function as indicated by the spirometry results was comparable between the two study groups (table 1).

A significantly higher proportion of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) were on antibiotic prophylaxis therapy (66%), compared with seven in the comparator group (19%) (p < 0.0001); 90% of the patients with CVID were on immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

Seventy-nine per cent of the participants were prescribed a rescue pack of antibiotics to keep at home as an SMP; 47% of the rescue packs contained amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 20% doxycycline, 14% quinolones (either ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), 15% amoxicillin and 7.5% had macrolides either azithromycin or clarithromycin.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Wk6bV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — duration and regimen considerations are summarized as follows: A Cochrane review included 13 studies enrolling 1622 women comparing single-dose to short-course (4–7 days) antimicrobials, and in one included moderate-quality study of nitrofurantoin, 714 women received 7 days or single-dose therapy; seven days was more effective than a single dose in preventing low birth weight (relative risk [RR], 1.65 95% CI, 1.06–2.57), with no differences in pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. The review concludes that current recommendations of 4 to 7-day duration of treatment for ASB during pregnancy are reasonable but based on low-quality evidence. The optimal duration of therapy will be antimicrobial-specific; nitrofurantoin and β-lactam antimicrobials (usually ampicillin or cephalexin) are preferred because of safety in pregnant women, but these agents are less effective as short-course therapy for acute cystitis. A single dose of fosfomycin is effective for clearance of bacteria in urine, but clinical evaluation in pregnancy is limited and outcomes such as pyelonephritis and preterm labor are not yet well studied. Research needs include studies evaluating the optimal duration for different regimens, including fosfomycin, and impacts on neonatal outcomes.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^11549o9Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infection in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent renal damage. Published guidelines recommend treatment of acute pyelonephritis initially with intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy for seven to 14 days though there is no consensus on the duration of either IV or oral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: June 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or weight mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eighteen trials (2612 children) were eligible for inclusion. No significant differences were found in persistent renal damage at six months (one trial, 306 infants: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.03) or in duration of fever (WMD 0.80, 95% CI -4.41 to - 6.01) between oral cefixime therapy (14 days) and IV therapy (three days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (three trials, 315 children: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.37) were found between IV therapy (3–4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7–14 days. In addition no significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (one trial, 179 children, persistent symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53).

Authors' Conclusions

These results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral cefixime or with short courses (2–4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. Trials are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy and if other oral antibiotics can be used in the initial treatment of acute pyelonephritis.
