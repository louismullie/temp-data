## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about atrial fibrillation treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why AF matters. Then, I should verify the three foundational pillars of management. Next, I will examine stroke prevention and risk stratification, followed by rate versus rhythm control strategies. After that, I need to check when and how to use antiarrhythmic drugs, when to consider catheter ablation, and how to handle special populations like heart failure. Finally, I should integrate shared decision-making, risk factor modification, and a practical algorithm, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why AF treatment is urgent. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, prevalence rises with age, and it drives stroke, heart failure, hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life; importantly, many patients are diagnosed only after a stroke or decompensation, underscoring the need for proactive, guideline-directed care and integrated models to deliver it consistently [^2535a9f2] [^a4a37476].

> I need to ensure I anchor on the three pillars of AF management. Contemporary care rests on stroke prevention with anticoagulation, symptom control with rate or rhythm strategies, and comprehensive risk factor modification; these are not mutually exclusive and should be individualized, with periodic reassessment as risks and preferences evolve [^d5defeb5] [^576f5b3e] [^0000251d].

> Next, I should review stroke prevention and risk stratification. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who needs anticoagulation; I should confirm thresholds. For nonvalvular AF, use CHA2DS2-VASc to estimate annual thromboembolic risk: initiate anticoagulation when risk is ≥ 2% per year (men ≥ 2, women ≥ 3), consider it when 1–2% per year (men 1, women 2), and generally avoid when < 1% per year; DOACs are preferred over warfarin except in mitral stenosis or mechanical valves, and aspirin alone is not recommended for stroke prevention in AF [^754f89b5] [^974e97a2] [^2af23f4b]. I should double-check peri-cardioversion anticoagulation: continue OAC for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion and long term if thromboembolic risk factors persist, regardless of apparent rhythm status, to mitigate thromboembolism [^e792c7e0].

> Now, rate versus rhythm control. Let me think about the historical stance and recent shifts. Traditionally, rate control is first-line for most patients because it achieves similar or better outcomes with fewer adverse effects than routine rhythm control; however, emerging evidence supports earlier rhythm control in selected patients to improve symptoms, reduce AF progression, and potentially improve hard outcomes, so I should individualize based on age, symptom burden, AF duration, comorbidities, and patient preference [^96883c09] [^1ee47072] [^1c69593c]. Wait, I initially thought strict rate targets were mandatory; hold on, I should verify that. Lenient rate control to a resting heart rate < 100–110 bpm is acceptable in stable patients without heart failure, whereas stricter targets may be needed in symptomatic patients or those with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy risk [^2cc73de4] [^59b51e1b].

> I will now examine rate-control options and dosing principles. Beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line for rate control; digoxin is less effective during activity but can be added for resting rate control or in heart failure, and AV nodal ablation with pacing is a last-resort strategy for refractory cases, ideally after considering catheter ablation of AF itself [^59b51e1b] [^ea2f8256]. I should confirm that rate control must be assessed during rest and activity, and that persistent uncontrolled tachycardia can precipitate tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, which is reversible with adequate control [^96883c09].

> For rhythm control, I need to check drug selection by substrate to minimize proarrhythmia. In patients without structural heart disease, flecainide or propafenone are reasonable; with coronary disease or heart failure, amiodarone or dofetilide are preferred; dronedarone is an option in selected patients but should be avoided in decompensated or advanced heart failure; sotalol is an alternative when QT risk is acceptable and renal function is adequate; always prioritize safety over efficacy when choosing AADs [^51e2c9d5] [^aa923bdd]. Hold on, I should verify that AADs require close monitoring for QT prolongation, bradyarrhythmias, and organ toxicity, especially with amiodarone, and that drug–drug interactions are common and consequential [^aa923bdd].

> Catheter ablation deserves careful consideration. Let me reconsider its position in the sequence. Ablation is now a Class 1 first-line therapy in selected patients, particularly those with symptomatic paroxysmal AF and relatively preserved left atrial size, and is reasonable earlier in persistent AF or when AADs fail or are not tolerated; pulmonary vein isolation is the cornerstone, with expanding roles for non-PV triggers in persistent AF; I should confirm candidacy and discuss procedural risks, success, and recurrence realistically [^df8ca469] [^3073cfa5] [^e579514a]. But wait, what if the patient has longstanding persistent AF or significant LA enlargement? In those scenarios, expectations should be tempered and repeat procedures may be needed, so shared decision-making is essential [^e579514a].

> Special populations require tailored strategies. In heart failure, I should confirm that rhythm control, including ablation, can improve symptoms, ventricular function, and outcomes in selected patients; the CAN-TREAT algorithm helps structure care, and early rhythm control may be beneficial when feasible; rate targets are often more stringent to avoid tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy [^d94c9886] [^1ee47072]. In older adults, I need to balance efficacy with fall risk, frailty, and polypharmacy; lenient rate control and careful anticoagulation management are often appropriate, and ablation can still be considered when symptoms are disabling and life expectancy is reasonable [^notfound]. For device-detected AF or atrial high-rate episodes, I should confirm that stroke risk is assessed using the same CHA2DS2-VASc framework and that anticoagulation decisions are individualized based on burden, duration, and clinical context, recognizing evolving evidence [^0000251d].

> I should double-check that shared decision-making is embedded throughout. Treatment choices often hinge on patient values, symptom goals, and tolerance of risk; evidence-based decision aids and digital tools can improve knowledge, reduce decisional conflict, and enhance adherence, so I should offer them when available and revisit decisions periodically as risks and preferences change [^4aeaf635] [^c176a237] [^576f5b3e]. Hold on, I should verify that I also address lifestyle and risk factor modification: weight loss, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, sleep apnea treatment, alcohol moderation, and exercise reduce AF burden and progression and should be integrated into longitudinal care [^d257ca65] [^96883c09].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm. First, confirm AF diagnosis and classify pattern; second, assess stroke risk with CHA2DS2-VASc and bleeding risk with HAS-BLED; third, decide on anticoagulation and peri-cardioversion strategy; fourth, choose rate versus rhythm control based on symptoms, age, AF duration, comorbidities, and patient preference; fifth, select therapy within the chosen strategy using substrate-guided AADs or ablation; sixth, implement risk factor modification and arrange follow-up to reassess rhythm, symptoms, stroke risk, and bleeding risk at least annually or with clinical change [^d5defeb5] [^0000251d] [^43566654]. I need to ensure I also plan for transitions of care and team-based models, such as nurse-led AF clinics, to sustain adherence and outcomes [^6ffb82d0].

> Finally, let me synthesize the key principles to ensure nothing is missing. Stroke prevention is mandatory for those at risk and should be reassessed over time; rate control is foundational for all patients, with lenient targets acceptable in many; rhythm control is appropriate for symptomatic patients, those with HF where it may improve outcomes, or those desiring to reduce AF burden; ablation is a first-line option in selected patients; and comprehensive risk factor modification plus shared decision-making are essential to optimize quality of life and reduce adverse outcomes [^754f89b5] [^2cc73de4] [^1ee47072] [^df8ca469] [^d257ca65] [^576f5b3e]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP guideline and contemporary ESC guidance; yes, it reflects the current emphasis on individualized, guideline-directed therapy with periodic reassessment and patient-centered care [^0ac523d4] [^1c69593c].

Atrial fibrillation (AF) management centers on **three pillars**: stroke prevention, rate control, and rhythm control [^3f877d28]. Stroke prevention is guided by CHA2DS2-VASc: anticoagulate when the score is ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, consider when 1 in men or 2 in women, and use DOACs preferentially unless valvular disease or mechanical valves are present [^754f89b5] [^974e97a2] [^2af23f4b]. Rate control is **first-line for most patients**, with beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as first-line agents; lenient targets (< 100–110 bpm) are acceptable in stable patients without heart failure [^2cc73de4] [^59b51e1b]. Rhythm control is reserved for persistent symptoms despite rate control, or for selected patients early after diagnosis, using antiarrhythmics or catheter ablation; ablation is increasingly considered first-line in symptomatic patients without significant left atrial enlargement [^1ee47072] [^df8ca469]. All patients should receive risk-factor modification and shared decision-making to align therapy with symptoms, comorbidities, and preferences [^d257ca65] [^576f5b3e].

---

## Stroke prevention

### Risk stratification

Use **CHA2DS2-VASc** to assess stroke risk: congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (2 points), diabetes, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2 points), vascular disease, age 65–74, and female sex [^e2f6d6ec]. Anticoagulation is recommended when the score is ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women; consider when 1 in men or 2 in women; and generally not recommended when 0 in men or 1 in women [^754f89b5] [^974e97a2].

---

### Anticoagulation options

- **DOACs**: Preferred over warfarin for most patients (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) due to lower intracranial bleeding risk and no routine monitoring [^2af23f4b].
- **Warfarin**: Use when mechanical heart valves, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, or severe renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min) are present.
- **Aspirin**: Not recommended for stroke prevention in AF [^2af23f4b].

---

### Peri-cardioversion anticoagulation

Continue **oral anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks** after cardioversion and long term if thromboembolic risk factors persist, regardless of rhythm status [^e792c7e0].

---

## Rate control

### Indications

Rate control is **first-line for most patients**, especially older adults, those with minimal symptoms, or significant comorbidities [^ea2f8256] [^27a5079f].

---

### Target heart rate

Lenient control to a resting heart rate **< 100–110 bpm** is reasonable in stable patients without heart failure [^2cc73de4] [^59b51e1b]. Strict control to **< 80 bpm at rest** is reserved for persistent symptoms, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or when a rhythm-control strategy is planned [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological options

| **Medication class** | **Agents** | **Indications** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Metoprolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol | First-line; effective at rest and exercise | - Severe bradycardia <br/> - Severe asthma |
| Non-dihydropyridine CCBs | Diltiazem, verapamil | First-line; effective at rest and exercise | - HFrEF <br/> - Severe bradycardia |
| Digoxin | Digoxin | Second-line; effective at rest, less during exercise | - Renal impairment <br/> - Toxicity risk |
| Combination therapy | Beta-blocker + digoxin or diltiazem | Refractory cases | Caution with bradycardia |

---

### Non-pharmacological options

AV nodal ablation with pacemaker is reserved for **refractory rate control** or when medications are contraindicated [^59b51e1b].

---

## Rhythm control

### Indications

Consider rhythm control for **persistent symptoms despite rate control**, newly diagnosed AF (especially within 12 months), or when AF progression risk is high (e.g. young, minimal structural heart disease) [^1ee47072] [^1c69593c].

---

### Pharmacological rhythm control

- **Flecainide, propafenone**: For patients without structural heart disease or ischemia [^51e2c9d5].
- **Dofetilide, dronedarone, sotalol**: For patients with structural heart disease or ischemia; avoid dronedarone in HFrEF or recent decompensation [^51e2c9d5].
- **Amiodarone**: Effective but associated with significant long-term toxicity; use when other options are contraindicated or ineffective [^aa923bdd].

---

### Non-pharmacological rhythm control

Catheter ablation is **first-line in selected patients** with symptomatic AF, particularly paroxysmal AF without significant left atrial enlargement; it is superior to antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm [^df8ca469] [^3073cfa5]. Surgical ablation (maze) is considered during concomitant cardiac surgery or for refractory cases [^3073cfa5].

---

## Risk factor modification and lifestyle interventions

- **Hypertension**: Strict control (target < 130/80 mmHg).
- **Obesity**: Weight loss ≥ 10% significantly reduces AF burden.
- **Diabetes**: Optimize glycemic control.
- **Sleep apnea**: Screen and treat with CPAP.
- **Alcohol**: Limit or abstain.
- **Exercise**: Regular moderate-intensity aerobic activity.

---

## Special populations

### Heart failure

In heart failure, **rate control** uses beta-blockers and digoxin; avoid non-dihydropyridine CCBs in HFrEF [^59b51e1b]. Rhythm control with catheter ablation improves symptoms, quality of life, and may reduce hospitalizations and mortality in selected patients [^fa919487].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **rate control** is often preferred due to higher risks with rhythm-control strategies; individualize based on comorbidities and frailty [^27a5079f].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should monitor **symptoms, heart rate, rhythm, anticoagulation effectiveness, and adverse effects**. Adjust therapy based on response and patient preferences [^0000251d].

---

AF management is **individualized**, balancing stroke prevention, rate versus rhythm control, and risk-factor modification. DOACs are preferred for stroke prevention, rate control is first-line for most, and rhythm control — including ablation — is reserved for selected patients or those with persistent symptoms.

### Overview of the management of atrial fibrillation: what is the current state of the art? [^888eac12]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Management of Atrial Fibrillation. There are three fundamental approaches to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF): rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation. Selecting a course of treatment requires a thorough knowledge of these therapeutic alternatives. This article explores treatment options, including the relative benefits of rate control versus rhythm control, which are complicated by the lack of highly effective and safe antiarrhythmic drugs. Anticoagulation is also an important issue in AF management, and warfarin effectively reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in AF patients. The use of warfarin, however, presents its own complications. We conclude that individualization of therapy is paramount when treating AF.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^69a61efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^b9c82eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### The patient with atrial fibrillation [^94f053f6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered arrhythmia, particularly affecting the elderly. Patients at significant risk for stroke should be considered for anticoagulation with warfarin. Management of atrial fibrillation revolves around either controlling the ventricular rate response or trying to maintain sinus rhythm with either pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies. There are many treatment options to consider, based upon the patient's expectations, symptoms, and comorbid conditions. Therefore, the treatment of atrial fibrillation must be individualized.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^d608efb9]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

### Contemporary approach to stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: risks, benefits, and new options [^b203b692]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common diagnosis affecting nearly 3 million adults in the United States. Morbidity and mortality in these patients is driven largely by the associated increased risk of thromboembolic complications, especially stroke. Atrial fibrillation is a stronger risk factor than hypertension, coronary disease, or heart failure and is associated with an approximately five-fold increased risk. Mitigating stroke risk can be challenging and requires accurate assessment of stroke risk factors and careful selection of appropriate therapy. Anticoagulation, including the more recently introduced direct oral anticoagulants, is the standard of care for most patients. In addition, emerging non-pharmacologic mechanical interventions are playing an expanding role in reducing stroke risk in select patients. In this review we highlight the current approach to stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation and discuss in detail the mechanism, risks, and benefits of current and evolving therapies.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) management—initial assessment and AF pattern: At the initial encounter, an overall management strategy should be discussed with the patient, considering type and duration of AF, severity and type of symptoms, associated cardiovascular disease, patient age, associated medical conditions, short-term and long-term treatment goals, and pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapeutic options; AF may be categorized as paroxysmal (self-terminating), persistent (requiring electrical or pharmacological termination), or permanent (cardioversion impossible or futile), and duration since onset may be known or unknown depending on symptoms or ECG documentation.

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^2535a9f2]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2-3% of the population in Europe and the USA and requiring 1-3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy.

### Drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: where do we go from here? [^cb4ee0d5]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical attention, has effects that range from mild symptoms to devastating stroke. Although treatments have evolved since the foxglove plant (later identified as containing digitalis) was first administered to slow the heart rate, satisfactory drug therapy has not been developed. In this review we describe present-day medical options and developments of future therapies to treat atrial fibrillation and maintain normal sinus rhythm.

### What can rhythm control therapy contribute to prognosis in atrial fibrillation? [^6c31ff86]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a global healthcare problem of growing prevalence and major significance. The consequences of AF include an increased rate of death, stroke and heart failure. Theoretically, a therapeutic strategy aiming at restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm should offset the prognosis impairment associated with AF. However, these expectations were disproven in large randomised controlled trials comparing conventional antiarrhythmic drugs for rhythm control with conventional rate control. These apparently contradictory findings suggest that rhythm control strategies require better therapeutic instruments. These improvements may involve drugs and/or interventions with optimised risk-benefit profile and which also appreciate the specific atrial pathology and the patient's comorbidities. This article addresses important aspects of rhythm control strategies, which may have the potential of a beneficial contribution to the prognosis of AF patients.

Antithrombotic options in atrial fibrillation—treatment thresholds and choices: Anticoagulation is recommended if ≥2%/y (1) and reasonable if 1%-<2%/y (2a). For agent selection, DOACs are preferred over warfarin (except for mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve) (1). Aspirin either alone or with clopidogrel is not recommended to reduce stroke risk (3: Harm), and if no risk factors for stroke, aspirin to prevent thromboembolic events is not recommended (3: No benefit).

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^dd73c500]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^af4e3657]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation affects at least 1% of the population and causes marked society-wide morbidity and mortality. Current management of atrial fibrillation including antithrombotic therapy and management of concomitant conditions in all patients, rate control therapy in most patients, and rhythm control therapy in patients with severe atrial fibrillation-related symptoms can alleviate atrial fibrillation-related symptoms but can neither effectively prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation nor suppress atrial fibrillation-related complications. Hence, there is a need for better therapy of atrial fibrillation. The etiology of atrial fibrillation is complex. Most of the causes of atrial fibrillation which are known at present perpetuate themselves in vicious circles, and presence of the arrhythmia by itself causes marked damage of atrial myocardium. These pathophysiological insights suggest that early diagnosis and comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation, including adequate therapy of all atrial fibrillation-causing conditions, rate control, and rhythm control therapy, could help to prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and reduce atrial fibrillation-related complications. Such a therapy should make use of safe and effective therapeutic modalities, some of which have become available recently or will become available in the near future. The hypothesis that early diagnosis and early, comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation can improve outcomes requires formal testing in controlled trials.

Future directions

Given the limited treatment options for patients with HF and AF, there is a clear unmet need in this important patient population. Future investigation is particularly required for rate control, optimal methods of rhythm control, and prevention. There is also a need to stratify the use of various treatments to improve efficacy and safety, and a number of studies are addressing whether genetic profiling can help to personalize our therapeutic approach.

Despite advances in many areas of AF, it seems that the evidence to guide best practices for rate control is more uncertain than ever. Adequately powered prospective clinical trials are needed to clarify optimal rate-control targets and the best pharmacologic treatments to achieve rate control in patients with HF and AF. While ablation represents a promising alternative to AAD, clinicians require more information on the balance between effectiveness, complications, and potential prognostic benefits. Finally, given the poor outcomes observed in patients with HF and AF, perhaps the best treatment strategy is to prevent AF from occurring in the first place. Clinical trials of interventions targeted at left atrial substrate and preventing disease progression may have an important role in this regard. Table 3 presents some of the main studies currently recruiting that will assess patients with HF and AF. It is clear that the combination of these two common CV conditions will continue to challenge physicians both in CV and general medicine for many years to come.

### Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and treatment [^62af18a6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It impairs cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. Key treatment issues include deciding when to restore normal sinus rhythm, when to control rate only, and how to prevent thromboembolism. Rate control is the preferred management option in most patients. Rhythm control is an option for patients in whom rate control cannot be achieved or who have persistent symptoms despite rate control. The current recommendation for strict rate control is a resting heart rate of less than 80 beats per minute. However, one study has shown that more lenient rate control of less than 110 beats per minute while at rest was not inferior to strict rate control in preventing cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Anticoagulation therapy is needed with rate control and rhythm control to prevent stroke. Warfarin is superior to aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing stroke despite its narrow therapeutic range and increased risk of bleeding. Tools that predict the risk of stroke (e.g., CHADS2) and the risk of bleeding (e.g., Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) are helpful in making decisions about anticoagulation therapy. Surgical options for atrial fibrillation include disruption of abnormal conduction pathways in the atria, and obliteration of the left atrial appendage. Catheter ablation is an option for restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal left atrial size. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted in patients who have complex cardiac disease; who are symptomatic on or unable to tolerate pharmacologic rate control; or who may be candidates for ablation or surgical interventions.

### Catheter ablation as first line therapy for atrial fibrillation [^a7a0d135]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment for atrial fibrillation has evolved significantly over time. Previously, medication management was the mainstay of treatment. As we have developed more robust technologies and modalities for catheter ablation, these treatment recommendations have changed. Catheter ablation is a safe and effective strategy for treating atrial fibrillation that is now considered first-line therapy in some patient populations. In this review, we discuss historical perspectives regarding the treatment and management of atrial fibrillation. We review the literature on studies investigating catheter ablation as first-line therapy, including the impact of catheter ablation on arrhythmia recurrence, cardiovascular outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Finally, we discuss future directions for the management of atrial fibrillation as the technology for catheter ablation continues to grow and progress.

### Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: are the guidelines guiding clinical practice? [^5d4def6f]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The AFFIRM study showed no clear survival advantage for a rhythm versus rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is appropriate in a large number of patients with AF. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology AF management guidelines include a safety-based algorithm for selection of AAD therapy. Class 1C agents are recommended as first-line therapy in patients without or with minimal structural heart disease. However, market research and clinical study data indicate a growing use of class III agents (mainly amiodarone) despite long-term safety and tolerability concerns, suggesting that clinical practice does not adhere to current guidelines.

### Treatment of atrial fibrillation [^96883c09]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that affects more than 2.5 million people in the United States and causes substantial morbidity and mortality, especially regarding the increased risk of stroke.

Objective

To summarize atrial fibrillation treatment exclusive of stroke prevention.

Evidence Review

An Ovid MEDLINE comprehensive literature search was performed on atrial fibrillation therapy excluding anticoagulation and emphasizing studies published within the last 5 years through April 2015 (N=5044 references). The 2014 atrial fibrillation guideline from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society also was reviewed.

Findings

Reversible causes of atrial fibrillation should be identified. Risk factor modification, including weight loss and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea can reduce atrial fibrillation episodes. Appropriate anticoagulation is necessary for patients at substantial stroke risk regardless of rate or rhythm treatment strategy. Sinus rhythm is often needed to control symptoms; however, an alternative strategy for atrial fibrillation is appropriate rate control. Rate control is safe in older patients (those who are about age ≥65 years) followed up for a few years, but no such safety data exist for patients younger than 60 years or for those followed up for longer periods. Thus, selection of therapy is individualized, taking into account present and future medical problems for the patient. Choice of an antiarrhythmic drug is based on safety first vs efficacy. Catheter ablation is an effective nonpharmacological alternative that is often, but not always, the second-line treatment. Reduction of the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation episodes that result in a significant improvement in quality of life is a good marker of drug treatment success and complete elimination of atrial fibrillation is not required in many patients. Rate control is usually achieved with a β-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is important to assess adequate rate control during both rest and activity. If the ventricular rate goes uncontrolled for a prolonged period, tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy can occur.

Conclusions and Relevance

Therapy for atrial fibrillation includes prevention and modification of inciting causes and appropriate anticoagulation. Rate control is necessary for all patients. Maintenance of sinus rhythm with drugs or catheter ablation should be considered based on the individual needs of each patient.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—rhythm and rate control options, anticoagulation, ablation, and pacing: Drugs and ablation are effective for both rate and rhythm control, and in special circumstances surgery may be the preferred option; regardless of the approach, the need for anticoagulation is based on stroke risk and not on whether sinus rhythm is maintained; for rhythm control, drugs are typically the first choice and left atrial (LA) ablation is a secondline choice, especially in patients with symptomatic lone AF, and in some patients—especially young with very symptomatic AF who need sinus rhythm—radiofrequency ablation may be preferred over years of drug therapy; during cardiac surgery, maze or LA ablation can be an effective adjunct to prevent recurrent postoperative AF and, because the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the site of over 95% of detected thrombi, this structure should be removed from the circulation when possible in patients at risk of developing postoperative AF, although this has not been proved to prevent stroke; for rate control, drugs are the primary treatment in most patients, while atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation with permanent pacing is an option that often yields remarkable symptomatic relief but concern about the negative effect of long-term right ventricular (RV) pacing makes this a fallback rather than a primary strategy, and left ventricular (LV) pacing may overcome many adverse hemodynamic effects associated with RV pacing.

### Atrial fibrillation therapy now and in the future: drugs, biologicals, and ablation [^c816c47e]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease with multiple inter-relating causes culminating in rapid, seemingly disorganized atrial activation. Therapy targeting AF is rapidly changing and improving. The purpose of this review is to summarize current state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for treatment of AF. The review focuses on reviewing treatment as it relates to the pathophysiological basis of disease and reviews preclinical and clinical evidence for potential new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including imaging, biomarkers, pharmacological therapy, and ablative strategies for AF. Current ablation and drug therapy approaches to treating AF are largely based on treating the arrhythmia once the substrate occurs and is more effective in paroxysmal AF rather than persistent or permanent AF. However, there is much research aimed at prevention strategies, targeting AF substrate, so-called upstream therapy. Improved diagnostics, using imaging, genetics, and biomarkers, are needed to better identify subtypes of AF based on underlying substrate/mechanism to allow more directed therapeutic approaches. In addition, novel antiarrhythmics with more atrial specific effects may reduce limiting proarrhythmic side effects. Advances in ablation therapy are aimed at improving technology to reduce procedure time and in mechanism-targeted approaches.

### Age and health status benefits following initiation of atrial fibrillation-specific treatments [^0bead032]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adults.AF impairs the health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life) of patients,leading clinical practice guidelines to emphasize optimizing health status as a primary treatment goal.Currently, various treatment strategies, including rate‐controlling medications and restoration of sinus rhythm, can improve patients' health status, as observed in pivotal trials demonstrating population‐averaged benefits in selected patient populations.However, translating these benefits into routine clinical practice can be challenging given the potential heterogeneity of treatment benefit by individual patient characteristics.

In older adults, assessing patients' health status to better guide treatment strategies can be challenging, given their clinical complexity and higher burden of comorbidity.Moreover, older adults are often at increased risk for pharmacological intolerance,or procedure‐related complications,,and are often excluded from randomized controlled trials. Better understanding the association of age with health status outcomes after AF treatment is needed to inform routine clinical practice.

To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to investigate the association of age with health status improvements after different treatment strategies in a multicenter AF registry.AF incidence increases with age, contributing to high mortality and morbidity,; therefore, a better definition of the association could provide a richer understanding of the anticipated health status benefits of alternative AF‐specific treatment strategies to better inform decision‐making.

### Curative ablation for atrial fibrillation: what clinical trials do we need to establish efficacy [^0b373293]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

In contrast to other supraventricular tachycardias, curative treatment of atrial fibrillation, although increasingly available and rapidly evolving, is neither as effective nor the first choice. Until recently, the unavailability of nonsurgical curative treatment may have fueled a debate on the relative importance of restoring sinus rhythm versus controlling the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Recent randomized trials (PIAF, AFFIRM, and RACE) using very limited atrial fibrillation burden assessment show that pharmacologic ventricular rate control is much safer and possibly more effective than pharmacologic restoration of sinus rhythm. A clinical trial comparing a truly curative treatment of atrial fibrillation-such as catheter ablation targeting pulmonary vein isolation-with pharmacologic treatment is required. It should focus on reliable efficacy parameters, use vigilant assessment of safety, and, most importantly, be structured to provide all-important prognostic information on long-term outcome. Atrial fibrillation burden is a theoretically robust efficacy parameter, but accurate quantification over a sufficiently long period of monitoring will require technologically innovative noninvasive rhythm monitoring devices.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e2f6d6ec]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65-74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Atrial fibrillation [^5088506f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence for diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has expanded substantially since 2017, when In the Clinic last considered this subject. Direct oral anticoagulants have become the predominant therapy for thromboembolic disease, and antidotes for these drugs are now available. Device-based left atrial appendage occlusion is frequently used in patients who cannot tolerate systemic anticoagulation, and growing evidence suggests that early rhythm control improves outcomes. Catheter ablation is now frequently performed to prevent recurrent AF. Managing risk factors for AF, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, remains paramount in prevention of this condition.

### Use of digital patient decision-support tools for atrial fibrillation treatments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c176a237]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and a key risk factor for embolic stroke and heart failure, with an increasing global burden as the population continues to age.AF treatment involves stroke prevention, symptom management, and cardiovascular and comorbidity optimisation.Treatment decisions in AF are complex because there are multiple treatment options and evidence gaps, often with more than one medically appropriate option. Recent AF guidelines acknowledge this uncertainty and emphasise the importance of shared decision-making in AF treatment decisions, considering patients’ values, goals and preferences.

A key component of shared decision-making is providing evidence-based information on the benefits and harms of existing treatment options, which can be supported by patient education tools.Patient education tools aim to increase the patient’s (ie, decision-maker) knowledge to enable discussion and informed uptake of a treatment choice.Whereas, when there are two or more reasonable treatment alternatives, a patient decision aid may be more appropriate (eg, patients at ‘moderate stroke risk’).Patient decision aids support preference-sensitive decisions by describing the health problem and making explicit the decision, providing information on options’ benefits and harms, and helping patients clarify which benefits and harms matter most to them.Patient education tools and patient decision aids (ie, patient decision-support tools) can facilitate shared decision-making and improve treatment adherence, leading to better outcomes.

To date, four systematic reviews(only one with meta-analysis)have evaluated patient decision-support tools for anticoagulation and stroke prevention in AF, suggesting improvements in decisional conflict. However, these reviews included mostly non-digital tools (eg, paper-based), which are limited in their ability to personalise and present information. Digital health—the development and use of digital technologies to improve health—offers new opportunities to deliver personalised and engaging information to support patients in shared decision-making. At present, it is uncertain whether digital delivery of patient decision-support tools for AF treatment decisions can improve decisional conflict and patient knowledge. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of digital patient decision-support tools for AF treatment decisions in adults with AF.

### Rate versus rhythm control in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^27a5079f]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with atrial fibrillation involves three main areas: anticoagulation, rate control and rhythm control. Importantly, these are not mutually exclusive of each other. Anticoagulation is necessary for patients who are at a high risk of stroke; for example, those who are older than 75 years, or those who have hypertension, severe left ventricular dysfunction, previous cerebrovascular events, or diabetes. It is now clear that patients who are at a high risk of stroke require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin regardless of whether a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy is chosen. One possible exception might be patients who are apparently cured with catheter ablation. Several published trials comparing rate-control and rhythm-control strategies for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation have shown no difference in mortality between these approaches. The patients enrolled in these studies were typically over 65 years of age. Data comparing rate and rhythm strategies in patients who are younger than 60 years of age are limited. For more elderly patients, it seems reasonable to consider rate control as a primary treatment option and to reserve rhythm control for those who do not respond to rate control. For younger patients, we prefer to start with a rhythm-control approach and to reserve rate-control approaches for patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation, or both, do not ameliorate the symptoms.

### Disease understanding in patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation [^e2fc1c1d]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with high mortality and morbidity.Although oral anticoagulation (OAC) has been shown to reduce stroke risk by two-thirds among patients with AF, approximately half of patients with AF and risk factors for stroke do not receive this treatment, and of those treated, many discontinue anticoagulation.Patients’ confidence in their knowledge of available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic therapies for AF is essential to shared medical decision making and long-term medication adherence. Yet, there is a paucity of data regarding the extent to which patients newly diagnosed with AF in routine community practice feel they understand their treatment options and how this perception evolves over time.

Patients may have limited knowledge of the risks and therapeutic benefits associated with a diagnosis of AF,and evidence suggests that patients’ lack of knowledge surrounding their condition and treatment options presents a key barrier to the use of medications and adherence to recommendations.Some information is available via the internet and other public sources; however, the potential for misinformation from internet sources may adversely impact patient compliance.Interventions providing information about the need for warfarin, the risks and benefits associated with OAC therapy, potential interactions and the importance of monitoring international normalised ratio significantly improves time in therapeutic range in patients with AF initiating warfarin during the first 6 months.The treatment options for AF have become more complex over the past decade as additional therapeutic options are introduced including direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and apixaban.

In addition to actual knowledge, patients’ confidence in their disease understanding is associated with self-efficacy and health literacy, which are prerequisite for changing patient behaviour.Understanding how patients’ perceived knowledge of AF therapeutic options impacts treatment decisions may inform strategies to increase initiation and adherence to AF treatment. To meet this need, a survey was administered to participants of SATELLITE (Survey of Patient Knowledge and Personal Priorities for Treatment), a substudy of the national Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT) II registry, to collect data on patients’ self-reported risk perception as well as the patient’s confidence in their understanding of the role, options and benefits of existing and novel AF therapies.The goal of this study was to describe the level of understanding for newly diagnosed patients with AF and assess how patient understanding changes over the first 6 months for patients newly diagnosed with AF. Finally, we explored the relationship between patient understanding of therapeutic options at baseline and treatment rates at 6 months.

### Atrial fibrillation: JACC council perspectives [^e579514a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly prevalent arrhythmia; its pathophysiology and progression are well studied. Stroke and bleeding risk models have been created and validated. Decision tools for stroke prophylaxis are evolving, with better options at hand. Utilization of various diagnostic tools offer insight into AF burden and thromboembolic risk. Rate control, rhythm control, and stroke prophylaxis are the cornerstones of AF therapy. Although antiarrhythmic drugs are useful, AF ablation has become a primary therapeutic strategy. Pulmonary vein isolation is the cornerstone of AF ablation, and methods to improve ablation safety and efficacy continue to progress. Ablation of nonpulmonary vein sites is increasingly being recognized as an important strategy for treating nonparoxysmal AF. Several new ablation techniques and technologies and stroke prophylaxis are being explored. This is a contemporary review on the prevalence, pathophysiology, risk prediction, prophylaxis, treatment options, new insights for optimizing treatment outcomes, and emerging concepts of AF.

### Rate or rhythm control for atrial fibrillation: update and controversies [^3f15347d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mortality and considerable morbidity, including stroke, heart failure, and diminished quality of life. Despite these adverse outcomes, rhythm control has not demonstrated benefit in clinical trials. Antiarrhythmic medications, including recently developed agents, have limited efficacy in achieving durable sinus rhythm and substantial toxicity. A rate-control strategy is therefore more attractive for minimally symptomatic patients, but younger and more symptomatic patients may benefit from restoration of sinus rhythm. Catheter ablation is more effective than medications in preventing arrhythmia recurrence, avoids adverse effects associated with antiarrhythmic drugs, and should be considered early in symptomatic patients when success is likely. However, more definitive data are needed from randomized trials assessing long-term outcomes after ablation, including stroke risk and mortality. Clinical decision tools help select the appropriate management for individual patients. Lenient rate management is easy to achieve and seems reasonably safe for certain patients, although the optimum rate varies with individual comorbidities. Because safer and more effective pharmacologic and interventional therapies are now available, an individualized approach to atrial fibrillation management is essential.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^d7feb4c2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Personalized medicine and atrial fibrillation: will it ever happen? [^b8beca2f]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In many ways, as with most areas of clinical medicine, the management of patients with AF is already personalized. Prescription of thromboembolism prophylaxis regimens is tailored for each patient. Bedside stroke and bleeding risk prediction rules [-] are available to help clinicians decide whether to prescribe aspirin or systemic anticoagulants. Cardioversions, antiarrhythmic therapy, and ablation for AF are variably prescribed depending on patient symptoms. When choosing which systemic anticoagulants or antiarrhythmic medications to prescribe, clinicians consider comorbidities, drug efficacy, adverse effects, contraindications, pharmacologic interactions, and cost. Ablation procedures for patients with persistent AF are more extensive than for those with paroxysmal AF.

Despite the personalized nature of AF management, care of patients with AF is challenging owing to the complexity of the arrhythmia. Patient management is limited by unpredictable recurrence and progression of AF, differing susceptibilities to stroke and heart failure, and variable treatment responses. These challenges are opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic innovation, and represent areas where genetic medicine might facilitate clinical management. Two promising areas for the near-term application of genetic information in AF include pharmacological management and risk prediction (Table 2).

### Clinical study designs surgical ablation devices for treatment of AF (...) [^4ebacbad]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Study Designs for Surgical Ablation Devices for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.
1. Introduction This guidance provides FDA’s recommendations on clinical trial designs for surgical ablation devices intended for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The recommendations in this guidance address clinical studies for new surgical ablation devices intended for treatment of AF, as well as for legally marketed surgical ablation devices for which a new indication for treatment of AF is sought. Atrial fibrillation is a complex arrhythmia and its precise mechanisms remain unclear. Current treatments span a spectrum of non-invasive to highly invasive options and include medical and surgical variants.

The success of the MAZE procedure 1 and its successors has led to the development of surgical ablation devices designed to mark cardiac tissue in a manner similar to suture lines, thereby disrupting the path of the electrical impulses causing the patient’s AF. If you elect to use best medical therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs as the control therapy for evaluation of effectiveness, FDA recognizes that drug regimens are tailored to individual circumstances and that no unique optimal regimen exists. However, FDA recommends that any investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs utilize a pre-specified tiered protocol that delineates criteria for initial drug selection and for changes in drug therapy. When the sole purpose of the surgery is to perform AF ablation, FDA intends to weigh the risk of the surgery and ablation procedure against the sole possible benefit of treatment of AF.

In an IDE application for a trial where the only purpose of the surgical procedure is ablation for treatment of AF, you should provide a sound scientific rationale to support your hypothesis that the benefits of AF ablation outweigh the risks of the surgical procedure.
- if your study includes only subjects with longstanding persistent AF, the corresponding indications for use may be limited to the treatment of longstanding persistent AF;
- if your study design pertains only to ablation concomitant with mitral valve replacement or repair surgery, approval of your device may be limited to that specific indication; and
- if the only surgical procedure used in your study employs a minimally invasive surgical approach, your indications may be limited accordingly. For the primary effectiveness endpoint, FDA recommends you evaluate freedom from AF through the minimum follow-up period recommended by relevant medical society guidelines, which currently is 12 months.

2 We believe that the primary effectiveness endpoint for a rhythm disturbance is AF elimination and not necessarily the resumption of normal sinus rhythm.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^ff851b94]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

Although atrial fibrillation is clearly associated with severe consequences such as stroke, heart failure, and death, current rhythm management in AF patients does not translate into improved outcomes. Earlier initiation of rhythm control therapy, especially when embedded in a comprehensive AF management strategy, has the potential to maintain sinus rhythm more effectively, to disrupt the vicious circles that maintain AF and cause its complications, and to prevent AF-related complications before they occur. Potentially, a combination of intermittent, short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy, antiarrhythmic drug therapy using new, potentially safer agents, and catheter ablation of AF could be components of early rhythm control therapy. Given the potential benefits and risk of such a therapy, there is a clear need to test whether early rhythm control therapy of AF can improve outcomes in AF patients.

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: a commentary [^14e476f1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy. After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention - that is, oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants) - could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last 2 years.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: a contemporary viewpoint [^68e0532d]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation is important. This review consists of three parts: chronic anticoagulation, anticoagulation for cardioversion, and a brief comment on anticoagulation around the time of left atrial radiofrequency ablation. The risk stratification scheme of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines for chronic anticoagulation is briefly reviewed. Although there are several other similar schemes, they are not identical. The key point is the balance between benefit and risk. Some emerging controversies are outlined. Two specific questions explored are: is well-controlled hypertension a risk factor, and does paroxysmal atrial fibrillation confer the same risk as continuous atrial fibrillation? Differences in the risk of bleeding while taking a vitamin K antagonist noted in recent compared with older data are discussed. Risk of bleeding in the elderly and combined antithrombotic therapy with a vitamin K antagonist and an antiplatelet agent in high-risk patients are briefly discussed. Recent failures of studies attempting to find a suitable alternative to vitamin K antagonists are outlined. The treatment guidelines for anticoagulation for cardioversion are briefly reviewed. The risk of thromboembolism according to international normalized ratio and use of low-molecular-weight heparin as an alternative to warfarin are discussed. Anticoagulation before and after left atrial radiofrequency ablation is empirical, and long-term anticoagulation seems advisable for high risk patients at the present time. The two most pressing needs for further investigation are (1) clarification, simplification, and consolidated of risk stratification schemes and treatment recommendations and (2) discovery of alternatives to warfarin.

### Diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation [^ebf92043]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that adversely affects cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. It is the most common arrhythmia and a major source of morbidity and mortality; its prevalence increases with age. Pulse rate is sensitive, but not specific, for diagnosis, and suspected atrial fibrillation should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography. Because normal electrocardiographic findings do not rule out atrial fibrillation, home monitoring is recommended if there is clinical suspicion of arrhythmia despite normal test results. Treatment is based on decisions made regarding when to convert to normal sinus rhythm vs. when to treat with rate control, and, in either case, how to best reduce the risk of stroke. For most patients, rate control is preferred to rhythm control. Ablation therapy is used to destroy abnormal foci responsible for atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke while increasing the risk of bleeding. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system assesses the risk of stroke, with a score of 2 or greater indicating a need for anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score estimates the risk of bleeding. Scores of 3 or greater indicate high risk. Warfarin, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), and aspirin are options for stroke prevention. Selection of therapy should be individualized based on risks and potential benefits, cost, and patient preference. Left atrial appendage obliteration is an option for reducing stroke risk. Two implantable devices used to occlude the appendage, the Watchman and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, appear to be as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke, but they are invasive. Another percutaneous approach to occlusion, wherein the left atrium is closed off using the Lariat, is also available, but data on its long-term effectiveness and safety are still limited. Surgical treatments for atrial fibrillation are reserved for patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Management overview—Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives—rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient’s course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### Screening and management of atrial fibrillation in primary care [^a4a37476]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common chronic disease seen in primary care offices, emergency departments, inpatient hospital services, and many subspecialty practices. Atrial fibrillation care is complicated and multifaceted, and, at various points, clinicians may see it as a consequence and cause of multi-morbidity, as a silent driver of stroke risk, as a bellwether of an acute medical illness, or as a primary rhythm disturbance that requires targeted treatment. Primary care physicians in particular must navigate these priorities, perspectives, and resources to meet the needs of individual patients. This includes judicious use of diagnostic testing, thoughtful use of novel therapeutic agents and procedures, and providing access to subspecialty expertise. This review explores the epidemiology, screening, and risk assessment of atrial fibrillation, as well as management of its symptoms (rate and various rhythm control options) and stroke risk (anticoagulation and other treatments), and offers a model for the integration of the components of atrial fibrillation care.

### Management of atrial fibrillation [^cc443e0e]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, and confers a substantial mortality and morbidity from stroke, thromboembolism, heart failure, and impaired quality of life. With the increasingly elderly population in the developed world, as well as improvements in the management of myocardial infarction and heart failure, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is increasing, resulting in a major public-health problem. This Review aims to provide an overview on the modern management of atrial fibrillation, with particular emphasis on pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Irrespective of a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy, stroke prevention with appropriate thromboprophylaxis still remains central to the management of this common arrhythmia. Electrophysiological approaches could hold some promise for a curative approach in atrial fibrillation.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^2ce22091]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation guideline methodology and scope—An initial extensive evidence review was conducted from May 2022 to November 2022, and additional relevant studies, published through November 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The writing committee consisted of cardiologists, cardiac electrophysiologists, surgeons, pharmacists, and patient representatives/lay stakeholders, and the writing committee included representatives from the ACC, AHA, ACCP, and HRS. This document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC and the AHA and was endorsed by ACCP and HRS. In developing the “2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation” (2023 atrial fibrillation guideline), the writing committee reviewed previously published guidelines, and Table 1 contains a list of these publications deemed pertinent to this writing effort and is intended for use as a resource, thus obviating the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations. The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the strength of recommendation and encompasses the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk, and the Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scientific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources.

### Rate control in atrial fibrillation [^59b51e1b]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Control of the heart rate (rate control) is central to atrial fibrillation management, even for patients who ultimately require control of the rhythm. We review heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, including the rationale for the intervention, patient selection, and the treatments available. The choice of rate control depends on the symptoms and clinical characteristics of the patient, but for all patients with atrial fibrillation, rate control is part of the management. Choice of drugs is patient-dependent. β blockers, alone or in combination with digoxin, or non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (not in heart failure) effectively lower the heart rate. Digoxin is least effective, but a reasonable choice for physically inactive patients aged 80 years or older, in whom other treatments are ineffective or are contraindicated, and as an additional drug to other rate-controlling drugs, especially in heart failure when instituted cautiously. Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker insertion for rate control should be used as an approach of last resort but is also an option early in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with cardiac resynchronisation therapy. However, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation should be considered before atrioventricular node ablation. Although rate control is a top priority and one of the first management issues for all patients with atrial fibrillation, many issues remain.

### Chapter 5: guideline recommendations: which AAD and for whom? [^aa923bdd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This chapter discusses the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/ Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) management with particular focus on antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) selection and the identification of individuals for whom AAD treatment is appropriate. Discussion includes AAD indications, when to start an AAD, choosing among AADs, how to minimize proarrhythmic risk, how to determine efficacy, and the use of adjuvant interventions. The indications for all AADs are based on safety; the current AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines state that the choice of AAD is based on the presence or absence of structural heart disease (SHD), coronary artery disease, or heart failure (HF), with further recommendations in the ESC guidelines based on HF type (e.g., HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] versus HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). The chapter closes with a discussion of the lack of consistent use of guideline-directed care, with a review of supportive data from the recently reported AIM-AF survey-a multinational survey on AF management that involved both cardiologists and electrophysiologists. In AIM-AF, inappropriate drug selection in terms of suitable candidate selection and drug choice occurred with all types of drugs and in most patient groups. Most notable was the overuse of amiodarone in patients without SHD, and the widespread use of sotalol, including its use in patients with HFrEF. Chapter 5 is summarized as follows.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating rhythm control in patients with AF for the following purposes:

- improve symptoms of AF

- improve symptoms and outcomes, such as mortality and hospitalizations, for HF and ischemia in patients with HF

- reduce the risk of AF progression

- reduce hospitalizations, stroke, and mortality in patients with a recent diagnosis of AF

- reduce the risk of developing dementia or worsening cardiac structural abnormalities.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^d94c9886]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two conditions that are likely to dominate the next 50 years of cardiovascular (CV) care. Both are increasingly prevalent and associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. They are closely inter-related with similar risk factors and shared pathophysiology. Patients with concomitant HF and AF suffer from even worse symptoms and poorer prognosis, yet evidence-based evaluation and management of this group of patients is lacking. In this review, we evaluate the common mechanisms for the development of AF in HF patients and vice versa, focusing on the evidence for potential treatment strategies. Recent data have suggested that these patients may respond differently than those with HF or AF alone. These results highlight the clear clinical need to identify and treat according to best evidence, in order to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce the huge burden that HF and AF are expected to have on global healthcare systems in the future. We propose an easy-to-use clinical mnemonic to aid the initial management of newly discovered concomitant HF and AF, the CAN-TREAT HFrEF + AF algorithm (Cardioversion if compromised; Anticoagulation unless contraindication; Normalize fluid balance; Target initial heart rate <110 b.p.m.; Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone modification; Early consideration of rhythm control; Advanced HF therapies; Treatment of other CV disease).

### State of the art: catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^732e3dad]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Curative treatment of atrial fibrillation with catheter ablation is now a legitimate option for a large number of patients. In the last decade a tremendous amount has been discovered about this fascinating arrhythmia, yet there is still much that is understood. A number of different ablation strategies have been used including pulmonary vein isolation, targeting of fractionated electrograms, compartmentalising the atria with linear lesions and various combinations and modifications of these lesion sets. The optimal ablation strategy for both paroxysmal and long-lasting persistent atrial fibrillation is unknown. In this review the possible mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation are examined along with the current catheter ablation techniques used in the treatment atrial fibrillation.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects an estimated 2.3 million Americans, with projections to over 10 million by 2050,,at current estimated costs of over $26 billion each year totalor $18 000–$20 000 per patient.Although mortality from AF can be significantly reduced with use of oral anticoagulation agents to prevent thromboembolic stroke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,patients with AF still can suffer from significant morbidity,,,,including 35% to 50% with hospital admissions or death within 5 years even with the appropriate use of oral anticoagulation.

The decision of whether to pursue a rhythm‐control strategy, and what type of strategy to employ, remains a highly complex process in which the treating clinician and patient must assess the impact of rhythm control on symptoms and long‐term outcomes, the potential for procedural complications or medication side effects, as well as the probability of success. Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) limited to antiarrhythmic medications for rhythm control have shown no difference in outcomes compared with a rate‐control strategy,,,,although more recent trials that include AF ablation for rhythm control have noted improvements in ventricular function,and lower rates of stroke and death among patients with heart failure treated using a rhythm‐control strategy that included AF ablation.,The recently published EAST‐AFNET 4 (Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial‐Network of Competence on Atrial Fibrillation 4) trialexamined early application of a rhythm‐control strategy (within a year) and noted a reduction in the combined outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, or cardiac hospitalizations,,,although the study did not directly measure costsand patients assigned to rhythm control also had an increase in number of visits.A number of clinical factors have been shown to predict a rhythm‐ or rate‐control strategy based on existing evidence, although the heterogeneity of studies and findings highlights the fact that there is no “one‐size‐fits‐all” approach to AF. These results suggest that better methods are needed to individualize treatment strategies for each patient with AF.
