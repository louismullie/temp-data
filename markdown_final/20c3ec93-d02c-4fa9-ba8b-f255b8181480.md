## Question

Semaglutide vs. liraglutide in overweight adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how semaglutide compares with liraglutide for weight loss in overweight adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and regulatory indications. Then, I should verify the head-to-head randomized evidence. Next, I will review indirect comparisons and dose-ranging data. After that, I need to check real-world effectiveness and persistence. I will then examine safety and tolerability, including rare risks. Finally, I should synthesize practical recommendations, including dosing, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness, and close with a concise conclusion anchored to guidelines and pivotal trials [^117CRXpr] [^114nTXgk].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications. Both semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly and liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily are GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity, as adjuncts to lifestyle intervention, which frames the relevance of head-to-head and placebo-controlled data for shared decision-making [^117CRXpr] [^111ndT5w].

> I will now examine the pivotal head-to-head evidence. The STEP 8 randomized clinical trial directly compared semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly versus liraglutide 3.0 mg daily over 68 weeks in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes; semaglutide achieved a mean weight loss of −15.8% versus −6.4% with liraglutide, yielding a 9.4 percentage-point difference favoring semaglutide, with higher odds of achieving ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, and ≥ 20% weight loss and fewer discontinuations for any reason, despite broadly similar gastrointestinal adverse event rates, which is a clinically meaningful magnitude of superiority [^114nTXgk] [^1136eMcY].

> Wait, let me verify the earlier dose-ranging signal that foreshadowed this result. A phase 2 dose-ranging trial showed that daily semaglutide at 0.2–0.4 mg (weekly exposure roughly 1.4–2.8 mg) produced 11.2–13.8% weight loss and was superior to liraglutide 3.0 mg at −7.8%, reinforcing the dose-dependent efficacy advantage of semaglutide over liraglutide even before the definitive weekly 2.4 mg regimen was established [^113bU4Z9].

> Next, I should review indirect comparisons and meta-analyses to ensure consistency. Network meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently rank semaglutide 2.4 mg among the highest-efficacy anti-obesity pharmacotherapies, with placebo-subtracted weight loss around 10–13% and substantially higher categorical response rates, whereas liraglutide 3.0 mg typically yields about 4–6% placebo-subtracted loss, aligning directionally with STEP 8 and supporting external validity across populations and designs [^112sb821] [^112TmKyn] [^113Us47E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about real-world performance without checking adherence and persistence. Observational cohorts show that semaglutide generally produces greater 1-year weight loss than liraglutide in routine care, but absolute effects are smaller than in trials, largely due to lower persistence; only about 40% maintain persistent coverage at 1 year, and among those who do persist, semaglutide users frequently achieve ≥ 10% loss approximating trial proportions, underscoring the importance of access, cost, and tolerability management in practice [^116Z1poW] [^113Cg9g1] [^115CF5qv].

> I need to ensure the safety comparison is balanced and accurate. Both agents have gastrointestinal adverse events as the predominant class effect, typically mild-to-moderate and transient, with similar overall GI AE rates in STEP 8 and low discontinuation rates when dose escalation is gradual; rare pancreatitis signals exist in some real-world datasets, but meta-analyses of RCTs have not shown a consistent increase, and both drugs carry a boxed warning for medullary thyroid carcinoma in patients with MEN2 or personal/family history, so counseling and vigilance are warranted [^114nTXgk] [^115ZmzxX] [^11378R99] [^116UFpX3].

> Let me consider dosing and administration pragmatics. Semaglutide 2.4 mg is titrated over 16 weeks to mitigate GI intolerance, and its once-weekly schedule may improve adherence for some patients; liraglutide 3.0 mg is titrated over 4 weeks and given daily, which some patients find less convenient, though individual preferences vary and shared decision-making is key to sustaining therapy [^112e2hLh] [^114nTXgk].

> I should double-check durability and treat-to-target implications. Continuation of semaglutide sustains weight loss with additional benefit over 48 weeks in STEP 4, whereas withdrawal leads to regain; STEP 5 demonstrated maintenance of approximately 15% mean loss at 2 years with ongoing therapy, and SELECT showed sustained weight reduction over 4 years alongside cardiovascular risk reduction, reinforcing that durable benefit requires continued treatment and that stopping typically leads to weight regain [^112VfZbG] [^116bRTXu] [^112EoLg3].

> But wait, what about cost-effectiveness and value. A cost-needed-to-treat analysis suggests semaglutide achieves a 1% weight reduction at a lower cost per percent than liraglutide despite higher list price, due to greater efficacy; however, I should acknowledge that absolute annual costs are higher and payer coverage constraints often drive discontinuation, so real-world value depends on access, persistence, and long-term health gains, which should be discussed upfront with patients [^111aCzzj] [^116Z1poW].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure recommendations align with evidence. The AGA suggests semaglutide 2.4 mg with lifestyle intervention for adults with obesity or overweight with complications, and cardiology guidelines favor semaglutide over liraglutide when pharmacotherapy is indicated for weight reduction in chronic coronary disease, reflecting both efficacy and emerging cardiovascular benefit signals in high-risk populations [^117CRXpr] [^115gN2so].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes who are candidates for pharmacotherapy, semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly is preferred over liraglutide 3.0 mg daily based on superior efficacy, similar GI tolerability with appropriate titration, and more favorable durability and value per percent weight lost; liraglutide remains a reasonable alternative when semaglutide is unavailable, contraindicated, or not tolerated, and in all cases, therapy should be paired with lifestyle intervention and a plan to optimize persistence and manage GI effects to preserve real-world effectiveness [^114nTXgk] [^117CRXpr] [^116Z1poW].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly produces substantially greater weight loss than liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily in head-to-head trials, maintains superiority across indirect comparisons, and translates to higher categorical response rates and better value per percent lost, with broadly similar GI safety profiles; real-world effectiveness hinges on persistence, which clinicians must proactively support through dosing strategies, adverse effect counseling, and access solutions [^114nTXgk] [^112sb821] [^111aCzzj] [^116Z1poW].

Semaglutide achieves **greater weight loss** than liraglutide in overweight adults, with mean reductions of 15.8% vs 6.4% at 68 weeks in STEP 8 [^114nTXgk] and higher odds of ≥ 10% and ≥ 15% weight loss [^114nTXgk]. Both agents have similar gastrointestinal side effects [^114nTXgk], but semaglutide has **lower discontinuation rates** and is administered once weekly, whereas liraglutide requires daily dosing. Semaglutide is preferred for patients prioritizing efficacy and convenience, while liraglutide remains an option for those who cannot access or tolerate semaglutide.

## Clinical trial evidence

### Semaglutide

- **STEP 1 trial**: Mean weight loss of 14.9% at 68 weeks in adults with overweight/obesity without diabetes; 86.4% achieved ≥ 5% weight loss, 69.1% achieved ≥ 10%, and 50.5% achieved ≥ 15% [^114YQ4nW].
- **STEP 8 trial**: Mean weight loss of 15.8% at 68 weeks vs 6.4% with liraglutide; higher odds of achieving ≥ 10% (70.9% vs 25.6%) and ≥ 15% weight loss (55.6% vs 12.0%) [^114nTXgk].
- **STEP 5 trial**: Sustained mean weight loss of 15.2% at 104 weeks [^116bRTXu].

---

### Liraglutide

In the **SCALE trial**, mean weight loss was 8.0% at 56 weeks in adults with overweight/obesity without diabetes, with 63.2% achieving ≥ 5% and 33.1% achieving ≥ 10% weight loss. In the **SCALE Diabetes trial**, mean weight loss was 6.0% at 56 weeks in adults with type 2 diabetes, with 49.8% achieving ≥ 5% and 22.4% achieving ≥ 10% weight loss [^116xb97X].

## Comparative efficacy

| **Metric** | **Semaglutide** | **Liraglutide** |
|-|-|-|
| Mean weight loss | 15.8% (STEP 8) | 6.4% (STEP 8) |
| ≥ 10% weight loss | 70.9% (STEP 8) | 25.6% (STEP 8) |
| ≥ 15% weight loss | 55.6% (STEP 8) | 12.0% (STEP 8) |
| Sustained weight loss | 15.2% at 104 weeks (STEP 5) | Sustained loss reported but lower magnitude |

---

Semaglutide demonstrates **significantly greater weight loss** and higher proportions achieving clinically meaningful thresholds than liraglutide [^114nTXgk].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Both cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; rates are similar in trials [^114nTXgk].
- **Discontinuation rates**: Lower with semaglutide (13.5%) than liraglutide (27.6%) in STEP 8 [^114nTXgk].
- **Serious adverse events**: Similar between groups in STEP 8 [^notfound].

---

## Patient adherence and satisfaction

Adherence is supported by semaglutide's **once-weekly dosing** compared with liraglutide's daily injections, which may improve adherence and satisfaction. Patient-reported outcomes from STEP 8 indicate greater satisfaction with semaglutide, likely due to its superior efficacy and less frequent dosing.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)** recommends semaglutide 2.4 mg with lifestyle intervention for adults with obesity or overweight with complications, citing superior efficacy. The **American Diabetes Association (ADA)** prefers GLP-1 RAs with greater weight loss efficacy (semaglutide or tirzepatide) for patients with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity [^112ykCej].

---

## Real-world effectiveness

Real-world data show **greater weight loss with semaglutide** than liraglutide, though both achieve less than in trials, largely due to adherence and persistence challenges [^113Cg9g1].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Semaglutide provides **better value for money** than liraglutide for weight reduction, with a lower cost per 1% weight loss achieved [^111aCzzj].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Factor** | **Semaglutide** | **Liraglutide** |
|-|-|-|
| Dosing frequency | Once weekly | Daily |
| Mean weight loss | 15.8% (STEP 8) | 6.4% (STEP 8) |
| ≥ 10% weight loss | 70.9% (STEP 8) | 25.6% (STEP 8) |
| Discontinuation rate | 13.5% (STEP 8) | 27.6% (STEP 8) |
| Cost-effectiveness | Better value | Higher cost per % loss |

---

Semaglutide achieves **greater weight loss** and better adherence than liraglutide, with similar safety profiles. It is preferred for patients prioritizing efficacy and convenience, while liraglutide remains an alternative when semaglutide is unavailable or not tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m². Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.

Results

Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^116JEHaY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^1136eMcY]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 8 was published by Domenica M Rubino and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 8 study, the trial question was: is weekly subcutaneous semaglutide superior to daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes? In the STEP 8 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STEP 8 study, the population was: 338 patients (265 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol; history of type 1 or T2DM mellitus; self-reported change in body weight ≥ 5 kg at 90 days of screening. In the STEP 8 study, the interventions were: n = 126 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg once weekly if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks) n = 127 liraglutide (initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks). In the STEP 8 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in body weight (15.8% vs. 6.4%; AD 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12). In the STEP 8 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; OR 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 20% (38.5% vs. 6%; OR 8.2, 95% CI 3.5 to 19.1). In the STEP 8 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events. In the STEP 8 study, the conclusion was: in non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, semaglutide was superior to liraglutide with respect to reduction in body weight.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^1164TQR8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is treatment with semaglutide associated with weight loss outcomes similar to those seen in results of randomized clinical trials?

Findings

In this cohort study of 175 patients with overweight or obesity, the total body weight loss percentages achieved were 5.9% at 3 months and 10.9% at 6 months.

Meaning

Semaglutide treatment in a regular clinical setting was associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized clinical trials, which suggests its applicability for treating patients with overweight or obesity.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^112T9Tfw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a complex chronic disease that represents a significant public health and economic challenge, affecting 42% of the US adult population. It causes or exacerbates the risk of numerous major health complications, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cancer, osteoarthritis, and obstructive sleep apnea. Given the medical burden of obesity and the $173 billion in associated annual costs, advances in treatment are of paramount importance.

In the past decade, 2 glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity: liraglutide (2014) and semaglutide (2021). Additionally, the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 RA agonist tirzepatide was approved by the FDA for obesity in November 2023. These medications produced clinically meaningful weight reduction in randomized clinical trials. For example, in the STEP 1 (Research Study Investigating How Well Semaglutide Works in People Suffering From Overweight or Obesity) study, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, plus a lifestyle intervention produced a mean 14.9% reduction in body weight in patients with overweight or obesity (without diabetes) at 68 weeks, compared with a 2.4% weight reduction in the placebo group plus a lifestyle intervention. In the SCALE (Effect of Liraglutide on Body Weight in Non-Diabetic Obese Subjects or Overweight Subjects With Co-Morbidities) trial, once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (plus lifestyle modification), produced a mean 8.0% weight reduction in patients with overweight or obesity (without diabetes) at 56 weeks vs a 2.6% weight reduction in the placebo group. In the STEP 8 trial, which compared once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both groups also received counseling for diet and physical activity), over 68 weeks, adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes who received semaglutide achieved a mean body weight reduction of 15.8% vs 6.4% with liraglutide.

### The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly on energy intake, appetite, control of eating, and gastric emptying in adults with obesity [^1175oGQn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a growing global health crisis placing substantial burden on healthcare systems, with excess weight contributing to a range of detrimental effects, including increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and mortality. 1, 2 Despite the importance of weight loss in improving health outcomes for patients with overweight/obesity, 1, 2 relatively few pharmacotherapies are approved for weight management. 3

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) were initially developed for improvement of glycaemic control in T2D. 4 Following the observation of weight reductions in T2D, 4 GLP‐1RAs were studied in patients with overweight or obesity, 5, 6 and a single agent (liraglutide 3 mg) is currently approved for weight management. 7, 8 While liraglutide provided clinically relevant reductions in body weight of 5.4% relative to placebo in a pivotal study in overweight/obese patients, 6 there remains an unmet need for those patients for whom weight loss ≥ 10% is recommended. 1, 2 Furthermore, other available antiobesity agents fail to achieve ≥ 10% weight loss and some are associated with safety concerns, 3, 9 highlighting the need for effective, well‐tolerated treatments.

### Semaglutide for adults living with obesity [^115Yqhr2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Obesity is a complex chronic condition linked to various comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, with a significant global burden. Semaglutide, a widely used glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), can aid in weight loss by reducing appetite. However, its efficacy remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of semaglutide on adults living with obesity.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries. The latest search date was 17 December 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared semaglutide with placebo, structured lifestyle modification programmes, other anti-obesity medications or other GLP-1RAs in adults living with obesity, with a minimum of six months' follow-up.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were weight, adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), quality of life, and mortality. Important outcomes were waist circumference, heart failure, diabetes-related outcomes, blood pressure-related outcomes, liver disease-related outcomes, obstructive sleep apnoea, and lipid metabolism-related outcomes.

Risk Of Bias

We used the original version of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs (RoB 1).

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis with a random-effects model. Where this was not possible, we described the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. The main comparison of interest in the review is semaglutide versus placebo.

Included Studies

We included 18 RCTs (27,949 participants), with a mean age ranging from 41.0 to 69.5 years, and an average BMI between 31.9 kg/m 2 and 40.3 kg/m 2. Seventeen RCTs reported that the drug manufacturer had a major role in their design, conduct, analysis, or writing. Seventeen RCTs compared semaglutide versus placebo, at medium- (16 RCTs) or long-term (2 RCTs) follow-up. Other comparators were liraglutide (2 RCTs) and tirzepatide (1 RCT).

Synthesis Of Results

Semaglutide versus placebo (medium term: 6 months to 17 months) At medium-term follow-up, semaglutide reduces percentage body weight (mean difference (MD) -10.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.24 to -9.21; 15 studies, 8651 participants; high-certainty evidence) and increases the proportion of people achieving 5% weight loss (risk ratio (RR) 2.68, 95% CI 2.30 to 3.12; 12 studies, 7458 participants; high-certainty evidence). Semaglutide may increase non-serious adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22; 13 studies, 8443 participants; low-certainty evidence), likely results in little to no absolute difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.21; 15 studies, 9054 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and has very uncertain effects on serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 15 studies, 9054 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Semaglutide likely results in little to no difference in quality of life (SF-36 physical functioning score: MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.28; 9 studies, 6083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Semaglutide may result in little to no absolute difference in MACE (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; 9 studies, 7647 participants; low-certainty evidence) and mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.98; 14 studies, 8953 participants; low-certainty evidence). For most outcomes, the main reasons for downgrading certainty of evidence were related to imprecision and inconsistency. Semaglutide versus placebo (long term: 26 months) At long-term follow-up, semaglutide likely reduces percentage body weight (MD -11.11, 95% CI -16.47 to -5.75; I² = 94%; 2 studies, 15,124 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and likely increases the proportion of people achieving 5% weight loss (RR 2.74, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.84; 2 studies, 17,876 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Its effects on non-serious adverse events are very uncertain (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.34; 1 study, 305 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with likely little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95; 2 studies, 17,908 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a likely increase in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.20; 2 studies, 17,908 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Semaglutide likely results in little to no clinically significant differences in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L: MD 0.02, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence), MACE (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.90; moderate-certainty evidence), and mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; moderate-certainty evidence). For most outcomes, the main reasons for downgrading certainty of evidence were related to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Semaglutide results in a clinically relevant weight loss at medium-term follow-up compared to placebo, which is likely to be sustained in the long term, while taking the drug. While semaglutide increases the risk of adverse events leading to withdrawal, it appears to be of limited clinical relevance in absolute terms at medium-term, and clinically relevant at long-term follow-up. The effects of semaglutide on quality of life, MACE, and mortality are likely limited or uncertain. Most studies were funded by the drug's manufacturer, raising important concerns about conflicts of interest. We identified 46 ongoing studies that may strengthen future evidence syntheses. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of semaglutide in the management of obesity.

5.2 Efficacy outcomes

Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68‐week long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9%‐17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table 2). Furthermore, > 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

TABLE 2
Efficacy results from the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials a

In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP 3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioural therapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo). In STEP 4, the mean decrease in body weight during the 20‐week run‐in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase. In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68‐week long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)was achieved by 86%‐89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29%‐48% receiving placebo (Table 2). In these trials, 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo), 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo), and 32%‐40% achieved ≥ 20% weight loss (vs. 2%‐5% with placebo) (Table 2).

3 MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY

Older pharmacological options for chronic weight management, such as orlistat, phentermine‐topiramate and naltrexone‐bupropion, typically show moderate efficacy (~3%‐9% mean weight loss over that achieved with lifestyle intervention alone). Liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily administered subcutaneously was the first GLP‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) to be approved for weight management, after demonstrating weight losses of 4%‐6% over those achieved with lifestyle intervention alone in clinical trials of 20‐56 weeks' duration. In these trials, 46%‐76% of participants lost ≥ 5% and 23%‐37% lost ≥ 10% of their baseline body weight.,

Semaglutide is a GLP‐1 analogue shown to reduce energy intake, reduce hunger and increase feelings of satiety and fullness. This effect has been shown to arise via GLP‐1 receptor activation in the central nervous system, with further indirect modulation of neuronal activity involved in appetite regulation and food intake and preference. The STEP programme was designed to comprehensively explore the efficacy of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity, with each trial addressing a specific research question. For the six completed trials discussed in this review, these are: STEP 1 (large pivotal study), weight loss; STEP 2, weight loss in type 2 diabetes; STEP 3, weight loss in combination with intensive behavioural therapy; STEP 4, effect of continuing versus withdrawing semaglutide on weight‐loss maintenance; STEP 5, weight maintenance over 2 years; and STEP 8, head‐to‐head comparison of semaglutide and liraglutide. In addition to these STEP trials, a regional phase IIIa trial, STEP 6, assessed the effect of semaglutide versus placebo for weight management in 401 adults from east Asia (Japan and South Korea) with obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^113Cg9g1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large cohort of patients with obesity who initiated treatment with injectable semaglutide or liraglutide, patients lost an average of 3.7% body weight at 1 year. Weight loss varied significantly by the medication, indication, dosage, and persistence of medication coverage. In the multivariable analysis, patients who received semaglutide (vs liraglutide), had a high dosage of the medication (vs low), had obesity (vs T2D) as treatment indication, had persistent medication coverage or 90 to 275 medication coverage days within the first year (vs < 90 medication coverage days), had higher baseline BMI, and were female (vs male) had significantly higher odds of achieving 10% or greater weight reduction at 1 year.

Recently, injectable forms of semaglutide have been more commonly prescribed, in part related to their ability to demonstrate clinically meaningful weight outcomes. As a result of its superiority, the demand for the medication has skyrocketed, leading to notable drug shortages. Patients have high expectations to achieve substantial weight reductions with GLP-1 RA medications. Our clinical findings suggest that this was not the case for most patients in our cohort; however, those who persisted with the medication coverage experienced weight losses comparable with those shown in corresponding clinical trials. Unfortunately, only 4 in 10 patients in this cohort had persistent medication coverage at 1 year, which underlines the current challenges with treating T2D and obesity with these highly effective medications. High out-of-pocket costs, insurance coverage–related issues, medication supply shortages, adverse effects, and weight reduction not meeting the patient's expectations could be the reasons for this, warranting future studies on determinants of nonpersistent coverage with these medications. However, 61.0% of the patients who received semaglutide for obesity and with persistent coverage at 1 year achieved 10% or greater weight loss, which is only slightly less than the proportion in the STEP 1 study, where 69.1% of participants achieved at least 10% weight reduction at 68 weeks.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^112VfZbG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

Objective

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

Interventions

A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Results

Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^116Z1poW]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Limited data are available on long-term weight loss achieved with semaglutide or liraglutide for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity in clinical practice.

Objective

To document weight loss achieved with injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide and identify factors associated with weight reduction of 10% or greater at 1 year.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from a large, integrated health system in Ohio and Florida. Participants included adults with a body mass index (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0 who initiated treatment with semaglutide or liraglutide between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2022. Follow-up was completed July 28, 2023.

Exposure

Injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide approved for T2D or obesity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percentage weight change and categorical weight reduction of 10% or greater at 1 year.

Results

A total of 3389 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.4[12.2] years; 1835 [54.7%] female) were identified. Of these, 1341 patients received semaglutide for T2D; 1444, liraglutide for T2D; 227, liraglutide for obesity; and 377, semaglutide for obesity. Mean (SD) percentage weight change at 1 year was -5.1%(7.8%) with semaglutide vs -2.2%(6.4%) with liraglutide (P < .001); -3.2%(6.8%) for T2D as a treatment indication vs -5.9%(9.0%) for obesity (P < .001); and -5.5%(7.5%) with persistent medication coverage (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days) at 1 year vs -2.8%(7.0%) with 90 to 275 medication coverage days and -1.8%(6.7%) with fewer than 90 medication coverage days (P < .001). In the multivariable model, semaglutide vs liraglutide (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19 [95% CI, 1.77–2.72]), obesity as a treatment indication vs T2D (AOR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.83–3.30]), persistent medication coverage vs 90 medication coverage days (AOR, 3.36 [95% CI, 2.52–4.54]) or 90 to 275 medication coverage days within the first year (AOR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.10–2.06]), high dosage of the medication vs low (AOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.11–2.25]), and female sex (AOR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.27–1.94]) were associated with achieving a 10% or greater weight reduction at year 1.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this retrospective cohort study of 3389 patients with obesity, weight reduction at 1 year was associated with the medication's active agent, its dosage, treatment indication, persistent medication coverage, and patient sex. Future research should focus on identifying the reasons for discontinuation of medication use and interventions aimed at improving long-term persistent coverage.

### Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for weight loss among adults without diabetes: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113Us47E]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual or triple co-agonists for weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists for the treatment of obesity among adults without diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 4 October 2024.

Study Selection

Placebo-controlled RCTs in otherwise healthy participants with overweight or obesity.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was change in relative or absolute body weight from baseline to maximum on-treatment follow-up. Safety outcomes included death, serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse events (AEs), and gastrointestinal AEs.

Data Synthesis

A total of 26 RCTs comprising 15491 participants (72% female; mean body mass index, 30 to 41 kg/m 2; mean age, 34 to 57 years) and 12 agents (3 commercially available agents [liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide] and 9 premarket agents for long-term weight management) were included. Treatment ranged from 16 to 104 weeks (median, 43 weeks). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide (15 mg once weekly) resulted in weight loss of up to 17.8% (95% CI, 16.3% to 19.3%) after 72 weeks of therapy; semaglutide (2.4 mg once weekly), up to 13.9% (CI, 11.0% to 16.7%) after 68 weeks; and liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily), up to 5.8% (CI, 3.6% to 8.0%) after 26 weeks. Retatrutide (12 mg once weekly) produced greater weight loss of up to 22.1% (CI, 19.3% to 24.9%) after 48 weeks; other novel single and combination GLP-1 agents were also efficacious to varying degrees. Although AEs were frequent (GLP-1 RA vs. placebo: 80% to 97% vs. 63% to 100%), the majority were gastrointestinal-related (47% to 84% vs. 13% to 63%, respectively), most commonly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. AEs requiring treatment discontinuation (0% to 26% vs. 0% to 9%, respectively) and SAEs (0% to 10% vs. 0% to 12%, respectively) were rare.

Limitations

No head-to-head RCTs were available. Heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists are efficacious for weight loss, with reported safety concerns predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, when used among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^114W5CRM]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Study Variables

The primary outcome measures in this study were (1) percentage of weight change at 1 year following initiation of injectable semaglutide or liraglutide treatment and (2) categorical weight loss of 10% or greater at 1 year, given that sustained weight loss of 10% or more in patients with obesity has a major beneficial impact on obesity-related comorbidities. Baseline BMI was calculated using the weight data captured on the index date or, if not available, within 6 months before the index date. Body weight at 1 year was determined by the first weight measurement captured between 12 and 18 months. If no weight measurement was available after 12 months, the last weight measurement less than 3 months before the 1-year follow-up time was carried forward; otherwise, the 1-year weight measurement was considered missing. We also captured available weight data from baseline through 18 months (in 1-month increments) to compare the weight trajectories by GLP-1 RA agent. The end of the follow-up period for outcome ascertainment was July 28, 2023.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^113c456V]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that semaglutide is clinically effective for weight loss at 3 and 6 months for people with overweight or obesity. Although our study lacked the stringent and closely controlled nature of RCTs, we report similar weight loss results within the same time period as in RCTs. Studies with greater sample sizes and longer periods of follow-up are further needed to support the effectiveness of semaglutide.

### Differential efficacy of weight loss interventions in patients with versus without diabetes [^1154Vj1e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Differential Efficacy of Weight Loss Interventions Among Patients with Diabetes

Ketogenic diets strongly reduce dietary carbohydrates, and hence are expected to be of benefit in patients with diabetes. While carefully executed trials in people without diabetes have found weight reductions of up to 12 kg over 6 months, a dedicated meta-analysis of a ketogenic diet in diabetes found a mean adjusted weight difference of − 5.63 kg compared to other diets. As mentioned previously, intermittent fasting diets induce on average a weight loss of merely 1.89 kg among patients with diabetes. By comparison, a meta-analysis encompassing 27 trials of intermittent fasting diets in overweight and obese individuals estimated a mean efficacy of − 4.97 kg, more than twice what has been found in patients with diabetes. Of note, intermittent fasting can be a trigger of acute complications in patients with T1DM, or with T2DM and a high insulin requirement.

GLP-1 agonists are perhaps the pharmacological group for which most evidence exists about their comparative efficacy in patients with or without diabetes. In fact, a dedicated RCT assessed the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide at anti-obesity doses, specifically in patients with diabetes (SCALE Diabetes and SCALE Obesity and prediabetes). Participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg/day (obesity dose) arm achieved a mean − 6.4 kg body weight change after 56 weeks. By contrast, in the pivotal study of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obesity without diabetes, the weight loss at week 56 was 8.4 kg. In summary, the pooled weight-loss efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg/d in RCTs differs markedly in the presence of diabetes. Subcutaneous semaglutide at the anti-obesity dose of 2.4 mg/week has demonstrated reductions in body weight of 15.8% with continued use over 68 weeks in patients without diabetes. Meanwhile, in the STEP 2 trial of semaglutide at the same dose in patients with excess body weight and T2DM, the weight loss was 9.6%, or 9.6 kg (baseline body weight in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm was 99.9 kg), almost half of what was observed in the absence of T2DM.

2.1 Liraglutide

Liraglutide and semaglutide are both long‐acting GLP‐1RAs that have pharmacodynamic effects 24 h a day. They have around 93% sequence similarity with slight sequential and structural variances; therefore, they act similarly (Figure 4). Although their administration intervals and doses may vary, both are well‐tolerated and effective for weight loss. A systematic review of 18 studies reported that liraglutide and semaglutide therapies led to a weight loss of 48.2%–88.7% among obese and overweight adults without diabetes, where overall clinically acceptable change was set to be greater than 5%. Furthermore, a phase 2 trial found that once‐daily administration of subcutaneous semaglutide 0.4 mg dose (equivalent to 2.8 mg once weekly) significantly increased weight loss compared to the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose. Another randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy and adverse effects profiles of once‐weekly subcutaneously administered semaglutide, 2.4 mg, versus once‐daily liraglutide, more than 1.8 mg. The study backed the previous findings that both medications were significantly associated with weight loss. However, semaglutide induced greater weight loss and had fewer permanent treatment discontinuations due to adverse events.

In contrast, another study testing the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide presented those 85 patients (48.6%) reported experiencing adverse effects associated with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most commonly reported ones. Based on data from 10 studies involving liraglutide and semaglutide, both GLP‐1 receptor agonists demonstrated a generally favourable safety profile in real‐world practice. The discontinuation rates due to adverse events were relatively low, with liraglutide 3.0 mg once‐daily groups ranging from 5.4% to 11.4% and semaglutide 2.4 mg per week groups ranging from 2.4% to 7.0%. The overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the liraglutide and semaglutide groups (ranging from 66.5% to 96.7% and 81.3% to 95.8%, respectively) than in the control groups. However, it is important to note that serious adverse events were infrequently reported, ranging from 0% to 7.5% in liraglutide groups and 7.7% to 9.8% in semaglutide groups, with most being mild to moderate in severity.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^116bRTXu]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0)years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg/m² and weight of 106.0 (22.0)kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week104 was -15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus -2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of -12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, -15.3 to -9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104weeks versus placebo.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^113j88CW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The STEP 8 trial, including 338 patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, is one of the few head-to-head studies in the field of obesity research, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg/week with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and placebo combined with counseling, a daily 500-kcal-deficit diet and 150 min/week physical exercise for 68 weeks. Patients treated with semaglutide showed a 15.8% body-weight reduction versus 6.4% for the liraglutide group and 1.9% for the placebo group, with an estimated treatment difference of -9.4% between semaglutide and liraglutide (95% CI −12.0, −6.8; p < 0.001). 38.5% of patients treated with semaglutide lost ≥ 20%, versus 6.0% with liraglutide (p < 0.001).

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual agonists, and retatrutide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity: a Bayesian NMA [^1121K46a]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), dual agonists (GLP-1RAs/GIP or GCGR), and retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon) for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 29,506 adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²), assessing liraglutide, semaglutide, survodutide, tirzepatide, retatrutide, and placebo. Outcomes included mean weight loss, achievement of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, waist circumference (WC), BMI, and adverse events (AEs) at ≥ 36weeks. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses evaluated the impact of diabetes status, sex, age, and BMI.

Results

Retatrutide and dual agonists achieved equivalent mean weight loss (-11.0kg), surpassing GLP-1RAs (-9.0kg), with retatrutide excelling at achieving ≥ 15% weight loss (OR 54.6). Dual agonists and GLP-1RAs followed (OR 16.4 and 9.0, respectively). Retatrutide had the highest AE risk. Meta-regression showed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) reduced weight loss by 4.338kg for GLP-1RAs and 5.016kg for dual agonists, with enhanced outcomes in female-dominant or high-BMI cohorts.

Conclusions

Retatrutide offers superior weight loss efficacy but with a higher AE risk. Dual agonists provide a favorable efficacy-safety balance. Personalized treatment selection based on patient characteristics is recommended.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^1175i7bQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with T2D and established CVD, liraglutide and semaglutide are approved for reducing the risk of MACE. Reductions in CV events with GLP‐1RAs are potentially driven by modification of atherosclerosis progression. In line with this, semaglutide reduced atherosclerosis in preclinical studies at doses that did not significantly reduce body weight, suggesting that anti‐atherosclerotic effects are not due solely to its impact on weight. In a meta‐analysis of trials in T2D, reductions in CVD risk were also independent of reductions in SBP and body weight. Further research is needed to elucidate fully the mechanisms behind the effect of GLP‐1RAs on CV outcomes.

Based on current and previously published data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that semaglutide may also have beneficial effects on CV outcomes in individuals with overweight/obesity without T2D. However, the present analyses revealed that the reduction in ASCVD risk with semaglutide in STEP 1 was not significantly different from that with placebo. The most probable explanation for this is that the STEP 1 population was at relatively low risk at the start of the trial; for example, the participants were relatively young. Stratification of participants by C‐reactive protein concentrations or statin use may have assisted with differentiating the effects of semaglutide and placebo on risk. To investigate this further, the ongoing SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients With Overweight or Obesity; NCT03574597) trial will evaluate semaglutide versus placebo for preventing MACE in patients with established CVD and overweight/obesity, but without T2D.

Some of the analyses described here were exploratory or post‐hoc in nature, approaches with inherent limitations. In addition, not all analyses were controlled for multiplicity, and the studies were not able to determine the contribution of weight loss alone to improvement in CV risk. Furthermore, in STEP 4, as the treatment group comparisons over 68 weeks only included the 89% of enrolled trial participants who completed the 20‐week run‐in on semaglutide, which followed a strict dose‐titration schedule, selection bias may have been introduced and could have favoured participants who were better able to tolerate semaglutide. As changes in use of antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medication were based on physician judgement, they may have been affected by site‐ or physician‐dependent variability. Finally, the trial populations were predominantly female and the impact of sex on the findings is unknown.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^113GfQta]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview of Efficacy, Side Effects, and Key Challenges

GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and liraglutide, as well as combination agents like tirzepatide (which adds glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonism) — all hereafter referred to as GLP-1s for brevity — are effective new agents for obesity treatment which demonstrate weight reduction, weight maintenance, and reduced morbidity and mortality. These medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities. Semaglutide and liraglutide are indicated for adults or youth aged ≥ 12 y and tirzepatide for adults aged ≥ 18 y. GLP-1s for obesity have additional FDA-approved indications for cardiovascular disease risk reduction (semaglutide) and obstructive sleep apnea (tirzepatide). GLP-1s are separately approved for type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, which are not the focus of this Advisory.

Efficacy

In the original phase 3 randomized trials for obesity, average weight reduction compared to placebo has ranged from 5.3% to 17.8% after 56 to 72 wk (Table 1), with improvements in several obesity-related risks and complications. In real-world practice, the efficacy for weight reduction is often lower, for example, about 8% for individuals with diabetes and 11% for individuals without diabetes at 60 wk with semaglutide 2.4 mg/d. Generally, weight reduction is more rapid during the first 6 mo and slows thereafter, with relative plateauing at 18 mo. When GLP-1 use is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 y in controlled and observational studies.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^1152fu5J]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight/obesity is well established, with more than 90% of people with T2D being overweight. Individuals with T2D and overweight/obesity are at increased risk of developing T2D complications compared with people who are not overweight/obese. Body weight (BW) reductions of ≥ 5% improve glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure.BW control is an important component of an individualized, multifactorial approach to T2D management, as recommended in current treatment guidelines.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended as second-line therapy (add-on to metformin) where minimizing weight gain, promoting weight loss or when hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risk reduction are considerations. All available GLP-1RAs (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide) have demonstrated weight loss in people with T2D. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk, Denmark) is a GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of T2D as once-weekly (OW) subcutaneousand once-daily oral formulations. The efficacy and safety of OW semaglutide have been established in the global phase 3 SUSTAIN clinical trial program, encompassing subjects from across the continuum of T2D care. In addition to significantly greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), semaglutide demonstrated superior reductions in BW versus all comparators across all SUSTAIN trials.

The SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials compared semaglutide with the GLP-1RAs OW exenatide extended release (exenatide ER), OW dulaglutide and once-daily liraglutide, respectively. In these trials, mean BW loss was significantly greater with semaglutide versus comparators at end of treatment (EOT: weeks 56, 40 and 30 for SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10, respectively): SUSTAIN 3: –5.6 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs exenatide ER 2.0 mg; SUSTAIN 7: –4.6 kg vs –2.3 kg with semaglutide 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg and –6.5 kg vs –3.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg; SUSTAIN 10: –5.8 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs liraglutide 1.2 mg; all p < 0.0001.

### Effect of subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 3 randomized clinical trial [^112BFVzL]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Weight loss improves cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight or obesity. Intensive lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy are the most effective noninvasive weight loss approaches.

Objective

To compare the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg vs placebo for weight management as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy with initial low-calorie diet in adults with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 68-week, phase 3a study (STEP 3) conducted at 41 sites in the US from August 2018 to April 2020 in adults without diabetes (N = 611) and with either overweight (body mass index ≥ 27) plus at least 1 comorbidity or obesity (body mass index ≥ 30).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (2:1) to semaglutide, 2.4 mg (n = 407) or placebo (n = 204), both combined with a low-calorie diet for the first 8 weeks and intensive behavioral therapy (ie, 30 counseling visits) during 68 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The co-primary end points were percentage change in body weight and the loss of 5% or more of baseline weight by week 68. Confirmatory secondary end points included losses of at least 10% or 15% of baseline weight.

Results

Of 611 randomized participants (495 women [81.0%], mean age 46 years [SD, 13], body weight 105.8 kg [SD, 22.9], and body mass index 38.0 [SD, 6.7]), 567 (92.8%) completed the trial, and 505 (82.7%) were receiving treatment at trial end. At week 68, the estimated mean body weight change from baseline was -16.0% for semaglutide vs -5.7% for placebo (difference, -10.3 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -8.6]; P < .001). More participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo lost at least 5% of baseline body weight (86.6% vs 47.6%, respectively; P < .001). A higher proportion of participants in the semaglutide vs placebo group achieved weight losses of at least 10% or 15% (75.3% vs 27.0% and 55.8% vs 13.2%, respectively; P < .001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide (82.8%) vs placebo (63.2%). Treatment was discontinued owing to these events in 3.4% of semaglutide participants vs 0% of placebo participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo, used as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy and initial low-calorie diet, resulted in significantly greater weight loss during 68 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the durability of these findings.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^114YQ4nW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a global health challenge with few pharmacologic options. Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥ 27 in persons with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.

Results

The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -13.4 to -11.5; P < 0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P < 0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

Conclusions

In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; STEP 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03548935).

### Semaglutide induces weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes regardless of baseline BMI or gastrointestinal adverse events in the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 trials [^116kW2QW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The SUSTAIN 1 to 5 clinical trials previously demonstrated the superiority of semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg once‐weekly over placebo and active comparators in inducing weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 The post hoc analysis presented here further establishes the consistency of semaglutide‐induced weight loss, which was significantly greater than placebo (both as monotherapy and as an add‐on to basal insulin), sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine, across all BMI subgroups. This is mirrored by similar analyses carried out on trials with other GLP‐1RAs. In trials with liraglutide (global population), exenatide and dulaglutide (Asian populations), weight loss over comparator remained significant across BMI subgroups. 25, 26, 27 In the DURATION 6 trial, subjects treated with exenatide ER and liraglutide consistently experienced weight loss regardless of whether their baseline BMI was < 30 or ≥ 30 kg/m 2. 27 An analysis of 6 trials in the AWARD clinical programme comparing dulaglutide with a range of comparators found that weight loss did not vary with baseline BMI. 28

The magnitude of weight loss achieved with both semaglutide doses (0.5 mg, 3.5 to 4.3 kg; 1.0 mg, 4.5 to 6.4 kg) is numerically higher than that reported previously in the clinical trials of other long‐acting GLP‐1RAs (−0.4 to +2.5 kg). 29, 30, 31, 32 Although comparisons of results between trials should be made with caution, a number of head‐to‐head trials between GLP‐1RAs have been completed that can place the results from the SUSTAIN programme in further perspective. In direct comparisons of GLP1‐RAs, weight loss was significantly greater with liraglutide 1.8 mg than exenatide ER, albiglutide, dulaglutide and lixisenatide, and similar to that of exenatide twice‐daily. 11, 12 While a phase 3 trial comparing semaglutide and liraglutide is not currently available, phase 2 results suggest that semaglutide treatment may be expected to show equivalent or greater weight loss. 33

### Incretin analogs for weight management in adults without diabetes [^1161jCRw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This is a narrative review of incretin analogs and their effect on weight management in adult without diabetes.

Data Sources

Randomized controlled trials were identified by English language. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched from inception through June 2023 to identify all pertinent trials reporting outcomes on efficacy and safety search using the terms: tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, and obesity.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Selected studies were included if the study population was composed of adults without diabetes being treated by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 agonists for weight management, and weight loss was assessed as a primary outcome.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies involving 3 pharmacotherapies (liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) were identified. Efficacy data supporting the use of these agents for weight management were promising when compared to placebo and/or other behavioral therapies. Percent weight loss ranged from 5.7% to 11.8%, 14.9% to 17.4%, and 15% to 20.9% for liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, respectively. Safety data were relatively similar across all trials and identified gastrointestinal adverse effects as most common.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists are preferred for overweight or obese patients by the American Gastroenterological Association. Future guidelines may address tirzepatides' place in therapy as new evidence comes forth. Providers should consider patient-specific factors such as cost, adverse effects, drug interactions, and comorbidities when prescribing these agents and provide education regarding the need for concurrent diet and exercise modifications.

Conclusions

All incretin analogs in this review are superior to placebo when used for weight management in adults without diabetes.

Liraglutide 3 mg

Liraglutide 3 mg once-daily injection is approved as an AOM. The double-blind 56-week SCALE trial of 3,731 people without T2DM showed that liraglutide 3 mg induced a superior weight reduction of − 8% as compared to − 2.6% with placebo in 56 weeks. While the weight loss benefits of liraglutide have been shown to be maintained for 2 years, patients are also able to tolerate the therapy, with only mild- to moderate-intensity adverse drug reactions (ADRs) relating to the GIT encountered. A total of five randomized, placebo‐controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide for weight management. Liraglutide 3 mg as an adjunct to diet and physical activity consistently resulted in a 4–6 kg weight loss, with higher proportions of patients achieving weight losses of at least 5 and 10% compared with placebo. The comparative data suggest that greater weight loss is achieved with liraglutide compared to orlistat or lorcaserin, but slightly lower weight loss than achieved with phentermine/topiramate.

Oral Semaglutide 50 mg

Oral semaglutide at a high dose of 50 mg will be examined in a phase 3a trial in the year 2021. With approximately 1000 obese or overweight subjects with comorbidities included in a 68-week-long study, this trial is designed to compare oral semaglutide and placebo in terms of efficacy and safety.

Danuglipron

Apart from its use in the management of T2DM, danuglipron has also been tested in obese and high-BMI patients for its weight loss benefits.

GLP-1 Co-formulations for the Treatment of Obesity

To achieve better weight-loss efficacy and mitigation of ADRs, combination therapies are now accepted in the management of obesity. GLP1RAs can be combined with other compounds to target multiple signalling pathways involved in energy balance regulation.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^115aaKv4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was -15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

### Liraglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with overweight or obesity: a post hoc analysis from SCALE randomized controlled trials [^117GNb9X]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The LEADER trial (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) was a prospective randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg in 9340 participants with T2DM. 9 During a median follow‐up period of 3.8 years, the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke (primary composite outcome) was significantly lower with liraglutide than with placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78‐0.97); P < .001. Results from another GLP‐1 RA trial, the SUSTAIN‐6 trial (Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes), indicated that therapy with once‐weekly semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0 mg) for 2 years was also associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58‐0.95). 16 Liraglutide 3.0 mg, compared to placebo, has demonstrated positive effects on body weight and a reduced risk of T2DM among individuals with prediabetes while on treatment, as well as a mean decrease in blood pressure. 11 Results from the present pooled analysis of the SCALE trials suggest no increased risk and a possible benefit of liraglutide 3.0 mg on cardiovascular safety in an overweight and obese population. The population of the SCALE trials was younger on average, with a higher mean BMI, and was at lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to the LEADER trial. Moreover, individuals with uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. Whether there is a dose/response relationship for the beneficial effect of liraglutide on cardiovascular risk is currently unknown, but weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg was significantly greater than with the 1.8 mg dose, 12 and was greater with higher doses compared with lower doses of semaglutide. 16

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^112Zwtm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^111F1dMC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent conditions associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Historically, pharmacologic treatments for weight reduction (antiobesity medications [AOMs]) have been limited in number, not particularly well-tolerated, and modest in impacts on weight. However, newer therapies, including the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide and the dual GLP-1 RA/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) agonist tirzepatide, have demonstrated substantial weight reduction in patients with obesity, with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).,

While tirzepatide produces greater weight loss than semaglutide in patients with T2D, data from head-to-head trials comparing these therapies in patients with overweight or obesity are not yet available. Further, it remains unclear whether the magnitude of weight loss in clinical settings mirrors that in RCTs, given well-described differences between these populations. Finally, because these medications are costly and insurance coverage is limited for patients without T2D, actual adherence may differ from clinical trials, potentially attenuating the treatment effect.

Accordingly, we aimed to compare on-treatment weight change between tirzepatide and semaglutide (injectable) labeled for T2D in a large clinical population. We quantified differences in (1) likelihood of achieving 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss, and (2) percentage change in body weight at 3, 6, and 12 months with treatment.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^112e2hLh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8was a head‐to‐head comparison in which participants were randomized to receive once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo, or once‐daily liraglutide 3.0 mg or matching placebo for 68 weeks.

All trials followed the same dose‐escalation regimen. Participants treated with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg were initiated on a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and the dose was escalated every 4 weeks to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg, until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached at week 16. If participants were unable to tolerate the 2.4 mg dose because of adverse events (AEs), lower maintenance doses were permitted if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely. It was recommended that participants made at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose. Diet and physical activity (lifestyle intervention) were recorded daily in a diary or by use of a smartphone application or other tools, reviewed during counselling sessions.

4.1 Estimands used to assess treatment efficacy

In line with regulatory guidance, the STEP trials were designed to report results using two estimands. The treatment policy (primary) estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication, while the secondary trial product estimand modelled treatment effects in all randomly assigned participants, assuming they had remained on treatment for the duration of the trials, and without initiation of rescue medication. The data reported in this review are based on the primary treatment policy estimand, since the statistical analyses were performed using this approach. Results using the two estimands were largely consistent.

### Cost-effectiveness of weight-management pharmacotherapies in Canada: a societal perspective [^113enazQ]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, semaglutide 2.4 mg was found to be a cost-effective treatment alternative compared with D&E alone (current SoC), or with orlistat (next best alternative), and extendedly dominated other pharmacotherapies (NB-32, or liraglutide 3.0 mg) in adults living with obesity or with overweight and ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity. The analyses conducted rely on surrogate effects of weight loss and glycemic reductions leading to delays in the incidences of weight-related diseases and costs. The modeled associations were informed via large, observational, cohort studies, e.g. QDiabetes, QRisk3, Framingham Recurrent CHD or meta meta-analyses of observational studies. The analysis further assumed that weight loss had an instantaneous effect on incidences, and that the effect did not depend on prior weight or time spent living with obesity.

### Coadministered cagrilintide and semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^1134QoPH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg has established weight-loss and cardiovascular benefits, and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg has shown promising results in early-phase trials; the efficacy of the combination (known as CagriSema) on weight loss in persons with either overweight and coexisting conditions or obesity is unknown.

Methods

In a phase 3a, 68-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. Participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 21:3:3:7 to receive the combination of semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg, semaglutide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, cagrilintide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, or placebo, plus lifestyle interventions for all groups. The coprimary end points were the relative change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight from baseline to week 68 with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with placebo. Body-weight reductions of 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more were assessed as confirmatory secondary end points. Effect estimates were assessed with the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle). Safety was assessed.

Results

A total of 3417 participants underwent randomization, with 2108 assigned to receive cagrilintide-semaglutide, 302 to receive semaglutide, 302 to receive cagrilintide, and 705 to receive placebo. The estimated mean percent change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -20.4% with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with -3.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -17.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -18.1 to -16.6; P < 0.001). Participants receiving cagrilintide-semaglutide were more likely than those receiving placebo to reach weight-loss targets of 5% or more, 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Gastrointestinal adverse events (affecting 79.6% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 39.9% in the placebo group), including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, were mainly transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Cagrilintide-semaglutide provided significant and clinically relevant body-weight reductions in adults with overweight or obesity, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05567796.).

Semaglutide 2.4 mg QW

The STEP 1 clinical trial has investigated the benefits of once-weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the management of people who are obese or overweight. In a double-blind trial of 1961 nondiabetic obese (≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight patients (≥ 27 kg/m 2) with coexisting weight-related complications, semaglutide 2.4 mg along with lifestyle modifications led to a 14.9% reduction in body weight as compared with a 2.4% reduction with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of − 12.4 percentage points at 68 weeks. The mean reduction in body weight from baseline to week 68 was − 15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared to − 2.6 kg in the placebo group. 86.4, 69.1, and 50.5% of the patients on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more, respectively, at the end of 68 weeks. Not only that, patients receiving semaglutide also reported significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors and physical functioning as compared to the placebo arm. Transient nausea and diarrhoea were the most common adverse events; these were of mild-to-moderate severity that subsided over time. The STEP 2 trial compared semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and semaglutide 1 mg for weight management in a double-blind, double-dummy design in overweight and obese T2DM patients. At the end of 68 weeks, semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week demonstrated a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in body weight compared with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of 6.2 percentage points (95% CI − 7.3 to − 5.2; p < 0.0001). A higher number of patients with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo achieved a weight loss of 5% or more (OR − 4.88, 95% CI 3.58–6.64). Furthermore, semaglutide 2.4 mg has been investigated versus placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy and a low-calorie diet for weight management in 611 overweight and obese patients in the STEP 3 trial. Higher proportions of the patients in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more at the end of 68 weeks: 86.6, 75.3, and 55.8%, respectively.

### Obesity pharmacotherapy in older adults: a narrative review of evidence [^1129GeoM]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Weight loss trials

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) studies had no upper limit in age. STEP-1 took 1961 adults with a BMI ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 in people with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) without T2D and demonstrated mean weight reduction of 14.8% in participants taking semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly (vs. 2.4% in the placebo group), as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 86.4% (vs. 31.5%) of patients achieved weight loss ≥ 5%, 69.1% (vs. 12%) achieved weight loss ≥ 10% and 50.5% (vs. 4.9%) achieved weight loss ≥ 15%. Results were reduced in those with T2D, but still significant (STEP-2). Further STEP trials have demonstrated mean weight reduction of 16% (vs. 5.7%) when semaglutide was used as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy (STEP-3), and improved head-to-head weight reduction compared to liraglutide over 68 weeks, with possible benefits in older adults given the once weekly administration of semaglutide (STEP-8). STEP-4 gave every participant a 20-week course of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, and produced a mean weight loss of 10.6%, before randomisation to either continued semaglutide treatment or exchange to placebo for an additional 48 weeks. Continuation of semaglutide resulted in a further 7.9% reduction in body weight from their week 20 weight, whereas the placebo group regained 6.9%. However, STEP 1 extension concluded that 1-year withdrawal of semaglutide results in regain of two-thirds of prior weight loss, highlighting that withdrawal of semaglutide results in weight regain which may be problematic in older adults who are already using polypharmacy approaches for comorbid disease. Consideration of a cyclical delivery of semaglutide, and other AOMs, could be considered, where semaglutide is administered until a pre-determined body weight is achieved, at which point an interval period is commenced until a pre-determined percentage of weight is regained, before restarting treatment. In addition to being polypharmacologically beneficial, this method would appeal to organisations funding healthcare in the licensing of AOMs. More evidence is needed to clarify the ideal duration that an AOM should be given initially before the first interval, but longer compliance with anti-obesity agents from the outset does result in reduced weight regain following cessation. If this method was to be implemented, it would be imperative to remember the evidence to date suggests benefit only with chronic prescription of respective AOM, both in relation to weight and cardiometabolic disease.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^111ZKFqL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.3 Comparative effectiveness studies of‐for weight loss

In general, there were few large, methodologically strong head‐to‐head comparative effectiveness studies of weight loss in obese users of different GLP‐1RA for weight loss (Table 2). Liraglutide has been compared with dulaglutide, showing no clear difference in weight loss. In patients receiving GLP‐1RA treatment for T2D or obesity, semaglutide use was more likely to lead to weight reduction of ≥ 10% compared with liraglutide use. In individuals without T2D, weight loss was 6.9% for semaglutide, 6.6% for liraglutide and 3.1% for dulaglutide. A newer large real‐world comparative cohort study from the US of more than 18 000 adults with overweight or obesity compared weight loss during treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide. The treatment was labelled for T2D, yet only 52% of individuals in the study were classified as having T2D. The achieved treatment doses were not reported. The study found a larger weight loss at 12 months for tirzepatide (−15.3%) versus semaglutide (−8.3%) in individuals who had not been excluded due to discontinuation or GLP‐1RA switching. Two recent studies based on the TriNetX database have compared users of tirzepatide with either users of semaglutideor other GLP‐1RAs (combined). Anson et al. followed individuals after six months of completed treatment with tirzepatide and semaglutide and found that tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss and decreased risk of developing T2D in individuals without pre‐existing diabetes compared with semaglutide at one‐year follow‐up. In patients with T2D, Chuang et al. found a greater effect on weight loss with tirzepatide than other GLP‐1RA combined; however, treatment duration was not reported. More well‐conducted real‐world studies in different cohorts and with comparable doses are required for concluding on real‐world comparative effectiveness.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^112pvz1X]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of 3389 patients with obesity treated with injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide in a regular clinical setting, achieving sustained weight reduction of 10% or more was associated with the GLP-1 RA agent, treatment indication, medication dosage, sex, and persistence with medication coverage. Future research should focus on identifying the reasons for discontinuation of medication use and interventions aimed at improving long-term persistent coverage.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^111yd7at]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

### Efficacy and safety of efpeglenatide in key patient subgroups from the BALANCE randomized trial, stratified by pre-diabetes status, BMI, and age at baseline [^111iSfeK]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Currently, there are two GLP-1 RAs approved for body weight management in patients with obesity and without diabetes: liraglutide, administered as a once-daily injection; and semaglutide, administered QW. In a trial in patients with obesity and without T2D, 20-week treatment with liraglutide 1.8–3.0 mg once daily led to an 84%–96% decrease in the prevalence of pre-diabetes (defined as FPG 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL) or glucose tolerance 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL) measured during an oral glucose tolerance test). Liraglutide was also shown to reduce the incidence of progression to T2D in a study of adults with pre-diabetes and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities). Of patients treated with liraglutide, 2% were diagnosed with diabetes after 3 years compared with 6% of the placebo group, and the time from randomization to diagnosis was 2.7 times longer with liraglutide than with placebo (p < 0.0001). The recent Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) phase III clinical trial program explored the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide in overweight adults without diabetes with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4)or in adults with T2D with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (STEP 2). All trials showed that semaglutide was associated with significantly greater body weight reductions and a greater proportion of patients achieved weight loss of 5% or greater compared with placebo. The STEP 1 study also showed that, of patients with pre-diabetes, 84.1% of those in the once-weekly semaglutide group reverted to normoglycemia after 68 weeks of treatment, compared with 47.8% in the placebo group.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and agonists administered for obesity with weight loss and adverse events: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112sb821]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Comparative effectiveness of 7 glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agents on weight loss (WL) in obesity remains unknown.

Methods

We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) utilizing the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central and clinical trial registries, from inception to March 2, 2021. The prespecified criteria for study inclusion were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of ≥ 12 weeks' duration. The data appraisal and extraction were performed by two investigators independently, using the published reports. The main outcomes and statistical methods were weight loss over placebo (WLOP) and adverse events (AEs) among GLP-1 agents using random-effects NMA (frequentist approach); relative ranking using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) method and certainty of evidence using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE).

Findings

64 RCTs (from 2004 to 2021) included 27018 patients (median of age, 55.1 years old; 57.4% women; baseline weight 94.8kg and BMI 33.0kg/m 2; trial duration 26 weeks). Direct meta-analysis showed significant WLOP with: -1.44kg (95% CI, -2.14 to -0.74) with dulaglutide ≥ 1.5 mg; -1.82kg (-2.42 to -1.23) with exenatide immediate release (IR); -2.20kg (-4.31 to -0.08) with exenatide extended release (ER); -3.20kg (-6.53 to 0.15) with efpeglenatide; -2.72kg (-3.35 to -2.09) with liraglutide ≤ 1.8mg; -4.49kg (-5.26 to -3.72) with liraglutide > 1.8mg; -0.62kg (-1.22 to -0.02) with lixisenatide; -4.33kg (-5.71 to -3.00) with semaglutide SQ < 2.4mg; -9.88kg (-13.17 to -6.59) with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg; -2.73kg (-4.81 to -0.65) with semaglutide oral; and -1.71kg (-2.64 to -0.78) with taspoglutide. Highest WLOP were with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg and < 2.4mg, and liraglutide > 1.8mg (SUCRAs 100, 86.1, 82.8 respectively). Highest SUCRAs for discontinuation due to AEs were with taspoglutide and liraglutide > 1.8mg. Risk of bias was high or unclear for random sequence generation (29.7%), allocation concealment (26.6%), and incomplete outcome data (26.6%). Heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%) in WL and AEs reflected magnitude, not direction of effect.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^115fQHyA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

No retrospective cohort study has assessed the effectiveness of semaglutide at doses used in randomized clinical trials to treat obesity (ie, 1.7 and 2.4 mg).

Objective

To study weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment at doses used in randomized clinical trials for patients with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study, conducted at a referral center for weight management, retrospectively collected data on the use of semaglutide for adults with overweight or obesity between January 1, 2021, and March 15, 2022, with a follow-up of up to 6 months. A total of 408 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more were prescribed weekly semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 months or more. Patients with a history of bariatric procedures, taking other antiobesity medications, and with an active malignant neoplasm were excluded.

Exposures

Weekly 1.7-mg or 2.4-mg semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 to 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the percentage of weight loss. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving weight loss of 5% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more after 3 and 6 months and the percentage of weight loss for patients with or without type 2 diabetes after 3 and 6 months.

Results

The study included 175 patients (132 women [75.4%]; mean [SD] age, 49.3 [12.5] years; mean [SD] BMI, 41.3 [9.1]) in the analysis at 3 months and 102 patients at 6 months. The mean (SD) weight loss after 3 months was 6.7 (4.4) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 5.9% (3.7%) (P < .001), and the mean (SD) weight loss after 6 months was 12.3 (6.6) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 10.9% (5.8%) (P < .001 from baseline). Of the 102 patients who were followed up at 6 months, 89 (87.3%) achieved weight loss of 5% or more, 56 (54.9%) achieved weight loss of 10% or more, 24 (23.5%) achieved weight loss of 15% or more, and 8 (7.8%) achieved weight loss of 20% or more. Patients with type 2 diabetes had a lower mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 3 and 6 months compared with those without type 2 diabetes: 3.9% (3.1%) vs 6.3% (3.7%) at 3 months (P = 0.001) and 7.2% (6.3%) vs 11.8% (5.3%) at 6 months (P = 0.005).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that weekly 1.7-mg and 2.4-mg doses of semaglutide were associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized clinical trials. Studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to evaluate prolonged weight loss outcomes.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^111QAHRT]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.

Weight Loss by Obesity Class

Obesity classes are divided into class 1 (BMI, 30 to < 35), class 2 (BMI, 35 to < 40), and class 3 (BMI, ≥ 40). Patients with class 3 obesity had similar mean (SD) weight loss outcomes when compared with patients with overweight or classes 1 and 2 obesity at 3 months (7.1 [5.0] kg [n = 89] vs 6.3 [3.6] kg [n = 86]; p = 0.27), equivalent to mean (SD) weight loss of 5.3% (3.8%) vs 6.5% (3.6%) (P = 0.03) and at 6 months (−12.6 [7.9] kg [n = 51] vs −12.1 [5.0] kg [n = 51]; p = 0.70), equivalent to mean (SD) weight loss of 9.2% (5.9%) vs 12.6% (5.2%) (P = 0.002).

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Liraglutide versus semaglutide for weight reduction-a cost needed to treat analysis [^111aCzzj]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Higher doses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists liraglutide and, more recently, semaglutide have demonstrated a significant reduction in body weight. However, their comparative value for money for this indication is unclear.

Methods

The cost needed to treat to achieve a 1% reduction in body weight using semaglutide or liraglutide was calculated. The body weight reductions were extracted from the published STEP 1 trial and the SCALE trial results, respectively. A scenario analysis was performed to mitigate the primary differences between the two studies' populations. Drug costs were based on US GoodRx prices as of October 2022.

Results

Liraglutide in STEP 1 resulted in a weight loss of 5.4% (95% CI: 5%-5.8%). Semaglutide in SCALE resulted in a weight loss of 12.4% (95% CI: 11.5%-13.4%). The total cost of therapy with liraglutide during the trial was estimated at $17,585 compared with $22,878 with semaglutide. Accordingly, the cost needed to treat per 1% of body weight reduction with liraglutide is estimated at $3256 (95% CI: $3032-$3517) compared with $1845 (95% CI: $1707-$1989) with semaglutide.

Conclusions

Semaglutide provides significantly better value for money than liraglutide for weight reduction.

### If the evidence is there, why are GLP-1 receptor agonists not on-label for hip and knee osteoarthritis in overweight patients? [^113EjMpX]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

While the STEP 9 and STOP-KNEE OA trials focus on patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in OA patients with overweight (BMI 27–29.9 kg/m²) has not been systematically examined. However, extensive weight management literature offers substantial evidence supporting the effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs for individuals in this BMI category. Beyond OA-specific trials, pooled analyses of the SCALE trials demonstrated that liraglutide resulted in clinically significant and sustained weight loss in overweight individuals with at least one weight-related comorbidity, accompanied by improvements in blood pressure, glycaemic control and lipid profiles. In the STEP 1 and STEP 3 trials, semaglutide resulted in over 10% body weight reduction in overweight or obese individuals without diabetes. The SELECT trial, which enrolled 17 604 adults with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and established CVD but no previous diagnosis of diabetes, demonstrated that semaglutide reduced the risk of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke by 20%. These findings highlight the extensive therapeutic advantages of GLP-1 RAs in groups at metabolic risk — advantages that likely extend to patients with symptomatic OA yet remain inaccessible to many due to regulatory restrictions. Although there are currently no OA-specific randomised trials involving the overweight OA population (BMI 27–29.9 kg/m²), there is no data indicating that GLP-1 RAs would exhibit a distinct safety profile in these patients compared with other overweight populations that have been thoroughly investigated.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^115QY3cJ]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

Co-primary endpoints were percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 104 and achievement of weight loss of at least 5% of baseline weight at week 104. These were tested first in the statistical testing hierarchy, followed by the confirmatory secondary endpoints, which were tested in the following order: achievement of weight loss of at least 10% or 15% at week 104; and change from baseline to week 104 in waist circumference and systolic blood pressure.

Supportive secondary endpoints were not included in the statistical testing hierarchy and were: achievement of weight loss of ≥ 20% at week 104; change from baseline to week 104 in body weight (in kg), BMI, HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, diastolic blood pressure, lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids and triglycerides) and C-reactive protein; change from baseline to week 52 in body weight (percentage change and kg change), BMI and waist circumference; and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, ≥ 15% and ≥ 20% at week 52.

### Effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery weight recurrence [^112LFnv7]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) weight recurrence.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 207 adults with post-MBS weight recurrence treated with semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly (n = 115) or liraglutide 3.0 mg daily (n = 92) at an academic center from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2021, was conducted. The primary end point was percentage body weight change at 12 months of treatment with regimens containing semaglutide or liraglutide.

Results

The mean sample age was 55.2years; mean BMI was 40.4 kg/m 2; 89.9% were female; and 50% completed sleeve gastrectomy, 29% completed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 21% completed adjustable gastric banding. Least-squares mean weight change at 12 months was -12.92% versus -8.77% in the semaglutide and liraglutide groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The adjusted odds ratios were 2.34 (95% CI: 1.28–4.29) for ≥ 10% weight loss and 2.55 (95% CI: 1.22–5.36) for ≥ 15% weight loss over 12 months in the semaglutide group versus liraglutide group, respectively. Weight-loss efficacy of semaglutide (vs. liraglutide) did not differ by subgroups explored, including age, sex, and MBS procedure.

Conclusions

These results show that treatment regimens including semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly lead to superior weight loss compared with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily for treating post-MBS weight recurrence, regardless of procedure type or the magnitude of weight recurrence.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management in participants from China: a prespecified analysis of the STEP 7 randomized clinical trial [^111qfpFx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a multifaceted health condition associated with multiple complications, including an increased risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and musculoskeletal disorders. Obesity can negatively impact mental health, leading to depression, anxiety and diminished quality of life (QOL).

While the World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m 2, if the Working Group on Obesity in China definitions are applied (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m 2 for overweight; BMI ≥ 28 kg/m 2 for obesity), China had the highest global prevalence of overweight or obesity in 2021, with roughly 50% of adults affected. This is projected to increase to two‐thirds of the adult population by 2030. Pharmacological options for treating obesity in China are scarce; by 2023, only orlistat, beinaglutide and liraglutide were approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for weight management. As such, there is a strong unmet need for convenient medication for overweight and obesity in China.

The efficacy and safety of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA), have been demonstrated for weight management in the STEP programme. Semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbidity in the United States, Europe and other countries, including China (NMPA, June 2024). In STEP 7 (NCT04251156), efficacy and safety were demonstrated in a predominantly East Asian population with overweight or obesity, with or without T2D.

This prespecified analysis compared the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity in Chinese participants enrolled in STEP 7.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (exenatide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide; note: liraglutide 3 mg dose FDA-approved for long-term weight management) demonstrate weight-loss effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with a Cochrane review reporting weight loss of 2.87 kg for exenatide and 3.24 kg for liraglutide across 17 randomized controlled trials (6,899 participants; 26 weeks), and an open-label T2DM trial noting a mean baseline BMI approximately 34 kg/m² with weight loss of 5.6 kg with semaglutide and 1.9 kg with exenatide; in a Phase 2 trial in patients with obesity (without DM), weight loss was significantly higher in all semaglutide groups versus placebo and compared to 3.0 mg liraglutide at semaglutide doses of 0.2 mg per day or more. Nausea is common and tends to subside with continuation of therapy, and dose escalation may be done more slowly if GI intolerance occurs. Although pancreatitis risk is a concern, in LEADER (n = 9,340 T2DM) acute pancreatitis numbers were higher with placebo (23, 0.5%, 1.7 events/1,000 patient-years of observation [PYO]) than with liraglutide (18, 0.4%, 1.1 events/1,000 PYO). Due to rat and mice data with increased C-cell tumors, there is a boxed warning of thyroid C-cell (medullary) tumor risk and GLP-1 agonists are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).

In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week", "1.0 mg/week", and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering weight management pharmacotherapy along with lifestyle changes in patients with T2DM and overweight or obesity. Prefer GLP-1 receptor agonist or dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist with greater weight loss efficacy (semaglutide or tirzepatide), especially considering their added weight-independent benefits (glycemic and cardiometabolic).

### An indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg [^111E8AQb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study indirectly compared the effect of two GLP‐1 RAs (semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg) on reducing HbA1c and body weight from baseline in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin therapy.

The primary analysis showed that semaglutide 1.0 mg was significantly more effective than dulaglutide 3.0 mg and comparable with dulaglutide 4.5 mg in reducing HbA1c from baseline. Semaglutide 1.0 mg was also significantly more effective at reducing body weight versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg. No significant difference was shown in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c less than 7.0% for any comparison. All sensitivity analyses supported the findings of the primary analysis.

This is the first comparison of semaglutide 1.0 mg with dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin. With multiple products in the GLP‐1 RA class now available, information regarding their comparative effectiveness has become clinically relevant. Higher HbA1c levels are associated with a greater risk of complications from T2D, with only 26.4% of patients with T2D achieving the target HbA1c of less than 6.5%. Approximately 90% of people with T2D are overweight or have obesity. Diabetes and obesity together increase the risk of a range of chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and risk of mortality. Weight loss in patients with T2D has been shown to reduce HbA1c levels and improve cardiovascular risk factors. Weight loss is therefore an important consideration in the treatment of T2D. Hence, there is a need for treatment strategies for reducing body weight, in addition to improving glycaemic control, in patients with T2D. The significantly greater reductions in body weight shown with semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg in this indirect comparison may therefore be a factor to consider for clinicians determining the most appropriate GLP‐1 RA for individual patients. A higher dose of semaglutide (2.0 mg) for the treatment of T2D is currently being investigated in SUSTAIN FORTE.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^11695jAi]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While early total body weight loss of at least 5% labels patients as responders to AOM, a higher response should be targeted; 5–10% total body weight loss is associated with a reduction in the risk of various metabolic, skeletal, and anatomical complications of obesity, and a total body weight loss > 15% may be needed to result in improvement of CV outcomes, as observed in studies assessing effects of weight loss in response to lifestyle modifications. The effectiveness of the currently available weight loss monotherapies is still modest, with the exception of GLP-1 RA, and in particular semaglutide, which in combination with behavioral modification therapy, may achieve more than 15% weight loss. The combination of more than one molecule may be needed to achieve a larger total body weight loss; for instance, tirzepatide, a GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist, led to ∼23% weight loss with the highest dose. New drugs seem thus have a much higher potency and are expected to change the medical weight management landscape in the not-so-distant future. Trials on AOM showed improvement in various metabolic parameters, some of which were of a small magnitude with a limited clinical implication. Furthermore, whether this effect has been driven solely by total body weight loss, rather than a direct effect of the drug per se, and whether it differs between metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy individuals with obesity, has been poorly investigated. While some available data showed improvement in liver steatosis with GLP1-RA, there is no evidence of reduction in liver fibrosis with any AOM, a parameter that requires longer term studies to show benefit. To-date, data on the effect of AOM on CV outcomes are still lacking. However, indirect evidence from trials in patients with DM is promising. The LEADER trial compared liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) to placebo in patients with DM on a composite CV outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarct and non-fatal stroke). After a median follow up of 3.8 years, there was a 13% relative risk reduction in the composite CV outcomes and 22% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death, in liraglutide group, compared to placebo. In a similar study design in patients with DM, semaglutide showed a 26% relative risk reduction the composite CV outcome, compared to placebo, while there was no difference in CV death. Interestingly, new findings suggest a potential neuroprotective effect of GLP-1 agonist, with a reduction of the risk of dementia and age-related cognitive decline, associated with diabetes and obesity; such a promising effect needs to be demonstrated in large prospective studies, extending over several years to decades.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^115ZmzxX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease, leading to substantial burden on individuals and health care systems worldwide. Weight management guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2, or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with weight‐related comorbidities.,

Semaglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for weight management in people with overweight or obesity at a once‐weekly subcutaneous dose of 2.4 mg. In the phase III Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) 1‐4 studies, weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated substantial, clinically meaningful weight losses and improvements in cardiometabolic parameters and patient‐reported outcomes.,

Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), most commonly mild‐to‐moderate nausea, are a dose‐dependent class effect of GLP‐1RAs. We conducted a pooled analysis of the STEP 1‐3 trials to evaluate the GI AE profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg. In addition, we explored whether GI AEs contributed to the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide in STEP 1‐3. Data from the STEP 4 withdrawal trial were analysed separately and used to evaluate the incidence of GI AEs after achievement of the target 2.4 mg maintenance dose. These analyses may inform understanding of both weight loss and GI tolerability with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

4 EFFECTS OF GLP‐1RA FOR WEIGHT LOSS

4.1 Clinical guidelines for‐therapies

Guidelines for the clinical management of people with obesity have generally lagged behind the rapid development of newer pharmacological therapies. Existing guidelines have been reviewed recently by others, for example, Cornier, Yuristaand Gaskin. While newer cardiology guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in 2019and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2021cover weight loss in cardiovascular disease prevention, and the 2020 Canadian clinical practice guideline on obesity in adultsoffers good advice on assessment, prevention and treatment of obesity, these guidelines do not cover the most effective weight loss drugs currently in use, that is, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The newer American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelinesoffer some guidance on the use of liraglutide and semaglutide.

4.2 Clinical effectiveness of‐for weight loss in real‐world populations

Most studies evaluating the real‐world effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss are observational studies of the 'before‐after' type, that is, comparing post‐treatment initiation body weight with pre‐treatment weight in people who all are exposed to the drug of interest. In total, we reviewed 24 studies,(Table 1), most of which were published recently, that is, in 2024.,

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p < 0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p < 0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p < 0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p < 0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p < 0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p = 0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p < 0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p < 0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes, obesity and beyond [^111FEVGZ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The success of these medicines has spurred development of next-generation GLP-1-based drugs, promising greater weight loss, improved tolerability and additional options for the route and frequency of dosing. This Review profiles established and emerging GLP-1-based medicines, discussing optimization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability, engagement of new therapeutically useful pathways and safety aspects. Structurally unique GLP-1-based medicines that achieve substantially greater and rapid weight loss may impact musculoskeletal health, providing a rationale for therapeutics that more selectively target adipose tissue loss while preserving muscle mass and strength. Ongoing clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease, neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, hypertension and neurodegenerative disorders may broaden indications for GLP-1-based therapeutics.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^11222hio]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — weight management pharmacotherapy indications and preferred agents: Pharmacotherapy is indicated for individuals with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥ 27 kg/m2 with comorbidities, and in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, agents with both glucose-lowering and weight loss effects are preferred and include GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA class; some agents (liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide) have an indication for glucose lowering as well as weight management. Phentermine and other older adrenergic agents are approved for short-term treatment, while others are approved for long-term treatment. If these medications do not achieve weight goals or are not tolerated or are contraindicated, other obesity treatment approaches should be considered.

### The emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of NAFLD [^116bhpcm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Because greater weight loss was observed in early head-to-head trials of semaglutide compared with liraglutide, the STEP program involved several RCTs (n = 4988) developed to assess the efficacy and safety for weight management of higher dose semaglutide (2.4 mg/weekly). Results of the 68-week-duration STEP 1 to STEP 4 trials have been recently reported (STEP 1: weight management [WM]; STEP 2: WM in T2D; STEP 3: intensive behavioral therapy; STEP 4: sustained WM; STEP-5 is an ongoing 102-week treatment trial). As anticipated, weight loss was greater than in the SCALE trials. The most impressive is perhaps STEP 4, in which patients with overweight/obesity without T2D, all initially treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly for 20 weeks, were randomized to receive either continued semaglutide or placebo for another 48 weeks. The mean weight loss of volunteers that continued on semaglutide was 7.9% in contrast to a weight regain of 6.9% on placebo. Pooling the STEP 1 to 4 studies together, semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly led to a mean weight loss ranging from -7.9% to -16% (-7.1 to -16.8 kg), whereas with placebo it ranged from +6.9% to -5.7% (+6.1 to -6.2 kg). These results led to the approval on June 4, 2021 of semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly (as Wegovy) for the treatment of obesity. Such results clearly make semaglutide a strong candidate for the use in patients with NAFLD.

Semaglutide pharmacology

Semaglutide is a long‐acting GLP‐1 analogue that mimics the effects of native GLP‐1, which promotes WL by reducing energy intake, increasing satiety and satiation, and reducing hunger, as well as enhancing glycemic control (17). Many GLP‐1s have been approved for the treatment of T2D, but only liraglutide 3.0 mg daily has been approved for WM. Semaglutide is approved for treatment of diabetes at the dosage of ≤ 1.0 mg once weekly subcutaneously or in oral tablet form at a dosage of up to 14 mg (2, 17, 18, 19, 20).

Current phase 3 trials are investigating semaglutide as a new GLP‐1 analogue for the treatment of obesity because greater WL was observed with semaglutide than liraglutide (21). In the phase 2 trial of semaglutide in adults with obesity, a 0.4‐mg dose daily was well tolerated, and patients experienced a mean WL at week 52 from baseline of −13.8% compared with −7.8% for liraglutide 3.0 mg and −2.3% for placebo (21).

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity program

The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial development program is evaluating semaglutide 2.4 mg, administered subcutaneously once weekly, for WM in people with obesity or overweight. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the effect, safety, and tolerability profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg on WL, to enable further clinical development, and to support regulatory approval of semaglutide for WM. The trial design, objectives, end points, and baseline characteristics of five of the STEP trials are presented in this article.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111VJk7F]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Obesity and weight-informed antihyperglycemic choice — Overweight or obesity are present in over 90% of people with type 2 diabetes, so weight effects of medications should guide selection. Insulins, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones can promote weight gain and should be used judiciously and at the lowest possible dose, while glucose-lowering medications that promote weight loss should be prioritized. Of the currently available agents, tirzepatide and semaglutide have the highest efficacy for glucose lowering and weight loss, followed by dulaglutide, liraglutide, and extended-release exenatide. Other agents (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, dopamine agonists, bile acid sequestrants, and α-glucosidase inhibitors) are weight neutral or modestly beneficial and can be used as add-ons when further glucose lowering is needed or when preferred agents are not tolerated, contraindicated, or unavailable. Metabolic surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, are very effective for weight and glycemic goals.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and progressive disease characterised by excess adiposity, which affects more than one billion people worldwide. Obesity is associated with several health complications, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, various cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and decreased quality of life.

Newly developed gut hormone‐based medications are effective for weight loss and treatment of obesity‐related diseases and are therefore approved for obesity treatment as an adjunct to increased physical activity and reduced calorie diets. Particularly, the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist, semaglutide, and the GLP‐1/glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist (RA), tirzepatide, have shown large weight losses of 15%–16%, and up to 19%–22.5%respectively, in randomised controlled trials (RCT). GLP‐1 receptor agonists act by enhancing glucose‐dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release, while also reducing appetite and energy intake through delayed gastric emptying and increased satiety signalling. Several other gut hormone‐based obesity treatments are currently being investigated in clinical trials, such as GLP‐1/GIP/Glucagon triple receptor agonist (retatrutide), GLP‐1/Glucagon receptor dual agonist (survodutide and mazdutide), and Amylin/GLP‐1 receptor agonist (CagriSema and Amycretin).with early data suggesting even larger weight losses. In contrast to controlled trials, real‐world effectiveness may be influenced by medication costs, diverse populations, and the fact that many stop medications already within the first year. Thus, real‐world evidence (RWE) studies are necessary to elucidate the treatment effect and implementation possibilities in clinical practice. Unlike RCTs which assess efficacy under controlled conditions, RWE studies evaluate effectiveness in everyday settings and more diverse patient populations.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^116UFpX3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In populations using GLP‐1 RAs in higher doses specifically for weight loss, less is currently known about pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risks. A real‐world comparative cohort study found rates of pancreatitis of 4.6 (semaglutide) and 7.9 (liraglutide) per 1000 person‐years compared with a remarkably low rate of 1.0 in bupropion‐naltrexone initiators, yielding a high yet imprecise HR of 9.1 (95% CI 1.3–66.0). Another real‐world comparative cohort study of GLP‐1RA initiators for overweight found no difference between these semaglutide and tirzepatide (HR 1.04, 0.52–2.11). These real‐world pancreatitis rates of approximately 4 to 8 per 1000 person‐years with GLP‐1RA are several fold higher than in the major weight loss RCTs of liraglutide RCT. Of note, meta‐analyses of RCTs in either T2D or weight loss have found no increased risk of pancreatitis. However, in the RCTs, people were not eligible if they had a history of chronic or recent acute pancreatitis, and if they had any disorder (such as psychiatric illness or alcohol abuse) potentially compromising their trial compliance, which — together with more selective pancreatitis case adjudication in the trials — might explain the higher absolute pancreatitis risks in some real‐world studies. Although most clinical guidelines as well as EMA and FDA list pancreatitis as a possible side effect of GLP‐1RAs, most real‐world studies suggest no clear increased pancreatitis risk with GLP‐1RAs, thus corroborating findings from meta‐analyses of the RCTs.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^117DDcMb]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 therapy efficacy magnitude and durability summarize trial and real-world effects and temporal patterns. In the original phase 3 randomized trials for obesity, average weight reduction compared to placebo has ranged from 5.3% to 17.8% after 56–72 weeks. In real-world practice, the efficacy for weight reduction is often lower: for example, about 8% for individuals with diabetes and 11% for individuals without diabetes at 60 weeks with semaglutide 2.4 mg/day. Generally, weight reduction is more rapid during the first 6 months and then slower thereafter, with relative plateauing at 18 months. When GLP-1 use is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 years, whereas when GLP-1s are stopped, weight regain is common — typically nearly to baseline within one year.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of overweight or obesity in Asian populations: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomised trials [^111c8nWC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity among Asian populations poses a critical public health concern. Semaglutide 2.4mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated promising weight-reduction effects in global populations, but its efficacy and safety profile in Asians remain less comprehensively examined. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of semaglutide 2.4mg compared to placebo in Asian individuals with overweight or obesity.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, ScienceDirect, Europe pubMed central (PMC) and the Cochrane Library up to 15 June 2025. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing semaglutide 2.4mg with placebo in overweight or obese Asian individuals. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias v2 tool. Pooled outcomes were analysed using random-effects models to estimate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 statistic.

Results

Five RCTs involving 2614 participants met the inclusion criteria. All trials were deemed to have a low risk of bias. Our meta-analysis indicated that treatment with semaglutide 2.4mg resulted in significantly greater reductions in body weight (MD: -8.20%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -10.06 to -6.35; I² = 84%), waist circumference (MD: -6.47cm; 95% CI: -8.26 to -4.68; I² = 84%), body mass index (MD: -3.22kg/m 2; 95% CI: -4.01 to -2.44; I² = 66%) and systolic blood pressure (MD: -3.46mmHg; 95% CI: -5.29 to -1.62; I² = 28%) compared to placebo. A higher proportion of participants in semaglutide 2.4mg achieved weight loss exceeding 5%, 10% and 15%. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly reported adverse effects, generally mild to moderate and self-limiting.

Conclusions

Semaglutide 2.4mg significantly improves weight-related and cardiometabolic outcomes in Asian adults with overweight or obesity. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term effects, real-world applicability and variability across subpopulations.

### Ease-of-use and acceptability of the novel semaglutide 2.4 mg single-dose pen-injector in people with overweight or obesity in the STEP 8 phase III trial [^115RhW6n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 analogue, is indicated for weight management and is administered once‐weekly (at any time of day, with or without meals), in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. Its efficacy and safety were established through the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) phase III trial programme.,

An autoinjector‐type single‐dose pen‐injector (SPI; Figure S1) has been developed for semaglutide 2.4 mg. Its first use in a phase III trial was during STEP 8, the primary endpoint of which was to compare the weight loss with once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg with that of once‐daily liraglutide 3.0 mg in adults with overweight/obesity. Because the semaglutide 2.4 mg SPI is the first autoinjector used for weight management, the aim of the present study, performed according to a STEP 8 protocol amendment, was to examine the patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) ease‐of‐use and acceptability, including comparisons of the SPI with hypothetical once‐daily oral treatment. In addition, we examined ease‐of‐training as reported by site healthcare professionals (HCPs).

### Efficacy of liraglutide for weight loss among patients with type 2 diabetes: the SCALE diabetes randomized clinical trial [^116xb97X]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Weight loss of 5% to 10% can improve type 2 diabetes and related comorbidities. Few safe, effective weight-management drugs are currently available.

Objective

To investigate efficacy and safety of liraglutide vs placebo for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Fifty-six-week randomized (2:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with 12-week observational off-drug follow-up period. The study was conducted at 126 sites in 9 countries between June 2011 and January 2013. Of 1361 participants assessed for eligibility, 846 were randomized. Inclusion criteria were body mass index of 27.0 or greater, age 18 years or older, taking 0 to 3 oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea) with stable body weight, and glycated hemoglobin level 7.0% to 10.0%.

Interventions

Once-daily, subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0 mg) (n = 423), liraglutide (1.8 mg) (n = 211), or placebo (n = 212), all as adjunct to 500 kcal/d dietary deficit and increased physical activity (≥ 150 min/wk).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Three coprimary end points: relative change in weight, proportion of participants losing 5% or more, or more than 10%, of baseline weight at week 56.

Results

Baseline weight was 105.7 kg with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 105.8 kg with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 106.5 kg with placebo. Weight loss was 6.0% (6.4 kg) with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 4.7% (5.0 kg) with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 2.0% (2.2 kg) with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0 mg] vs placebo, -4.00% [95% CI, -5.10% to -2.90%]; liraglutide [1.8 mg] vs placebo, -2.71% [95% CI, -4.00% to -1.42%]; P < .001 for both). Weight loss of 5% or greater occurred in 54.3% with liraglutide (3.0 mg) and 40.4% with liraglutide (1.8 mg) vs 21.4% with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0 mg] vs placebo, 32.9% [95% CI, 24.6% to 41.2%]; for liraglutide [1.8 mg] vs placebo, 19.0% [95% CI, 9.1% to 28.8%]; P < .001 for both). Weight loss greater than 10% occurred in 25.2% with liraglutide (3.0 mg) and 15.9% with liraglutide (1.8 mg) vs 6.7% with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0 mg] vs placebo, 18.5% [95% CI, 12.7% to 24.4%], P < .001; for liraglutide [1.8 mg] vs placebo, 9.3% [95% CI, 2.7% to 15.8%], P = 0.006). More gastrointestinal disorders were reported with liraglutide (3.0 mg) vs liraglutide (1.8 mg) and placebo. No pancreatitis was reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among overweight and obese participants with type 2 diabetes, use of subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0 mg) daily, compared with placebo, resulted in weight loss over 56 weeks. Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term efficacy and safety.

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^112EoLg3]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, semaglutide showed a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in 17,604 adults with preexisting cardiovascular disease, overweight or obesity, without diabetes. Here in this prespecified analysis, we examined effects of semaglutide on weight and anthropometric outcomes, safety and tolerability by baseline body mass index (BMI). In patients treated with semaglutide, weight loss continued over 65 weeks and was sustained for up to 4 years. At 208 weeks, semaglutide was associated with mean reduction in weight (−10.2%), waist circumference (−7.7 cm) and waist-to-height ratio (−6.9%) versus placebo (−1.5%, −1.3 cm and −1.0%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all comparisons versus placebo). Clinically meaningful weight loss occurred in both sexes and all races, body sizes and regions. Semaglutide was associated with fewer serious adverse events. For each BMI category (< 30, 30 to < 35, 35 to < 40 and ≥ 40 kg/m²) there were lower rates (events per 100 years of observation) of serious adverse events with semaglutide (43.23, 43.54, 51.07 and 47.06 for semaglutide and 50.48, 49.66, 52.73 and 60.85 for placebo). Semaglutide was associated with increased rates of trial product discontinuation. Discontinuations increased as BMI class decreased. In SELECT, at 208 weeks, semaglutide produced clinically significant weight loss and improvements in anthropometric measurements versus placebo. Weight loss was sustained over 4 years.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114UrjaB]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain WL or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain WL following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity, with an effort to gain a greater understanding of WL, WL maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

### Metabolic interventions as adjunctive therapies to insulin in type 1 diabetes: current clinical landscape and perspectives [^115o7627]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Early studies examining Semaglutide in T1D, particularly in overweight and obese patients, show promising results. For instance, a retrospective chart review by Garg et al. followed 50 overweight or obese patients with T1D who were treated with once‐weekly Semaglutide for 1 year, comparing them to a control group of T1D patients. The Semaglutide group experienced significantly greater reductions in BMI (−7.9% ± 2.6%, p < 0.0001) and weight (−15.9 lbs ± 5.4 lbs, p < 0.0001). Additionally, Semaglutide treatment was associated with notable improvements in glycaemic parameters, further supporting its potential as an effective adjunctive therapy in T1D. Larger, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these early findings and fully assess the benefits of Semaglutide in T1D. An ongoing randomized controlled trial (NCT05537233) is currently investigating the effects of Semaglutide in inadequately controlled, obese adults with T1D. These studies will be instrumental in determining whether the clinical benefits of GLP1RAs outweigh their side effects, such as nausea and hypoglycaemic events, and whether the weight loss induced by GLP1RAs can be maintained over extended periods. In addition to assessing the effects of established GLP1RAs like Liraglutide, newer analogues such as Semaglutide warrant further investigation to evaluate their efficacy in the T1D population (NCT0530579). Another critical area for future research is the impact of GLP1RAs on microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, given the high cardiovascular and renal disease burden in T1D (NCT05478707, ACTRN12623001277639). Understanding how GLP1RA therapy influences these long‐term complications will be pivotal in determining their broader role in T1D management.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^115M2H2e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The GI AE profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials is consistent with previous observations with lower semaglutide doses and the established AE profile of GLP‐1RAs. Direct comparison of GI AE incidence with semaglutide 1.0 and 2.4 mg in adults with T2D and overweight or obesity in STEP 2 found only a slightly higher incidence of GI AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg (63.5% of participants) versus 1.0 mg (57.5%), despite the more than doubling of dose, and few patients discontinued treatment because of GI AEs in either group (4.2% of participants vs. 3.5%, respectively). These findings are consistent with the established dose dependence of GI AEs with the GLP‐1RA class and semaglutide specifically. As higher incidences of GI AEs tend to be experienced with higher doses of GLP‐1RAs, gradual dose escalation and dose adjustment may help mitigate the impact of GI AEs in clinical practice.

Almost all approved obesity pharmacotherapies are commonly associated with GI AEs, including orlistat (e.g. faecal urgency), phentermine‐topiramate (e.g. constipation) and naltrexone‐bupropion (e.g. nausea and constipation). Use of liraglutide 3.0 mg, another GLP‐1RA, approved for treatment of overweight or obesity, can also result in mild‐or‐moderate GI AEs of a nature similar to those reported in the STEP trials, primarily during initial dose escalation.,

The mechanism of action through which GI AEs arise with GLP‐1RAs remains uncertain. Delayed gastric emptying may be a potential contributor, particularly with short‐acting GLP‐1RAs; longer‐acting agents do not appear to be associated with notable delays in gastric emptying. A 12‐week study of semaglutide 1.0 mg in adults with obesity using the paracetamol absorption test identified a delay in first‐hour gastric emptying after a meal versus placebo; however, a 20‐week study of semaglutide 2.4 mg did not identify such a delay in paracetamol‐assessed gastric emptying. Changes in the rate of lower GI transit may be responsible for constipation and/or diarrhoea, although evidence is lacking. The mechanism for GLP‐1RA‐induced nausea may primarily relate to central effects; studies in animal models suggest that nausea responses associated with peripheral GLP‐1RA administration involve activation of GLP‐1 receptors in the central nervous system.

Change in Weight From Baseline

There were significant (P < 0.0001) weight reductions from baseline to 6 months in the full weight cohort (− 2.1 kg; 95% CI − 2.6, − 1.6) and in the subgroups of patients with BMI > 30 kg/m 2 (− 2.3 kg; 95% CI − 2.9, − 1.7) and > 35 kg/m 2 (− 2.4 kg; 95% CI − 3.1, − 1.7; Fig. 3 b). Weight loss was more pronounced at 12 months than at 6 months, with reductions of − 2.8 kg (95% CI − 3.9, − 1.8) in the full cohort, − 3.3 kg (95% CI −4.6, − 2.1) in those with baseline BMI > 30 kg/m 2 and − 4.3 kg (95% CI − 5.9, − 2.8) in those with baseline BMI > 35 kg/m 2.

The sensitivity analysis with at least two baseline GLP-1 RA prescriptions supported these results (Fig. 4 b). There was significant (P < 0.0001) weight reduction at 6 months in the full cohort and both subgroups (− 2.2 kg [95% CI − 2.7, − 1.6], − 2.3 kg [− 2.9, − 1.7] and − 2.2 kg [− 2.9, − 1.4], respectively), and larger reductions at 12 months (− 3.1 kg [95% CI − 4.1, − 2.0], − 3.7 kg [− 5.0, − 2.4] and − 4.3 kg [− 6.0, − 2.5], respectively).

### Obesity pharmacotherapy in older adults: a narrative review of evidence [^112NCYds]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of obesity in older adults (people aged > 60 years) is increasing in line with the demographic shift in global populations. Despite knowledge of obesity-related complications in younger adults (increased risk of type 2 diabetes, liver and cardiovascular disease and malignancy), these considerations may be outweighed, in older adults, by concerns regarding weight-loss induced reduction in skeletal muscle and bone mass, and the awareness of the 'obesity paradox'. Obesity in the elderly contributes to various obesity-related complications from cardiometabolic disease and cancer, to functional decline, worsening cognition, and quality of life, that will have already suffered an age-related decline. Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone of obesity management in older adults, with emphasis on resistance training for muscle strength and bone mineral density preservation. However, in older adults with obesity refractory to lifestyle strategies, pharmacotherapy, using anti-obesity medicines (AOMs), can be a useful adjunct. Recent evidence suggests that intentional weight loss in older adults with overweight and obesity is effective and safe, hence a diminishing reluctance to use AOMs in this more vulnerable population. Despite nine AOMs being currently approved for the treatment of obesity, limited clinical trial evidence in older adults predominantly focuses on incretin therapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide). AOMs enhance weight loss and reduce cardiometabolic events, while maintaining muscle mass. Future randomised controlled trials should specifically evaluate the effectiveness of novel AOMs for long-term weight management in older adults with obesity, carefully considering the impact on body composition and functional ability, as well as health economics.

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly on 10-year type 2 diabetes risk in adults with overweight or obesity [^116FCXsH]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) trials, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg plus lifestyle intervention reduced body weight and improved cardiometabolic parameters in adults with obesity (or overweight with weight-related comorbidities). Effects on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) require investigation.

Methods

STEP 1 (68 weeks) and 5 (104 weeks) randomized participants to semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. STEP 4 included a 20-week semaglutide run-in followed by randomization to 48weeks of continued semaglutide or withdrawal (placebo). Ten-year T2D risk scores were calculated post hoc using Cardiometabolic Disease Staging.

Results

In STEP 1 (N = 1583), relative risk score reductions were greater with semaglutide versus placebo (semaglutide: -61.1%; placebo: -12.9%; p < 0.0001). These reductions were maintained to week 104 in STEP 5 (N = 295; semaglutide: -60.0%; placebo: 3.5%; p < 0.0001). Risk scores during the STEP 4 run-in period (N = 776) were reduced from 20.6% to 11.1% and further to 7.7% at week 68 with continued semaglutide, increasing to 15.4% with withdrawal (relative risk score change: semaglutide: -32.1%; placebo: +40.6%; p < 0.0001). Risk score reductions mirrored weight loss.

Conclusions

Cardiometabolic Disease Staging risk assessment suggests that once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg may substantially lower 10-year T2D risk in people with overweight or obesity.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115CF5qv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, many real‐world studies suggested smaller weight loss (in kg or %) than what has been observed in the RCTs (i.e. up to 6% with liraglutide, 14% with semaglutide and 18% with tirzepatide vs. placebo). Estimated weight loss was highly variable between studies; however, even within the same GLP‐1RA, this was related to differences in user characteristics such as the proportion with T2D and previous use or not of GLP‐1RA at baseline, differences in dosages of the drug, comprehensiveness of the weight management programme, follow‐up time and weight measure used (e.g. self‐reported or other measurements of body weight). The percentage weight reduction over typically 6–12 months of follow‐up thus ranged from 2.2% to 18.5% for liraglutide,4.4% to 19.5% for semaglutide, and 4.8% to 21.2% for tirzepatide. Importantly, the weight‐loss effectiveness of GLP‐1RA was similar to what has been observed in trials when focusing on the subgroup of adherent patients who consistently took their prescribed GLP‐1RA, for example, at 12 months follow‐up, whereas studies reporting results in an 'as‐started' approach found considerably lower effectiveness. Semaglutide and tirzepatide initiators appeared to achieve the greatest weight loss in real life, and weight loss effects were weaker for patients with T2D than for obese people without diabetes, which was also observed in trials. Only two studies of tirzepatide for T2D were identified, and they reported lower weight loss results than in the trials. Both studies included many individuals switching to tirzepatide from other GLP‐1RAs, that is, individuals generally not included in the SURPASS and SURMOUNT‐1 trials, with those switching from semaglutide seemingly experiencing further weight loss on tirzepatide treatment.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^1134d9Jy]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management (WM) as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

Methods

Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, WM; NCT03552757, WM in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, WM with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained WM; and NCT03693430, long‐term WM), ~5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary end point is change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight.

Results

Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%‐81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m 2 and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

Conclusions

The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on WM in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long‐term follow‐up.

### Effect of weekly semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes… [^111fB5CR]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 338 participants, mean body weight change from baseline to 68 weeks was –15. 8% with semaglutide vs –6. 4% with liraglutide, a statistically significant difference. Meaning Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks. Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04074161.

demonstrated sustained, clinically meaningful reductions in body weight in people with overweight or obesity, with and without type 2 diabetes, in the ongoing global phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity program. 2–5 Semaglutide was the second GLP-1RA approved for weight management after once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3. 0 mg, which is available for chronic weight management in people with obesity.
6. In a phase 2 trial, once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide, 0. 4 mg, significantly increased weight loss vs liraglutide,
3. 0 mg. 9 The STEP 8 trial directly compared once-weekly semaglutide, 2. 4 mg, vs once-daily liraglutide,
3. 0 mg, for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity to rigorously assess differences in efficacy and adverse event profiles.

At week 75, observed mean changes from baseline were 2 /min with semaglutide, 3 /min with liraglutide, and 2 /min with placebo. Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks, accompanied by significantly greater improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors.
