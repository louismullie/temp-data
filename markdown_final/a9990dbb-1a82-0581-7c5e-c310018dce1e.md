## Question

Danuglipron 120 mg in T2DM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about danuglipron 120 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes, specifically its efficacy, safety, tolerability, and how it compares with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pivotal phase 2b trial design and analytic approach. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary efficacy outcomes at 16 weeks. Next, I will examine the safety and tolerability profile, including discontinuation and gastrointestinal adverse events. After that, I need to consider dose-escalation strategy and its impact on tolerability. Finally, I will contextualize these findings against other GLP-1 RAs and outline practical clinical implications and limitations, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the original tables and figures before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the study framework and population. The pivotal evidence is a phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging trial in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise, with or without metformin, treated for 16 weeks with danuglipron or placebo, with a 4-week follow-up; the primary endpoint was change in HbA1c at week 16, analyzed with mixed-model repeated measures and censoring after rescue or discontinuation, which aligns with a modified intention-to-treat approach [^f8dfafb9] [^7513cdae] [^131d3d73].

> I should confirm the dosing and escalation details. Danuglipron was administered orally twice daily with food, and for doses of 40 mg or more twice daily, a prespecified weekly dose escalation was used to mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects; importantly, dose de-escalation was not permitted in this phase 2 study, which limits our ability to manage intolerability during treatment [^7513cdae] [^b806865d].

> Now, let me verify the primary efficacy outcome. At week 16, danuglipron 120 mg twice daily reduced HbA1c by a least-squares mean of 1.18% from baseline versus 0.02% with placebo, yielding a placebo-adjusted reduction of 1.16% with a 90% CI of −1.47% to −0.86%; this magnitude is clinically meaningful and comparable to what is seen with peptidic GLP-1 RAs over similar durations, and the effect appeared early, with separation from placebo by week 2 and sustained through week 16 [^65cedd4d] [^6c821a2d].

> Next, I should review fasting glucose and body weight. Fasting plasma glucose fell by a placebo-adjusted 33.24 mg/dL at week 16 with 120 mg twice daily, reinforcing clinically relevant glycemic benefit; body weight decreased by a placebo-adjusted 4.17 kg at week 16, with 47% of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss, consistent with GLP-1–mediated effects on appetite and caloric intake [^28d5ac1c] [^65cedd4d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking discontinuation and adverse events. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal — nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting — with dose-responsive increases in discontinuation due to adverse events; in the 120 mg twice daily group, discontinuation due to adverse events was 34% versus 8% with placebo, and vomiting was more frequent than at 80 mg, even though most events were mild to moderate in intensity; importantly, there were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia, consistent with glucose-dependent insulin secretion [^2864f0c9] [^f8dfafb9].

> Wait, let me verify the impact of dose-escalation strategy on tolerability. The authors explicitly note that rapid weekly escalation likely worsened tolerability and may have limited the ability to fully assess the 120 mg dose, as the target was reached less than 12 weeks before the end-of-treatment assessment; slower escalation schemes tested in other studies, including monthly steps, have been associated with improved tolerability and lower discontinuation rates, suggesting that a gentler titration could mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects in future development [^b806865d] [^f7e53d93] [^5a75782b].

> I need to ensure I contextualize these results against the broader GLP-1 RA class. The placebo-adjusted HbA1c reduction of about 1.16% at 16 weeks sits within the typical 0.8–1.5% range seen with peptidic GLP-1 RAs in phase 2–3 trials, and the weight loss of roughly 4 kg is directionally similar to what is observed with short-duration exposure to agents like semaglutide and liraglutide; however, head-to-head trials are lacking, and the oral route without fasting restrictions is a potential advantage if tolerability can be optimized [^6c821a2d] [^2864f0c9] [^e52e5247].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular and long-term safety signals. The 16-week trial was not powered for cardiovascular outcomes, and while short-term studies show no concerning ECG or laboratory safety signals beyond the expected GI effects, larger and longer-term exposure is required to characterize rare events and liver safety; notably, subsequent development was discontinued after a single asymptomatic potential drug-induced liver injury signal in a separate study, underscoring the need for robust safety databases before routine clinical use [^f8dfafb9] [^bcb218f8].

> Let me consider practical clinical implications and limitations. If danuglipron were to advance, a slower, flexible titration with the option to reduce dose upon intolerance would be prudent, and patients should be counseled on expected GI side effects and strategies to improve adherence; given the high discontinuation rates observed with rapid escalation, shared decision-making and close follow-up during titration would be essential to realize glycemic and weight benefits without losing patients to adverse effects [^b806865d] [^f7e53d93].

> In summary, I should double-check that my key claims are reference-aligned: danuglipron 120 mg twice daily for 16 weeks produced a placebo-adjusted HbA1c reduction of 1.16% with about 4.2 kg weight loss and robust FPG lowering, but faced 34% discontinuation due to adverse events driven by gastrointestinal intolerance under rapid weekly escalation; slower titration strategies are likely to improve tolerability, and while efficacy looks comparable to injectable GLP-1 RAs, definitive comparative and long-term safety data are pending, which tempers immediate clinical adoption [^65cedd4d] [^28d5ac1c] [^2864f0c9] [^b806865d].

Danuglipron 120 mg twice daily **reduces HbA1c by about 1.16%** [^65cedd4d] and **weight by about 4.17 kg** [^28d5ac1c] over 16 weeks in adults with type 2 diabetes, with effects evident by week 2 and sustained through week 16 [^6c821a2d]. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) [^2864f0c9] and are dose-related; discontinuation due to adverse events is higher at 120 mg BID (34%) than at lower doses [^2864f0c9]. There is no clear dose-response above 10 mg for HbA1c, but weight loss is greater at 80–120 mg. No severe hypoglycemia or clinically meaningful liver or cardiovascular signals were observed in the 16-week trial [^f8dfafb9], but longer-term safety remains uncertain [^a8b12aa6].

## Comparison with other GLP-1 receptor agonists

| **Parameter** | **Danuglipron 120 mg bid** | **Injectable glp-1 ras (e.g. semaglutide, liraglutide)** | **Oral semaglutide** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HbA1c reduction | 1.16% (16 weeks) [^65cedd4d] | 1.0–1.8% (26–52 weeks) | 1.0–1.4% (26–52 weeks) |
| Weight loss | 4.17 kg (16 weeks) [^28d5ac1c] | 2.5–6.0 kg (26–52 weeks) | 2.0–4.0 kg (26–52 weeks) |
| Administration | Oral, BID, with food [^f8dfafb9] | Subcutaneous, weekly or daily | Oral, once daily, fasting |
| Gastrointestinal adverse events | 34% discontinuation at 120 mg BID [^2864f0c9] | 10–20% discontinuation | 10–15% discontinuation |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Duration**: 16 weeks is insufficient to assess durability or long-term safety [^b806865d].
- **Dose escalation**: Rapid weekly escalation may worsen tolerability; slower schemes may improve retention [^b806865d] [^f7e53d93].
- **Liver safety**: A separate study reported a potential DILI signal, prompting development discontinuation; overall hepatic risk remains uncertain [^bcb218f8].
- **Regulatory status**: Development has been discontinued; no approval or availability [^bcb218f8].

---

## Clinical implications

Danuglipron 120 mg BID demonstrates **meaningful HbA1c and weight effects** over 16 weeks [^f8dfafb9], but gastrointestinal intolerance and high discontinuation rates limit usability [^2864f0c9]. If oral GLP-1 therapy advances, slower titration and formulation changes may improve tolerability; until then, injectable GLP-1 RAs or oral semaglutide remain preferred options [^e52e5247].

Importance

Currently available glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) are peptide agonists that require subcutaneous administration or strict fasting requirements before and after oral administration.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple dose levels of the novel, oral, small molecule GLP-1R agonist danuglipron over 16 weeks.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 6-group randomized clinical trial with 16-week double-blind treatment period and 4-week follow-up was conducted from July 7, 2020, to July 7, 2021. Adults with T2D inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, with or without metformin treatment, were enrolled from 97 clinical research sites in 8 countries or regions.

Interventions

Participants received placebo or danuglipron, 2.5, 10, 40, 80, or 120 mg, all orally administered twice daily with food for 16 weeks. Weekly dose escalation steps were incorporated to achieve danuglipron doses of 40 mg or more twice daily.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, primary end point), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight were assessed at week 16. Safety was monitored throughout the study period, including a 4-week follow-up period.

Results

Of 411 participants randomized and treated (mean [SD] age, 58.6 [9.3] years; 209 [51%] male), 316 (77%) completed treatment. For all danuglipron doses, HbA1c and FPG were statistically significantly reduced at week 16 vs placebo, with HbA1c reductions up to a least squares mean difference vs placebo of -1.16% (90% CI, -1.47% to -0.86%) for the 120-mg twice daily group and FPG reductions up to a least squares mean difference vs placebo of -33.24 mg/dL (90% CI, -45.63 to -20.84 mg/dL). Body weight was statistically significantly reduced at week 16 compared with placebo in the 80-mg twice daily and 120-mg twice daily groups only, with a least squares mean difference vs placebo of -2.04 kg (90% CI, -3.01 to -1.07 kg) for the 80-mg twice daily group and -4.17 kg (90% CI, -5.15 to -3.18 kg) for the 120-mg twice daily group. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults with T2D, danuglipron reduced HbA1c, FPG, and body weight at week 16 compared with placebo, with a tolerability profile consistent with the mechanism of action.

Efficacy

All danuglipron groups demonstrated statistically significant dose-responsive declines from baseline in HbA 1c at week 16 compared with placebo, with LS mean changes of −0.49% to −1.18% across danuglipron groups and −0.02% for the placebo group (Table 2). At week 16, the LS mean difference compared with placebo in change in HbA 1c was −1.16% (90% CI, −1.47% to −0.86%) for the 120-mg twice daily group (Table 2). With 1 exception, HbA 1c was statistically significantly reduced with all danuglipron doses compared with placebo at earlier time points (Figure 2 A). At week 16, the observed proportions of participants with HbA 1c less than 7% were 31% (16 of 52) for 2.5 mg twice daily, 54% (33 of 61) for 10 mg twice daily, 58% (32 of 55) for 40 mg twice daily, 65% (30 of 46) for 80 mg twice daily, and 61% (23 of 38) for 120 mg twice daily compared with 8% (4 of 52) for placebo.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study presents the first phase 2 clinical data with an oral small-molecule GLP-1R agonist and found that in adults with T2D, with or without metformin use, danuglipron administration during 16 weeks reduced HbA 1c and FPG at all dose levels studied and reduced body weight at doses of 80 mg or more twice daily compared with placebo. Danuglipron was generally safe in this population, with most participants receiving metformin background therapy, with a tolerability profile consistent with the mechanism of action.

Multiple dose levels of danuglipron resulted in HbA 1c reductions at 16 weeks of approximately 1%. Reductions in HbA 1c and FPG, compared with placebo, were evident for all danuglipron groups as early as week 2 and continued through week 16, with some exceptions for the lowest-dose group. Reductions in HbA 1c at week 16 were relatively similar across danuglipron doses of 10 to 120 mg twice daily, and the placebo-adjusted reductions in glycemic parameters are commensurate with phase 2 data with peptidic GLP-1R agonists over similar durations of time. A greater proportion of participants receiving danuglipron compared with placebo achieved the glycemic target of HbA 1c less than 7%, and the proportion achieving this target generally increased with higher danuglipron doses.

Methods

Study Design

This phase 2b, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group (6 groups), dose-ranging, 16-week randomized clinical trial was conducted from July 7, 2020, to July 7, 2021, across 97 clinical research sites in 8 countries or regions (Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Republic of Korea, Poland, Slovakia, Taiwan, and the US). Investigators recruited participants. The study was conducted entirely during the COVID-19 global pandemic. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards or independent ethics committees at each investigational center, and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinkiand in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all local regulatory requirements were followed. This report followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. The protocol and statistical analysis plan can be found in Supplement 1.

After a screening period, there was a 2-week, single-blind, placebo, run-in period to familiarize participants with the study regimens and monitor compliance, after which participants were randomized (day 1) to 1 of 6 double-blind, parallel groups (placebo or danuglipron target dose of 2.5, 10, 40, 80, or 120 mg twice daily). For danuglipron regimens of 40 mg twice daily and above, up to 6 weeks of the 16-week, double-blind treatment period was used for dose escalation, using a prespecified fixed schedule with starting doses and increments preserved across the study groups (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Dose deescalation was not permitted. At the end of the treatment period, there was a follow-up period of approximately 4 weeks. Clinic visits occurred at screening, placebo run-in, baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16, and follow-up.

### Efficacy and safety of oral small molecule glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist danuglipron for glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^8faf76e2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The study Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) was published by Aditi R Saxena and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of danuglipron in patients with T2DM? In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the population was: 137 patients (70 female, 67 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, with or without metformin treatment. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM; secondary form of diabetes; recent history of cardiovascular events; gastrointestinal conditions possibly affecting drug absorption; medullary thyroid carcinoma. In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 71 danuglipron (at an oral dose of 120 mg BID with food for 16 weeks) n = 66 placebo (matching placebo BID). In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in glycated hemoglobin at week 16 (1.18% vs. 0.02%; MD 1.16, 90% CI 0.86 to 1.47). In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in fasting plasma glucose at week 16 (31.93 mg/dL vs. -1.31 mg/dL; MD 33.24, 90% CI 20.84 to 45.63) Significant increase in reduction in body weight at week 16 (4.6 kg vs. 0.43 kg; MD 4.17, 90% CI 3.18 to 5.15). In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 120 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, with or without metformin treatment, danuglipron was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in glycated hemoglobin at week 16.

### Tolerability, safety and pharmacodynamics of oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist danuglipron for type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study comparing different dose-escalation schemes [^92dcc7e2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the tolerability, safety and pharmacodynamics of different dose-escalation schemes of the oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist danuglipron.

Materials and Methods

This Phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study randomly assigned adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with metformin to placebo or danuglipron (low [5-mg] or high [10-mg] starting dose, with 1- or 2-week dose-escalation steps, to target doses of 80, 120 or 200mg twice daily [BID]) and adults with obesity without diabetes to placebo or danuglipron 200mg BID.

Results

Participants with T2D (n = 123, mean glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 8.19%) or obesity without diabetes (n = 28, mean body mass index 37.3kg/m 2) were randomly assigned and treated. Discontinuation from study medication occurred in 27.3% to 72.7% of participants across danuglipron groups versus 16.7% to 18.8% for placebo, most often due to adverse events. Nausea (20.0%-47.6% of participants across danuglipron groups vs. 12.5% for placebo) and vomiting (18.2%-40.9% danuglipron vs. 12.5% placebo, respectively) were most commonly reported in participants with T2D. Gastrointestinal adverse events were generally related to danuglipron target dose and were not substantially affected by starting dose. In participants with T2D, least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1c (-1.04% to -1.57% across danuglipron groups vs. -0.32% for placebo), fasting plasma glucose (-23.34mg/dL to -53.94mg/dL danuglipron vs. -13.09mg/dL placebo) and body weight (-1.93 to -5.38kg danuglipron vs. -0.42kg placebo) at Week 12 were generally statistically significant for danuglipron compared with placebo (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Danuglipron resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight over 12weeks, in the setting of higher discontinuation rates and incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events with higher target doses.

### Efficacy and safety of oral small molecule glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist danuglipron for glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^b806865d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

At the time of study design, weekly dose escalation steps were considered an acceptable and efficient approach to assess glycemic efficacy during 16 weeks, taking into account the half-life of danuglipron. Danuglipron doses were expected to reach pharmacokinetic steady state within the weekly timeframe, and weekly steps were of a longer duration than had been used previously. However, clinical data with peptidic GLP-1R agonists have demonstrated that longer dose escalation steps are more likely to result in better tolerability, particularly at higher doses, and monthly steps are used for many of the peptidic GLP-1R agonists in clinical use.

Limitations

Limitations of the study include the study duration and rapid dose escalation, which likely impacted optimal assessment of tolerability, leading to greater discontinuation rates, and may have limited efficacy assessments of 120 mg twice daily of danuglipron because the target dose for this group was reached less than 12 weeks before the end of treatment assessment. Dose reduction was not permitted in this phase 2 study. Additional complexity was encountered because the study was conducted during the earliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic; the indirect impact of the pandemic is difficult to quantify.

At week 16, FPG was statistically significantly reduced with all danuglipron doses compared with placebo, with LS mean differences of −14.12 mg/dL (90% CI, −25.77 to −2.47 mg/dL) in the 2.5-mg twice daily group to −33.24 mg/dL (90% CI, −45.63 to −20.84 mg/dL) in the 120-mg twice daily group (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) (Table 2). With some exceptions, FPG was statistically significantly reduced with all danuglipron doses compared with placebo at earlier time points (Figure 2 B).

Body weight was statistically significantly reduced at week 16 compared with placebo in the 80-mg twice daily group (LS mean difference, −2.04 kg; 90% CI, −3.01 kg to −1.07 kg]) and 120-mg twice daily group (−4.17 kg; 90% CI, −5.15 kg to −3.18 kg), but the differences were not statistically significant at lower danuglipron dose levels (Table 2). This pattern was generally evident at earlier time points (Figure 2 C). The observed proportions of participants with body weight loss of 5% or more at week 16, relative to baseline, were 6% (3 of 53) for 2.5 mg twice daily, 10% (6 of 62) for 10 mg twice daily, 18% (10 of 57) for 40 mg twice daily, 22% (10 of 46) for 80 mg twice daily, and 47% (18 of 38) for 120 mg twice daily compared with 2% (1 of 52) for placebo. There were no consistent trends in change from baseline for fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and fasting glucagon across all treatment groups or differences to placebo relative to the danuglipron groups (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Participant disposition and baseline characteristics

In total, 65 participants were screened for study entry; 37 participants were randomized to receive danuglipron or placebo twice daily (Figure S2: Appendix S1). Ten participants were randomized to receive danuglipron 40 mg, nine participants to danuglipron 80 mg, nine participants to danuglipron 120 mg and nine participants to placebo. All 37 participants completed the study. Eight participants discontinued from the study drug: six participants in danuglipron dose groups discontinued treatment due to AEs (discussed below); one in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of "lack of efficacy"; and one participant in the danuglipron 40‐mg group was randomized inappropriately (participant did not meet eligibility criteria) and was discontinued from treatment.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 and were generally similar across treatment groups, with some variability noted across treatment groups in duration of T2DM, body weight and BMI.

3.2 Safety and tolerability

Seventy all‐causality TEAEs were reported by 28 participants (75.7%); of these, 54 AEs (54 of 70; 77.1%) reported by 24 participants (64.9%) were considered treatment‐related (Table S1: Appendix S1). The number of TEAEs (all‐causality and treatment‐related) was higher in the danuglipron groups compared with the placebo group but did not appear to increase with increasing dose. There were no deaths or SAEs during the study. Six participants (16.2%) permanently discontinued from the study drug due to TEAEs. All treatment discontinuations occurred in danuglipron groups and were due to treatment‐related AEs of nausea (two participants in the 40‐mg group), vomiting (two participants in the 80‐mg group) and abdominal discomfort (one participant each in the 80‐ and 120‐mg groups). Two participants had temporary discontinuations from the study drug because of TEAEs: one participant (80‐mg group) experienced treatment‐related nausea; the other participant (40‐mg group) experienced two AEs of increased alanine or aspartate aminotransferase levels that were not considered treatment‐related. These AEs resolved and permitted continuation with study medication.

Danuglipron

Danuglipron is another oral, non-peptide, G-protein biased GLP-1 RA. Recently, a phase 2b study for people with obesity has been completed and a press release revealed that danuglipron doses between 40 and 200 mg twice daily led up to 11.7% WL compared to 1.4% weight gain with placebo after 32 weeks of treatment. However, the medication discontinuation rates were greater than 50% across all doses compared to ≈40% with placebo, with the most common adverse events (AE) being gastrointestinal in nature.

In people with T2D and overweight/obesity, 16 weeks of danuglipron led to a placebo-adjusted WL up to −4.2 kg with the highest dose of 120 mg twice daily. A mean placebo-adjusted reduction of HbA1c up to −1.2% with the highest dose was also observed.

Currently, multiple phase 3 trials with oral semaglutide and orforglipron are ongoing for different populations (NCT05803421), while another oral GLP-1 RA (CT-996) is in early phase clinical trials (Table 1).

### A phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of danuglipron (PF-06882961), an oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^2f7f873c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, increases in heart rate were observed in danuglipron dose groups after 8 weeks of dosing, which was observed in the previous study in Western participantsand in other studies with peptidic GLP‐1R agonists. The magnitude of heart‐rate increases observed in this study is in line with short‐term clinical data published with peptidic GLP‐1R agonists. A trend toward mild increases in blood pressure was noted on Day 56 with the 80‐ and 120‐mg doses of danuglipron relative to the 40‐mg dose and placebo, with mean blood pressure in the normal range. This pattern was not observed in the previous study in Western participants, where there was a trend for reductions in SBP with higher doses of danuglipron. However, mild increases in blood pressure have been observed in short‐term studies with peptidic GLP‐1R agonists, which have subsequently showed benefits in cardiovascular outcomes.

Substantial reductions from baseline in glycaemic biomarkers and body weight with danuglipron versus placebo have been observed in Western participants with T2DM following 28 days of twice daily or once daily dosing. This current study shows that danuglipron has similar robust effects on glycaemic parameters in Japanese participants over 56 days. This study was also the first to show sustained glycaemic efficacy with danuglipron following periods of home self‐administration in between study site visits. Relative to placebo, significant declines in MDG of up to −67.9 mg/dl from baseline were observed in all danuglipron groups on Day 56, consistent with the placebo‐adjusted reductions in MDG of up to −65.5 mg/dl with the danuglipron 120‐mg twice daily dose observed on Day 28 in Western participants with T2DM. Substantial reductions in FPG, observed from Day 15, were maintained through to study end (up to −40.9 mg/dl with danuglipron 120 mg twice daily on Day 57) and were in line with the reductions in FPG seen in Western participants (up to −44.3 mg/dl with the danuglipron 120‐mg twice daily dose on Day 28). Consistent with the mechanism of action, there were no occurrences of FPG levels ≤ 70 mg/dl during the study, and only one hypoglycaemic AE of mild severity (danuglipron 40‐mg group) was reported as probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia.

### A phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of danuglipron (PF-06882961), an oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^3963bd9b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The observed reductions in glucose levels with danuglipron treatment were reflected in changes from baseline in HbA1c, where statistically significant reductions versus placebo were observed from Day 15 through to Day 57 across all danuglipron groups. Placebo‐adjusted reductions in HbA1c of up to −1.4% (danuglipron 120‐mg group) were observed on Day 57. Administration of stable danuglipron doses over a longer treatment period may achieve even greater reductions in HbA1c, providing patients with a clinically meaningful glycaemic benefit over the longer term.

Compared with the large declines in body weight observed following danuglipron treatment in Western participants with T2DM, where placebo‐adjusted reductions of up to −5.5 kg were observed with the danuglipron 120‐mg dose on Day 28, the reductions in body weight in Japanese participants with T2DM observed in this study were lower by comparison (up to −1.9 kg). Differences in the magnitude of weight reductions between Western and Japanese study populations may be due to differences in baseline body weight and BMI between the two groups (92.4 kg and 32.9 kg/m², respectively, in Western participants; 78.6 kg and 27.8 kg/m², respectively, in Japanese participants). Higher baseline BMI has been associated with greater degrees of weight loss in trials with peptidic GLP‐1R agonists.

### Efficacy and safety of oral small molecule glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist danuglipron for glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^2864f0c9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Reductions in body weight were observed at all time points from week 2 through week 16 with danuglipron doses of 80 mg or more twice daily compared with placebo. Lower doses of danuglipron (≤ 40 mg twice daily) were body weight neutral and were not clearly different from placebo during the 16-week study duration. The weight loss seen with the higher doses of danuglipron in this study is supported by the phase 1 pharmacodynamic data for danuglipron, and the weight loss with danuglipron in the current study is of a similar magnitude to that observed in the phase 2 data for oral semaglutide and the injectable GLP-1R agonists during similar durations of dosing.

As has been noted with the GLP-1R agonist class, the most common TEAEs were gastrointestinal in nature and consisted of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Most TEAEs with danuglipron were mild, although TEAEs were also the most common reason for discontinuation, discontinuations due to TEAEs were dose responsive, and dose reduction was not permitted in the study. For danuglipron doses less than 40 mg twice daily, the proportion of participants with TEAEs was similar to placebo, whereas higher doses (≥ 80 mg twice daily) were associated with higher rates of TEAEs and higher rates of discontinuation related to TEAEs. In the 120-mg twice daily group, 1 participant had TEAEs of severe intensity, which was similar to or lower than other groups, including placebo; and the number of moderate TEAEs was lower than in the 80-mg twice daily group. Although rates of nausea and diarrhea were similar to the 80-mg twice daily group, the rate of vomiting was higher in the 120-mg twice daily group. However, in comparison with semaglutide phase 2 data, (the phase 2 semaglutide studies used more rapid dose escalation schemes compared with the schemes used in the phase 3 semaglutide studies), the range of proportion of participants experiencing gastrointestinal TEAEs with danuglipron was relatively similar. Consistent with the mechanism of action, the rates of hypoglycemia were low in the current study, and there were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia.

3.3.2 Fasting plasma glucose

Statistically significant reductions from baseline in FPG were observed on Day 57 in all danuglipron groups compared with placebo (Table 3; Figure 1B). Modelled LS‐mean (90% CI) placebo‐adjusted changes from baseline to Day 57 in FPG found dose‐proportional reductions of −27.25 (−39.95, −14.55), −36.78 (−49.72, −23.85) and −40.87 (−53.77, −27.98) mg/dl for the danuglipron 40‐, 80‐ and 120‐mg groups, respectively. Reductions in FPG levels were observed across all danuglipron groups relative to placebo from Day 15 through to Day 57. There were no occurrences of FPG ≤ 70 mg/dl in any of the randomized participants during the study.

3.3.3 Glycated haemoglobin

Statistically significant reductions from baseline on Day 57 were also observed for HbA1c across all danuglipron groups compared with placebo (Table 3; Figure 1C). The modelled LS‐mean (90% CI) placebo‐adjusted reductions from baseline to Day 57 in HbA1c were −1.20% (−1.80%, −0.61%), −0.86% (−1.46%, −0.26%) and −1.41% (−2.01%, −0.82%) across the danuglipron 40‐, 80‐ and 120‐mg groups, respectively. Reductions in HbA1c were observed in all danuglipron dose groups relative to placebo over the course of the study, with reductions generally increasing in magnitude over time up to Day 57.

The study Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) was published by Aditi R Saxena and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of danuglipron in patients with T2DM? In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the population was: 137 patients (70 female, 67 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, with or without metformin treatment. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM; secondary form of diabetes; recent history of cardiovascular events; gastrointestinal conditions possibly affecting drug absorption; medullary thyroid carcinoma. In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 71 danuglipron (at an oral dose of 40 mg BID with food for 16 weeks) n = 66 placebo (matching placebo BID). In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in glycated hemoglobin at week 16 (1.03% vs. 0.02%; MD 1.01, 90% CI 0.73 to 1.3). In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in fasting plasma glucose at week 16 (30.47 mg/dL vs. -1.31 mg/dL; MD 31.78, 90% CI 20.35 to 43.2) Significant increase in reduction in body weight at week 16 (1.16 kg vs. 0.43 kg; MD 0.73, 90% CI 0.2 to 1.66). In the Oral GLP-1 (danuglipron 40 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by diet and exercise, with or without metformin treatment, danuglipron was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in glycated hemoglobin at week 16.

On the basis of the observed data, participants who reached an HbA 1c goal of less than 7% at week 16 were categorized as having a response; otherwise, participants were categorized as not having a response. Participants who discontinued study medication and/or received glycemic rescue medication before week 16 had their week 16 value censored (if it was not missing). The proportion of participants who achieved a response defined as body weight loss of 5% or more at week 16 were similarly analyzed. All participants who took 1 dose or more of study medication were included in the safety analyses. Safety data were summarized descriptively.

Two-sided P < .10 was prespecified as statistically significant for the primary and secondary efficacy end points, with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for all statistical analyses, and therefore reported least squares (LS) mean represent marginal means for a balanced population.

There were no apparent dose‐related increases in the frequency of laboratory, vital sign or ECG abnormalities by categorical analysis. A trend for increases in mean time‐matched double differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over the course of the day was observed on Day 56 in the danuglipron 80‐ and 120‐mg groups, relative to the placebo and danuglipron 40‐mg groups; no apparent increases were observed in the danuglipron 40‐mg group relative to placebo (Figure S4A, B: Appendix S1). Mean SBP and DBP values for all dose groups were in the normal range. A trend for increases in mean time‐matched double differences in pulse rate and heart rate by ECG over the course of the day was observed on Day 56 in all danuglipron dose groups compared with placebo, with a greater observed increase in the danuglipron 120‐mg group compared with other groups (Figure S4C, D: Appendix S1). Mean pulse rate and heart rate values for all dose groups were generally in the normal range. No TEAEs related to vital sign or ECG abnormalities were reported, and there were no occurrences of heart rates > 120 bpm. Compared with placebo, there were no dose‐related trends in mean time‐matched double differences from baseline in the ECG parameters of PR, QRS, QT or QTcF intervals over 8 weeks, and no ECG findings were reported as clinically meaningful by the investigator.

Statistical Analysis

A sample size of approximately 400 was selected to provide approximately 67 participants per group, with approximately 50 completing the study per group (assuming a conservative 25% dropout rate). This yielded 80% power to detect a placebo-adjusted change in HbA 1c of 0.5%, using a 1-sided t test at a 5% level and assuming a conservative SD of 1.0%.

The primary efficacy analysis population comprised all randomized participants who took 1 dose or more of study medication and is therefore similar to a modified intention-to-treat approach, where participants were analyzed based on the study medication they were randomized to. For participants who discontinued study medication and/or received glycemic rescue medication, all subsequent values were censored in the analysis. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis was used to estimate the treatment effects for change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 16 (the primary efficacy end point) and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. A similar analysis was used to estimate changes in FPG and body weight at these time points, as well as changes in the exploratory end points (fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and glucagon) at week 16 and including earlier time points in the models. The mixed-model repeated-measures models included treatment, time, strata (metformin vs diet and exercise alone), and treatment × time interaction as fixed effects, the relevant baseline measure as a covariate, and the baseline × time interaction with time fitted as a repeated effect and participant as a random effect. An unstructured correlation matrix was used, and the Kenward-Roger approximation for estimating degrees of freedom for the model parameters was used.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

3.4 Pharmacokinetics

Following multiple dosing, danuglipron plasma exposures on Day 56 (steady state) increased in an approximately dose‐proportional manner (Figures S7 and S8: Appendix S1), with dose‐proportional increases in geometric mean AUC 24 and C max values, and similar dose‐normalized (dn) exposures (AUC 24 (dn); C max (dn)), observed across the dose groups (Table 4). Lower median danuglipron concentrations were observed for the 120‐mg group compared with the 80‐mg group at 24, 36 and 48 h post‐dose on Day 56 (Figure S7: Appendix S1); high interindividual variability at these time points and the small number of participants per cohort most likely contributed to this observation.

TABLE 4
Descriptive summary of key plasma pharmacokinetic parameters on Day 56 (steady state) following twice‐daily oral dosing of danuglipron

Following the morning dose on Day 56, median C max was observed within a median T max of 6 h post‐dose across all danuglipron doses; mean t ½ values on Day 56 ranged from 5.300 to 6.373 h (Table 4). Observed accumulation ratios for AUC 24 (R ac) and C max (R ac, C max) on Day 56 of multiple dosing ranged between 1.202‐1.349 and 1.118‐1.392, respectively, across dose groups (Table S4: Appendix S1), indicating that accumulation was minimal following this dosing regimen.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of danuglipron (PF-06882961), which is a novel, oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Materials and Methods

This phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study enrolled adult Japanese participants with T2DM inadequately controlled on diet and exercise. Participants received twice-daily oral doses of placebo or multiple ascending doses of danuglipron titrated to 40, 80 or 120mg twice daily over 8weeks. The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of danuglipron. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included plasma pharmacokinetics, glycaemic parameters and body weight.

Results

In the 37 participants randomized, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and headache. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. Dose-proportional increases in danuglipron exposure parameters were observed at steady state (Day 56). Significant reductions from baseline were observed with danuglipron on Day 56 for mean daily glucose [least squares mean (90% confidence interval) placebo-adjusted difference of up to -67.89 (-88.98, -46.79) mg/dl] and on Day 57 for fasting plasma glucose [up to -40.87 (-53.77, -27.98) mg/dl], glycated haemoglobin [up to -1.41% (-2.01%, -0.82%)] and body weight [up to -1.87 (-3.58, -0.17) kg].

Conclusions

In Japanese adults with T2DM, danuglipron exhibited dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure at steady state and robustly reduced glycaemic parameters and body weight after 8weeks of dosing, with a safety profile consistent with the mechanism of action.

Abstract

Aims

This study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of danuglipron (PF‐06882961), which is a novel, oral small‐molecule glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist, in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Materials and Methods

This phase 1, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study enrolled adult Japanese participants with T2DM inadequately controlled on diet and exercise. Participants received twice‐daily oral doses of placebo or multiple ascending doses of danuglipron titrated to 40, 80 or 120 mg twice daily over 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of danuglipron. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included plasma pharmacokinetics, glycaemic parameters and body weight.

Results

In the 37 participants randomized, the most common treatment‐emergent adverse events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and headache. Most treatment‐emergent adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. Dose‐proportional increases in danuglipron exposure parameters were observed at steady state (Day 56). Significant reductions from baseline were observed with danuglipron on Day 56 for mean daily glucose [least squares mean (90% confidence interval) placebo‐adjusted difference of up to −67.89 (−88.98, −46.79) mg/dl] and on Day 57 for fasting plasma glucose [up to −40.87 (−53.77, −27.98) mg/dl], glycated haemoglobin [up to −1.41% (−2.01%, −0.82%)] and body weight [up to −1.87 (−3.58, −0.17) kg].

Conclusions

In Japanese adults with T2DM, danuglipron exhibited dose‐proportional increases in plasma exposure at steady state and robustly reduced glycaemic parameters and body weight after 8 weeks of dosing, with a safety profile consistent with the mechanism of action.

### Efficacy and safety of oral small molecule glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist danuglipron for glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^5b450363]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Participants abstained from food and drink (except water) for at least 8 hours (preferably 10 hours) before body weight measurements and blood sampling. The sponsor study team and investigative site were blinded to postrandomization measures of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glucagon, and fasting plasma insulin, unless the FPG results met criteria for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Glycemic rescue medication (metformin, sulfonylureas, or sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, prescribed according to local regulations) was permitted if participants experienced persistent fasting hyperglycemia. Participants who discontinued study medication were permitted to continue in the study.

Study Population

Adults (aged 18–75 years, self-reported male or female) with T2D treated with diet and exercise, with or without metformin use, were eligible for inclusion if their HbA 1c was 7% or more and no higher than 10.5% (to convert HbA 1c percentage to mmol/mol, multiply by 10.93 and subtract 23.50) at screening, body weight was greater than 50 kg and stable, and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was in the range of 22.5 (Asia) or 24.5 (North America and Europe) to 45.4. At least 80% of enrolled participants were required to be taking metformin before screening, with no more than 20% of the study population treated with diet and exercise alone. Participants self-reported race and sex. Race and sex data were collected and reported as part of the standard demographic information that is collected in most clinical trials and helps to provide context for these data within the wider literature and in a clinical setting. Analyses were not conducted on the basis of demographic characteristics. Key exclusion criteria can be found in the eMethods in Supplement 2. Participants who were taking metformin were required to receive a stable dose of metformin 60 days or more before screening, and they remained on this same dose throughout the study except when a dose change was medically indicated.

### Danuglipron (PF-06882961) in type 2 diabetes: a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending-dose phase 1 trial [^42588b74]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Agonism of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) results in glycemic lowering and body weight loss and is a therapeutic strategy to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. We developed danuglipron (PF-06882961), an oral small-molecule GLP-1R agonist and found it had comparable efficacy to injectable peptidic GLP-1R agonists in a humanized mouse model. We then completed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multiple ascending-dose phase 1 study (NCT03538743), in which we enrolled 98 patients with T2D on background metformin and randomized them to receive multiple ascending doses of danuglipron or placebo for 28d, across eight cohorts. The primary outcomes were assessment of adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Most AEs were mild, with nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting most commonly reported. There were no clinically meaningful AEs in laboratory values across groups. Heart rate generally increased with danuglipron treatment at day 28, but no heart-rate AEs were reported. Systolic blood pressure was slightly decreased and changes in diastolic blood pressure were similar with danuglipron treatment at day 28, compared with placebo. There were no clinically meaningful electrocardiogram findings. In this study in T2D, danuglipron was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the mechanism of action of GLP-1R agonism.

4 DISCUSSION

In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 2b study of danuglipron in adult patients with obesity and without diabetes, the primary efficacy endpoint was met, with all danuglipron treatment groups demonstrating statistically significant reductions from baseline body weight ranging from −5.0% to −12.9% with 26 or 32 weeks of dosing, relative to placebo. As these are generally consistent with the magnitude of reductions reported as being clinically meaningful for other GLP1 RAs, and did not appear to plateau over the treatment period, body weight reductions achieved with longer‐term dosing of danuglipron may be expected to result in clinical benefits. Secondary efficacy assessments also indicated favourable outcomes for danuglipron over placebo. Statistically significantly greater proportions of participants achieving ≥ 5% reductions in body weight were observed in all danuglipron groups versus placebo, and participants receiving danuglipron also demonstrated statistically significantly greater declines in waist circumference from baseline relative to placebo.

When this study was initiated, participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 were randomized to groups with 1‐ and 2‐week dose escalation intervals similar to those being assessed in the Phase 2 trials of danuglipron in T2D being conducted at the same time. These administration schedules were selected as, given the half‐life of danuglipron, exposure would be expected to reach steady‐state in this timeframe. Cohort 3 was added via a protocol amendment to assess the potential impact of slower (monthly) dose escalation and the data gathered in this group, along with those available for injectable GLP‐1 RAs, indicate that a more gradual dose‐escalation approach may result in improved tolerability relative to more rapid dose escalation.

In all cohorts, a fixed dose escalation scheme was used with the aim of assessing safety and efficacy at a range of target doses and dose escalation steps, without the potentially confounding heterogeneity introduced by flexible dosing. Strategies that could mitigate AEs and potentially improve adherence and study retention in later stage studies (e.g. additional time at a given dose level, or reduction to a previously tolerated dose) were not permitted in this Phase 2 assessment. The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was higher than anticipated in the danuglipron groups, particularly given that most AEs were reported as being of mild intensity. This was most notable in participants randomized to the once‐weekly dose escalation schedule. Participants in the placebo groups also had higher than expected discontinuation rates which could suggest that, across treatment groups, other factors in addition to the mild AEs reported may have contributed to the decision to discontinue treatment.

4 DISCUSSION

This phase 1 study of the novel GLP‐1R agonist danuglipron showed that administration of ascending, multiple oral doses of danuglipron over 56 days was generally safe in adult Japanese participants with T2DM inadequately controlled on diet and exercise, with a tolerability profile consistent with the mechanism of action. The most frequently reported all‐causality TEAEs were nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and headache, and most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Although a trend for increases in SBP, DBP and pulse rate was observed on Day 56 with higher doses of danuglipron relative to placebo, mean SBP, DBP and pulse rate values were generally in the normal range. Pharmacodynamic analyses revealed significant reductions from baseline in glycaemic indices and reductions from baseline in body weight across all danuglipron groups compared with placebo. Analysis of the danuglipron pharmacokinetic profile showed dose‐proportional increases in plasma exposure at steady state (Day 56) following titration to 40‐, 80‐ or 120‐mg doses.

The safety profile of danuglipron observed in this phase 1 study of Japanese participants with T2DM is consistent with previous phase 1 studies of danuglipron conducted in Western participants with or without T2DM. Previously, in healthy Western participants who received single doses of danuglipron ranging from 3 to 300 mg, or in Western participants with T2DM who received multiple doses of danuglipron ranging from 10 to 200 mg administered twice daily or once daily over 28 days, the most commonly reported TEAEs were related to gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal discomfort or distension), in line with the current study in Japanese participants with T2DM. Gastrointestinal TEAEs were anticipated following multiple dosing of danuglipron because of the mechanism of action of this oral GLP‐1R agonist. Although dose escalation was incorporated into the protocols of both multiple‐dose studies to maximize danuglipron tolerability, the relatively short treatment durations of the studies (28 days in Western participants; 56 days in Japanese participants) dictated a rapid dose‐escalation schedule to achieve the higher doses. More gradual dose‐escalation schemes over longer treatment durations are anticipated to result in lower incidence rates of gastrointestinal AEs. However, both the overall and gastrointestinal safety profiles of danuglipron are generally consistent with those described for peptidic GLP‐1R agonists, including the recent oral formulation of semaglutide.

3.5 Pharmacodynamic outcomes

All danuglipron groups apart from 80 mg BID (4‐week dose escalation) demonstrated statistically significant but modest declines from baseline in HbA1c at the end of treatment relative to placebo (least squares means ranging from −0.1% to −0.4%). At the end of treatment, least squares mean changes from baseline in FPG were statistically significant for all danuglipron groups in Cohorts 1 and 2 (ranging from −6.7 to −9.9 mg/dL) versus placebo, but no significant changes were observed in Cohort 3.

3.6 Safety and tolerability

Of 626 participants in the safety analysis set, 85.6% (n = 536) reported ≥ 1 all‐causality TEAE, including 70.0% (n = 63) of those assigned to placebo and 88.2% (n = 473) of those taking danuglipron (Table 2). Total numbers of TEAEs reported were 194 with placebo (90 evaluable participants) and 1817 with danuglipron (536 evaluable participants). Of all reported TEAEs, 56.6% were judged to be related to study treatment.

Summary of treatment‐emergent adverse events.

Most all‐causality TEAEs were mild in severity (63.1%), 35.1% were moderate, and 1.8% severe. SAEs were reported in 19 (3.0%) participants (Table 2). One participant in the danuglipron 200 mg BID (4‐week dose escalation) group had SAEs of nausea and bilious vomiting that were considered related to study treatment; no other SAEs were reported as treatment related. No deaths were reported during the study.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peptidic glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) are approved for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to reduce excess body weight. In treating the disease of obesity, clinicians also have the opportunity to reduce the burden of obesity‐related conditions including T2D, cardiovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia. Much interest remains in identifying effective, convenient, accessible treatments for patients. Danuglipron (PF‐06882961) is an orally administered, potent, small‐molecule GLP‐1 RA that was under investigation for chronic weight management and as a potential therapy for adults with T2D.

In two randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 1 studies in patients with T2D (NCT03538743; NCT04552470), danuglipron demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile consistent with the mechanism, resulting in robust reductions in glycemic indices and body weight. Similar findings were observed in a 12‐week, Phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of patients with T2D or obesity (NCT04617275) and a 16‐week, Phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study in patients with T2D (NCT03985293). Across Phase 1 and 2 studies, the most commonly reported AEs for danuglipron were gastrointestinal and mild in severity. Here, we report results of a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 2b study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple dose levels of danuglipron administered twice daily (BID) to adults with obesity and without diabetes. After completion of this Phase 2b study, additional studies with danuglipron were conducted, and in one of these subsequent studies, a single asymptomatic participant experienced potential drug‐induced liver injury. After a review of all clinical trial data and recent input from regulators, Pfizer announced the discontinuation of clinical development of danuglipron.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In 2021, diabetes affected an estimated 11 million adults in Japan (age‐adjusted prevalence, 6.6%) and caused ~245 000 deaths. Recent studies have found that nearly half of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not achieve the standard glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target of < 7.0%. Japanese clinical practice guidelinesfor the management of non‐insulin‐dependent T2DM recommend the use of an oral antihyperglycaemic agent, such as a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor or metformin, and/or an injectable glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor (GLP‐1R) agonist as first‐line therapy in patients where adequate glycaemic control is not achieved through diet and exercise. However, a survey of injectable‐naïve Japanese patients with T2DM revealed a strong preference for drug profiles associated with oral versus injectable GLP‐1R agonists, with administration mode and frequency the most important factors contributing to this decision.

Danuglipron (PF‐06882961) is a novel, potent, oral small‐molecule GLP‐1R agonist being investigated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM. Based on pharmacokinetic data from early phase 1 studies, danuglipron is administered twice daily and can be dosed without regard to food. In non‐clinical models, danuglipron stimulated glucose‐dependent insulin release and suppressed food intake with equivalent efficacy to that of injectable peptidic GLP‐1R agonists. In a recent multiple ascending‐dose phase 1 study in non‐Japanese participants with T2DM on a background of metformin, danuglipron reduced glycaemic indices and body weight with favourable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, supporting further clinical development of danuglipron for the treatment of T2DM and obesity.

This current phase 1 study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of danuglipron in Japanese participants with T2DM following oral, twice‐daily dosing for 8 weeks. This was the first clinical study of danuglipron in Japanese patients, and the first to describe the effect of danuglipron dosing beyond 28 days, in an outpatient study, and on a background of diet and exercise alone.

2.6 Pharmacodynamic assessments

Exploratory objectives of the study included characterization of the pharmacodynamic effect of danuglipron following multiple oral doses in adult Japanese participants with T2DM. Pre‐specified exploratory endpoints included change from baseline in mean daily glucose (MDG, assessed as glucose AUC 24 /24 h) following an MMTT, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, fasting plasma insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) and of β‐cell function (HOMA‐B). Additional endpoints included fasting glucagon, fasting C‐peptide and change from baseline in AUC from time 0 to 4 h (AUC 0‐4) for glucose, insulin, glucagon and C‐peptide following an MMTT. After randomization, all pharmacodynamic endpoints were blinded; only glucose levels that met pre‐specified criteria for hypo‐ or hyperglycaemia were unblinded. See Appendix S1 for details on pharmacodynamic assays, including MMTT assessments.

Abstract

Aims

This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 2b study aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of danuglipron (PF‐06882961), an oral small‐molecule glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist, in adults with obesity.

Materials and Methods

Eligible participants (aged 18–75 years; with obesity, without diabetes) were randomized to receive danuglipron or placebo twice daily (BID) for 26 or 32 weeks. Danuglipron was escalated to doses of 40–200 mg BID in 1‐, 2‐, or 4‐week intervals. Assessments included body weight, waist circumference, and safety evaluations.

Results

Overall, 628 participants were randomized; of 626 receiving study treatment (placebo, n = 90; danuglipron, n = 536), 39.3% completed treatment. Approximately 38% of participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (AEs) and 22% discontinued for other reasons. The primary endpoint was the change in weight from baseline to the end of treatment; all danuglipron groups demonstrated statistically significant reductions with least squares mean percentage decreases from baseline ranging from −5.0% (90% confidence interval [CI] −6.8%, −3.2%) to −12.9% (90% CI −16.1%, −9.5%) relative to placebo. Danuglipron was considered safe. Consistent with the mechanism, the most frequently reported events were nausea and vomiting, and increased rates of gastrointestinal AEs were generally observed at higher doses. Most events were reported as mild, and no other dose‐related trends were observed in safety endpoints.

Conclusions

In participants with obesity, danuglipron resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in body weight versus placebo over 26 or 32 weeks. The overall safety profile observed in this study was consistent with expectations for the mechanism, although discontinuation rates due to AEs were higher than anticipated across all treatment groups, including placebo.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3 Study participants

Eligible participants were Japanese adults aged 20‐70 years, inclusive, with T2DM treated by diet and exercise alone, HbA1c level ≥ 7% to ≤ 10.5% at screening, total body weight > 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) 22.5‐45.4 kg/m 2. Use of other medications for glycaemic control was not permitted in this study. The time frame of restriction of use of antidiabetic medications ranged from 60 days (for oral medications) to 90 days (for injectable medications and thiazolidinediones) before the screening visit and throughout the study participation until the follow‐up visit. See Appendix S1 for additional inclusion and exclusion criteria.

2.4 Safety assessments

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of danuglipron in adult Japanese participants with T2DM. Endpoints included the incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) [including adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs)], clinical safety laboratory measurements, vital signs and 12‐lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). Change from baseline in body weight was assessed as a pre‐specified exploratory endpoint. AEs were summarized per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 23.1.

2.5 Pharmacokinetic assessments

The secondary objective of the study was to characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of danuglipron in adult Japanese participants with T2DM. Endpoints included area under the plasma concentration‐time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 h (AUC 24), maximum plasma concentration [C max (0‐10 h)], time to C max (T max) and terminal half‐life (t ½). See Appendix S1 for details on pharmacokinetic assays.

Across the range of doses tested, 40–200 mg BID, danuglipron treatment was generally safe, and no unexpected signals were identified. Most TEAEs were mild in intensity; the most common events were gastrointestinal, with nausea and vomiting being the most frequently reported TEAEs in participants randomized to danuglipron and the TEAEs most frequently reported as reasons for discontinuation. The types of TEAEs reported (preferred terms and SOCs) were generally consistent with those previously reported for danuglipron, and other GLP‐1 RAs, including in Phase 2 and 3 studies of other small‐ and large‐molecule GLP‐1 RAs in adults with obesity or overweight. Differences in rates of TEAEs emerged between danuglipron treatment groups, in which lower target doses, and in some cases longer dose escalation intervals, were generally associated with lower rates of TEAEs. For example, the 80 mg BID 1‐week group reported nausea and vomiting rates at 62% and 38%, respectively, whereas rates of 38% and 8% were observed with 4‐week dose escalation intervals to the same target dose. Similarly, discontinuations due to all‐causality TEAEs were reported with higher frequency in groups with shorter dose escalation intervals and higher target doses. In the 16‐week Phase 2 trial of danuglipron in T2D, the proportion of participants discontinuing study treatment because of TEAEs was also dose‐responsive across danuglipron groups (3%–34% compared with 8% for placebo). In a separate 12‐week Phase 2 study in participants with T2D or obesity without T2D assessing 1‐ and 2‐week escalation steps to higher target doses of danuglipron, discontinuation from treatment due to TEAEs occurred in 18%–38% (danuglipron) compared with 6% (placebo) in participants with T2D and 55% (danuglipron) compared with 0% (placebo) in the obesity cohort, which received only the highest target dose of 200 mg BID (or placebo) with 1‐week escalation steps. In danuglipron groups, discontinuations from study treatment were most commonly due to gastrointestinal TEAEs. In the current Phase 2 study in obesity, for Cohorts 1 and 2 with more rapid dose escalation, discontinuations due to gastrointestinal AEs occurred earlier compared with danuglipron groups with 4‐week dose escalation intervals in Cohort 3, where such discontinuations due to gastrointestinal AEs were less than 10% through to Week 12 for all groups (data not presented). Gastrointestinal AEs generally improved over time in most treatment groups. Otherwise, there were no observed imbalances across danuglipron and placebo arms in the rates of abnormal safety measurements (including vital signs, ECG values, laboratory tests, and SIB and depression assessments) or rates of AEs, aside from those anticipated with this mechanism.

Oral GLP-1 RA

Orfoglipron and danuglipron are being studied for T2DM and obesity treatment. The phase IIb clinical trial studying danuglipron twice daily in participants with obesity had over 50% of patients discontinue treatment in comparison to about 40% with placebo. To increase patient adherence, danugliprion will be studied in a once daily formulation.

Future directions

Considering the GLP-1 RAs currently available for treating T2DM and obesity, along with the numerous new GLP-1 RAs, dual, and triple agonists in development, we anticipate a shift in clinical practice towards more personalized and tailored use of these agents to meet individual patient needs. In Fig. 4, we present a proposed algorithm for the management of patients, which reflects this personalized approach.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

All but one of the TEAEs reported during the study were mild (n = 36) or moderate (n = 33) in severity. One participant (40‐mg group) experienced a severe TEAE of increased alanine aminotransferase level, which resolved on Day 36 and was not considered treatment‐related; the study drug was temporarily discontinued because of this TEAE, as noted above.

The most frequently reported all‐causality TEAEs were related to gastrointestinal disorders (reported by 67.6% of participants), most commonly nausea (48.6%), vomiting (43.2%), abdominal discomfort (35.1%) and diarrhoea (10.8%), and to nervous system disorders (reported by 13.5% of participants), most commonly headache (10.8%) (Table 2). The incidence of TEAEs related to gastrointestinal disorders was higher in the danuglipron groups compared with the placebo group but did not appear to increase in a dose‐dependent manner. Time courses of the incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea TEAEs over the duration of the study are shown in Figure S3: Appendix S1. The incidence of these TEAEs varied over time according to the target dose of danuglipron and the associated dose titration scheme. With the exception of nausea in the danuglipron 80‐mg group, the incidence of gastrointestinal TEAEs tended to decrease or stabilize after the first ~3‐4 weeks of dosing, and incidence rates varied markedly between danuglipron dose groups. All TEAEs of nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and decreased appetite in the danuglipron dose groups were considered treatment‐related, whereas TEAEs of headache and dental caries were considered not treatment‐related. One participant in the danuglipron 40‐mg group experienced a probable event of symptomatic hypoglycaemia (blood glucose was not measured) of mild severity, which was considered treatment‐related; symptoms resolved on the day of onset following treatment with oral carbohydrates. No other hypoglycaemic events were reported in the study.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Disposition

Overall, 1220 participants were screened (Cohorts 1 and 2, n = 926; Cohort 3, n = 294) and 628 participants randomized (Cohorts 1 and 2, n = 499; Cohort 3, n = 129) (Figure 2). Dates of recruitment and follow‐up for the study are reported in Data S1. Two participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 discontinued the study prior to the first dose of study treatment; therefore, efficacy and safety analyses in Cohorts 1 and 2 included 497 participants. In Cohort 3, all randomized participants received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment; therefore, efficacy and safety analyses included all 129 participants.

Disposition of study participants for (A) Cohorts 1 and 2 and (B) Cohort 3. AE, adverse event; BID, twice daily; LTFU, lost to follow‐up; PD, protocol deviation.

Of 626 participants randomized and treated, 246 (39.3%) completed the double‐blind treatment phase on study treatment. Participants who discontinued treatment may have continued in the study off‐treatment. Data provided here summarize discontinuations from study treatment, regardless of whether participants continued in the study or not. In Cohorts 1 and 2, 196 (39.4%) participants completed treatment and 301 (60.6%) discontinued treatment; in Cohort 3, 50 (38.8%) participants completed treatment and 79 (61.2%) discontinued treatment. For Cohorts 1 and 2, discontinuation rates ranged from 52% to 78% across danuglipron groups, versus 38% for placebo. In Cohort 3, discontinuation rates ranged from 59% to 69% across danuglipron groups, versus 42% for placebo.

The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with previous studies of danuglipron and with the known profiles of other GLP‐1 RAs. There were no clinically significant adverse trends in safety measurements, including laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG assessments. There were no danuglipron‐treated participants with significantly elevated liver enzyme levels. The types of TEAEs reported were generally in line with expectations, and most TEAEs were mild in severity. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were higher than anticipated, indicating opportunities for improvement in tolerability profile and study retention. Overall, the outcomes of this Phase 2b study demonstrate the efficacy of danuglipron at target doses of 40–200 mg BID in participants with obesity, relative to placebo, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in body weight. After completion of this Phase 2b study, additional studies with danuglipron were conducted. In one of these subsequent studies, a single asymptomatic participant experienced potential drug‐induced liver injury. While the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across all danuglipron studies was in line with approved agents in the class, after a review of the totality of information and recent input from regulators, Pfizer announced discontinuation of the clinical development of danuglipron.

Across cohorts, the most common reason for discontinuation was AEs (38.5% [n = 241] for all‐causality AEs; 31.6% [n = 198] for treatment‐related AEs in the gastrointestinal system organ class [SOC]), with higher discontinuation rates due to AEs in the danuglipron treatment groups (ranging 32%–67% [Cohorts 1 and 2], and 24%–50% [Cohort 3]) than in the placebo groups (6% [Cohorts 1 and 2] and 0% [Cohort 3]). The discontinuation rate from study treatment for reasons other than AEs was 22% overall and did not appear to be meaningfully different between placebo (Cohorts 1 and 2: 32% and Cohort 3: 42%) and danuglipron (11%–41%) treatment groups.

3.2 Demographics and characteristics

The study was conducted across four regions, with participants in the safety analysis set located in the United States (70.6% [n = 442]), Canada (20.6% [n = 129]), Japan (8.1% [n = 51]), and Taiwan (0.6% [n = 4]). All four regions contributed to Cohort 1; Cohorts 2 and 3 were conducted at a subset of US sites only.

GLP-1 RA in development

Oral orfoglipron, a nonpeptide partial GLP-1 RA, enhances cyclic AMP signaling more than β-arrestin recruitment, indicating less receptor desensitization compared to full GLP-1 RAs. Can be administered without respect to food unlike, peptide based oral semaglutide. In a phase 2 study clinical trial evaluating its use in T2DM, orforglipron significantly decreased HbA1c to −2.1% compared to −1.1% for dulaglutide and −0.43% for placebo.

Twice daily danuglipron, In a phase 2 study decreased HbA1c by −0.49% to −1.18% in a dose dependent manner, compared to −0.02% for placebo.

Dual GLP-1 RA agonists

Semaglutide 2.4 mg, combined with cagrilintide (CagriSema), a long-acting amylin analogue, is being developed for treating T2DM. It is administered in a once-weekly subcutaneous injection. In a phase 2 clinical trial, CagriSema significantly reduced HbA1c by −2.2%, compared to −1.8% for semaglutide 2.4 mg alone (p = 0.075) (Table 1).

Dual GLP-1 RA and glucagon agonists

Mazdutide is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection. In a phase 2 clinical trial among Chinese patients, mazdutide reduced HbA1c by −1.41% to −1.67% in a dose dependent manner compared to +0.03% for placebo. Survotutide was studied in once and twice weekly administration by subcutaneous injection in a phase II trial, and was shown to significantly reduce HbA1c compared to placebo (Table 1).

Triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon RA

Retatrutide, a once weekly, triple GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon RA administered by subcutaneous injection, is under development for treating type 2 diabetes. In a phase 2 clinical trial, retatrutide reduced HbA1c to −2.02%, compared to −1.41% for dulaglutide 1.5 mg and −0.01% for placebo (Table 1).

### Efficacy and safety of danuglipron (PF-06882961) in adults with obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study [^dd208d5e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Across all three study cohorts, TEAEs in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC were reported in 30.0% (n = 27) of participants on placebo and in 77.4% (n = 415) of participants in the danuglipron treatment groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nausea (51.4% [n = 322]) and vomiting (31.3% [n = 196]). Proportions of participants reporting nausea and vomiting were higher across danuglipron groups than placebo groups (Table 2). During danuglipron dose escalation, first instances of nausea and vomiting generally occurred earlier in treatment groups with 1‐week escalation intervals versus those with 2‐ or 4‐week intervals at corresponding target doses (Figure S3). Proportions of participants with first occurrences of nausea or vomiting at dose steps up to and including 80 mg BID were generally below 10% each week, and few participants per week (generally < 5%) reported first events of nausea and vomiting after reaching target doses of 40 mg or 80 mg BID.

Overall, 38.5% (n = 241) of participants discontinued study treatment due to all‐causality TEAEs, and 33.2% (n = 208) discontinued due to treatment‐related TEAEs (Table 2). Across danuglipron groups, discontinuations due to AEs were highest with the 200 mg BID (1‐week dose escalation) group and lowest with the 80 mg BID (4‐week dose escalation). Four (4.4%) participants on placebo discontinued due to AEs. Preferred terms reported as the reason for discontinuation in ≥ 2% of participants were nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and diarrhoea. Nausea and vomiting, respectively, were reported as reasons for discontinuation in 21.1% (n = 113) and 13.1% (n = 70) of participants on danuglipron, compared with 1.1% (n = 1) and 0% on placebo (Table S2).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral DA-1229 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control with diet and exercise [^8f318570]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study on Korean subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated that patients treated with DA-1229 experienced significantly reduced HbA1c levels after 12 weeks compared to those who received a placebo. Although the reduction in HbA1c from baseline was greatest in the 5-mg group, there was no statistical difference between the dosage groups. These results indicate that a dose-dependent reduction in HbA1c may not occur at doses greater than 5 mg. The degree of HbA1c reduction was more profound in the subgroup with a higher baseline HbA1c [> 8.5% (69 mmol/mol)]. Insulin secretory function as assessed by the insulinogenic index improved significantly in the 10-mg group compared to the placebo group. Other markers of insulin secretory function, including 2 h OGTT C-peptide and post-OGTT C-peptide AUC 0–2h, also showed significant increases in the 2.5 and 5-mg groups for 2 h OGTT C-peptide and in all three groups for post-OGTT C-peptide AUC 0–2h compared to the placebo group. Post-OGTT glucose AUC 0–2h significantly decreased in the 5 and 10-mg groups compared to the placebo group. In summary, efficacy was demonstrated in all DA-1229 groups compared to the placebo group in the primary efficacy evaluation, and the greatest efficacy was shown in the 5-mg group. In the secondary efficacy evaluation, significant changes were demonstrated in all DA-1229 groups, with the greatest efficacy in the 5-mg group. However, there were no significant changes in lipid parameters and body weight in any group. Furthermore, the incidence of AEs was similar in all groups, including the placebo group. Based on the results of this phase II trial, the optimal dose for this drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is 5 mg once daily.

### Orlistat 120 mg improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with or without concurrent weight loss [^50a68812]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Published data suggest that orlistat 120 mg, a lipase inhibitor used to treat obesity, may improve glycaemic parameters through weight loss-independent effects.

Aim

To investigate the effect of orlistat 120 mg on weight loss, and assess whether changes in glycaemic parameters [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] are independent of weight loss.

Methods

This retrospective analysis of pooled data from seven multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involved overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 18–70 years). Patients were required to have a body mass index of 27–43 kg/m2, HbA1c of 6.5 to < 13%, and stable weight for ≥ 3 months. Subjects received orlistat 120 mg tid or placebo for 6 or 12 months.

Results

A total of 2550 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and randomized to treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid (n = 1279) or placebo (n = 1271). For the whole population, patients treated with orlistat 120 mg had significantly greater mean decreases in FPG compared with placebo-treated patients (-1.39 mmol/l vs. -0.47 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). In addition, orlistat 120 mg provided significantly larger mean decreases in HbA1c compared with placebo (-0.74% vs. -0.31%; p < 0.0001). For patients with minimal weight loss (≤ 1% of baseline body weight), orlistat 120 mg still provided a significantly greater decrease in the least squares mean value for both FPG (-0.83 mmol/l vs. ± 0.02 mmol/l; p = 0.0052) and HbA1c -0.29% vs. ± 0.14%; p = 0.0008). This suggested that the improvement of glycaemic control with orlistat 120 mg was independent of weight loss. Using linear regression analysis, improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c) with orlistat 120 mg was less strongly correlated with weight loss than for placebo.

Conclusion

Orlistat 120 mg appears to improve glycaemic control more than would be predicted by weight loss alone in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Postulated mechanisms underlying this effect include an improvement of insulin sensitivity, a slower and incomplete digestion of dietary fat, reduction of postprandial plasma non-esterified fatty acids, decreased visceral adipose tissue, and stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in the lower small intestine.

### Efficacy and safety of ETC-1002, a novel investigational low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering therapy for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^101d014a]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

8-Hydroxy-2,2,14,14-tetramethylpentadecanedioic acid (ETC-1002) is a small molecule with a unique mechanism of action shown in nonclinical studies to modulate pathways of cholesterol, fatty acid, and carbohydrate metabolism. In previous phase 2 clinical trials, once daily oral treatment with ETC-1002 significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In this trial, the lipid-lowering efficacy of ETC-1002 was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Additional cardiometabolic biomarkers, including glycemic measures, were also assessed.

Approach and Results

A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Patients discontinued all diabetes mellitus and lipid-regulating drugs and were randomized to receive ETC-1002 80 mg QD for 2 weeks followed by 120 mg QD for 2 weeks or placebo for 4 weeks. ETC-1002 lowered low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels by 43 ± 2.6% (least squares mean ± SE), compared with a reduction of 4 ± 2.5% by placebo at day 29 (P < 0.0001; primary end point). Non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and total cholesterol were also significantly lowered by ETC-1002 compared with placebo (P < 0.0001). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was reduced by 41% (median) compared with a placebo reduction of 11% (P = 0.0011). No clinically meaningful safety findings were observed.

Conclusions

ETC-1002 lowered low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and other lipids and demonstrated improvement in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia without worsening glycemic control. ETC-1002 was well tolerated in this population.

### Nateglinide [^c36cb9c0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Monotherapy and In Combination with Metformin

In a 24-week, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled study, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either nateglinide alone (120 mg three times daily before meals), metformin alone (500 mg three times daily), a combination of nateglinide 120 mg (three times daily before meals) and metformin (500 mg three times daily), or placebo. Fifty-seven percent of patients were previously untreated with oral antidiabetic therapy. Patients previously treated with antidiabetic medications were required to discontinue medication for at least 2 months before randomization.

At Week 24, statistically significant reductions in mean HbA1c and FPG were observed with metformin monotherapy compared to nateglinide monotherapy, and the combination of nateglinide and metformin compared to either nateglinide or metformin monotherapy (see Table 7).

Compared to placebo, nateglinide monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant increase in mean body weight, while no significant change in body weight was observed with metformin monotherapy or combination of nateglinide and metformin therapy (see Table 7). Among the subset of patients previously treated with other antidiabetic agents, primarily glyburide, HbA1C in the nateglinide monotherapy group increased slightly from baseline, whereas HbA1C was reduced in the metformin monotherapy group (see Table 7).

In another 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1C greater than or equal to 6.8% after treatment with metformin (greater than or equal to 1500 mg daily for at least 1 month) were first entered into a four week run-in period of metformin monotherapy (2000 mg daily) and then randomized to receive either nateglinide (60 mg or 120 mg three times daily before meals) or placebo as add-on to metformin. At the end of treatment, nateglinide 60 mg and 120 mg three times daily resulted in a statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1C compared to placebo when added to metformin (-0.4% and -0.6% for nateglinide 60 mg and nateglinide 120 mg plus metformin, respectively).

14.1 Monotherapy

In a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either nateglinide (60 mg or 120 mg three times daily before meals) or placebo. Patients previously treated with antidiabetic medications were required to discontinue that medication for at least 2 months before randomization.

At Week 24, treatment with nateglinide before meals resulted in statistically significant reductions in mean HbA1C and mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo (see Table 5). The reductions in HbA1C and FPG were similar for patient's naïve to, and those previously exposed to, antidiabetic medications.

14.2 Monotherapy Compared to Glyburide

In a 24-week, double-blind, active-controlled trial, patients with type 2 diabetes who had been on a sulfonylurea for 3 or more months and who had a baseline HbA1C greater than or equal to 6.5% were randomized to receive nateglinide (60 mg or 120 mg three times daily before meals) or glyburide 10 mg once daily. Patients randomized to nateglinide had statistically significant increases in mean HbA1C and mean FPG at endpoint compared to patients randomized to glyburide.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^ac92edeb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

GLP-1 receptor agonists

GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) are analogs of the naturally occurring incretin GLP-1 that have a prolonged half-life and, therefore, prolonged action. At pharmacologic doses, GLP-1 RAs increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decrease glucose-dependent glucagon secretion, and slow gastric emptying, thereby reducing A1C by 0.8–1.5%. GLP-1 RAs are understood to have minor beneficial effects on CVD risk, which may be related to their effects to promote weight loss and blood pressure reduction. These effects are maintained when GLP-1 RAs are used as part of dual therapy with metformin. GLP-1 RAs, such as exenatide and liraglutide, are more potent inhibitors of postprandial hyperlipidemia through reduced TG absorption than DPP-4 inhibitors. They also can cause moderate decreases in TG and LDL-C, and increases in HDL-C levels. In an analysis of pooled data from 8 studies of exenatide once weekly, Blonde and colleagues found that patients who lost the most weight with exenatide (quartiles 1 and 2) experienced the greatest reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, and TGs, and the greatest increases in HDL-C. The first placebo-controlled, GLP-1 RA, CV safety trial with lixisenatide (Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome [ELIXA] trial) showed no specific ASCVD benefit (i.e. neutral effects).

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and lipid management in diabetes mellitus — persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D) without ASCVD and with less than 2 traditional risk factors should be assessed with one of the ASCVD risk calculators to determine initiation and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy, and clinicians should assess nontraditional ASCVD risk factors beyond a lipid panel to guide management when the initial shared decision is not self-evident. Manage persons with prediabetes and persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the age of 40 in the same manner as those with T2D. In persons with high ASCVD risk, use a moderate-intensity statin regardless of DM type or status; in very high ASCVD risk (including family history of premature ASCVD in men < 55 y and women < 65 y), use a high-intensity statin regardless of baseline LDL-C level, and for extreme risk use a high-intensity statin plus other therapies as needed to achieve lipid targets. Treatment targets are specified by risk: high (LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, apolipoprotein B [apo B] < 90 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), very high (LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, apo B < 80 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), and extreme (LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, apo B < 70 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 90 mg/dL). Statins are recommended for the initial treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Monitor efficacy every 6 to 12 wk and increase the dose or intensity of statin as needed to achieve goals; once targets are achieved, lipid panel or apo B can be monitored less often. Combining the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe with a statin may be considered when the desired lipid targets are not achieved with a maximally tolerated statin dose; alternately add bempedoic acid or consider adding icosapent ethyl (in persons with triglycerides 135 to 499 mg/dL) for ASCVD risk reduction. Management of hypertriglyceridemia in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk should begin with intensive lifestyle modification and statin therapy; in those on a maximally tolerated statin who have triglyceride concentrations ≥ 200 mg/dL and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL, add a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acid to achieve the desired apo B or non-HDL-C goal, and icosapent ethyl can be considered in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk.

### Efficacy and safety of mitiglinide versus nateglinide in newly diagnose patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized double blind trial [^46a45dcb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This study was performed to examine the efficacy and safety of mitiglinide in type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM). Enrolled patients had received treatment with diet and exercise in the previous 3 months with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7–10%, and were randomized to receive mitiglinide (n = 111, 5–20 mg/meal) or nateglinide (n = 114,60–120 mg/meal) for 16 weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed by the changes in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial glucose (PBG) levels. The baseline HbA1c value was 8.2 and 8.3% in both groups. At the end of study, the reduction of HbA1c values from baseline by mitiglinide was slightly more than that by nateglinide (-1.11% vs. -0.76%), but not statically significant (p = 0.06). Final FBG and PBG were comparable for the two treatments. There were 2.8% subjects treated with nateglinide who had hypoglycaemic episodes, but none in the mitiglinide treatment group. The results indicate that mitiglinide and nateglinide had similar effects on FBG, PBG and HbA1c in T2DM patients after the 16-week treatments.

Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia — statins are first-line and intensity is matched to ASCVD risk with monitoring. Unless contraindicated, a statin should be used as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in persons with T2D. High-risk patients (T2D with < 10% 10-year risk) should be started on moderate-intensity statin therapy, which results in an LDL-C reduction in the range of 30% to 40%. For persons at very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) and extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk), high-intensity statin therapy, which lowers LDL-C by > 50% to 60%, should be started regardless of baseline LDL-C level. Lipids should initially be monitored at 6- to 12-week intervals and then at less frequent intervals (eg, 6 months) once at goal.

Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

In our study, the administration of DA-1229 (5 mg) once daily significantly reduced the mean HbA1c by 0.57% compared with the placebo in Korean subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus after 12 weeks of treatment (Figure 2). This degree of HbA1c reduction by DA-1229 was comparable to other DPP-IV inhibitors–. In a phase II trial involving sitagliptin (100 mg daily), the mean HbA1c was significantly reduced by approximately 0.55% compared with the placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. In a 12-week phase II trial of vildagliptin (100 mg daily), a 0.53% reduction in the mean HbA1c after 12 weeks of treatment was observed. The significant HbA1c-lowering effect of DA-1229 was supported by a large proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), lower FPG and GA levels (Table 3) and decreased post-OGTT glucose AUC 0–2h results compared with the placebo group (Table 4). These effects were the greatest in subjects who received 5 mg of DA-1229; therefore, the optimal dose for this drug in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients should be 5 mg.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^901a66c9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### The use of lipid-lowering therapy and effects of antihyperglycaemic therapy on lipids in subjects with type 2 diabetes with or without cardiovascular disease: a pooled analysis of data from eleven randomized trials with insulin glargine 100 U / mL [^187aba3d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dyslipidaemia is a major contributor to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to characterize the extent of lipid-lowering therapy use and its impact on lipid and glycaemic outcomes in people with T2D uncontrolled on oral agents who were enrolled in insulin glargine 100 units/mL (Gla-100) randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

A post hoc patient-level pooled analysis of eleven RCTs (≥ 24 weeks' duration) comparing Gla-100 (± oral antidiabetes drugs [OADs]) with OADs alone in people with T2D was performed. Baseline and Week 24 or study endpoint lipid status (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] and triglycerides) and indices of glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) were examined in patient groups according to treatment received and CVD status. Lipid-lowering therapy was provided at the discretion of physicians at baseline and throughout the studies.

Results

Of the 4768 participants included in the analysis, 41% (n = 1940) received lipid-lowering therapy. Only 51% of participants with CVD (1885/3672) were treated with lipid-lowering therapy; these participants had significantly lower levels of LDL-C, HDL-C and non-HDL-C, and higher levels of triglycerides versus patients not treated with lipid-lowering therapy at baseline and study endpoint (P < 0.001 for all). Antihyperglycaemia therapy resulted in decreases in glycosylated haemoglobin (-1.4 to -1.6%) and FPG (-68.9 to -75.3 mg/dL) at Week 24. Furthermore, slight improvements in non-HDL-C (-3.9 to -9.1 mg/dL) and triglyceride levels (-25.8 to -51.2 mg/dL) were observed. Similar changes were seen irrespective of lipid-lowering therapy or CVD status.

Conclusions

In a T2D cohort included in Gla-100 clinical studies, many participants with T2D and CVD did not receive lipid-lowering therapy, and for most categories of lipid the levels were outside the optimal range. Even in patients treated with antihyperglycaemic therapy but not lipid-lowering therapy, there were modest improvements in non-HDL-C and triglyceride levels in all participants with T2D and CVD. There is a need for increased implementation of guideline recommendations such as American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association for the management of dyslipidaemia in patients with T2D.

### Lipid effects of glyburide / metformin tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia in an open-label extension study [^5e3f9e7c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Because both type 2 diabetes and elevated plasma lipid levels are important independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease, the choice of an antihyperglycemic agent for patients with type 2 diabetes — in whom abnormal plasma lipid levels are often seen-should take into account effects on lipids as well as on markers of glycemic control.

Objective

This study assessed the effects on lipid levels of glyburide/metformin tablets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in a group of patients who had poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at baseline.

Methods

This 52-week, open-label study was an extension of a 32-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The patient population was drawn from 3 groups: those who completed the double-blind study, those who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and those who were ineligible for the double-blind study based on predefined measures of glycemic control (screening fasting plasma glucose > 240 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≤ 12%, or HbA1c 11%-12%) and were directly enrolled in the open-label extension study. Patients with an HbA1c of < 9% received glyburide/ metformin tablets 1.25 mg/250 mg BID; those with an HbA1c ≥ 9% received glyburide/ metformin tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg BID. Changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were assessed for 52 weeks.

Results

The study population included 828 patients: 515 who completed the double-blind study, 138 who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and 175 who were enrolled directly. Direct enrollees had poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at baseline. Improvements in plasma lipid levels were seen as early as week 13. At week 52, the mean change in TC from baseline was -8.0 mg/dL for the total population (95% CI, -10.9 to -5.2; P < 0.05) and -23.2 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI, -30.1 to -16.4; P < 0.05). The mean decrease in LDL-C from baseline for the total population was 2.86 mg/dL (95% CI, -5.3 to -0.4; P < 0.05), compared with a reduction of 13.3 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI, -18.5 to -8.1; P < 0.05). Mean HDL-C levels were minimally affected. Mean TG levels decreased by 27.8 mg/dL for the entire population (95% CI, -42.9 to -12.8; P < 0.05) and by 99.7 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI, -152.5 to -46.8; P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In this open-label extension study, treatment with glyburide/ metformin tablets for type 2 diabetes had a durable, favorable effect on lipid levels, particularly in those with poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at baseline.

### Efficacy and safety profile of glimepiride in Mexican American patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^6666ff2c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Mexican Americans, the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, have a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus relative to the non-Hispanic white population. It is estimated that 10% of Mexican Americans ≥ 20 years of age have diabetes.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glimepiride, a long-acting sulfonylurea, as an adjunct to diet/exercise in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Mexican Americans with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level between 120 mg/dL and 225 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values between 8.0% and 10.5%, after ≥ 3 months of diet/exercise were enrolled. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (using the lowest available treatment assignment number when eligibility was established) to receive 14 weeks of glimepiride or matching placebo once daily with continued diet/exercise. The starting glimepiride dose was 1 mg, with titration to 2 mg and 4 mg for FPG levels > 120 mg/dL. The primary efficacy variable was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end point. Secondary efficacy variables were HbA(1c) response (rated as excellent, good, or marginal) and changes in FPG, fasting insulin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels from baseline to study end point. The tolerability of glimepiride in this study population was determined by evaluating adverse events, hypoglycemic episodes, and physical examination as well as laboratory findings. All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A per-protocol analysis also was conducted to support the primary efficacy analysis.

Results

Seventy patients were randomized to treatment with glimepiride (n = 48) or placebo ((n = 22). The glimepiride and placebo groups were similar with respect to mean (SE) age (48.4 [11.7] and 50.7 [10.0] years, respectively) and sex (56.3% [27/48] and 50.0% [11/22] were male, respectively). However, the glimepiride group had a higher mean body weight (83.3 [17.0] vs 76.3 [18.5] kg) and a significantly higher mean fasting insulin level (23.8 [17.7] vs 17.8 [19.7] microU/mL; P = 0.031). The mean (SE) HbA(1c) values at study end point were 7.8% (0.2%) and 9.9% (0.7%) in patients receiving glimepiride and placebo, respectively. The adjusted mean difference in HbA(1c) reduction from baseline to end point was statistically significant in favor of glimepiride (-1.8% [0.4%]; P < 0.001). More pronounced HbA(1c) impairment at baseline was associated with greater glimepiride-placebo differences in HbA(1c) reduction. Glimepiride-treated patients also achieved a significantly greater improvement in FPG, with an adjusted mean (SE) treatment difference of -46.7 (16.7) mg/dL (P = 0.007). Glimepiride did not appear to affect fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels but was associated with significantly greater mean increases in fasting insulin (10.2 vs -2.1 microU/mL; P = 0.002) and body weight (2.3 vs 2.1 kg; P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Glimepiride was well tolerated, with an adverse-event profile similar to that of placebo.

Conclusions

These results indicate that once-daily glimepiride plus diet/exercise was effective in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled with diet/exercise alone. It appeared to be well tolerated in the population studied. More weight gain was seen with glimepiride compared with placebo. Given the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Mexican Americans, further clinical studies of glimepiride and other glucose-lowering therapies are needed in this ethnic subset.

### Glucose-lowering effects and safety of DS-8500a, a G protein-coupled receptor 119 agonist, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase II study [^4b36d311]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

DS-8500a is a novel G protein-coupled receptor 119 agonist being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The study objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of DS-8500a in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In this double-blind, parallel-group, phase II study, 99 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive placebo, or DS-8500a 10mg or 75mg once daily for 28 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the 24-hour weighted mean glucose (WMG) from baseline (day -1) to day 28. Other endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, lipids, and safety.

Results

The 24-hour WMG decreased significantly after 28 days of treatment in the 10 mg and 75mg groups with placebo-subtracted least squares mean differences (95%CI) of -0.74 (-1.29 to -0.19)mmol/L and -1.05 (-1.59 to -0.50)mmol/L, respectively. Reductions in 24-hour WMG in both DS-8500a groups were observed on day 14 and were greater on day 28 than on day 14. The reductions in fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose were significantly greater in the 75mg DS-8500a group versus placebo. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides decreased significantly; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the 75mg group versus placebo. Both doses of DS-8500a were well tolerated without significant treatment-related adverse events, hypoglycemia, or discontinuations due to adverse events.

Conclusions

DS-8500a significantly improved glycemic control and lipids and was well tolerated over 28 days of administration in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Nateglinide provides tighter glycaemic control than glyburide in patients with type 2 diabetes with prevalent postprandial hyperglycaemia [^b428e16a]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Postprandial hyperglycaemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been linked to the development of cardiovascular disease. This study compared the effects of mealtime (thrice-daily) nateglinide with once-daily glyburide on postprandial glucose levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes and postprandial hyperglycaemia.

Methods

Patients with Type 2 diabetes aged ≥ 21 years with 2-h postprandial glucose levels ≥ 11.1 mmol/l, HbA(1c) of 6.5–8.5% (48–69 mmol/mol) and BMI of 22–30 kg/m² were randomized to 6 weeks' double-blind treatment with nateglinide 120 mg three times daily prior to meals, or glyburide 5 mg once daily before breakfast. The primary endpoint was the baseline-adjusted change in plasma glucose from preprandial (fasting plasma glucose) to 2-h postprandial glucose levels (2-h postprandial glucose excursion) at 6 weeks.

Results

Patients were randomized to nateglinide (n = 122) or glyburide (n = 110). The treatment groups were similar in terms of age, gender, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial glucose and HbA(1c). At endpoint, nateglinide recipients had significantly greater reductions than those receiving glyburide in both the 2-h (-2.4 vs. -1.6 mmol/l; P = 0.02) and 1-h (-1.7 vs. -0.9 mmol/l; P = 0.016) postprandial glucose excursions. Adverse events, most commonly symptomatic hypoglycaemia, were reported in 26% of recipients of glyburide and 22% of recipients of nateglinide. Episodes of suspected mild hypoglycaemia were reported in 24% of recipients of glyburide and 10% of recipients of nateglinide.

Conclusions

Nateglinide leads to greater reductions in postprandial glucose excursions and is associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia than glyburide in this selected population of patients with Type 2 diabetes.

ACP grading framework for evidence and recommendations using GRADE defines evidence certainty and recommendation strength categories as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect (the intervention "results in" the effect)". Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different (the intervention "probably results in" the effect)". Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect (the intervention "may result in" the effect)". Recommendation strength includes Strong (ACP recommends) when there is "Confidence that the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional (ACP suggests) when "Benefits probably outweigh the risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Weight loss, HbA1c reduction, and tolerability of cetilistat in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in obese diabetics: comparison with orlistat (xenical) [^ab868281]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was to determine the efficacy and safety of cetilistat and orlistat relative to placebo in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, on metformin. Following a 2-week run-in, patients were randomized to placebo, cetilistat (40, 80, or 120 mg three times daily), or orlistat 120 mg t.i.d., for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was absolute change in body weight from baseline. Secondary endpoints included other measures of obesity and glycemic control. Similar reductions in body weight were observed in patients receiving cetilistat 80 or 120 mg t.i.d. or 120 mg t.i.d. orlistat; these reductions were significant vs. placebo (3.85 kg, P = 0.01; 4.32 kg, P = 0.0002; 3.78 kg, P = 0.008). In the 40 mg t.i.d. and placebo groups, reductions were 2.94 kg, P = 0.958 and 2.86 kg, respectively. Statistically significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were noted. Cetilistat was well tolerated, and showed fewer discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) than in the placebo and orlistat groups. Discontinuation in the orlistat group was significantly worse than in the 120 mg cetilistat and placebo groups and was entirely due to gastrointestinal (GI) AEs. Treatment with cetilistat 80 or 120 mg t.i.d., or with orlistat 120 mg t.i.d., significantly reduced body weight and improved glycemic control relative to placebo in obese diabetic patients. Cetilistat was well tolerated with the number of discontinuations due to AEs being similar to placebo.

The study REWIND was published by Hertzel C Gerstein and colleagues in 2019 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the REWIND study, the trial question was: what is the role of dulaglutide in middle-aged and older patients with T2DM with either previous CVD or cardiovascular risk factors? In the REWIND study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the REWIND study, the population was: 9901 patients (4589 female, 5312 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 50 years with T2DM who had either a previous cardiovascular event or cardiovascular risk factors. The key exclusion criteria were eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²; cancer in the previous 5 years; severe hypoglycemia in the previous year, life expectancy < 1 year; coronary or cerebrovascular event within the previous 2 months; plans for revascularization. In the REWIND study, the interventions were: n = 4949 dulaglutide (weekly subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg) n = 4952 placebo (matching placebo). In the REWIND study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (12% vs. 13.4%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99). In the REWIND study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in myocardial infarction (4.5% vs. 4.7%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.79 to 1.15) Significant decrease in stroke (3.2% vs. 4.1%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) No significant difference in death from all causes (10.8% vs. 12%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.01). In the REWIND study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, serious gastrointestinal events, severe hypoglycemia, cancers, pancreatitis. significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse event during follow-up (47.4% vs. 34.1%). In the REWIND study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 50 years with T2DM who had either a previous cardiovascular event or cardiovascular risk factors, dulaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering therapy effectiveness (Table 10) — statins, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants: Typical LDL-C decline with statins by dose intensity is Low < 30%, Mod 30% to 45%, and High ≥ 50%; statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and potential adverse effects include myalgias, fatigue, a diabetogenic effect for both new onset T2D and increase in A1C, and rare rhabdomyolysis (1–4/10,000 per year). Ezetimibe 10 mg orally every day lowers LDL-C by 12% to 25% as mono-Rx and by 25% when added to statin through inhibition of intestinal and biliary cholesterol absorption; reported adverse effects include myalgias, fatigue, URI symptoms, and GI symptoms. Bile acid sequestrants reduce LDL-C 8% to 16% as mono-Rx via efficient binding of bile acids that lowers hepatic cholesterol and promotes LDL-R upregulation, with adverse effects including GI symptoms, constipation, and binding of other drugs.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^907a7cb0]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes — tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is recently approved by the FDA for improvement in glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes. A systematic analysis of several completed trials with a total of 6609 participants confirmed dose-dependent superiority on glycemic efficacy at 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly subcutaneous administration, with reduction in body weight versus placebo, GLP-1 RAs, and basal insulin. Tirzepatide was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events but no increase in risk of hypoglycemia, appears useful for those already on metformin therapy, and based on early data and ongoing trials (including a cardiovascular outcomes trial) additional clinical indications for weight loss and/or cardiovascular risk reduction may be sought.

### Efficacy of glimepiride / metformin combination versus glibenclamide / metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus [^868857e0]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of glimepiride/metformin combination versus glibenclamide/metformin for reaching glycemic control in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Patients and Methods

A randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial was performed in 152 uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients. Serum fasting and postprandial glucose, hemoglobin A1c (A1C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. After random allocation, all patients received two pills of glimepiride (1 mg)/metformin (500 mg) or glibenclamide (5 mg)/metformin (500 mg) po once a day. Dosage was increased to a maximum of four pills in order to reach the glycemic control goals (fasting glucose ≤ 7.2 mmol/l, postprandial glucose < 10.0 mmol/l, A1C < 7%, or an A1C ≥ 1% reduction). Statistical analyses were carried out using chi-square, ANOVA, or Student's t test. The protocol was approved by an ethics committee and met all requirements needed to perform research in human subjects; all patients gave written informed consent.

Results

Each study group included 76 patients. No significant differences in basal clinical and laboratory characteristics between groups were found. At the end of the study, A1C concentration was significantly lower in the glimepiride/metformin group (P = 0.025). A higher proportion of patients from the glimepiride group (44.6% vs. 26.8%, P < .05) reached the goal of A1C < 7% at 12 months of treatment. A higher proportion of hypoglycemic events were observed in the glibenclamide group (28.9% vs. 17.1%, P < .047).

Conclusion

Glimepiride/metformin demonstrated being more efficacious than glibenclamide/metformin at reaching the glycemic control goals with less hypoglycemic events in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^90a6ffad]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

In people with T2D, retatrutide (0.5 to 12 mg) led to substantial reductions in bodyweight and HbA1c compared to both placebo and dulaglutide 1.5 mg in a phase 2 trial. After 36 weeks, retatrutide resulted in HbA1c reduction up to –2.2% vs. −1.4% with dulaglutide and −0.3% with placebo and a bodyweight reduction of up to 16.9% with retatrutide vs. 2% with dulaglutide and 3% with placebo. The benefits of triple agonism extended also to MASLD – in a subgroup of 98 people, fat content normalised in approximately 90% of people receiving the highest retatrutide doses.

The safety profile of retatrutide was consistent with that of other incretin-based therapies. Transient and mostly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal symptoms were the most frequently reported AE and occurred more frequently with the 4 mg starting dose groups rather than the 2 mg starting dose groups. AE leading to drug discontinuation were observed in 16% of participants with the 12 mg dose, but the overall incidence of SAE was low (up to 6–8%).

A programme of phase 3 trials with retatrutide (TRIUMPH) is ongoing with an aim to assess the safety and efficacy of retatrutide in different populations living with obesity (OSA, T2D, established cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis). Another triple agonist (HM15211) is undergoing phase 1 clinical trials with no published data so far.

### A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II trial evaluating the optimal dose, efficacy and safety of LC 15–0444 in patients with type 2 diabetes [^a4a1dfc4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal dose, efficacy and safety of a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor, LC15-0444, in Korean subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated by diet and exercise.

Methods

This study was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter and parallel-group, dose-range finding study. We enrolled 145 patients (91 men and 54 women) with a median age of 53 years and a median body mass index of 25.1 kg/m(2). The median baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 8.1 mmol/l, the median HbA1c was 7.9% and the median time since the diagnosis of diabetes was 3 years. After 2 weeks of an exercise/diet programme followed by 2 weeks of a placebo period, the subjects were randomized to one of the four following groups for a 12-week active treatment period: placebo and 50, 100 or 200 mg of LC15-0444.

Results

All three doses of LC15-0444 significantly reduced the HbA1c from baseline compared to the placebo group (-0.06 vs. -0.98, -0.74 and -0.78% in the placebo and 50, 100 and 200 mg groups, respectively), without a significant difference between the doses. Subjects with a higher baseline HbA1c (≥ 8.5%) had a greater reduction in HbA1c. Insulin secretory function, as assessed using homeostasis model assessment-beta cell, C-peptide and the insulinogenic index, improved significantly with LC15-0444 treatment. Insulin sensitivity, as assessed using homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, also improved significantly after 12 weeks of treatment. The 50 and 200 mg groups had significantly reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 12 weeks compared to the placebo group. No dosage of LC15-0444 affected weight or waist circumference. The incidences of adverse events were similar in all study subjects.

Conclusions

LC15-0444 monotherapy (50 mg for 12 weeks) improved the HbA1c, FPG level, oral glucose tolerance test results, β-cell function and insulin sensitivity measures, and was well tolerated in Korean subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) — approvals and pivotal STEP trial outcomes for weight management: it is "approved at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg per week for glycemic control in adults with T2D", and "subcutaneous semaglutide at the higher dose of 2.4 mg/week has been approved for chronic weight management". In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week", "1.0 mg/week", and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Randomized dose ranging study of the reduction of fasting and postprandial glucose in type 2 diabetes by nateglinide (A-4166) [^bd058409]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This randomized crossover double-blind placebo-controlled study aimed to assess the efficacy of nateglinide (A-4166), a novel phenylalanine-derived insulin secretagogue, in type 2 diabetic subjects while fasting and 5 min before a standard meal.

Research Design and Methods

A single dose of nateglinide (60, 120, or 180 mg) or placebo was given to eight diet-treated overnight-fasted type 2 diabetic patients and to seven patients 5 min before a standard breakfast. Plasma glucose, radioimmunoassay insulin, and nateglinide were measured at baseline and for a further 180 min.

Results

The time-averaged 180-min postdose mean decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration was greater after nateglinide (1.8 mmol/l; 95% CI 1.5–2.0) than after placebo (0.7 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.3–1.2) (P < 0.001). Hypoglycemia did not develop in any of the subjects. Insulin concentrations increased 1.5-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold with the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg doses, respectively (P < 0.001), peaking approximately 30 min after the dose. Nateglinide concentrations peaked after approximately 30 min, decreasing to 21% of peak by 180 min. In the meal test, the mean increase (2.9 mmol/l, 2.3–3.6) in plasma glucose over 180 min after placebo was reduced by 1.8 mmol/l (P < 0.001) with the two higher doses of nateglinide.

Conclusions

A single dose of nateglinide administered to diet-treated type 2 diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia increased insulin secretion and reduced fasting glucose without hypoglycemia. Administered 5 min before a meal, nateglinide reduced the postprandial glucose excursion by 64%. With its rapid onset and short duration of action, nateglinide is a promising oral prandial therapy in type 2 diabetes.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Monotherapy

A total of 304 patients with type 2 diabetes already treated with sulfonylurea therapy participated in a 14-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of glimepiride monotherapy. Patients discontinued their sulfonylurea therapy then entered a 3-week placebo washout period followed by randomization into 1 of 4 treatment groups: placebo (n = 74), glimepiride 1 mg (n = 78), glimepiride 4 mg (n = 76), and glimepiride 8 mg (n = 76). All patients randomized to glimepiride started 1 mg daily. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg had blinded, forced titration of the glimepiride dose at weekly intervals, first to 4 mg and then to 8 mg, as long as the dose was tolerated, until the randomized dose was reached. Patients randomized to the 4 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 2. Patients randomized to the 8 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 3. Once the randomized dose level was reached, patients were to be maintained at that dose until Week 14. Approximately 66% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial compared to 81% of patients treated with glimepiride 1 mg and 92% of patients treated with glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg. Compared to placebo, treatment with glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, and 8 mg daily provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1Ccompared to placebo (Table 3).

A total of 249 patients who were treatment-naive or who had received limited treatment with antidiabetic therapy in the past were randomized to receive 22 weeks of treatment with either glimepiride (n = 123) or placebo (n = 126) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration trial. The starting dose of glimepiride was 1 mg daily and was titrated upward or downward at 2-week intervals to a goal FPG of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels for both FPG and PPG were analyzed in the laboratory. Following 10 weeks of dose adjustment, patients were maintained at their optimal dose (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 mg) for the remaining 12 weeks of the trial. Treatment with glimepiride provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1Cand FPG compared to placebo (Table 4).

### Efficacy and safety of saroglitazar in managing hypertriglyceridemia in type-2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^5682306f]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Saroglitazar is commonly used in India for managing hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of saroglitazar in hypertriglyceridemia.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for RCTs involving diabetes patients receiving saroglitazar in intervention arm, and placebo/lipid/diabetes medication in the control arm. Primary outcome was to evaluate change in serum triglyceride and HbA1c. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate changes in other lipid parameters, glycaemia and adverse effects. Analysis for lipid and glycaemic parameters were done separately for controls receiving anti-lipid medications (statins/fibrates) [active control group (ACG)] and those receiving placebo/diabetes medications [passive control group (PCG)].

Results

Following 12 weeks therapy, individuals receiving saroglitazar had significantly lower triglycerides when compared to PCG [MD -71.67 mg/dl (95% CI: -123.67 to -19.66 mg/dl); P < 0.01; I² = 91% (considerable heterogeneity); low certainty of evidence (LCE)], but not ACG [MD -37.38 mg/dl (95% CI: -84.55–9.79 mg/dl; P = 0.12; I² = 98% (considerable heterogeneity); LCE]. Individuals receiving saroglitazar had significantly lower fasting glucose when compared to PCG [MD -24.61 mg/dl (95% CI: -44.13 to -5.09 mg/dl); P = 0.01; I² = 65% (moderate heterogeneity); LCE], but not ACG [MD -13.5 mg/dl (95% CI: -33.1–6.10 mg/dl; P = 0.18; I² = 98% (considerable heterogeneity); LCE]. HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL-C, apolipoprotein-B and HDL-C were not significantly different among study groups. Creatinine was significantly higher in patients receiving saroglitazar as compared to controls [MD 0.12 mg/dl (95% CI: 0.04–0.21 mg/dl); P < 0.01; I² = 29% (low heterogeneity); high certainty of evidence].

Conclusion

This meta-analysis reinforces the excellent triglyceride lowering of saroglitazar, but highlights significant increase in creatinine.
