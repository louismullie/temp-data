## Question

latent syphilis treatment for PCN allegy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat latent syphilis in patients with a reported penicillin allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease stage definitions and the standard-of-care regimens. Then, I should verify the approach to penicillin allergy evaluation and when to pursue desensitization. Next, I will review evidence-based non-penicillin alternatives for early versus late latent disease and explicitly exclude ineffective agents. After that, I should consider HIV- and pregnancy-specific nuances. Finally, I need to confirm follow-up, serologic response criteria, and a practical decision pathway, correcting any misremembered details along the way with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and staging because latent syphilis is defined by positive serology in the absence of signs or symptoms and is subdivided into early latent (acquired within the prior 12 months) and late latent or unknown duration, which drives duration of therapy and follow-up, and I should not assume stage without correlating history, prior serologies, and exposures to minimize misclassification risk [^112dRLSz] [^1169wuyn].

> I need to check the gold-standard regimens in non-allergic patients so I can anchor the hierarchy: benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once for early latent and 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 weeks for late latent or unknown duration are standard first-line therapies, and I should verify that these remain preferred across CDC and WHO guidance before considering alternatives [^111vsdQS] [^113Ku1FZ] [^113P3tUe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "penicillin allergy", because more than 90% of labeled patients are not truly allergic after structured evaluation; low-risk histories can often undergo direct oral challenge in ambulatory settings, whereas moderate to high-risk cases benefit from skin testing with or without graded oral challenge, and this de-labeling pathway is safe, feasible, and cost-conscious in STI clinics and primary care settings [^111GwWn5] [^112tkjLN] [^115iTPKR] [^1122ipg2].

> Wait, let me verify the role of desensitization because in true IgE-mediated allergy, preserving penicillin is still ideal; major guidelines prioritize penicillin desensitization when feasible, especially for persons with HIV in whom adherence or follow-up is uncertain and in all pregnant patients, so I should emphasize desensitization as the preferred path whenever logistics allow [^116WKp7N] [^112VEVYs] [^116EvmZm] [^114JCYdP].

> Now, for early latent syphilis when desensitization is not possible, I will examine validated alternatives; doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days is consistently recommended, and I briefly thought it might be "200 mg twice daily", but I should correct that to 200 mg per day, typically given as 100 mg BID for 14 days, as per IUSTI and BASHH, with FDA SPL supporting doxycycline's use in penicillin-allergic adults, acknowledging observational rather than RCT-grade evidence for doxycycline in early infection [^114qCKhq] [^115NXvxA] [^115Qo82Z].

> But wait, what if doxycycline is not suitable; ceftriaxone 500–1000 mg IM/IV once daily for 10 days is an alternative endorsed in BASHH for early syphilis if there is no history of immediate anaphylaxis to penicillin, and although I initially recalled a 3% cross-reactivity, I should correct myself because modern data support very low cross-reactivity between penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins, and careful history plus shared decision-making is prudent here given the limited comparative data in latent infection specifically [^115NXvxA] [^116zLC6d].

> Let me consider the amoxicillin plus probenecid option mentioned; although penicillins are typically avoided in confirmed penicillin allergy, in contexts where the label is unverified or desensitization has rendered penicillin temporarily safe, some guidelines list amoxicillin 500 mg QID with probenecid 500 mg QID for 14 days in early syphilis as an alternative during shortages or when parenteral therapy is impractical, but this demands excellent adherence and careful allergy adjudication before selection [^115NXvxA].

> For late latent or unknown duration disease in patients who truly cannot receive penicillin, I should double-check durations; IUSTI recommends doxycycline 200 mg per day, usually 100 mg BID, for 21–28 days, whereas WHO recommends 30 days, and U.S. HIV OI guidance supports 28 days as an alternative in penicillin allergy, so recommending 28–30 days acknowledges this range while aligning with prevalent practice patterns and evidence limitations [^1178NBuh] [^1146B3vv] [^114u6JCc].

> Next, I should exclude agents with unacceptable resistance or inferiority signals; macrolides such as azithromycin are no longer recommended given widespread 23S rRNA mutations and documented failures despite older trials suggesting efficacy, and linezolid failed noninferiority with early termination for futility in a recent randomized trial, so both should be avoided for syphilis treatment despite in vitro activity or historical interest [^111EJaE2] [^111yFxsy] [^116LP7JM] [^111CvKZW].

> I will now examine HIV-specific considerations; diagnosis and stage-directed treatment do not change for latent syphilis solely due to HIV status, but the threshold for penicillin desensitization is lower when follow-up is uncertain, and closer serologic monitoring is reasonable, with routine CSF evaluation reserved for neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms rather than performed universally, aligning practice with current guidance while avoiding unnecessary procedures [^1169wuyn] [^116WKp7N] [^113wxPsD].

> I need to ensure pregnancy-specific cautions are explicit; tetracyclines including doxycycline are contraindicated in pregnancy, making penicillin desensitization followed by benzathine penicillin the required approach, and I should confirm for the reader that alternative oral regimens have not demonstrated reliable prevention of congenital syphilis in late infection, reinforcing the imperative to restore penicillin exposure in this setting [^115Qo82Z] [^113fBFEo] [^112VEVYs].

> Next, I should review follow-up because there is no test-of-cure; obtain a baseline non-treponemal titer and repeat at 6, 12, and often 24 months, aiming for a fourfold decline by 12 months in early infection and within a longer window for late infection, and if serologic failure occurs or titers rise, evaluate for reinfection or neurosyphilis and retreat per stage, with aqueous crystalline penicillin regimens for neurosyphilis when indicated and benzathine penicillin G weekly for three weeks used for latent retreatment failures [^112dRLSz] [^113T8LtR] [^114Ma81C].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis remains practical; the decision path is to reassess and risk-stratify the allergy, perform direct oral challenge or skin testing when appropriate to de-label, prioritize penicillin desensitization when the allergy is confirmed, use doxycycline for early latent at 100 mg twice daily for 14 days and for late latent at 100 mg twice daily for 28–30 days if penicillin cannot be given, consider ceftriaxone for early disease in carefully selected patients without anaphylaxis history, and maintain rigorous serologic follow-up to distinguish cure from reinfection, documenting each step for continuity of care [^111GwWn5] [^114qCKhq] [^1178NBuh] [^1146B3vv] [^115NXvxA].

> Final check and concise take-home: for latent syphilis with a confirmed penicillin allergy where desensitization is not feasible, early latent disease can be treated with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, while late latent or unknown duration disease warrants doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 28–30 days, with ceftriaxone considered for early disease in non-anaphylactic patients and azithromycin and linezolid avoided due to resistance and inferiority, coupled with baseline and 6-, 12-, and 24-month serologic monitoring to confirm response [^114qCKhq] [^1178NBuh] [^1146B3vv] [^115NXvxA] [^111EJaE2] [^116LP7JM] [^112dRLSz] [^113T8LtR].

For latent syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients, **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 28 days** is the preferred alternative for late latent or unknown-duration disease [^114u6JCc] [^1178NBuh]. Ceftriaxone **1–2 g IV/IM daily for 10–14 days** is an alternative if doxycycline is unsuitable and should be used with caution in severe penicillin allergy because of rare cross-reactivity [^notfound] [^116zLC6d]. Macrolides are **not recommended** due to resistance and treatment failures [^112fY4GB] [^111EJaE2]. Penicillin desensitization is reserved for pregnant patients or when alternatives are contraindicated [^112VEVYs] [^116EvmZm]. Monitor serologic response at 6, 12, and 24 months; retreat if a fourfold titer decline is not achieved by 12–24 months [^1178NBuh] [^113T8LtR].

## Recommended alternative regimens

### Doxycycline

- **Regimen**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 28 days [^1178NBuh] [^114u6JCc].
- **Efficacy**: High serologic response in late latent/unknown-duration syphilis [^1122DDJp] [^114u6JCc] [^1178NBuh].
- **Limitations**: Avoid in pregnancy and severe tetracycline allergy [^1126iYJ1].

---

### Ceftriaxone

- **Regimen**: 1–2 g IV/IM daily for 10–14 days [^112oswF8].
- **Efficacy**: Effective alternative; consider if doxycycline is unsuitable [^1178NBuh] [^112fY4GB].
- **Limitations**: Daily parenteral therapy; rare cross-reactivity in severe penicillin allergy [^1141u2Qz] [^116zLC6d].

---

## Not recommended alternatives

Avoid **macrolides (e.g. azithromycin)** due to resistance and treatment failures [^112fY4GB] [^111EJaE2], and **amoxicillin**, which has limited evidence and is not standard for latent syphilis [^114LzW3g] [^1178NBuh].

---

## Penicillin desensitization

Indications for penicillin desensitization include **pregnancy** or situations in which alternatives are contraindicated [^113fBFEo] [^112VEVYs]; the **process** involves controlled incremental dosing with close monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Serologic monitoring should include **RPR or VDRL** at **6, 12, and 24 months**; **treatment failure** should prompt retreatment if a fourfold titer decline is not achieved by 12–24 months [^1178NBuh] [^113T8LtR].

---

## Special considerations

**HIV-positive patients** should receive the same regimens with careful attention to adherence and follow-up; **pregnant patients** require desensitization and penicillin therapy [^116WKp7N] [^112VEVYs] [^113fBFEo].

---

Doxycycline is the **preferred alternative** for latent syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients, with ceftriaxone as a secondary option; avoid macrolides and amoxicillin, and use desensitization when indicated [^114u6JCc] [^1178NBuh] [^111EJaE2] [^116EvmZm].

### Syphilis [^1169wuyn]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Are there specific considerations for patients with HIV?

Syphilis and HIV infection often co-exist. Patients with syphilis should be screened for HIV and, if negative, offered pre-exposure prophylaxis. They should also be screened for gonorrhoea and chlamydia. HIV-positive patients have additional indications for CSF evaluation (see table 3). Otherwise, diagnosis and treatment are unchanged.

We surveyed infectious diseases consultants to determine how they manage syphilis when there are insufficient data to guide management or when guidelines cannot be followed because of a lack of available definitive diagnostic tests. Most providers did not have access to dark-field microscopy, which resulted in variation in the management of syphilis, especially for patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

### Azithromycin resistance in Treponema pallidum [^111EJaE2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Although the recommended treatment for syphilis is penicillin, azithromycin has been used as an alternative. We discuss azithromycin-related treatment failures and resistance in Treponema pallidum and propose ways to address the resulting clinical and public health challenges.

- **Recent findings**: Azithromycin treatment failures in syphilis were first noted in San Francisco in 2002 and result from an A→G mutation at position 2058 of the 23S rRNA gene of T. pallidum. This mutation confers resistance by preventing macrolide binding to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit, of which 23S rRNA is a structural component. Azithromycin resistance has also been identified in T. pallidum specimens from other parts of the United States, Ireland, and Canada, with the number of resistant specimens increasing over time. Treatment with azithromycin or other macrolides appears to be a risk factor for acquiring a resistant T. pallidum strain.

- **Summary**: Although T. pallidum remains sensitive to penicillin and certain other antibiotics, azithromycin resistance in T. pallidum has emerged and is increasing in the United States, Canada, and Ireland. This poses clinical and public health challenges and indicates a need for further antibiotic drug development and surveillance for resistance in T. pallidum. If azithromycin is used to treat syphilis, clinicians and public health practitioners should remain vigilant for treatment failures.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1122ipg2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically evaluating penicillin allergies, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing to penicillins and the required cephalosporin. This is to establish whether sensitization is to the β-lactam core or the side chain if a cephalosporin is required by a patient with a previous reaction.

Subsequent challenge testing should be obtained to exclude allergy or pursue desensitization if the patient is found to be allergic.

### 2020 European guideline on the management of syphilis [^116EvmZm]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

The 2020 European guideline on the management of syphilis provides detailed recommendations about medical management, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy for neurosyphilis, ocular, and auricular syphilis in HIV-negative patients. According to the IUSTI 2021 guidelines, it is recommended to offer penicillin desensitization and treatment with the first-line regimen to patients with a penicillin allergy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116WKp7N]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for syphilis, specifically in the context of antibiotic therapy for latent syphilis in HIV-positive individuals, the DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend offering penicillin desensitization and treatment with benzathine penicillin to patients with a penicillin allergy. This is particularly advised when compliance or follow-up cannot be ensured.

### WHO guidelines for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis) [^1146B3vv]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of syphilis, particularly in relation to antibiotic therapy for latent syphilis in HIV-negative individuals, the WHO 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 30 days. This recommendation applies when benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used, such as in cases of penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible, or when these antibiotics are not available.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1147h6yf]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

CDC 2021 guidelines provide specific recommendations for managing syphilis, particularly in patients with congenital syphilis. These guidelines advise against routine treatment for patients unlikely to have congenital syphilis. It is recommended to obtain serologic monitoring in infants with reactive non-treponemal tests to ensure that the test results return to negative. Administering benzathine penicillin G at a dosage of 50,000 units/kg as a single intramuscular injection should be considered, especially if follow-up is uncertain and the neonate has a reactive non-treponemal test.

### Clinical efficacy of cefixime for the treatment of early syphilis [^116xE5Dw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, open-label, non-comparative pilot study in men and women diagnosed with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. The detailed protocol of the study is available elsewhere.

- **Participants**: In brief, the study took place in five primary care HIV community clinics of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in California. Enrollment was conducted between September 2018 and January 2020. Eligible participants were 18 years of age or older, with clinically or laboratory-confirmed primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, with a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer ≥ 1:8 using the Arlington Scientific RPR test kit. HIV-infected individuals had a CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 350 cells/μL and had to be virologically suppressed (viral load < 200 copies/mL) during the past 6 months.

Patients were excluded if they: (1) had an allergy to cefixime or penicillin; (2) were pregnant or had a positive pregnancy test; (3) had a serofast RPR titer (prior titer ≥ 1:8 without a history of fourfold titer decline); (4) received antimicrobial therapy with activity against syphilis within the past 7 days, namely azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or other β-lactam antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin); or (5) had a medical condition or other factors that might affect their ability to follow the protocol.

- **Randomization and interventions**: Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either BPG 2.4 MU intramuscularly once or cefixime 400 mg, by mouth, twice daily for 10 days. For those assigned to the penicillin arm, the injection was administered on the day of enrollment.

### Amoxicillin and ceftriaxone as treatment alternatives to penicillin for maternal syphilis [^1126iYJ1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although ceftriaxone can be administered once a day, it requires daily hospital visits. Azithromycin is not recommended for use during pregnancy, and treatment failures for fetuses have been reported. Tetracyclines are contraindicated during pregnancy. Therefore, we used amoxicillin in accordance with guidelines for Japan.

One study reported the effect of probenecid during pregnancy on fetal outcomes. Because probenecid can cross the placental barrier, its use in pregnancy must follow careful consideration of anticipated benefits and possible hazards. Probenecid was prescribed to increase serum levels of penicillin. Amoxicillin monotherapy might be considered for treating maternal syphilis if an appropriate dose is given.

The World Health Organization estimates that 5.6 million doses of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin are needed annually to treat all syphilis cases, and 930,000 doses are needed to prevent all cases of congenital syphilis. In May 2016, the 69th World Health Assembly reported that benzathine penicillin had been in short supply for several years. Therefore, during shortages of penicillin, it is prudent to consider alternative treatment regimens.

In conclusion, amoxicillin and ceftriaxone should be considered as alternatives to penicillin for the treatment of maternal syphilis. Further studies evaluating the efficacy of amoxicillin and ceftriaxone are warranted.

### Analysis of serological treatment response to doxycycline versus benzathine penicillin in syphilis infections, a retrospective single-center study [^113Er14S]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Doxycycline is the second-line treatment of choice for infectious syphilis when treatment with penicillin G is not feasible. At the time of writing, difficulties in the penicillin supply chain make it necessary to evaluate and resort to antibiotic therapies which are currently considered a second-line choice. Moreover, systematic studies comparing the two treatments in affected patients are still few, and many do not consider late and indeterminate latent infections.

The objective of this study was to assess the differences in the serological response of the treatment of syphilis infections with benzathine penicillin compared with doxycycline. We built an in-house database with all patients diagnosed with syphilis infection from January 2010 to January 2020 in the STD Centre of the S. Orsola-Malpighi Polyclinic of the University of Bologna, located in the northeast of Italy. We recorded all the principal independent variables (demographic, social status, reinfection rate, HIV infections, comorbidities, sexual behaviors, and initial TPHA values) and dependent variables (RPR values). We then extrapolated all patients treated with doxycycline (100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for 14 days for infections diagnosed within the first year and a 28-day course for infections older than 1 year or undetermined). These were matched in a 1:1 ratio with a homogeneous group of patients treated with penicillin G (2.4 million units in a single dose intramuscularly for infections diagnosed within the first year and a cycle consisting of 2.4 million units administered in a single dose per week for 3 weeks for infection).

### Treatment of syphilis 2001: Nonpregnant adults [^111H7huC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). High credibility.

After a precipitous increase in the incidence of infectious syphilis in the United States during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the rate of new cases has declined so dramatically that a program initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to achieve elimination appears to stand a good chance of succeeding. In the fall of 2000, the CDC convened an advisory group to examine the recent medical literature regarding syphilis treatment. Published literature in peer-reviewed journals and abstracts from relevant scientific meetings that have appeared since the last STD Treatment Guidelines meeting in 1997 were reviewed. Where applicable, unpublished data from studies in progress were also discussed. Expert opinion was sought. Through all these efforts, it appears that the azalide azithromycin and the third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone should find more definitive roles in the treatment of syphilis. None will eclipse the continued primacy of penicillin for this purpose.

### An economic evaluation of direct oral penicillin challenge for de-labelling low-risk patients with a penicillin allergy label [^115iTPKR]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

After risk stratification, patients classified as 'high-risk' according to the BSACI referral criteria had an outcome letter sent to their general practitioner (GP) recommending onward referral to an allergy specialist. Patients deemed 'low-risk' were offered a direct penicillin challenge (DPC). This study offered two types of de-labelling:

- **Opportunistic de-labelling**: The administration of DPC occurred when the patient did not require antibiotics, meaning the intervention was primarily offered for de-labelling purposes. A 500 mg amoxicillin oral tablet was followed by 250 mg of amoxicillin twice daily for three days. There are currently no validated protocols regarding the dose and duration of DPC. The protocol used in this study was based on consensus within the research team at the time of funding acquisition and was adapted from specialist clinical practice.

- **Therapeutic de-labelling**: This method involved the exclusion of type-1 hypersensitivity using 500 mg of amoxicillin, followed by a full therapeutic course of amoxicillin or a penicillin-containing antibiotic, based on clinical indication for the treatment of infection.

Patients who underwent DPC were followed up until day 5 to assess for a delayed or non-immediate hypersensitivity reaction. On day 5, inpatients still on the ward underwent a direct clinical review; no patient was kept in the hospital solely due to the 5-day review. Those who had been discharged or underwent DPC in an elective setting were contacted via telephone. Any emergent or severe adverse events were fully evaluated by the study team. If deemed unrelated to the DPC, the patient was de-labelled; otherwise, the penicillin allergy label (PAL) was retained.

### Bashh UK guidelines for the management of syphilis 2024 [^115NXvxA]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2024). High credibility.

The BASHH 2024 guidelines provide recommendations for antibiotic therapy in the management of early syphilis, particularly for HIV-negative patients. They suggest the following options as alternative therapy:

- **Procaine penicillin G**: 600,000 units IM once daily for 10 days.

- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg PO BID for 14 days.

- **Ceftriaxone**: 500–1,000 mg IM or IV once daily for 10 days (if there is no anaphylaxis to penicillin).

- **Amoxycillin and probenecid**: Amoxycillin 500 mg PO QID plus probenecid 500 mg PO QID for 14 days.

### Single-dose azithromycin versus penicillin G benzathine for the treatment of early syphilis [^117S6cuT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pilot studies suggest that a single, 2-g oral dose of azithromycin may be an alternative to a 2.4-MU intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine in the prevention and treatment of syphilis. We evaluated the efficacy of treatment with azithromycin in a developing country.

- **Methods**: A total of 328 subjects, 25 with primary and 303 with high-titer latent syphilis (a titer of at least 1:8 on a rapid plasmin reagin [RPR] test), were recruited through screening of high-risk populations in Mbeya, Tanzania. They were randomly assigned to receive 2 g of azithromycin orally (163 subjects) or 2.4 million units of penicillin G benzathine intramuscularly (165 subjects). The primary outcome was treatment efficacy, defined serologically by a decline in the RPR titer of at least two dilutions by nine months after treatment, and by epithelialization of ulcers within one or two weeks in primary syphilis.

- **Results**: The average age of participants was 27.0 years; 235 (71.6 percent) were female, and 171 (52.1 percent) were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. Cure rates were 97.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 94.0 to 99.4) in the azithromycin group and 95.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 90.6 to 97.8) in the penicillin G benzathine group (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1.7 to 7.1 percent), achieving prespecified criteria for equivalence. Cure rates were also similar three and six months after treatment in the two groups and in all subgroups. Cure rates at three months were 59.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 51.8 to

### One dose versus three doses of benzathine penicillin G in early syphilis [^114qd8g4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Controversy persists regarding the appropriate duration of therapy with benzathine penicillin G in persons with early (i.e. primary, secondary, or early latent) syphilis (Treponema pallidum infection).

- **Methods**: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial, we assigned persons who had early syphilis, with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, to receive intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin G in a one-time dose of 2.4 million units or in doses of 2.4 million units administered at three successive weekly intervals. The primary endpoint was seroreversion to nonreactive status or a decrease in the rapid plasma reagin titer by two or more dilutions at six months, referred to here as a serologic response (noninferiority margin, 10 percentage points). A key secondary endpoint was a serologic response within subgroups defined according to HIV status, also assessed in a noninferiority analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 249 persons with early syphilis were enrolled. Most participants were men (97%), 62% were Black, and 153 (61%) were living with HIV infection. The distribution according to syphilis stage was 19% with primary syphilis, 47% with secondary syphilis, and 33% with early latent syphilis. The percentage of participants with a serologic response at six months was 76% (95% confidence interval, 68 to 82) in the single-dose group and 70% (95% CI, 61 to 77) in the three-dose group (difference, -6 percentage points; 90% CI, -15 to 3), indicating noninferiority. No clinical relapse or treatment failure occurred in either group.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111vsdQS]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of syphilis, specifically focusing on antibiotic therapy for latent syphilis in HIV-negative patients, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend administering benzathine penicillin G, 2,400,000 units IM, in a single dose for adult patients with early latent syphilis.

### Combination of amoxicillin 3000 mg and probenecid versus 1500 mg amoxicillin monotherapy for treating syphilis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus: An open-label, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^114LzW3g]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Amoxicillin plus probenecid is an alternative to intramuscular benzathine penicillin G for treating syphilis in the United Kingdom. Low-dose amoxicillin is an alternative treatment option used in Japan.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial between 31 August 2018 and 3 February 2022 to compare 1500 mg low-dose amoxicillin monotherapy with the combination of 3000 mg amoxicillin and probenecid (non-inferiority margin 10%). Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and syphilis were eligible. The primary outcome was the cumulative serological cure rate within 12 months post-treatment, measured using the manual rapid plasma reagin card test. Secondary outcomes included safety assessment.

- **Results**: A total of 112 participants were randomized into two groups. Serological cure rates within 12 months were 90.6% and 94.4% with the low-dose amoxicillin and combination regimens, respectively. Serological cure rates for early syphilis within 12 months were 93.5% and 97.9% with the low-dose amoxicillin and combination regimens, respectively. Non-inferiority of low-dose amoxicillin compared with amoxicillin plus probenecid overall and for early syphilis was not confirmed. No significant side effects were detected.

- **Conclusions**: This is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate a high efficacy of amoxicillin-based regimens for treating syphilis in patients with HIV infection, and the non-inferiority of low-dose amoxicillin compared with amoxicillin plus probenecid was not seen. Therefore, amoxicillin monotherapy's efficacy requires further investigation.

### Randomized multicenter trial for the validation of an easy-to-administer algorithm to define penicillin allergy status in sexually transmitted infection clinic outpatients [^111GwWn5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Approximately 15% of patients in sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics report penicillin allergies, complicating treatment for syphilis and gonorrhea. Nonetheless, more than 90% do not have a penicillin allergy when evaluated. We developed and validated an algorithm to define which patients reporting penicillin allergy can be safely treated at STI clinics with these drugs.

- **Methods**: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the feasibility and safety of penicillin allergy evaluations in STI clinics. Participants with reported penicillin allergy answered an expert-developed questionnaire to stratify risk. Low-risk participants underwent penicillin skin testing (PST) followed by an amoxicillin 250 mg challenge or a graded oral challenge (GOC)-amoxicillin 25 mg followed by 250 mg. Reactions were recorded, and participant and provider surveys were conducted.

- **Results**: Of the 284 participants, 72 (25.3%) were deemed high risk and were excluded. Of the 206 low-risk participants, 102 (49.5%) underwent PST without reactions, and 3 (3%) had mild reactions during the oral challenge. Of the 104 (50.5%) participants in the GOC, 95 (91.3%) completed challenges without reaction, 4 (4.2%) had mild symptoms after 25 mg, and 4 (4.2%) after 250-mg doses. Overall, 195 participants (94.7%) successfully completed the study, and 11 (5.3%) experienced mild symptoms. Of the 14 providers, 12 (85.7%) completed surveys, and 11 (93%) agreed on the safety and effectiveness of penicillin allergy assessment in STI clinics.

- **Conclusions**: An easy-to-administer risk-assessment questionnaire can safely identify patients for penicillin allergy assessments in STI clinics.

Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and twelve months. No clinical data guide interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion. Recommendations from European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO guidelines are considered.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of oral amoxicillin in pregnant women with active syphilis, Japan, 2010–2018 [^113RKrJo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We conducted a nationwide retrospective study in Japan to evaluate the effectiveness of oral amoxicillin or ampicillin as alternatives to injectable benzathine penicillin G for treating pregnant women with syphilis and preventing congenital syphilis (CS). We investigated 80 pregnant women with active syphilis treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin during 2010–2018. Overall, 21% (15/71) had pregnancies resulting in CS cases, and 3.8% (3/80) changed therapies because of side effects. Among 26 patients with early syphilis, no CS cases occurred, but among 45 with late syphilis, 15 (33%) CS cases occurred. Among 57 patients who started treatment > 60 days before delivery, 8 (14%) had CS pregnancy outcomes. We found oral amoxicillin potentially ineffective for preventing CS cases among pregnant women with late syphilis but potentially effective in those with early syphilis. Prospective studies are needed to definitively evaluate the efficacy of amoxicillin for the treatment of pregnant women with syphilis to prevent CS.

### Analysis of serological treatment response to doxycycline versus benzathine penicillin in syphilis infections, a retrospective single-center study [^114ck4ig]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Our analysis indicates similar rates of seronegativization progress in both groups within the first 12 months. However, a substantial difference emerged at the 24th month of follow-up between the group treated with doxycycline and the group treated with penicillin. The different outcomes in patients treated with late-stage (L.S.) syphilis may explain the healing rate differences between these two principal groups.

Our data slightly deviate from the literature concerning L.S. Patients experience lower rapid plasma reagin (RPR) seronegativization rates of L.S. when treated with doxycycline. The data show similar results between the two groups concerning early-stage (E.S.) response to treatment.

Moreover, our univariate model regression showed no confirmed differences, but there was a trend for patients who had reinfections of syphilis and were infected with HIV to fail RPR seronegativization and maintain a serofast state.

Finally, the study highlighted a tendency for patients with multiple reinfections to have slight difficulty in achieving an RPR response to therapy with doxycycline, although this was not statistically confirmable compared to penicillin.

The strength of our study lies in the use of a statistical method for attenuating bias between the two groups (propensity score) and the utilization of a single-center database built on medical records compiled by a small number of highly experienced doctors in venereal disease management. In addition, propensity score matching helps to overcome numerous confounding factors such as education levels, number of reinfections, HIV infection, and sexual behavior that could arise in such studies.

### Erythromycin [^116idGhQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Erythromycin is an alternate choice of treatment for primary syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients. In cases of syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum, spinal fluid examinations should be done before treatment and as part of follow-up after therapy.

Oral erythromycins are indicated in cases of intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Extraenteric amebiasis, however, requires treatment with other agents.

Erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP, followed by erythromycin base orally, is recommended as an alternative treatment for acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in female patients with a history of sensitivity to penicillin. Patients should undergo a serologic test for syphilis before receiving erythromycin as treatment for gonorrhea and a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after three months.

Erythromycins are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, such as conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections during pregnancy. When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin can treat uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults due to Chlamydia trachomatis.

Additionally, when tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.

Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila is also an indication for erythromycin treatment. However, it should be noted that although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and clinical experience suggests its potential effectiveness.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^113WjnNd]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

The exact rate of resensitization to penicillins is not known, with figures ranging widely among different studies from 0% to 27.9%. The variable resensitization rate in different studies can be attributed to diverse methodologies, relatively small sample sizes, and the failure to perform skin tests (STs) to confirm resensitization in some patients who experienced a suspected adverse reaction after initial negative STs. According to this evidence, there is no consensus on whether routine resensitization should be ruled out.

While several studies suggest that the resensitization phenomenon is rare, others indicate the necessity for skin retesting after drug provocation tests (DPT) to rule out resensitization. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the need for skin retesting in patients with suspected penicillin allergies who have negative allergy tests and to agree on its inclusion after completing the routine diagnostic workup.

The aim of our study was to determine the rate of resensitization in a group of patients with a suggestive reported allergic reaction to penicillins by repeating STs after an initial evaluation. We also aimed to analyze the potential factors associated with the resensitization phenomenon.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^117S9AQe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

For individuals with a documented penicillin allergy, desensitization followed by treatment with penicillin is recommended. The limited data available on alternative antibiotic agents suggests they should only be considered when treatment with penicillin is not possible or is absolutely contraindicated. In nonpregnant adults with penicillin allergy in whom desensitization is not possible, intramuscular ceftriaxone at 2 g per day for 10 to 14 days is an alternative. Ceftriaxone penetrates the CNS well and has been shown to have efficacy similar to that of penicillin in all stages of syphilis, although the data are restricted to observational studies.

Appropriate systemic syphilis therapy has been demonstrated to positively impact visual outcomes, as we proved in our cohort, with BCVA found to significantly improve for involved eyes after appropriate treatment and is often taken as an indication of a correct diagnosis.

- **Topical and periocular corticosteroids**: These play a crucial role in the treatment of ocular inflammation associated with syphilis, effectively managing syphilitic interstitial keratitis and anterior uveitis. Despite concerns about using systemic steroids in infectious uveitis, both oral and intravenous corticosteroids are appropriate adjunct treatments for posterior uveitis, scleritis, and optic neuritis, as extensively documented in uveitis management literature. In our study, oral corticosteroids were prescribed to almost one-fifth of patients, always initiated under antibiotic coverage for more than 48 hours. This approach aims to reduce dense vitreous haze.

### Amoxicillin and ceftriaxone as treatment alternatives to penicillin for maternal syphilis [^116pCbGX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 930,000 cases of maternal syphilis resulted in 350,000 cases of congenital syphilis. In Japan, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases reported that the number of patients with syphilis is increasing. As the incidence of syphilis in women increases in Japan, the incidence of congenital syphilis also rises. The efficacy of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis is well established by clinical experience and is the only treatment option with documented efficacy.

Both case-patients described in this report were given amoxicillin and probenecid. A pharmacokinetic study reported that oral amoxicillin and probenecid could attain treponemicidal concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid; therefore, these drugs were considered alternative agents for the treatment of neurosyphilis. Tanizaki et al. reported that treatment with oral amoxicillin (3 g) and probenecid (750 mg) was highly effective and well tolerated in syphilis patients with HIV infection. However, in their report, all patients were men.

For case-patient 2, we changed the treatment to ceftriaxone, which is active against T. pallidum and has an effective concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. Marra et al. reported that ceftriaxone is an alternative to penicillin for the treatment of neurosyphilis or early syphilis among HIV-infected patients. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend ceftriaxone as an alternative treatment for syphilis in nonpregnant women. However, data regarding the use of ceftriaxone for the treatment of maternal infections is limited.

### Treatment administered to newborns with congenital syphilis during a penicillin shortage in 2015, Fortaleza, Brazil [^1141yvbt]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Between 2014 and 2016, Brazil experienced a severe shortage in penicillin supply, resulting in a lack of treatment among some pregnant women and newborns with syphilis, as well as the use of non-evidence-based regimens. This study evaluated all live births in Fortaleza reported with congenital syphilis in 2015 to identify the different therapeutic regimens used in newborns during this period of penicillin shortage.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using manually extracted data from medical chart reviews of maternal and infant cases delivered in 2015 from all public maternity hospitals in the city of Fortaleza. Data collection occurred from June 2017 to July 2018.

- **Results**: A total of 575 congenital syphilis cases were reported to the municipality of Fortaleza during 2015, and 469 (81.5%) were analyzed. Of these, only 210 (44.8%) were treated with a nationally recommended treatment. As alternative therapeutic options, ceftriaxone was used in 65 (13.8%), cefazolin in 15 (3.2%), and a combination of more than one drug in 179 (38.2%). Newborns with serum VDRL titers ≥ 1:16 (p = 0.021), those who had some clinical manifestation at birth (p = 0.003), were born premature (p < 0.001), had low birth weight (p = 0.010), exhibited jaundice indicative of the need for phototherapy (p = 0.019), and had hepatomegaly (p = 0.045) were more likely to be treated with penicillin according to national treatment guidelines compared to newborns treated with other regimens.

- **Conclusion**: During the period of penicillin shortage in Fortaleza, less than half of the infants reported with congenital syphilis received the nationally recommended treatment.

### Oral linezolid compared with benzathine penicillin G for treatment of early syphilis in adults (Trep-AB study) in Spain: A prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^116zZ71z]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

We conducted a multicentre, prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial (The Trep-AB Study) at one STI unit in a public hospital and two STI community clinics in Catalonia, northeast Spain. Two of the three recruiting centres primarily serve men who have sex with men and transgender women, while the other centre serves both genders, albeit with a higher male attendance. This is because, in Spain, sexual and reproductive health care for women is typically managed by gynaecologists, rather than STI clinics. All patients diagnosed with early syphilis were assessed for possible inclusion in the study.

Eligible patients were adult individuals aged 18 years or older who met the International Union Against STIs Treatment Guidelines criteria for primary, secondary, or early-latent syphilis (full list available in the appendix, p. 2). Primary and secondary syphilis typically have distinct clinical features; however, in instances where patients exhibited both primary and secondary syphilis symptoms concurrently, they were categorized as having secondary syphilis. Participants with primary syphilis and a positive quantitative PCR (qPCR) test for T. pallidum were included, regardless of their baseline serological test results for syphilis. Participants with secondary and early-latent syphilis with positive results on both treponemal and non-treponemal serological tests were also included in the study, regardless of their qPCR result.

The main exclusion criteria were a known allergy to investigational medicinal products.

### Origins of syphilis and management in the immunocompetent patient: Facts and controversies [^114CN4GA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the continued efficacy of penicillin since the 1940s, many aspects of the natural history, diagnosis, and management of syphilis remain controversial. A key factor contributing to these controversies is the absence of a gold standard direct method for distinguishing between the different stages of syphilis and appraising treatment response. This contribution presents an overview of some of the most debated aspects of the origins, diagnosis, and management of syphilis in immunocompetent patients.

- **Hypotheses on origins**: The two main hypotheses on the origins of Treponema pallidum are the "Columbian" and the "Pre-Columbian" hypotheses. Strong evidence supports that Columbus' crew brought T. pallidum to Europe during the discovery of the New World.

- **Diagnosis**: Because T. pallidum culture and inoculation to animals are not readily available methods, the gold standard method for diagnosing syphilis is the direct identification of T. pallidum by dark field microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody tests. These methods, however, are inapplicable in many patients. Thus, the diagnosis of syphilis is usually based on the clinical and serologic picture. Serologic tests should only be considered as surrogate markers of the disease and do not provide definite distinction between syphilis stages. The optimal combination of serologic tests remains undefined.

- **Controversies**: Other areas of controversy include identifying patients who would benefit from a lumbar puncture, the diagnostic criteria of neurosyphilis, and the most relevant markers of treatment response.

### Analysis of serological treatment response to doxycycline versus benzathine penicillin in syphilis infections, a retrospective single-center study [^114nAy85]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The study retrieved a total of 1,681 patients from the database who had been affected by syphilis.

- **Group 1**: Consisted of 41 patients who met the inclusion criteria. They were further stratified into those who underwent 2-week courses of tetracyclines (totaling 24) and those treated with 4-week courses (numbering 17).

- **Group 2**: Included the same number of patients, divided evenly into two sub-groups. Selection criteria for Group 2 included homogeneity in age, sex, educational background, job type, stage of syphilis, HIV infection rate, TPHA serological values, and syphilis reinfection rate.

All characteristics of the two main groups were re-evaluated after matching and found not statistically significant, as detailed in Table 1.

We noted that 14 patients from each group were unable to complete the 24-month follow-up, and 3 of these were also unable to complete the 12-month follow-up.

- **Analysis Results**: The overall analysis of the main groups showed no significant differences. At 12 months, the penicillin group had a slightly higher proportion of healed patients compared to those treated with tetracyclines, but the difference was not statistically significant (26 vs. 22, p = 0.615) [Table 2]. By the end of the 24-month observation period, a slight, yet not significant, difference in seronegativization rates was observed, with a greater success rate in patients receiving penicillin compared to those with doxycycline (37 vs. 27, p = 0.14) [Table 2].

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy often receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

- **Objective**: To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

- **Methods**: A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline used a standard 2-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

- **Results**: Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after versus before guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, vs 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P < .5) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs 1.1%, P = 0.004), and fluoroquinolones (15.3% vs 3.3%, P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: The implementation of the guideline resulted in a significant change in prescribing patterns.

### Oral linezolid compared with benzathine penicillin G for treatment of early syphilis in adults (Trep-AB study) in Spain: a prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^116LP7JM]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In this RCT evaluating the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of syphilis, linezolid 600 mg per day for 5 days did not meet the prespecified non-inferiority criteria for the primary composite endpoint comprising clinical cure, serological cure, and absence of relapse. The overall response was 19 (70%) of 27 in the linezolid group and 28 (100%) of 28 in the BPG group, with a treatment difference of –29.6% (95% CI –50.5 to –8.8). The results of the interim analysis prompted the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to terminate the trial prematurely because of futility.

Previous in-vitro studies have shown activity of linezolid against T. pallidum. However, in this trial, the dosing of linezolid used (once per day) might have been too low, or the duration of the treatment course (5 days) might have been too short for effectively treating syphilis. Selecting an appropriate dose regimen for antibiotic repurposing is complex. Despite licensed regimens for linezolid in adults typically recommending 600 mg twice per day, we chose a once-per-day regimen of 600 mg in our study to simplify the regimen and potentially improve adherence. We expected this dosage to be effective based on initial pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic calculations, with fAUC24:MIC ratios used as predictors of efficacy in other bacteria. However, this approach to dose selection has limitations, as it relies on point estimates and might not account for patient-specific factors such as age, gender, weight, and individual variations in drug metabolism, which can influence linezolid efficacy.

### Oral linezolid compared with benzathine penicillin G for treatment of early syphilis in adults (Trep-AB study) in Spain: a prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^112fY4GB]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum that affects more than 50 million people worldwide. The incidence of syphilis has increased markedly in Europe and high-income countries since 2000, with the highest rise observed among men who have sex with men. Systemic dissemination of T. pallidum can lead to neurosyphilis through invasion of the CNS, whereas in pregnant women, mother-to-child transmission can cause fetal loss, stillbirth, and congenital infection in newborns, resulting in long-term sequelae.

- **Research in context**:

	- **Evidence before this study**: On July 1, 2023, we searched PubMed from inception for articles containing the terms "randomized controlled trial" or "phase III" and either "syphilis" or "T. pallidum" in the title or abstract. Our search retrieved 61 results since 1987, most of which investigated the effectiveness of screening strategies and other public health interventions. We found five trials investigating the efficacy of azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and enhanced regimens of benzathine penicillin G (BPG), one pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) on cefixime, one pilot RCT on amoxicillin (with or without probenecid), and observational studies on doxycycline. Early trials had demonstrated the efficacy of azithromycin, but a high prevalence of macrolide resistance (ranging from 67% to 100%) was reported in specimens from several studies globally between 2004 and 2020. Ceftriaxone showed efficacy similar to BPG in early syphilis, with limited evidence in neurosyphilis, but required a prolonged course.

To ensure patient safety, our patient-monitoring approach involved frequent checks for the rapid identification of treatment failure and the subsequent application of standard-of-care treatment, with follow-ups until complete cure. The follow-up period was of sufficient duration, initially set at 48 weeks and later extended to 96 weeks, to detect any relapse in enrolled patients. We conducted an interim analysis with a relatively small sample size of 50 patients and maintained rigorous oversight by the Clinical Trial Unit and Contract Research Organisation of the Fight Infectious Disease Foundation.

Both investigational medicinal products are marketed drugs supplied by the study sponsor. Linezolid was packaged with instructions inserted by the pharmacy service of the University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol.

At baseline, data on demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics were collected, including information on concomitant medications or recreational drug use. Participants underwent physical examination and clinical assessment of syphilis, which included a specific assessment for neurosyphilis conducted according to routine clinical practice. Laboratory assessments comprised serological tests for syphilis (chemiluminescence immunoassay and rapid plasma reagin [RPR]), and qPCR testing of swab samples and plasma. Swabs were collected from chancres in primary syphilis and oral or genital mucosal lesions in secondary syphilis (lesional swabs). For latent syphilis and secondary syphilis without mucosal lesions, swabs were taken from healthy oral mucosa (oral swabs).

### Safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation: A systematic review [^1157TKDX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 8–13% of pregnant patients report penicillin allergy. Penicillins and other beta-lactams are widely used in pregnancy but are often avoided in these patients, resulting in suboptimal therapy, antimicrobial resistance, higher costs, and increased morbidity for patients and neonates. True penicillin allergy is rare, and 95% of unverified penicillin allergies are delabelled upon evaluation. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and recommended for pregnant patients, few undergo assessment. Research on antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is accelerating, and this systematic review was undertaken to summarize this growing body of evidence for obstetric providers.

A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed ahead-of-print and non-Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted in collaboration with a medical information specialist. There were no restrictions on study language, date, or design.

All peer-reviewed studies of pregnant individuals reporting unverified penicillin allergy and undergoing penicillin allergy evaluation with ≥ 5 participants were included. Case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, and studies focusing on the desensitization of verified penicillin-allergic patients were excluded.

Title/abstract review, full-text review, and data extraction were completed independently by two authors. Conflicts were resolved by a third author. Studies were evaluated using validated quality assessment tools.

### Analysis of serological treatment response to doxycycline versus benzathine penicillin in syphilis infections, a retrospective single-center study [^1122DDJp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). High credibility.

The syphilis stages were classified as follows: a diagnosis of early syphilis (E.S.) (primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis) when the T. pallidum infection occurred within the previous year; latent syphilis (L.S.) included late syphilis with manifestations occurring more than one year, and even decades, after the initial infection; and undetermined syphilis, which refers to T. pallidum infection with reactive syphilis serologic findings but without clinical manifestations of the disease.

Cases diagnosed with E.S. or L.S. from January 2010 to January 2020 in our clinic were considered. All cases were tested with serological tests performed by our central laboratory, and an in-house database was built. Patients underwent serial re-evaluations with repeat serologies at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after the first diagnosis.

Patients' age, sex, sexual behaviors, infection, syphilis stage, number of reinfections, and TPHA were registered and used as independent variables. In view of the retrospective and anonymous nature of the study, data access was requested from our control and data management office.

Patients with newly positive TPHA but negative RPR in the first two visits (2 months) were excluded. The emergence of new clinical signs and symptoms after treatment, or a four-fold increase of RPR during the follow-up period, was considered reinfection and excluded.

Inclusion criteria for Group 1 were patients who had taken doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 14–28 days according to the stage (14 days for E.S. and 28 days for the other forms).

### Current controversies in the management of adult syphilis [^1126ef59]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical management of patients with syphilis is controversial. This article summarizes recent research on syphilis treatment efficacy and outcomes, based on a comprehensive systematic review of published literature, relevant abstracts, conference proceedings, technical reports, and guidelines. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for the treatment of syphilis. Although several studies have suggested that azithromycin may have clinical efficacy, macrolide resistance has been widely documented among strains of Treponema pallidum, and treatment failures have been reported. Ceftriaxone is effective for the treatment of syphilis when used in multiple-dose regimens.

- **HIV-infected patients**: Lumbar puncture should be performed for human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with syphilis of more than one year's duration and a serum nontreponemal test titer greater than or equal to 1:32, as well as for other patients for whom the clinical suspicion of neurosyphilis is high.

Newer laboratory tests for syphilis are undergoing extensive evaluation and may prove to be useful for future clinical care. American and European approaches to syphilis treatment are similar but vary across several parameters.

### Oral linezolid compared with benzathine penicillin G for treatment of early syphilis in adults (Trep-AB Study) in Spain: a prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^114ameNf]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, we included individuals with different stages of syphilis within a single trial. Syphilis stages might exhibit variations in the bacterial burden, replicative state, and invasion of immunologically privileged sites, which could lead to different clinical outcomes. Notably, the failure rate in secondary syphilis, the most disseminated stage of the infection, was higher than in other stages of syphilis. Close monitoring of failure rates by disease stage should be included in future studies.

Second, the study could not be masked because of the different administration routes of the compared treatments. This is particularly relevant for subjective assessments; however, the inclusion of quantifiable clinical variables (e.g. lesion healing) and laboratory results (i.e. serological cure and molecular cure) within the composite primary endpoint minimizes the risk of bias associated with unmasking.

Finally, the absence of female participants hinders the generalizability of our findings to the broader population. The absence of female participants is primarily caused by the substantial 9:1 male-to-female ratio in syphilis cases in Spain and the fact that female individuals typically receive care from gynecologists, with less frequent visits to STI clinics. This limitation underscores the need for more inclusive research to address the gender-specific aspects of syphilis, considering variations in manifestations (e.g. primary chancres going unnoticed in less visible areas in women) and diagnostic challenges.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often face the challenge of selecting appropriate antibiotics for patients with reported antibiotic allergies. In the case of penicillins, penicillin skin testing has excellent sensitivity for predicting serious allergic reactions. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is valuable for ruling out sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For antibiotics beyond beta-lactams, the patient's history is the most reliable tool for assessing the likelihood of a serious reaction upon further drug exposure.

- **Penicillins and cephalosporins**: The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is likely not greater than the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other antibiotic classes.

- **Suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy**: Desensitization therapy should be considered when the effectiveness of alternative antibiotics is uncertain. In treating serious infections, it is usually feasible to administer the preferred antibiotic safely, even with a history indicating a possible antibiotic allergy.

### Penicillin allergy testing with direct oral challenge in primary care [^112tkjLN]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Nearly 10% of the United States population has a reported penicillin allergy. However, many of these patients do not have a true IgE-mediated allergy and are exposed to alternative antibiotics with increased risks of adverse outcomes. This highlights the importance of penicillin allergy testing. Patients with very low-risk penicillin allergies can safely undergo direct oral challenge (DOC) with a therapeutic dose of amoxicillin without prior skin testing. This study sought to establish a protocol for DOC in a primary care setting and test its efficacy and safety.

- **Methods**: A standardized DOC protocol was developed at two primary care sites in Southeast Michigan. Forty-nine patients across the two sites were identified as having very low-risk penicillin allergies and underwent DOC. Follow-up phone calls were completed one week and six months following DOC.

- **Results**: All 49 patients had a negative DOC and successfully had their penicillin allergy delabeled from their electronic health record (EHR). No patients reported severe adverse reactions following DOC. All 22 patients who were successfully contacted six months after completing DOC reported willingness to take penicillin if prescribed in the future and believed they were no longer allergic to penicillin.

- **Conclusions**: The results suggest that DOC may be effectively and safely implemented in a primary care setting to delabel penicillin allergies in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies. This study may serve as a model to increase access to DOC for adults in rural settings or low-income patient populations with limited access to medical resources.

### A phase III equivalence trial of azithromycin versus benzathine penicillin for treatment of early syphilis [^111yFxsy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Syphilis remains an important source of morbidity worldwide. Long-acting penicillin is the only therapy currently recommended for syphilis in much of the world. Because of hesitation to use penicillin for fear of anaphylaxis, there is a need for an effective, well-tolerated alternative to penicillin for syphilis therapy.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted in clinics for the treatment of persons with sexually transmitted diseases. We compared serological cure rates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative persons with early syphilis treated with azithromycin at a dosage of 2.0 g administered orally as a single dose with cure rates for those treated with benzathine penicillin G at a dosage of 2.4 million units administered intramuscularly.

- **Results**: A total of 517 participants were enrolled in the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after 6 months of follow-up, serological cure was observed in 180 (77.6%) of 232 azithromycin recipients and 186 (78.5%) of 237 penicillin recipients (1-sided lower bound 95% confidence interval, 7.2%). Nonserious adverse events were more common among azithromycin recipients than they were among penicillin recipients (61.5% vs 46.3%), and such adverse events were accounted for, in large part, by self-limited gastrointestinal complaints.

- **Conclusions**: In this trial, the efficacy of azithromycin at a dosage of 2.0 g administered orally was equivalent to that of benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of early syphilis in persons without HIV infection.
