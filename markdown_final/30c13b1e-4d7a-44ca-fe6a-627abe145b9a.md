## Question

What is the role of benzodiazepines in reducing the severity of tetanus convulsions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of benzodiazepines in reducing the severity of tetanus convulsions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of tetanus and why benzodiazepines are mechanistically plausible. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines and reviews say about benzodiazepines as first-line therapy. Next, I will examine the comparative evidence between diazepam and alternatives, including midazolam and magnesium sulfate. After that, I need to check dosing strategies, escalation pathways, and safety considerations. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, severity-based algorithm and acknowledge evidence gaps and special populations like neonates and resource-limited settings.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: tetanus toxin blocks presynaptic GABA and glycine release in inhibitory interneurons, producing disinhibited motor neuron firing and stimulus-triggered spasms; benzodiazepines enhance postsynaptic GABA-A inhibition, which compensates for the lost presynaptic inhibition, making them mechanistically rational for spasm control [^113GfyrU].

> Wait, let me verify the hierarchy of evidence before I anchor on a claim: contemporary, high-credibility reviews consistently designate benzodiazepines as the cornerstone of spasm control in tetanus, with diazepam and midazolam as the principal agents; this is echoed in recent Lancet reviews and ICU practice summaries, which note that while head-to-head comparisons are lacking, both are widely used and effective when titrated appropriately [^115thb5E].

> I should confirm the comparative data, especially the older randomized evidence. The Cochrane review found that diazepam alone reduced in-hospital mortality compared with phenobarbital plus chlorpromazine in children, and was associated with a milder clinical course and shorter hospitalization; however, the authors cautioned about small samples and methodological limitations, so I need to be careful not to overstate certainty here [^112yWYme].

> Hold on, let's not conflate seizure control with spasm control. I initially thought to cite status epilepticus guidelines to support benzodiazepine efficacy, but wait, I should verify whether that translates to tetanus spasms. The pathophysiology differs, yet the clinical principle of rapid GABAergic enhancement applies; still, tetanus-specific evidence is thinner, so I will keep the citation cautious and note that SE data support the class's anticonvulsant properties without claiming direct equivalence in tetanus [^117Qu9bN] [^116dZkfU].

> Next, I should review dosing and escalation. High-credibility reviews describe starting with IV diazepam or midazolam boluses, escalating to continuous infusion, and often requiring high total daily doses of diazepam exceeding 1 mg/kg/day; if benzodiazepines are insufficient, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade is added with mechanical ventilation, and propofol or magnesium may be used as adjuncts, particularly for autonomic instability [^115thb5E].

> I need to check the role of magnesium sulfate because it often gets conflated with benzodiazepines. Magnesium is not a replacement for benzodiazepines; it is an adjunct that can reduce spasm frequency and mitigate autonomic storms, but randomized and meta-analytic data have not shown a mortality benefit versus diazepam, and it is best used alongside, not instead of, benzodiazepines in severe cases [^115QN61f] [^115thb5E].

> Let me consider special populations and settings. In neonatal tetanus, case series from resource-limited settings show that aggressive benzodiazepine-based regimens, sometimes combined with magnesium and phenobarbital, can be lifesaving even without mechanical ventilation; this reinforces that benzodiazepines remain foundational even when ICU resources are limited, though outcomes are better with ventilatory support when available [^115k7JFG] [^113JCuyV] [^116zbEEs].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring. Benzodiazepines carry risks of respiratory depression and oversedation, especially with high cumulative doses or renal impairment due to active metabolites; clinicians should anticipate airway compromise from laryngospasm, monitor closely, and escalate to tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation when indicated, balancing sedation depth against the need to protect the airway and prevent complications of prolonged immobility [^115thb5E].

> But wait, what if benzodiazepines fail to control spasms despite adequate dosing? Refractory cases warrant adding nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade and considering propofol or magnesium infusions; case reports and series document successful control with rocuronium or cisatracurium-based regimens combined with sedatives, and some centers have explored intrathecal baclofen in select refractory cases, though infection risk and specialized care requirements limit routine use [^112ioM2w] [^113n6Q7V] [^115thb5E].

> Let me synthesize a practical, severity-based approach while acknowledging evidence gaps: for mild disease, intermittent IV diazepam or midazolam with close observation may suffice; for moderate disease, continuous infusion with upward titration to effect is typical; for severe disease, anticipate early airway protection, add neuromuscular blockade, and use benzodiazepines as the sedative backbone with adjuncts like propofol or magnesium for autonomic control; throughout, ensure wound care, antitoxin, and antibiotics are addressed in parallel [^115thb5E] [^111Df2Sz].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line: benzodiazepines are the first-line pharmacotherapy for controlling tetanus convulsions because they restore inhibitory tone at GABA-A receptors and are consistently recommended by high-credibility sources; while head-to-head trials are limited, real-world and historical data support their effectiveness, and escalation to neuromuscular blockade and ventilatory support is standard when spasms are refractory or airway compromise threatens [^115thb5E] [^115thb5E] [^112yWYme].

---

Benzodiazepines are the **first-line therapy** for tetanus convulsions because they enhance GABAergic inhibition to reduce muscle spasms and rigidity [^115thb5E]. Diazepam and midazolam are most commonly used, with diazepam favored for its low cost and multiple routes, while midazolam offers rapid onset and short duration for titration [^115thb5E]. High doses, often exceeding 1 mg/kg/day of diazepam, are frequently required, and continuous infusion may be needed for severe cases [^115thb5E]. If benzodiazepines are insufficient, add neuromuscular blockade and mechanical ventilation [^115thb5E]; magnesium sulfate can be used as adjunctive therapy for spasms and autonomic instability, but benzodiazepines remain the cornerstone of spasm control [^115QN61f].

---

## Mechanism of action

Benzodiazepines act by **enhancing GABAergic inhibition** at GABA-A receptors, which counteracts the loss of inhibitory neurotransmission caused by tetanus toxin and thereby reduces muscle spasms and rigidity [^111ebGzi].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting benzodiazepine use

Multiple high-quality reviews and guidelines consistently recommend benzodiazepines as the **cornerstone of spasm control** in tetanus [^115thb5E]. Diazepam and midazolam are the most commonly used agents, with diazepam favored for its low cost and availability, while midazolam offers rapid onset and short duration, allowing for precise titration [^115thb5E].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Benzodiazepines effectively reduce the frequency and severity of tetanus convulsions, improving patient comfort and reducing complications such as respiratory failure and autonomic instability [^115thb5E]. However, **high doses are often required**, with diazepam frequently exceeding 1 mg/kg/day, and continuous infusion may be necessary in severe cases [^115thb5E].

---

## Comparison with other medications

Benzodiazepines are superior to other medications, such as barbiturates and phenothiazines, due to their combined anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative, and anxiolytic effects [^112yWYme]. Magnesium sulfate is sometimes used as adjunctive therapy, particularly for autonomic instability, but it does not replace benzodiazepines as the primary spasm control agent [^115QN61f].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used appropriately, but **respiratory depression** and sedation are common adverse effects, especially at high doses [^115thb5E]. Close monitoring of respiratory function is essential, and mechanical ventilation may be required in severe cases [^115thb5E].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines recommend benzodiazepines as the **first-line treatment** for tetanus convulsions, with diazepam or midazolam as preferred agents [^115thb5E]. Escalation to neuromuscular blockade and mechanical ventilation is recommended if benzodiazepines alone are insufficient to control spasms [^115thb5E].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their effectiveness, benzodiazepines have limitations, including the need for **high doses**, potential for respiratory depression, and limited availability in resource-poor settings [^115thb5E]. Additionally, there is a lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials comparing benzodiazepines with other medications, highlighting the need for further research [^116tqDgg].

Benzodiazepines are the **first-line therapy** for tetanus convulsions, effectively reducing muscle spasms and rigidity through GABAergic enhancement [^111ebGzi]. Diazepam and midazolam are the most commonly used agents, with high doses and continuous infusion often required in severe cases [^115thb5E]. If benzodiazepines are insufficient, escalation to neuromuscular blockade and mechanical ventilation is recommended [^115thb5E].

Background

Clinical management of the muscle spasms and rigidity of tetanus poses a difficult therapeutic problem to physicians everywhere, especially in resource poor countries. There are wide variations in therapeutic regimens commonly used in clinical practice due to uncertainties about effectiveness of conventional drugs. Diazepam compared to other drugs (eg phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine) may have advantages because of combined anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative and anxiolytic effects.

Objectives

To compare diazepam to other drugs in treating the muscle spasms and rigidity of tetanus in children and adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Group trials register (October 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2003), EMBASE (1980 to October 2003), LILACS (2003), CINAHL (October 2003), Science Citation Index, African Index Medicus, conference abstracts and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers, experts and organizations working in the field and used personal communication.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently identified eligible trials, assessed trial methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Method of generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation and blinding were unclear in both studies. A total of 134 children were allocated to three treatment groups comprising diazepam alone, phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine, or phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine and diazepam. Meta-analysis of in-hospital deaths indicates that children treated with diazepam alone had a better chance of survival than those treated with combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine (Relative Risk for death 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.86; Risk Difference -0.22; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). Giving diazepam alone, or supplementing conventional anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine) with diazepam, was reported in one study to be associated with a statistically significantly milder clinical course and shorter duration of hospitalization.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Although there is evidence that diazepam alone compared with combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine is more effective in treating tetanus, the small size, methodological limitations and lack of data on drug safety from available trials preclude definite conclusions to support change in current clinical practice. The application of the present evidence should be moderated by local needs and circumstances, pending the availability of more evidence. We recommend a large multicenter, randomized controlled trial which compares diazepam alone with combinations of other drugs (excluding diazepam).

Conclusion

The most important factor that determines the outcome in tetanus is undoubtedly the quality of supportive care and the rapidity of initiation of treatment after a diagnosis has been made. Rodrigo and colleagues' systematic narrative review on the pharmacological management of tetanus is a timely and exhaustive resource that will benefit clinicians, researchers and students, and will go a long way to ensuring that patients with tetanus get the benefit of optimal management and, hence, the best chance for intact survival.

### Current practice in the management of tetanus [^116tqDgg]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is an important problem to be tackled in patients with tetanus, since it may lead to a fatal outcome if not addressed adequately. Rodrigo and colleagues examine the current knowledge on the use of drugs for this purpose, including intravenous morphine, clonidine, labetalol and magnesium sulfate.

Several studies have looked into the route of administration of tetanus immunoglobulin and Rodrigo and colleagues review the role of intrathecal immunoglobulin in minute detail, and presents a bird's eye view of current thinking. The role of antibiotics is also focused on, and the advantages of using metronidazole over crystalline penicillin are clearly spelt out.

The evidence-based review by Rodrigo and colleagues was hampered by the varying scales used to classify the severity of tetanus in different studies, and the lack of firmly grounded evidence for use of time-tested therapeutic modalities, including benzodiazepines and antibiotics. The paucity of randomized controlled trials due to the rarity of the illness and the ethical concerns in withholding time-tested therapeutic modalities also came into sharp focus. Since the focus is now on the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus, the future will see a shift toward tetanus due to non-obstetric causes, including mass casualties. This includes iatrogenic causes, including surgery under non-sterile conditions, piercing of body parts, ritual scarification and injections by drug abusers. The excessive use of muscle relaxants by physicians not adequately adept in their use is likely to result in an unfortunate increase in morbidity and mortality as well.

Airway Management

Across all settings, around 50% of adults with generalised tetanus require MV. – Though many patients on first presentation have a small oxygen requirement and difficulty clearing secretions, the primary indication for MV is protecting the airway from fulminant obstruction precipitated by laryngeal spasm. MV is generally recommended for all Ablett III/IV cases. Where available, primary tracheostomy is preferred, as prolonged endotracheal intubation carries increased risks of subglottic tracheal stenosis and vocal cord immobility. Percutaneous tracheostomy is preferred in some settings to minimise spasms provoked by operating theatre transfer. Maintaining consistent access to primary tracheostomy, particularly out of hours, may be challenging. In our experience, fostering strong relationships with Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeons and intensivists ensures that patients access timely, optimal ventilatory support.

Control of Muscle Spasms

Benzodiazepines are the cornerstone of spasm control. Both diazepam and midazolam are widely used, but have never been compared head-to-head. Diazepam is cheaper, and can be administered by various routes, but its long-acting metabolites can persist for days, conveying greater risks of respiratory depression, especially in patients with renal impairment. High doses, often > 1mg/kg/day of diazepam, are usually required. Protocols vary, but many escalate from initial IV boluses to continuous infusion, before switching to midazolam.

If benzodiazepines prove inadequate for control, most guidelines advocate for neuromuscular blockade (NMB). As these agents cause paralysis, they are only safe in ventilated, sedated patients. No single NMB agent is optimal; vecuronium, pipecuronium and rocuronium, being cardiovascularly inert, are generally preferred where available. Propofol is occasionally used as an adjunct for sedation and spasm control. IV magnesium sulphate is discussed below.

Other drugs including barbiturates, phenothiazines, and dantrolene sodium, are rarely used unless first-line medications are unavailable. Intrathecal baclofen has been used for refractory spasms, but is not widely practised given procedural risks and mortality concerns.

### Successful management of neonatal tetanus with autonomic manifestations at a referral hospital in Nigeria: a case report [^115k7JFG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case demonstrates that neonatal tetanus with autonomic dysfunction can survive in resource-limited settings without access to advanced neonatal intensive care. The successful use of magnesium sulfate alongside diazepam and phenobarbitone demonstrates a viable alternative for managing spasms and autonomic instability when mechanical ventilation is unavailable. Effective supportive care, timely use of antitetanus serum, and appropriate antibiotics like metronidazole, also played critical roles in recovery. This case reinforces the critical importance of maternal tetanus immunization and safe cord care practices in preventing this avoidable yet often fatal disease.

### Current practice in the management of tetanus [^116NHSHu]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The past three decades have seen a marked reduction in the global burden of tetanus, and following the campaign directed at elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus, the World Health Organization estimates that 58,000 newborns died in 2010, a 93% reduction from the situation in the late 1980s. Several countries have successful immunization programs in place, but tetanus still continues to be an important, though hugely preventable, cause of mortality in several regions in the developing world. Although tetanus toxoid was first used extensively in the Second World War, the types of wounds leading to tetanus have shown a recent trend to be less severe and often trivial, possibly because more serious wounds are generally given more expeditious and thorough medical attention.

The best chance of saving lives is by timely diagnosis and impeccable management of tetanus cases, which is a tough ask when physicians may not have experienced cases during their period of training. The issue is compounded by the fact that the diagnosis of tetanus is entirely clinical, with hardly any role for investigative modalities. Moreover, the management of tetanus is a challenge even for most physicians experienced in the care of such patients, and novices and old hands alike should be supported by having access to current recommendations and evidence-based therapeutic strategies.

The principles of management of tetanus include sedation and control of muscle spasms, neutralization of tetanus toxin, prevention of production of tetanus toxin by use of antibiotics to which Clostridium tetani is susceptible and by wound debridement, treatment of complications, including autonomic dysfunction, and supportive care.

The improvement of facilities in ICUs has led to a shift towards deep sedation, total paralysis and ventilator support in patients with severe tetanus. This has, however, resulted in a paradoxical increase in ventilator- associated complications, and renewed interest in sedation and control of muscle spasms by newer and often experimental pharmacological agents. Moreover, facilities for ventilator support are often limited in the very same parts of the world where tetanus is still a bane to contend with.

The narrative review of Rodrigo and colleagues takes a close look at the current evidence base for the use of newer agents for control of muscle spasms, including intravenous magnesium sulfate, intrathecal baclofen, dantrolene and botulinum toxin. The main stumbling blocks preventing widespread use of intrathecal baclofen were found to be the expensive intrathecal drug delivery system, the chance for infection and the need for specialized care in an ICU, due to its propensity to cause cardiorespiratory instability.

### Efficacy of concomitant use of dexmedetomidine and propofol in tetanus [^114RgJvy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Tetanus is an infectious disease caused by Clostridium tetani, which manifests systemic convulsion and autonomic instability associated with high case fatality. Despite proper medical intervention, management of those symptoms is often difficult. We report a case of 67-year-old man with tetanus in which a concomitant use of dexmedetomidine, an adrenaline α-2 receptor agonist, and propofol, a GABA(A) receptor binding agent, was successful in the management of systemic convulsion and autonomic instability without necessitating conventional anticonvulsant, neuromuscular blocking agents, or tracheostomy.

---

### Current practice in the management of tetanus [^114b9ZWR]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is still a scourge among the under-privileged populations of the world, and unfortunately remains an important cause of death although a cheap, safe and highly efficacious vaccine is available. The rarity of the disease in some parts of the world results in newly trained physicians being unable to make a clinical diagnosis, and hampers the conduct of adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Several new and experimental pharmacological agents are being used to control the spasms in tetanus, and to combat the autonomic instability that occurs in the disease. New evidence is emerging regarding the use of antibiotics and intrathecal immunoglobulin in tetanus. It is imperative, therefore, that all physicians working in critical care should be aware of the current advances and evidence-based guidelines for management of tetanus in order to achieve the best outcomes, which Rodrigo and colleagues have reviewed in a recent issue of Critical Care.

### Toxin-related seizures [^111QypM4]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Toxin-related seizures result from an imbalance in the brain's equilibrium of excitation-inhibition. Fortunately, most toxin-related seizures respond to standard therapy using benzodiazepines. However, a few alterations in the standard approach are recommended to ensure optimal care and expedient termination of seizure activity. If 2 doses of a benzodiazepine do not terminate the seizure activity, a therapeutic dose of pyridoxine (5 g intravenously in an adult and 70 mg/kg intravenously in a child) should be considered. Phenytoin should be avoided because it is ineffective for many toxin-induced seizures and is potentially harmful when used to treat seizures induced by theophylline or cyclic antidepressants.

Tetanus is a rare disease caused by the exotoxins of Clostridium tetani. Higher mortality rates have been reported among the elderly and in the newborn. In this report of a tetanus case, the treatment and prognosis of contractions resistant to diazepam, midazolam, and atracurium infusion has been evaluated.

A 61-yr-old woman presented with severe tetanus. Her intensive care management was complicated by severe generalized tetanic spasms despite the use of propofol, midazolam, alfentanil, magnesium sulphate, and atracurium. We describe the management of this problem with a variable dose remifentanil infusion.

### A meta-analysis of magnesium for tetanus [^115QN61f]. Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled studies suggest that magnesium sulphate controls spasms in patients with established tetanus. We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials that compared magnesium sulphate with placebo or diazepam for the treatment of patients with tetanus. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase and the Cochrane clinical trials registry. Three studies met the inclusion criteria, containing 275 participants (199 male patients, 72.4%). Magnesium sulphate did not reduce mortality, relative risk (95% CI): vs placebo, 0.80 (0.41–1.58); vs diazepam, 1.11 (0.70–1.75). The data on duration of total intensive care unit stay, total hospital stay and the need for ventilatory support were conflicting and pooling of results could not be done due to methodological differences of individual trials. More controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium sulphate on reducing autonomic instability, spasms, duration of intensive care and hospital stays and the need for mechanical ventilation.

### Successful management of neonatal tetanus with autonomic manifestations at a referral hospital in Nigeria: a case report [^112J9f1B]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Resource-constrained settings continue to report high case fatality from neonatal tetanus, due to lack of equipped intensive care facilities and sophisticated management modalities like neuromuscular blockade and invasive ventilation. This high mortality has been reported especially in those with symptom onset within the first week of life and in our case symptoms started on the seventh day of life. Our patient presented with features of autonomic dysfunction (labile heart rate, tachypnea and high temperatures), which has been associated with high mortality in the presence of severe neonatal tetanus. In settings with adequate resources, when the use of benzodiazepines alone fails to control spasms in neonatal tetanus, neuromuscular blockage and ventilation are employed with good outcomes. By controlling spasms of the respiratory muscles, these interventions reduce the risk of mortality from respiratory muscle failure, a leading cause of death among newborns affected by tetanus. However, in the presented case, we has no access to mechanical ventilation, therefore, we used magnesium sulfate infusion alongside diazepam and phenobarbitone and achieved a positive outcome. Magnesium sulfate induces muscular relaxation, vasodilation and a reduction in heart rate, potentially helping to mitigate the autonomic dysfunction that occurs in neonatal tetanus.

### A day in the life of a Ugandan healthcare provider: managing neonatal tetanus [^111njrvA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Two days later, his persistent tonic–clonic seizures emerged, triggered by simple touches, lasting less than 1 minute each. This new development prompted a thought in Dr. Brian's mind. Combing through all the pertinent information from this case — an unsterile knife, an infected umbilical cord, delayed presentation, and now tactile-triggered seizures — led us to reconsider our diagnosis: neonatal tetanus, a condition I have never witnessed because of widespread vaccinations. Dr. Brian referred to the Uganda Clinical Guidelines for appropriate treatment because the condition is uncommon in Uganda, with fewer than 100 cases reported annually according to the WHO/United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund Joint Reporting Form on Immunization. We moved the infant to a dark room to reduce stimulation, tailored the antibiotic regimen for neonatal tetanus, including metronidazole, and started diazepam every 4 hours to control the spasms. Given the strong suspicion of tetanus, we administered tetanus immunoglobulin, a crucial step in his care. Upon this discovery, an overwhelming feeling of dismay spread across the entire treatment team because of the high morbidity and mortality.

The next few days were critical. Despite our best efforts, the infant continued to have seizures and spasms, and his face became puffy, indicating systemic involvement. His jaw locked, and tactile stimulation caused severe spasms, a classic sign of tetanus. The spasms became so intense that his body would arch backward in opisthotonus, a grim manifestation of the disease that I had only seen in medical books. We alternated between diazepam and phenobarbital every 3 hours, trying to find a balance that would ease his suffering. Oral rehydration was impossible because of his locked jaw and continued increased muscle tone. Saliva would seep out of his mouth and nose continuously, requiring suctioning every couple of minutes. Aspiration was a significant concern, but our clinic did not have the resources to place the patient on a ventilator. We considered transferring him to a hospital in Kampala, Uganda's capital, but ultimately decided against it because of the cost for the family and our hope for improvement in the coming days.

### Pharmacological management of tetanus: an evidence-based review [^112qCxnp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is becoming rarer in both industrialized and developing nations due to an effective vaccination program. In 2010, the World Health Organization estimated there was a 93% reduction in newborns dying from tetanus worldwide, compared to the situation in the late 1980s. Due to its rarity, many diagnostic delays occur as physicians may not consider the diagnosis until the manifestations become overt. Without timely diagnosis and proper treatment, severe tetanus is fatal (mortality is also influenced by the comorbidities of the patient). The principles of treating tetanus are: reducing muscle spasms, rigidity and autonomic instability (with ventilatory support when necessary); neutralization of tetanus toxin with human antitetanus immunoglobulin or equine antitetanus sera; wound debridement; and administration of antibiotics to eradicate locally proliferating bacteria at the wound site. It is difficult to conduct trials on different treatment modalities in tetanus due to both logistical and ethical reasons. However, it is imperative that physicians are aware of the best evidence-based treatment strategies currently available to improve the outcome of patients. This review concentrates on analyzing the current evidence on the pharmacological management of tetanus.

### Autonomic dysfunction in tetanus-what lessons can be learnt with specific reference to α-2 agonists? [^115sdDXu]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Severe tetanus is seen infrequently in the developed world, but often requires intensive care support. Mechanical ventilation with neuromuscular blockade and heavy sedation, good wound care and prompt administration of antitoxin are important. The management of autonomic dysfunction remains challenging. We measured serum catecholamine levels in a patient with severe tetanus in whom autonomic crises were a major and persistent feature, and investigated the impact of sedatives plus α₂-agonists on these levels. Serum adrenaline levels were elevated up to 100-fold with clinically observed crises, although noradrenaline levels were much more difficult to interpret. There was no appreciable difference in catecholamine levels following administration of α₂-agonists in the doses we used, although clonidine did allow easier control of crises with other agents. This case highlights some important lessons in the management of severe tetanus.

### Heart rate variability as an indicator of autonomic nervous system disturbance in tetanus [^111b2Zmv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Tetanus management followed a standard protocol previously described, consisting of antibiotics, and spasm control using benzodiazepines and pipecuronium. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction was managed principally with magnesium sulfate.

Electrocardiogram data were collected from bedside monitors (Datex; Datex Ohmeda Inc. GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) in supine undisturbed patients using VSCapture software. Electrocardiogram, physiological, and clinical data were collected over a 24-hour period. Heart rate variability features were extracted from noise-free 5-minute recordings at 6, 12 noon, and 6to prevent bias from HRV diurnal variation. Time domain variables measured were square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal-to-normal intervals (RMSSD) and SD of all normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Frequency domain variables were total power, high-frequency power (0.15–0.4 Hz), low-frequency power (0.05–0.15 Hz), low-frequency normalized units, high-frequency normalized units, and low- to high-frequency ratio. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.5.1 (R Corporation, Vienna, Austria). Data are presented as mean (SD). Heart rate variability was compared between two groups of tetanus severity using a linear mixed-effects model to correct for repeated measurements. A P -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Introduction

Tetanus is a devastating neurological infection that remains a major cause of global morbidity and mortality despite a widely available, highly-effective vaccine, and improved access to antitoxin and intensive care. It is caused by Clostridium tetani, a ubiquitous, spore-forming, Gram-positive obligate anaerobe. C. tetani produces a potent neurotoxin. Tetanus neuro-toxin (TeNT) is transported retrogradely to the central nervous system (CNS), where it blocks gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and glycine release from inhibitory interneurons. The resulting disinhibition provokes unopposed motor neuron activity, giving rise to the clinical hallmarks of tetanus: muscle spasms and rigidity. –

There are four forms of tetanus - neonatal, localised, cephalic, and generalised disease. All share core clinical features. Neonatal tetanus arises in the first 28 days of life; it carries a poor prognosis, and each case reflects an avoidable cascade of failed care, encompassing incomplete maternal vaccination, weak antenatal health systems, and unclean perinatal practices. It is closely intertwined with 'maternal' tetanus, which occurs in adolescent or adult women during pregnancy, or in the six weeks after miscarriage, stillbirth, termination or delivery. These topics are discussed in detail elsewhere. Localised tetanus, typically affecting a single, injured limb, has a favourable prognosis, but may generalise without prompt treatment. Cephalic tetanus, a variant of localised tetanus circumscribed to the head and neck, is characterised by trismus, dysphagia, and one or more cranial nerve palsies; diagnosis is often delayed and outcomes poor. Generalised tetanus manifests with widespread, painful spasms, trismus, and dysphagia. Patients with generalised disease frequently require mechanical ventilation (MV) and prolonged stays in an intensive care unit (ICU). In many high-burden settings, this level of care is unavailable or financially catastrophic.

### Changes in severe accidental tetanus mortality in the ICU during two decades in Brazil [^116qM9sX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tetanus is still a significant health hazard in developing countries, with high associated mortality.

Objective

Describe the management of patients with severe tetanus in intensive care units (ICUs), in two different periods.

Setting

ICUs of two general hospitals.

Design

Concurrent cohort study.

Methods

Follow-up of all patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of severe tetanus in the ICUs from October 1981 to March 2001. We collected data prospectively, regarding the site of injury, clinical features, frequent clinical and infectious complications, concomitant illnesses, and mortality. The patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment protocol used; before 1993 and after 1993.

Results

There were 126 patients in group 1 (93 males) with a mean age of 39.0 ± 18.8 years. There were 110 patients in group 2 (95 males) with a mean age of 48.4 ± 17.8 years. Incubation period, onset period, and symptomatic period were higher in group 2 (P ≤ 0.02). The duration of neuromuscular junction blockade, benzodiazepine administration, mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay were longer in group 2, P < 0.001. Infectious complications were more frequent in group 2 (P < 0.001). The mortality rate in group 1 was 36.5% and in group 2, 18.0% (P = 0.002). Mortality was directly associated with symptomatic period, acute renal failure cardiac arrest and hypotension, and inversely associated with onset period in the multivariate analyses.

Conclusions

The reduced mortality in severe accidental tetanus patients in group 2 is probably related to advances in ICU management, despite the higher incidence of infectious complications, which are probably related to the longer ICU stay.

### Human versus equine intramuscular antitoxin, with or without human intrathecal antitoxin, for the treatment of adults with tetanus: a 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled trial [^111Lvt6A]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Procedures

The trial followed the protocol used in a previously published pilot phase. For the intramuscular intervention, participants were randomly assigned to either equine intramuscular antitoxin (21 000 IU, Vien Vaccin & SPYT, Nha Trang, Vietnam) or human intramuscular antitoxin (3000 IU Tetagam P, CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany). The intramuscular treatment was omitted in patients who had received a therapeutic dose of intramuscular antitoxin at a previous hospital. At the time of the study, only equine intramuscular antitoxin was available for routine care in Vietnam. For the intrathecal intervention, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a sham procedure or 500 IU Tetagam P given by intrathecal injection.

Both intramuscular and intrathecal interventions were given as soon as possible after hospital admission, with the intramuscular injection given first. To preserve masking and to comply with Vietnamese regulations for equine antitoxin use, participants received subcutaneous test doses of 0.5 mL of both human and equine preparations before the main intramuscular allocation. For the intrathecal intervention, the sham procedure consisted of screening the patient from view, positioning them in the lateral decubitus position and placing a dressing over the lumbar area, identical to that used in the intrathecal group. Intrathecal antitoxin was given by lumbar puncture, performed with patients in the lateral decubitus position after, if necessary, bolus doses of intravenous benzodiazepines and fentanyl. Injections were performed using a 20-gauge spinal needle via a 0.2 μm filter after removal of 2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid. Both groups of patients remained in the supine position for 4 h after the intervention and were monitored regularly, including careful neurological examination at 1 h. Due to safety concerns, intrathecal injections were generally not performed between 0000 h and 0600 h.

Routine management was delivered by ICU staff according to the management protocol of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Briefly, this consisted of antibiotics, wound care, and symptomatic control. Spasm control utilises benzodiazepines, escalating to non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents (pipecuronium), and mechanical ventilation. Autonomic nervous system disturbance was treated with magnesium sulphate as a first-line intervention, adding calcium antagonists, fentanyl, or inotropes as indicated. Airway management was by initial tracheostomy. According to hospital policy, patients received a first dose of a tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine the day before hospital discharge with instructions about following doses and reminders at follow-up.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115hZuLs]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal — seizure risk management states that neurologists generally do not treat seizure risk prophylactically, the CGC did not come to consensus on management of seizure risk in patients experiencing benzodiazepine (BZD) withdrawal, and the CGC recommends that clinicians manage seizures and seizure risk according to current standards of care, which may differ across disciplines.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^117Qu9bN]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current evidence from four RCTs (1234 adult participants in total) indicates that benzodiazepines are effective for the management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults. All but one trial were judged at low risk of bias. In general, evidence from the four trials shows that IV and IM benzodiazepines are safe and effective as first-line treatment in the pre-hospital setting compared with placebo. One trial evaluating the IV administration of lorazepam, diazepam, and placebo shows that seizure cessation is higher in the lorazepam group and the diazepam group compared with the placebo group but with no statistically significant differences between the two benzodiazepines. The RAMPART trial by Silbergleit et al. reports a higher rate of seizure cessation among people treated with IM midazolam than among those treated with IV lorazepam but the time from active treatment to seizure cessation is reported to be shorter with IV lorazepam (2 min) than with IM midazolam (3 min); however, the time from paramedic arrival to drug administration is not taken into account and appears to be longer in the IV group (4.8 min) than the IM group (1.2 min), reflecting the longer time needed to establish IV access. When the total time from paramedic arrival to seizure cessation is taken into consideration, the difference between the two benzodiazepine groups is small.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^1143kuHY]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Current, limited evidence suggests that both 2 mg IV lorazepam and 5 mg IV diazepam administered by paramedics are more effective than placebo and 10 mg IM midazolam is non-inferior to 4 mg IV lorazepam. The addition of levetiracetam to clonazepam does not offer clear advantages over clonazepam alone. Large well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish which benzodiazepines are more effective and preferable for the first-line treatment of adults with convulsive status epilepticus. In particular, well-designed clinical trials in adults are needed to assess the use of IV lorazepam versus IV diazepam and to confirm the efficacy and safety of IM midazolam versus IV lorazepam. Future clinical trials comparing IM midazolam versus buccal or intranasal midazolam would provide useful information to inform the management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults, especially when IV access is not feasible. Future cost-effectiveness analyses will also be useful to guide health policy and more cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

Although definition of seizure cessation and of convulsive status epilepticus varied across the four included trials, our findings showed that, in general, benzodiazepines (i.e. lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam) were effective at stopping seizures in adults treated in the pre-hospital setting. In the only trial with an untreated placebo arm by Alldredge et al. convulsive status epilepticus was successfully terminated before arrival at the emergency department in 59.1%, of adults treated with 2 mg IV lorazepam, in 42.6% of those treated with 5 mg IV diazepam and in 21.1% of those who received placebo, with no significant difference between the two benzodiazepine treatments (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 4.4). The hazard ratio for the time between active treatment and seizure cessation was 2.94 (95% CI 1.41–5.88) for lorazepam versus placebo and 1.54 (95% CI 0.85–2.77) for lorazepam versus diazepam. In the RAMPART trial by Silbergleit et al. 10 mg IM midazolam was non-inferior to 4 mg IV lorazepam for achieving seizure cessation (73.9% vs 62.4% of participants, respectively and the median time from active treatment to cessation of convulsions was similar across treatment groups: 2 versus 3 min in the midazolam and lorazepam groups, respectively). In the trial by Navarro et al. the addition of 2.5 g IV levetiracetam to 1 mg clonazepam did not confer any clear benefits over 1 mg clonazepam plus IV placebo in terms of the proportion of participants with seizure cessation (73.2% vs 83.8% participants, respectively). The median time between active treatment and interruption of the convulsion was 3 versus 5 min in the levetiracetam + clonazepam group and the clonazepam + placebo group, respectively. In the study by Shaner et al. more participants treated with 100 mg/min IV phenobarbital plus 40 mg/min phenytoin achieved seizure cessation than those treated with 2 mg/min IV diazepam plus 40 mg/min phenytoin (72.2% participants vs 33.3%, respectively). The median time from active treatment to seizure cessation was shorter for the phenobarbital group than for the diazepam group (5.5 vs 15 min, respectively, p < 0.10).

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^111rvZK5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Halting toxin production

Surgical debridement is required to eradicate necrotic tissue that may harbour C. tetani, even for wounds that appear innocuous. Debridement serves the dual benefit of providing samples for microbiological testing. For inoperable wounds, scrupulous wound care is key. Enteral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics should be administered for 7–10 days. Few studies have compared metronidazole (an inexpensive drug with excellent anaerobic coverage) and penicillin (more widely available, but with higher risks of allergic reactions). The first open-label trial of these drugs, published in 1985, found a significantly lower risk of death in Indonesian patients who received metronidazole. However, 3 subsequent studies failed to corroborate any difference in mortality, length-of-stay, or need for MV. – Yen and colleagues did find a lower muscle relaxant requirement in the metronidazole group, which may reflect theoretical effects of penicillin on GABAergic neurotransmission. As such, the evidence base marginally favours metronidazole, but penicillin is an effective, well-tolerated alternative.

### Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children [^111JhcPX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a tonic-clonic convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and require urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. International consensus is that an anticonvulsant drug should be administered for any tonic-clonic convulsion that has been continuing for at least five minutes. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) are traditionally regarded as first-line drugs and phenobarbital, phenytoin and paraldehyde as second-line drugs. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and updated in 2008.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsant drugs used to treat any acute tonic-clonic convulsion of any duration, including established convulsive (tonic-clonic) status epilepticus in children who present to a hospital or emergency medical department.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (23 May 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 23 May 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 23 May 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (23 May 2017), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 23 May 2017).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing any anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion including convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

The review includes 18 randomised trials involving 2199 participants, and a range of drug treatment options, doses and routes of administration (rectal, buccal, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous). The studies vary by design, setting and population, both in terms of their ages and also in their clinical situation. We have made many comparisons of drugs and of routes of administration of drugs in this review; our key findings are as follows:(1) This review provides only low- to very low-quality evidence comparing buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam for the treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions (risk ratio (RR) for seizure cessation 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.38; 4 trials; 690 children). However, there is uncertainty about the effect and therefore insufficient evidence to support its use. There were no included studies which compare intranasal and buccal midazolam.(2) Buccal and intranasal anticonvulsants were shown to lead to similar rates of seizure cessation as intravenous anticonvulsants, e.g. intranasal lorazepam appears to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.13; 1 trial; 141 children; high-quality evidence) and intranasal midazolam was equivalent to intravenous diazepam (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; 2 trials; 122 children; moderate-quality evidence).(3) Intramuscular midazolam also showed a similar rate of seizure cessation to intravenous diazepam (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09; 2 trials; 105 children; low-quality evidence).(4) For intravenous routes of administration, lorazepam appears to be as effective as diazepam in stopping acute tonic clonic convulsions: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16; 3 trials; 414 children; low-quality evidence. Furthermore, we found no statistically significant or clinically important differences between intravenous midazolam and diazepam (RR for seizure cessation 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.21; 1 trial; 80 children; moderate-quality evidence) or intravenous midazolam and lorazepam (RR for seizure cessation 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; 1 trial; 80 children; moderate-quality evidence). In general, intravenously-administered anticonvulsants led to more rapid seizure cessation but this was usually compromised by the time taken to establish intravenous access.(5) There is limited evidence from a single trial to suggest that intranasal lorazepam may be more effective than intramuscular paraldehyde in stopping acute tonic-clonic convulsions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.52; 160 children; moderate-quality evidence).(6) Adverse side effects were observed and reported very infrequently in the included studies. Respiratory depression was the most common and most clinically relevant side effect and, where reported, the frequency of this adverse event was observed in 0% to up to 18% of children. None of the studies individually demonstrated any difference in the rates of respiratory depression between the different anticonvulsants or their different routes of administration; but when pooled, three studies (439 children) provided moderate-quality evidence that lorazepam was significantly associated with fewer occurrences of respiratory depression than diazepam (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93). Much of the evidence provided in this review is of mostly moderate to high quality. However, the quality of the evidence provided for some important outcomes is low to very low, particularly for comparisons of non-intravenous routes of drug administration. Low- to very low-quality evidence was provided where limited data and imprecise results were available for analysis, methodological inadequacies were present in some studies which may have introduced bias into the results, study settings were not applicable to wider clinical practice, and where inconsistency was present in some pooled analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not identified any new high-quality evidence on the efficacy or safety of an anticonvulsant in stopping an acute tonic-clonic convulsion that would inform clinical practice. There appears to be a very low risk of adverse events, specifically respiratory depression. Intravenous lorazepam and diazepam appear to be associated with similar rates of seizure cessation and respiratory depression. Although intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam lead to more rapid seizure cessation, the time taken to obtain intravenous access may undermine this effect. In the absence of intravenous access, buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam are therefore acceptable first-line anticonvulsants for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion that has lasted at least five minutes. There is no evidence provided by this review to support the use of intranasal midazolam or lorazepam as alternatives to buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^113zaaZV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2004 policy on critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with seizures in the emergency department. A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) In patients with a first generalized convulsive seizure who have returned to their baseline clinical status, should antiepileptic therapy be initiated in the emergency department to prevent additional seizures? (2) In patients with a first unprovoked seizure who have returned to their baseline clinical status in the emergency department, should the patient be admitted to the hospital to prevent adverse events? (3) In patients with a known seizure disorder in which resuming their antiepileptic medication in the emergency department is deemed appropriate, does the route of administration impact recurrence of seizures? (4) In emergency department patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus who continue to have seizures despite receiving optimal dosing of a benzodiazepine, which agent or agents should be administered next to terminate seizures? A literature search was performed, the evidence was graded, and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Tetanus-induced rhythmic seizures mimicking the clinical and electroencephalographic presentation of status epilepticus [^114nwgt9]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

We describe the case of a woman in her 60s admitted to the intensive care unit after a first generalised tonic-clonic seizure in the context of alcohol withdrawal. She was placed under invasive mechanical ventilation due to persistence of coma despite antiepileptic treatment. Despite continuous sedation with propofol, the frequency and intensity of seizure increased. Seizures were very similar to epileptic tonic-clonic seizures and were recorded with video and electroencephalogram (EEG). A diagnosis of tetanus was considered after a scalp wound was discovered. The patient's husband revealed that a trismus had appeared a few days before hospital admission after a head trauma. EEG showed a pattern of diffuse spikes, which disappeared after a cisatracurium bolus. The diagnosis of tetanus was later confirmed by cultures from wound samples. Therefore, severe tetanus can mimic both the clinical and EEG features of status epilepticus and could be added to the differential diagnosis of epilepsy.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^114B3wap]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most severe form of epilepsy and requires urgent treatment. We synthesised the current evidence on first-line treatments for controlling seizures in adults with convulsive status epilepticus before, or at, arrival at hospital.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing antiepileptic drugs offered to adults as first-line treatments. Major electronic databases were searched.

Results

Four RCTs (1234 adults) were included. None were conducted in the UK and none assessed the use of buccal or intranasal midazolam. Both intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam administered by paramedics were more effective than placebo and, notably, intramuscular midazolam was non-inferior to intravenous lorazepam. Overall, median time to seizure cessation from drug administration varied from 2 to 15 min. Rates of respiratory depression among participants receiving active treatments ranged from 6.4 to 10.6%. Mortality ranged from 2 to 7.6% in active treatment groups and 6.2 to 15.5% in control groups.

Conclusions

Intravenous and intramuscular benzodiazepines are safe and effective in this clinical context. Further research is needed to establish the most clinically and cost-effective first-line treatment and preferable mode of administration. Head-to-head trials comparing buccal versus intranasal midazolam versus rectal diazepam would provide useful information to inform the management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults, especially when intravenous or intramuscular access is not feasible. Approaches to improve adherence to clinical guidelines on the use of currently available benzodiazepines for the first-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus should also be considered.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^113mkntr]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of the World Health Organization's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus elimination campaign. However, deaths amongst children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C. tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm, leading to airway obstruction and respiratory arrest; nosocomial infections; and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis, but microbiological tests may serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected healthcare data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology; its clinical features and differential diagnosis; principles of management; and prognosis.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1122LkLf]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The spatula test, though sensitive and specific, is no longer recommended due to the risk of precipitating laryngospasm and airway obstruction. Wound imaging by CT may identify foreign bodies or gas locules. Neuro-imaging or lumbar puncture are usually unnecessary.

Supplementary tests (Table 2), can play a supportive role in diagnosis. The microbiological tests of choice are real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for C. tetani neurotoxin gene detection, and C. tetani culture. RT-PCR is usually favoured for its faster turnaround time and ability to confirm toxigenic, disease-causing strains. The optimal sample is tissue obtained at surgical debridement, transported in an anaerobic medium such as cooked meat broth. Quantitative serological testing for TeNT antibodies to evaluate pre-existing immunity in suspected tetanus was previously common, but cases have occurred in immunised patients despite 'protective' antibody titres. This test is therefore falling out of favour in countries such as the UK. If performed, it is crucial that serum samples be taken prior to immunoglobulin administration. All these tests are useful when positive in symptomatic patients, but, crucially, negative results cannot exclude tetanus. Unless advised to do so by an expert microbiologist, we would counsel against testing asymptomatic patients.

Management

Management is multifaceted and guided by disease severity. Although useful for early prognostication, the Ablett classification is confounded by subjective grading and patient comorbidities (e.g. concurrent bacterial infection). As such, clinicians should apply their clinical judgement and consider early ICU admission even for patients with 'mild' disease.

Core management principles include source control and antibiotic administration; neutralising unbound toxin; airway management; spasm control; managing dysautonomia; and high-quality supportive care. Importantly, natural infection does not confer immunity, so all patients who recover from tetanus require a full course of immunisation.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^114u773L]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The antiepileptic drug levetiracetam in combination with the benzodiazepine clonazepam appears to be safe but does not improve the rate of seizure cessation compared with clonazepam alone.

Overall, our findings are consistent with current clinical recommendations, which reflect the consensus of using benzodiazepines as the first-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus. It is worth noting, however, that despite the beneficial effects of benzodiazepines in the pre-hospital setting, a considerable proportion of participants who receive active treatment are still experiencing seizures on arrival at the hospital emergency department (from 16 to 67% of participants across trials).

Adverse events in terms of respiratory depression and mortality were generally low across trials with no statistically significant differences between treatment arms of individual trials.

A number of uncertainties have arisen from our findings. Buccal midazolam and rectal diazepam are currently recommended by NICE as first-line, pre-hospital treatment for people with prolonged or repeated seizures in the community as they can be administered immediately by trained carers in those at risk, without the need to wait for the paramedics to arrive. In the child population, buccal and intranasal midazolam have been reported to have similar efficacy for the early treatment of convulsive status epilepticus and the use of midazolam by non-IV route has been proposed as a favourable alternative to diazepam. We did not identify any trial in the literature assessing the use of buccal midazolam, rectal diazepam, or indeed intranasal midazolam, in the adult population. Head-to-head clinical trials comparing different benzodiazepines or different routes of administration would, therefore, be useful to inform clinical practice. In addition, it is currently unclear whether other doses of benzodiazepines than those used in the published trials would be effective and safe and future trials should consider addressing the question of optimal dosage of benzodiazepine use. Moreover, the appropriate level of training that paramedics should undertake to recognise and treat people with convulsive status epilepticus in the community has yet to be elucidated.

Further research is also needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments of convulsive status epilepticus. Future economic evaluations should aim at capturing the full cost of managing the convulsive epileptic episode to the time of discharge from the hospital.

### Neonatal tetanus in Vietnam: comprehensive intensive care support improves mortality [^116zbEEs]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

This was a retrospective study using outcome data from all cases of neonatal tetanus admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2014. Records for the 7 years after the introduction of the bundle (2008–2014) were compared with records from the 7 years before its implementation (but after mechanical ventilation was available). For comparison of case severity, sufficiently detailed data were available only from 2001 to 2003 and 2010 to 2012; thus, those two 3-year periods were compared.

A retrospective inspection of the hospital records of the 20 patients admitted between January 2010 and December 2012 was performed to obtain more details on the clinical features and severity of these cases. This period was chosen because it allowed time for the new management bundle to be implemented fully and included the period when magnesium sulfate was first introduced.

Before 2008, standard management of neonatal tetanus consisted of administering equine antitoxin, metronidazole, sedation, and benzodiazepines (usually intermittent intravenous diazepam) for spasm control, and if spasms persisted, mechanical ventilation and pipecuronium for muscle relaxation were added.

The new management bundle added the following to standard management (Table 1): (1) first-line therapy with midazolam infusion; (2) early intubation and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation; (3) invasive monitoring of blood pressure; (4) treatment of autonomic dysfunction with magnesium sulfate; and (5) broad-spectrum antibiotics for all infants. The indication for ventilation was cyanosis or spasms not controlled by at least two 0.15 mg/kg boluses of midazolam within 30 minutes. Autonomic dysfunction was diagnosed in the presence of persistent hypertension, tachycardia, or labile blood pressure.

All patient data were entered into a specially designed database and extracted for analysis. Frequencies (%) and medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) were used to describe the data. Comparisons between the 2 time periods (before and after introduction of the treatment bundle) for categorical and continuous variables were performed by using Fisher's exact test and the Mann–Whitney U test, respectively. All analyses were performed in SPSS version 19 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL). Any P value of < .05 was considered statistically significant.

This study was approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

### Narrative review: tetanus-a health threat after natural disasters in developing countries [^1124WFPs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Tetanus is an expected complication when disasters strike in developing countries, where tetanus immunization coverage is often low or nonexistent. Collapsing structures and swirling debris inflict numerous crush injuries, fractures, and serious wounds. Clostridium tetani infects wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, or saliva and releases neurotoxins that may cause fatal disease. Clusters of infections have recently occurred after tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia, Kashmir, and Haiti. The emergency response to clusters of tetanus infections in developing countries after a natural disaster requires a multidisciplinary approach in the absence of an intensive care unit, readily available resources, and a functioning cold-chain system. It is essential that injured people receive immediate surgical and medical care of contaminated, open wounds with immunization and immunoglobulin therapy. Successful treatment of tetanus depends on prompt diagnosis of clinical tetanus, treatment to ensure neutralization of circulating toxin and elimination of C. tetani infection, control of spasms and convulsions, maintenance of the airway, and management of respiratory failure and autonomic dysfunction.

Pathophysiology

The defining features of tetanus — muscular rigidity, spasms, and autonomic instability — stem directly from tetanus toxin (TeNT). Previously termed tetanospasmin, TeNT targets inhibitory interneurons in the CNS. Understanding the toxin mechanism (Figure 2) is essential for interpreting symptoms, anticipating complications, and guiding treatment.

C. tetani spores, ubiquitous in soil and animal faeces, including human excrement, are remarkably resilient, withstanding boiling, freezing and disinfectants, including ethanol. Inoculation may occur via farming or gardening injuries; in road traffic accidents; or falls, particularly with foreign body retention. Other routes include animal bites, burns, injections, and unclean surgical procedures, notably circumcision and termination of pregnancy. Once introduced, spores germinate, and bacilli secrete two key toxins: tetanolysin and TeNT. While the role of tetanolysin remains unclear, it may promote anaerobic conditions for bacterial proliferation.

TeNT binds to peripheral motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction and undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the spinal cord and brainstem, similar to the rabies virus. Within the CNS, TeNT targets presynaptic glycine- and GABA-ergic interneurons, cleaving its substrate, synaptobrevin-2, and disrupting the SNARE complex essential for neurotransmitter release. The resultant failure of inhibitory neurotransmission leads to unchecked downstream motor activity, manifesting as muscle rigidity, spasms, and hyperreflexia. This also affects reflex circuits; unopposed motor activity within reflex arcs underlies stimulus-induced spasms of agonist and antagonist muscles. TeNT may spread through the lymphatics, bloodstream, and trans-synaptically within the CNS. Unlike TeNT, botulinum toxin type B — a closely-related neurotoxin that also targets synaptobrevin — acts peripherally without retrograde transport, and therefore engenders a dramatically different neurological syndrome characterised by rapidly-progressive descending flaccid paralysis, with a short incubation period. Autonomic dysfunction in severe tetanus is thought to be caused by disinhibition of autonomic neurons, resulting in dysregulated catecholamine release.

### Advances in the management of generalized convulsive status epilepticus: what have we learned? [^112Um9xg]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most serious manifestation of an epileptic diathesis. In the early stages (5–30 min), there exists class A evidence to support the efficacy of benzodiazepines as first-line treatment. As status epilepticus progresses into the later stages, the evidence for treatment becomes less robust until we are depending upon short case series and case reports for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. However, the past year saw the publication of three randomized controlled trials in the setting of benzodiazepine-resistant established convulsive status epilepticus: the EcLiPSE and ConSEPT studies, compared levetiracetam to phenytoin in children; and the ESETT study compared fosphenytoin, levetiracetam and sodium valproate in adults and children. In addition, the emergence of data from the SENSE study, a multicentre multinational prospective cohort study and the publication of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the mortality of status epilepticus over the past 30 years, has brought the treatment of status epilepticus into sharp focus. In this update we provide a detailed analysis of these studies and their impact on clinical practice. We review contentious areas of management in status epilepticus where a consensus is lacking and advance the case for more research on existing and alternative treatment strategies.

### Respiratory failure in tetanus: case report and review of a 25-year experience [^113n6Q7V]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

The objectives of the study were to describe a novel presentation of tetanus and to review the course of the respiratory component and the treatment and management of the disease. A case report is presented with a review of a 25-year experience at Mayo Clinic. We describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with persistent hiccups, dyspnea, and pleurisy of 3 days duration that was caused by tetanus from inadequate secondary immunity. She required intubation for progressive trismus and laryngospasm-associated respiratory failure. Infusion of lorazepam did not control her spasms. Refractory spasms and hiccups resolved with fentanyl and cisatracurium therapy. After 3 weeks, the patient was weaned from the ventilator with complete recovery. In the past 25 years, nine additional patients have presented to Mayo Clinic with acute tetanus. Respiratory failure requiring intubation developed in seven patients, and six of the seven intubated patients survived with minimal deficits. The prognosis of tetanus is favorable if it is diagnosed promptly and if treatment and supportive measures are begun. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with acute tetanus presenting with hiccups. This report also confirms the results of previous studies that suggested a need for improved immunity in the elderly population.

### Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children [^116D9Stj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Tonic-clonic (grand mal) convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a grand mal convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and demand urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. Benzodiazepines (midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam), phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde may all be regarded as drugs of first choice. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2005.

Objectives

To review the evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus in children treated in hospital.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (1st July 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), and MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion including convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Four trials involving 383 participants were included.(1) Intravenous lorazepam is as effective as intravenous diazepam in the treatment of acute tonic clonic convulsions, 19/27 (70%) versus 22/34 (65%), RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.54), has fewer adverse events and rectal lorazepam may be more effective than rectal diazepam, 6/6 versus 6/19 (31%), RR 3.17 (95% CI 1.63 to 6.14)(2) Buccal midazolam controlled seizures in 61/109 (56%) compared with 30/110 (27%) of rectal diazepam treated episodes with acute tonic-clonic convulsions, RR 2.05 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.91)(3) Intranasal midazolam is as effective as intravenous diazepam in the treatment of prolonged febrile convulsions, 23/26 (88%) versus 24/26 (92%), RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.14)(4) There is moderate evidence that intranasal lorazepam is more effective than intramuscular paraldehyde for acute tonic-clonic convulsions and patients treated with intranasal lorazepam are significantly less likely to require further anticonvulsants to control continuing seizures, 8/80 (10%) versus 21/80 (26%), RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this update have changed to suggest that intravenous lorazepam is at least as effective as intravenous diazepam and is associated with fewer adverse events in the treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions. Where intravenous access is unavailable there is evidence from one trial that buccal midazolam is the treatment of choice.

### Why won' T it stop? The dynamics of benzodiazepine resistance in status epilepticus [^116TXdrM]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Status epilepticus is a life-threatening neurological emergency that affects both adults and children. Approximately 36% of episodes of status epilepticus do not respond to the current preferred first-line treatment, benzodiazepines. The proportion of episodes that are refractory to benzodiazepines is higher in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries (HICs). Evidence suggests that longer episodes of status epilepticus alter brain physiology, thereby contributing to the emergence of benzodiazepine resistance. Such changes include alterations in GABA A receptor function and in the transmembrane gradient for chloride, both of which erode the ability of benzodiazepines to enhance inhibitory synaptic signalling. Often, current management guidelines for status epilepticus do not account for these duration-related changes in pathophysiology, which might differentially impact individuals in LMICs, where the average time taken to reach medical attention is longer than in HICs. In this Perspective article, we aim to combine clinical insights and the latest evidence from basic science to inspire a new, context-specific approach to efficiently managing status epilepticus.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1149uFWC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Tetanus remains a severe disease with substantial mortality and global burden. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with trismus, dysphagia, rigidity or spasms. High CFRs in resource-limited settings underscore the need for early diagnosis and access to high-quality critical care sustained over long periods. Tetanus can be prevented with timely wound care and by strengthening vaccination programmes. Further research is needed to optimise antitoxin dosage and routes of administration; identify tractable biomarkers to assist in early diagnosis and prognostication; and rehabilitate critical care survivors.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^114ZLqsH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of WHO's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination campaign. However, deaths among children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in southern Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm and resultant airway obstruction and respiratory arrest, nosocomial infections, and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, but microbiological tests can serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected health-care data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this Review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology, its clinical features and differential diagnosis, principles of management, and prognosis.

### Successful management of neonatal tetanus with autonomic manifestations at a referral hospital in Nigeria: a case report [^113JCuyV]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

Supportive care: oxygen therapy at 1 L/minute by nasal prongs, baby nursed in a quiet room with reduced illumination and given maintenance intravenous (IV) fluids with 10% dextrose water. Intravenous paracetamol given for fever.
Intravenous antibiotics: metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg per dose 8hourly and ceftazidime 50 mg/kg per dose 12hourly; according to the unit protocol (due to suspicion of associated sepsis).
Spasm control and sedation: IV magnesium sulfate loading at 200 mg/kg day 1, then maintenance of 150 mg/kg day 2 and 100 mg/kg day 3, given in 30mls of normal saline over 30 min. Intravenous phenobarbitone 2.5 mg/kg/dose alternated 6hourly with iv chlorpromazine 0.5 mg/kg/dose, were used for continuous sedation. Rectal diazepam 0.5 mg/kg/dose was given for breakthrough spasms. We monitored and charted the frequency and duration of spasms. There was no significant reduction in the frequency of spasms after 5days of admission, necessitating giving a cocktail of three different intravenous sedatives (Table 2), i.e. iv diazepam at 0.6 mg/kg/dose 8hourly; iv chlorpromazine at 0.5 mg/kg/dose 8hourly; iv phenobarbitone at 10 mg/kg/dose 8hourly. With this cocktail spasms reduced observably. Table 2 A typical 24-hour spasm control cocktail
Management of azotemia: fluid restriction was instituted and urinary catheter passed for monitoring urine output. Serial urea and creatinine could not be done due to financial constraint, however, a repeat after 15 days on admission showed normal results.
With no access to human tetanus immunoglobulin, the baby was given a stat dose of intramuscular (IM) equine antitetanus serum (ATS), containing 500 IU on the 11th day of admission when it was provided by the parents.
Gavage feeding with infant formula was commenced on the 6th day of admission, when it was possible to pass a nasogastric tube.
Physiotherapy was initiated on the 22nd day of admission when spasms had completely stopped.
Mother was satisfied with the care of her baby seeing that spasms were no longer present.

### Magnesium as first line therapy in the management of tetanus: a prospective study of 40 patients [^111uNWJE]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

A prospective observational study was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of magnesium sulphate for control of spasms and autonomic dysfunction in 40 patients with tetanus. Magnesium was infused intravenously, aiming to control spasms despite suppression of patellar reflex or respiratory insufficiency. Spasms were controlled in 38 of the 40 patients within a serum Mg(2+) range of 2–4 mmol.l(-1) with only two patients needing additional neuromuscular blocking drugs. Seventeen of 24 patients (< 60 years) and six of 16 patients (≥ 60 years) did not require ventilatory support. Thirty-six patients were conscious and co-operative throughout their management. Sympathetic over-activity was controlled without supplementary sedation. Overall mortality was 12%; all five deaths were in patients ≥ 60 years and no deaths were due to autonomic dysfunction. We recommend magnesium as possible first line therapy in the routine management of tetanus.

### Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children [^113RA6JE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Tonic-clonic (grand mal) convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a grand mal convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and demand urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. Diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde may all be regarded as drugs of first choice.

Objectives

To review the evidence comparing diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's specialized register (4 July 2002); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002); MEDLINE (28 May 2002) and EMBASE (January 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing lorazepam and other anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was a review of published, aggregate data. The main outcome measures included cessation of the presenting tonic-clonic convulsion/episode of convulsive status epilepticus; the number of additional drugs required to stop the convulsion; people demonstrating respiratory depression and people requiring admission to the intensive care unit because of respiratory depression.

Main Results

Only one trial was found, in which children were allocated lorazepam or diazepam. The main results are as follows. (1) One or two intravenous doses stopped the convulsion in 19 of 27 (70%) lorazepam and 22 of the 34 (65%) intravenous diazepam-treated children. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was 1.09(95% CI 0.77 to 1.54). A single dose of rectal lorazepam stopped the convulsion in six of six, compared to six of 19 children treated with rectal diazepam, RR 3.17(95% CI 1.63 to 6.14). (2) Six of the 27 (22%) intravenous lorazepam and 12 of the 34 (35%) intravenous diazepam-treated children respectively, experienced a further convulsion within 24 hours after presentation RR 0.63(95% CI 0.27 to 1.46). (3) Only one of 27 children (4%) who received intravenous lorazepam compared to five of 34 children (15%) who received intravenous diazepam required additional antiepileptic drugs to terminate the presenting seizure RR 0.25(95% CI 0.03 to 2.03). (4) A lower incidence of respiratory depression occurred in the lorazepam-treated group: one of 27 (4%) children compared to seven of 34 in the diazepam-treated group (21%), RR 0.21(95% CI 0.02 to 1.37).

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review provides no evidence to suggest that intravenous lorazepam should be preferred to diazepam as the first-line drug in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children. There was some evidence from this review that rectal lorazepam may be more effective and safer than rectal diazepam, but the data were insufficient to indicate that lorazepam should replace diazepam as the first choice rectal drug in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus.

### A pilot study to assess safety and feasibility of intrathecal immunoglobulin for the treatment of adults with tetanus [^116hiHD5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Adults ≥ 16 years old with tetanus admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, were eligible for study entry. Exclusion criteria were designed to be consistent with a subsequent randomized controlled trial with requirement for ventilation as primary endpoint and, therefore, included: already received antitoxin, having a contra-indication to antitoxin or lumbar puncture; already receiving mechanical ventilation or expected to before intrathecal injection; pregnancy; and failure to give informed consent. This was the first use of Tetagam-P in Vietnam, and to maximize safety, patients were enrolled sequentially in the study, that is, patients were only enrolled after the preceding patient had been discharged from ICU and the study data monitoring and safety board had authorized continuation. Patients were enrolled pragmatically to maximize safety; thus, once a patient had been discharged and continuation approved, the next eligible patient admitted during working hours (8–4Monday–Friday) was enrolled.

All patients received standard treatment of tetanus with intravenous metronidazole and wound debridement. Spasm control was achieved using intravenous diazepam or midazolam. If spasms were not controlled, then tracheostomy was performed and a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, pipecuronium, was given and titrated against spasms. Additional indications for tracheostomy were excessive sputum or laryngeal spasm.

Human tetanus immunoglobulin (Tetagam-P; CSL Behring, Hattersheim am Main, Germany) was given to all patients: 3,000 IU intramuscularly followed by 500 IU intrathecally via lumbar puncture. Both were to be given within 6 hours of ICU admission. This dose was chosen based on previously published studies. Lumbar puncture was performed in the lateral decubitus position and, if necessary, bolus doses of benzodiazepines and fentanyl were given 5–10 minutes beforehand to allow positioning and control spasms. Intrathecal injections were given using a 20-gauge spinal needle via a 0.2 micrometer filter (Braun Medical, Inc. Melsungen, Germany). Two milliliters of cerebrospinal fluid were removed before injecting the antitoxin as this equates to the volume of Tetagam-P injected intrathecally and has previously been reported to reduce headache incidence. Patients remained in the supine position for 4 hours following the procedure and were monitored regularly, including careful neurological examination at 1 hour.

### Rocuronium for control of muscle spasms in a tetanus patient with chronic methamphetamine use disorder [^112ioM2w]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

This is a case of a 31-year-old Filipino man with chronic methamphetamine use disorder who developed tetanus from a necrotic skin graft over his left calcaneus, which was fractured after a motor vehicular accident. During the course of his illness, the patient's muscle spasms were unusually refractory to benzodiazepine, which is the first-line drug used in the management of muscle spasms. The muscle spasms were successfully controlled on the seventh day of illness with rocuronium at a dose of 10 μg/kg/min and midazolam at 0.30mg/kg/hour. Both infusions were tapered off until the 23rd day of illness. The patient was discharged on the 30th day of illness, improved and stable.

### Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: a review for emergency clinicians [^116kTj6V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is divided into convulsive status epilepticus and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).

Objective

This review provides a focused evaluation of NCSE for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

NCSE is a form of status epilepticus presenting with prolonged seizure activity. This disease is underdiagnosed, as it presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms, most commonly change in mental status without overt convulsive motor activity. Causes include epilepsy, cerebral pathology or injury, any systemic insult such as infection, and drugs or toxins. Mortality is primarily related to the underlying condition. Patients most commonly present with altered mental status, but other signs and symptoms include abnormal ocular movements and automatisms such as lip smacking or subtle motor twitches in the face or extremities. The diagnosis is divided into electrographic and electroclinical, and although electroencephalogram (EEG) is recommended for definitive diagnosis, emergency clinicians should consider this disease in patients with prolonged postictal state after a seizure with no improvement in mental status, altered mental status with acute cerebral pathology (e.g., stroke, hypoxic brain injury), and unexplained altered mental status. Assessment includes laboratory evaluation and neuroimaging with EEG. Management includes treating life-threatening conditions, including compromise of the airway, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypo- or hyperthermia, followed by rapid cessation of the seizure activity with benzodiazepines and other antiseizure medications.

Conclusions

An understanding of the presentation and management of NCSE can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures: approved by the ACEP board of directors, April 17, 2024 [^1132GdTX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Status epilepticus — up to 5% of adults with epilepsy will have 1 episode in their lifetime, and a generalized convulsive seizure lasting for 5 minutes has been proposed as defining status epilepticus. The Neurocritical Care Society's Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee recommended urgent control of seizures with valproate, levetiracetam, or phenobarbital, in addition to phenytoin/fosphenytoin, and valproate was recommended for both emergent treatment of seizures and refractory status epilepticus. The European Federation of Neurological Societies' evidence-based guideline for adults recommended anesthetic doses of midazolam, propofol, or barbiturates for status epilepticus refractory to benzodiazepines and phenytoin.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^116dZkfU]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — emergent initial therapy states that benzodiazepines should be given as emergent initial therapy (strong recommendation, high quality). Route-specific choices are that lorazepam is the drug of choice for IV administration (strong recommendation, moderate quality), midazolam is the drug of choice for IM administration (strong recommendation, moderate quality), and rectal diazepam can be given when there is no IV access and IM administration of midazolam is contraindicated (strong recommendation, moderate quality).

### Survival of a patient with tetanus in Bhutan using a magnesium infusion managed only by clinical signs [^1146DxZz]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a life-threatening disease that continues to have a high prevalence in developing countries. Severe muscle spasms often require patients to receive tracheostomy, high-dose sedatives, and sometimes prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) infusion has great promise as an adjunct treatment for severe tetanus, as it may allow clinicians to decrease the dose of other sedative medications. Although the mechanism of action of MgSO4 is not well understood, it appears to attenuate both the muscle spasms and autonomic instability associated with severe tetanus infections. However, MgSO4 infusions are often managed based on serial measurements of serum magnesium levels and other laboratory tests such as arterial blood gases, which can be difficult to obtain in resource-poor settings. We describe a case of severe tetanus in Bhutan managed through the use of magnesium infusion titrated solely to physical examination findings.

### Assessment of benzodiazepine dosing strategies for the management of status epilepticus in the emergency department [^112bPs6K]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although guidelines recommend specific benzodiazepine doses for the treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE), underdosing appears to be common. The purpose of this investigation was to assess benzodiazepine dosing strategies for the initial management of GCSE in patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was a retrospective review of adult patients who received benzodiazepines in the ED for treatment of GCSE. Characteristics of those achieving seizure cessation following initial benzodiazepine therapy were assessed.

Results

222 patients presented to the ED and received 403 doses of benzodiazepines, of which 1.5% conformed with recommendations. First-line therapy was successful in 86.8% of patients with an average dose of 1.6 mg (0.02 mg/kg). No difference in dosing was noted between those experiencing early cessation and those that did not (p = 0.132). Patients experiencing early cessation were significantly less likely to receive further doses, be intubated, or be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Those that received early antiepileptic drug therapy were significantly less likely to receive additional benzodiazepine doses, be intubated, or be admitted to the ICU or hospital (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

According to guideline recommendations, there was consistent underdosing of benzodiazepines noted in both prehospital and ED settings. Early seizure cessation and the early receipt of an antiepileptic drug were found to be associated with multiple significant clinical outcomes. Future investigations should explore optimal dosing strategies for benzodiazepines as well as the impact of early antiepileptic drug administration.

### Magnesium sulfate for the prevention of seizures in preeclampsia: origin, experimental basis, clinical studies, and the evolution in obstetrical practice [^114Xf9uN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

For centuries, convulsions unique to pregnancy have been described. In this time, varying therapies-from phlebotomy to narcotics-have been suggested as the treatment of choice for eclampsia. Building upon the discovery of magnesium salts to control convulsions due to tetanus, magnesium sulfate became a suggested treatment for eclampsia. Throughout the 20 th century, several large, clinical trials verified magnesium sulfate as the treatment of choice for eclampsia. In this report, the history of eclampsia management and the study of magnesium sulfate are described. The intent of the report is to highlight the key clinical features with use of magnesium sulfate, the present understanding of the mechanism of action, and the rigor of the studies by which it was established as the current definitive prophylaxis and therapy for eclampsia. Because of the unique pharmacologic properties, it is critical that obstetric providers understand the foundational studies to establish dosing and identified risks with magnesium sulfate application. Additionally, alleged putative effects of magnesium sulfate administration, such as prolongation of labor, are also addressed. Lastly, the challenges with use of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclampsia is summarized given the varying definitions of preeclampsia. This report serves as a chronicle to summarize the story of how one of the most commonly utilized agents in obstetrics became the standard of present-day care.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114nZqhv]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical — seizures (prehospital) — patient safety and initial management: Trained personnel should be able to give medication without contacting medical direction, and more than two doses of benzodiazepines are associated with high-risk of airway compromise; use caution, weigh risks/benefits of deferring treatment until hospital, and/or consider consultation with medical direction if the patient has received two doses of benzodiazepines by bystanders and/or prehospital clinicians. Hypoglycemic patients who are treated in the field for seizure should be transported to hospital. Many airway/breathing issues in seizing patients can be managed without intubation or placement of an advanced airway; reserve these measures for patients that fail less invasive maneuvers as noted above. For children with convulsive status epilepticus requiring medication management in the prehospital setting, trained EMS personnel should be allowed to administer medication without medical direction. For new onset seizures or seizures that are refractory to treatment, consider other potential causes including, but not limited to, trauma, stroke, electrolyte abnormality, toxic ingestion, pregnancy with eclampsia, and hyperthermia. One dose, rather than a range, has been suggested to standardize a common dose when an EMS agency may need to switch from one type of benzodiazepine to another due to cost or resource limitations. Recent evidence supports the use of midazolam IM as an intervention that is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation.

### Treatment recommendations… [^111Df2Sz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.
- Tetanus treatment often involves several types of medications and supportive care.
- Complete recovery can take several months.
- Tetanus infection doesn't provide immunity, so vaccination is recommended during recovery.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Treatment recommendations Administer tetanus immune globulin Dose Medical experts recommend a single, 500 international unit dose of TIG for tetanus treatment. While the optimal therapeutic dose is uncertain, this dose appears as effective as higher doses. It also causes less discomfort. TIG helps remove unbound tetanus toxin from the body. It can't affect toxin already bound to nerve endings. Administration Administer TIG preparations intramuscularly.

TIG preparations available in the United States aren't licensed or formulated for intrathecal or intravenous use. Some medical experts recommend infiltration of part of the dose locally around the wound, although its efficacy hasn't been proven. Alternative treatment If TIG isn't available, healthcare providers can use immune globulin intravenous. Note, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved IGIV for this use. In addition, anti-tetanus antibody content varies by lot. Control muscle spasms Healthcare providers should use sedation and muscle relaxant drugs as indicated to control muscle spasms. Patients may require agents to control autonomic nervous system instability. Maintain an airway Healthcare providers should monitor for airway patency because associated muscle spasms can cause airway loss.

Depending on disease severity, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and mechanically assisted respiration may be lifesaving. Manage wounds and treat infections Clean all wounds. Remove or debride necrotic tissue. Remove any foreign material. Observe wounds for signs of infection. Promptly treat infected wounds. Provide antibiotic therapy Appropriate antibiotic therapy is recommended to reduce the number of tetanus bacteria.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^1122Htkv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine selection and pregnancy management indicates that benzodiazepines ideal for the treatment of withdrawal include those with a rapid onset and long duration of action, and that when treating pregnant patients, women should always be treated for acute withdrawal, including the use of supervised benzodiazepines when indicated, due to the risk of acute stress to the fetus and potentially dangerous alcohol withdrawal for the mother. For outpatient withdrawal management, providers hesitating because of benzodiazepine-related safety concerns should consider options in Recommendation 6, and Service Members seeking care under the Army's Voluntary Care policy should not have their trust violated by a Medical Treatment Facility providing only inpatient alcohol withdrawal management if they prefer to keep their care private from their chain of command; inpatient withdrawal management entails missed duty and command notification and is not the least restrictive alternative when there is no history of alcohol seizures, delirium tremens, or other compelling clinical need.

### Evidence-based medicine for… [^116Lm2cU]. chemm.hhs.gov (2013). Low credibility.

Among subjects whose seizures ceased before arrival in the emergency department, the median times to active treatment were 1. 2 minutes in the intramuscular-midazolam group and
4. 8 minutes in the intravenous-lorazepam group, with corresponding median times from active treatment to cessation of convulsions of 3. 3 minutes and

1. 6 minutes. Partial seizures, generalized tonic, clonic and tonic-clonic convulsions were included irrespective of duration or cause. One episode per child only was included. The frequency of overall control of convulsive episodes within 5 min were 85% and 93. 3% in buccal midazolam and intravenous diazepam groups, respectively; the difference was, however, not statistically significant. The mean time needed for controlling the convulsive episodes after administration of the drugs was significantly less with intravenous diazepam. The mean time for initiation of treatment was significantly less with buccal midazolam.

The mean time for controlling the convulsive episodes after noticing these first were significantly less with buccal midazolam than with intravenous diazepam that is likely to be due to longer time needed for initiating treatment with intravenous diazepam in preparing the injection and establishing an IV line. When treatment was given 5 min after seizure onset, all three benzodiazepines controlled seizures in virtually 100% of the cases at the higher doses. Time to terminate seizures tended to decrease at the higher doses of diazepam, although there were still a number of outliers at all doses tested. Seizure termination times were short with midazolam and did not substantially decrease at higher doses, again with a number of outliers. There was no appreciable enhancement of seizure termination speed.

The results show that increasing the treatment dose of benzodiazepine can produce a successful anticon-vulsant effect in all animals and can possibly enhance the speed of anticonvulsant effect, especially with diazepam. The results also show that administration of a strong centrally active anticholinergic drug such as scopolamine in combination with either diazepam or midazolam can modestly enhance the anticonvulsant action of low doses of a benzodiazepine, but does not increase the speed of seizure control.

### Status epilepticus in the ICU [^116heKnb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a common medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Management that follows published guidelines is best suited to improve outcomes, with the most severe cases frequently being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Diagnosis of convulsive SE can be made without electroencephalography (EEG), but EEG is required to reliably diagnose nonconvulsive SE. Rapidly narrowing down underlying causes for SE is crucial, as this may guide additional management steps. Causes may range from underlying epilepsy to acute brain injuries such as trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke, and infections. Initial management consists of rapid administration of benzodiazepines and one of the following non-sedating intravenous antiseizure medications (ASM): (fos-)phenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate; other ASM are increasingly used, such as lacosamide or brivaracetam. SE that continues despite these medications is called refractory, and most commonly treated with continuous infusions of midazolam or propofol. Alternatives include further non-sedating ASM and non-pharmacologic approaches. SE that reemerges after weaning or continues despite management with propofol or midazolam is labeled super-refractory SE. At this step, management may include non-sedating or sedating compounds including ketamine and barbiturates. Continuous video EEG is necessary for the management of refractory and super-refractory SE, as these are almost always nonconvulsive. If possible, management of the underlying cause of seizures is crucial particularly for patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Short-term mortality ranges from 10 to 15% after SE and is primarily related to increasing age, underlying etiology, and medical comorbidities. Refractoriness of treatment is clearly related to outcome with mortality rising from 10% in responsive cases, to 25% in refractory, and nearly 40% in super-refractory SE.

### Prehospital treatment of status epilepticus with benzodiazepines is effective and safe [^115q3Niy]. Epilepsy Currents (2002). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are an effective and safe treatment of status epilepticus and serial seizures when used in an out-of-hospital setting. Intravenously administered lorazepam is somewhat superior to diazepam for the treatment of status epilepticus. Treatment of status epilepticus should be initiated when seizures have lasted 5–7 minutes.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1149YkUu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Generalised tetanus, the most common and severe form of disease, typically progresses cephalocaudally. Cephalic and localised forms are predominantly determined by inoculation site (e.g. head/neck wounds, gingival infections, or chronic otitis media) and restricted toxin spread, respectively. It usually takes 4–6 weeks for inhibitory neurotransmission to be restored in generalised tetanus. The molecular mechanisms underlying protracted clinical recovery remain incompletely understood, but may include delayed clearance of cytosolic TeNT light chains, regeneration of synaptobrevin in pre-synaptic neurons and/or the sprouting of new axonal terminals.

History of Presenting Illness

While the notional incubation period for tetanus ranges from 1–60 days (median 8), symptom onset after 21 days is uncommon. Incubation is shorter for head and neck wounds but can be much longer with infected implants. In most cases, however, tetanus ensues from apparently innocuous or healed scratches and abrasions. Up to 30% of patients with tetanus have no identifiable wound on admission. – Clinicians should therefore enquire about any injuries occurring in the prior 3 weeks, but maintain a high index of suspicion in any patient with compatible symptoms, particularly those with incomplete or unclear vaccination history. We suggest specifically asking about motorbike accidents, recent piercings, acupuncture, and subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, all of which are documented routes of infection.

Clinical Features

A) Source of Contamination

It is important to assess for occult wounds, as healed scratches or scabs may continue generating toxin. Physical examination should focus on the commonest inoculation site - the foot -and if there is a clear history, the body part where symptoms first started. Clinicians should elicit a history of injecting drug use and look for evidence of track marks and skin popping from subcutaneous opiate injection. Injecting drug use is also associated with poorer tetanus outcomes.

Besides tetanus and its complications, clinicians should be alert to concurrent injury-related issues, notably skin and soft tissue infection, and consider the need for post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. Superinfections with leptospirosis from floodwater may layer jaundice upon features of tetanus, as is sometimes seen in Metro Manila during the rainy season. Finally, clinicians may encounter epiphenomena of alternative or traditional medicine treatments, such as linear scarring and annular skin changes from cutting needles and medicinal animal horns, respectively.

### Prophylactic drug management for febrile seizures in children [^1173SzmP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile seizures occurring in a child older than one month during an episode of fever affect 2% to 4% of children in Great Britain and the United States and recur in 30%. Rapid-acting antiepileptics and antipyretics given during subsequent fever episodes have been used to avoid the adverse effects of continuous antiepileptic drugs.

Objectives

To evaluate primarily the effectiveness and safety of antiepileptic and antipyretic drugs used prophylactically to treat children with febrile seizures; but also to evaluate any other drug intervention where there was a sound biological rationale for its use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 7); MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016); Embase (1966 to July 2016); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) (July 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted researchers in the field to identify continuing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised participant allocation that compared the use of antiepileptic, antipyretic or other plausible agents with each other, placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (RN and MO) independently applied predefined criteria to select trials for inclusion and extracted the predefined relevant data, recording methods for randomisation, blinding and exclusions. For the 2016 update a third author (MC) checked all original inclusions, data analyses, and updated the search. Outcomes assessed were seizure recurrence at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months and at age 5 to 6 years in the intervention and non-intervention groups, and adverse medication effects. We assessed the presence of publication bias using funnel plots.

Main Results

We included 40 articles describing 30 randomised trials with 4256 randomised participants. We analysed 13 interventions of continuous or intermittent prophylaxis and their control treatments. Methodological quality was moderate to poor in most studies. We found no significant benefit for intermittent phenobarbitone, phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, ibuprofen or zinc sulfate versus placebo or no treatment; nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo; nor for continuous phenobarbitone versus diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate, or oral diazepam versus clobazam. There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam versus placebo or no treatment, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85 at six months), RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84) at 12 months, RR 0.37 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.60) at 18 months, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.95) at 24 months, RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.85) at 36 months, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.89) at 48 months, with no benefit at 60 to 72 months. Phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment reduced seizures at 6, 12 and 24 months but not at 18 or 72 month follow-up (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.83) at 6 months; RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.70) at 12 months; and RR 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.89) at 24 months). Intermittent clobazam compared to placebo at six months resulted in a RR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.64), an effect found against an extremely high (83.3%) recurrence rate in the controls, which is a result that needs replication. The recording of adverse effects was variable. Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to 30% of children in the phenobarbitone-treated group and in up to 36% in benzodiazepine-treated groups. We found evidence of publication bias in the meta-analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus placebo (eight studies) at 12 months but not at six months (six studies); and valproate versus placebo (four studies) at 12 months, with too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons. Most of the reviewed antiepileptic drug trials are of a methodological quality graded as low or very low. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment often do not meet current standards; and treatment versus no treatment is more commonly seen than treatment versus placebo, leading to obvious risks of bias. Trials of antipyretics and zinc were of higher quality.

Authors' Conclusions

We found reduced recurrence rates for children with febrile seizures for intermittent diazepam and continuous phenobarbitone, with adverse effects in up to 30%. Apparent benefit for clobazam treatment in one trial needs to be replicated to be judged reliable. Given the benign nature of recurrent febrile seizures, and the high prevalence of adverse effects of these drugs, parents and families should be supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114k4vzo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal seizures — acute treatment and anticonvulsant options — are outlined as follows: Benzodiazepines are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures, and intravenous (IV) administration of a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is recommended after a withdrawal-related seizure; in a randomized, double-blind trial, patients received either 2 mL of saline or 2 mL of lorazepam intravenously and IV lorazepam significantly reduced recurrent seizures. All patients presenting with an alcohol withdrawal seizure should have IV access established immediately for fluids and medication, and intramuscular (IM) administration is also an effective and acceptable route. Phenobarbital is an appropriate option with a long half-life and a narrow therapeutic window and is more commonly used in an inpatient setting, such as the intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department (ED) where there is continuous supervision; the Guideline Committee recommends caution when using in settings that offer less monitoring than the ICU and ED, and clinicians with minimal experience should use extra caution in case over-sedation or respiratory depression occurs. Supporting data include a prospective series in which none of the 38 patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures had a subsequent convulsion after IV phenobarbital, and a small randomized trial in the ED found phenobarbital to be as effective as benzodiazepines for reducing CIWA-Ar scores from baseline to discharge. While animal studies show anticonvulsants can prevent seizures and delirium, human evidence is mixed and insufficient to conclude superiority over benzodiazepines, and phenytoin has been shown to be ineffective in preventing the recurrence of seizure and is not recommended unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

### Ten-year experiences with tetanus at a tertiary hospital in northwestern tanzania: a retrospective review of 102 cases [^114edHeF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Study subjects

The study included all patients of all age groups and gender who presented with a clinical diagnosis of tetanus. Patients who had incomplete or missed basic information were excluded from the study. The diagnosis of tetanus was wholly clinical and based on the presence of one or more of the following:-

1. Trismus

2. Rigidity of the neck and or abdomen

3. Reflex spasms

Tetanus was classified into generalized, cephalic, localized and neonatal types. Patients with rigidity and/or spasm limited to the wound bearing area of the body were classified as having localized tetanus, whereas those with trismus and generalized rigidity with or without generalized spasms were classified as having generalized tetanus. Tetanus occurring during neonatal period was classified as neonatal tetanus. A form of localized tetanus restricted to head and neck was classified as cephalic tetanus. The severity of tetanus was classified into mild, moderate severe and very severe according to the system reported by Ablett. The treatment was started immediately once the diagnosis was made. The three objectives of therapy i.e. supportive care; neutralization of circulating toxin and removal (eradication) of the source of tetanospasmin (infected sites) was applied to all cases depending on the severity of spasms and availability of all essential facilities. The patients were treated as per standard protocol for the management of tetanus which included antibiotics (i.e. Penicillin, metranidazole or combination of both), wound care, passive immunization with human tetanus immune globulins (500 Units I/M stat) and active immunization with injection Tetanus Toxiod at the time of admission which was repeated when patient were discharged from the ward. The patients also received Diazepam for the control of spasm and mechanical ventilation when and where it was required. Details of demographic data (i.e. age, sex, occupation), tetanus immunization history, suspected portal of entry of infection, incubation time, clinical presentations, management, related complications, duration of intensive care unit admission, length of hospitalization, outcome and factors predicting the outcome were obtained from medical records and entered in a questionnaire before analysis. Incubation period was defined as the time from injury to the appearance of symptoms and the period of onset was defined as the interval between the first symptoms and the first spasm.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113ffFU1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Appendix N — medications for managing intoxication: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) (first line) are GABAergic and indicated for excitatory symptoms, anxiety/agitation, neuromuscular excitation, and seizures. Initial dosing includes lorazepam 1–2 mg IV based on clinical signs and symptoms and duration of effects; diazepam 5–10 mg PO for less severe symptoms based on patient parameters; and midazolam 5 mg IM or 0.01–0.05 mg/kg IV for acute agitation in adult patients, and redosing frequency and dose should be guided by the degree and duration of the clinical effects of the initial dose. Other considerations note parenteral vs. PO administration based on signs and symptom severity and drug availability (eg, parenteral BZD shortages), and IM administration allows for administration in agitated patients without IV access; lorazepam has very slow IM onset (15–30 min); midazolam has very rapid IV onset, allowing for easy titration, and a relatively fast IM onset; if psychosis is primary symptom, antipsychotics should be considered primarily or adjunctively.

### A multicentre randomised controlled trial of levetiracetam versus phenytoin for convulsive status epilepticus in children (protocol): convulsive status epilepticus paediatric trial (conSEPT)-a PREDICT study [^117NGGJn]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is the most common life-threatening childhood neurological emergency. It has an annual incidence of 17–23 cases per 100,000 children per year, with 22% of patients requiring Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Mortality following paediatric CSE is reported at 3–5% and neurological sequelae occur in up to 34% of children.

Management guidelines for paediatric CSE recommend early and prompt use of anticonvulsant medication. Recommendations from the Advanced Life Support Group, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, the Status Epilepsy Working Party in the United Kingdom, and major textbooks, are broadly similar and universally adopt a stepwise approach to treatment; 1. Two doses of benzodiazepine; 2. Second line anticonvulsant, with all recommending phenytoin or fosphenytoin; and 3. Final termination of CSE with RSI intubation with thiopentone and ICU admission. While there is reasonable evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines in CSE there is a paucity of evidence concerning the type and efficacy of second line anticonvulsant medication used with management guidelines based only on expert opinion.

The aetiology and outcomes of CSE in children is different to that of adults, thus adult evidence cannot be expected to be directly applicable to paediatric practice. A large population based study of CSE reported that less than a quarter of the children had a previous history of CSE. Of those with a first presentation of CSE over half were previously neurologically normal, a third of episodes were due to prolonged febrile convulsions, 17% of episodes were due to central nervous system (CNS) infection or acute metabolic derangement, with the remainder of episodes idiopathic or associated with a pre-existing CNS abnormality.

The term CSE was traditionally defined as 30 min of a continuous generalised tonic-clonic convulsion or recurrent tonic-clonic convulsions without recovery of consciousness between each convulsion. Recently a revised operational definition based on the indication to commence treatment has defined CSE as seizures of a duration of five minutes or more. This shortening of seizure duration for CSE definition is due to evidence that the natural history for typical generalised convulsive seizures is to resolve spontaneously by 3–5 min, with those not doing so requiring medication for termination. This revised definition has been adopted by recent trials on paediatric CSE. Early medication use and cessation of seizures in CSE is important. There is a wealth of animal evidence suggesting that longer seizures are harmful and result in irreversible brain damage and poorer outcomes.

Tetanus remains a serious problem in public health, particularly in developing countries, despite efficient prevention programs. A retrospective study was conducted at an infectious diseases intensive care unit during 1998–2003 involving patients admitted with grade III tetanus. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal baclofen for the treatment of tetanus. Lumbar puncture was performed, and a subarachnoid catheter was inserted for drug administration. An intrathecal bolus of baclofen was followed by a continuous infusion of 20 microg/h, until a maximum daily dose of 2 mg was provided. Twenty-two patients were treated overall. Control of the symptoms was achieved in all patients but one. Seven patients had colonization of the catheter, and 1 patient developed meningitis. All patients except one recovered. In our study, this means of treatment was efficacious and well tolerated.

### Benzodiazepines for out-of-hospital status epilepticus: Do or Do not! there is No try! [^115CrRSP]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

"Do or do not! There is no try!" told the venerable Yoda to young Luke Skywalker on a gloomy planet in the Dagobah system. Although it would be presumptuous to pretend to understand the complexity of the mind of an 800-year-old Jedi master, I would surmise the intent of these words was to convince his student not to be afraid to use the Force. At this point in the story, the Force was the only hope for Luke and the Rebellion to defeat the Empire and put an end to its tyranny throughout the galaxy.

Let's get back from that galaxy far away to the real world and replace 800 years of wisdom by 30 years of evidence, Luke Skywalker by a paramedic in the field, the Force by parenteral benzodiazepines, and the evil Empire by the no-less evil generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). A frequent neurological emergency affecting patients across all age groups, GCSE is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Something we should take seriously and be ready to treat without hesitation. Early GCSE management should aim at rapid cessation of both clinical and electrical seizure activity, since appropriate and timely treatment of status epilepticus decreases the risk of complications and mortality. And there is hope. No less than 3 class I studies, on top of several class II and III studies, established parenteral benzodiazepines as an efficacious and safe first-line treatment of early convulsive SE treatment, including in the out-of-hospital setting. This evidence made its way into the most recent SE management guidelines, which clearly recommend the prompt administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV diazepam, or intramuscular (IM) midazolam (level A recommendation), at the doses studied in the RCT, as initial therapy of GCSE. They also propose intranasal buccal or rectal benzodiazepines as alternatives when IV/IM administration is not available. If a first dose is not successful, then the administration of a second ("rescue") dose is recommended. Yet, overwhelming evidence and clear guidelines somehow do not translate well into clinical practice. Observational studies have found that benzodiazepines are often delayed or underdosed, when they are not simply omitted. - These deviations from guidelines are not without consequences. Delayed or insufficient treatment with benzodiazepine has been associated with lower efficacy, a longer time to seizure cessation and an increased risk of refractoriness, leading to more intensive care unit admissions, more respiratory and hemodynamic complications, and worse outcome. -

### Airway management of tetanus after the Haitian earthquake: new aspects of old observations [^1175hgM6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Two men developed severe tetanus after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. They were admitted to the United States Naval Ship Comfort, a hospital ship sent to provide humanitarian relief. Severe masseter and intercostal muscle spasm impaired airway access and ventilation. Propofol and sevoflurane relieved the tetany, allowing airway control and ventilation without intubation or neuromuscular blocking drugs during wound debridement. Presynaptic impairment of inhibitory neurotransmitter release by tetanospasmin toxin is countered by enhancement of spinal cord postsynaptic inhibitory receptor activity by general anesthetics. Avoidance of tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation during anesthesia may be desirable in the settings of limited resources in which tetanus usually presents.

### Flumazenil [^112hTeV9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use in the ICU

Flumazenil should be used with caution in the ICU because of the increased risk of unrecognized benzodiazepine dependence in such settings. Flumazenil may produce convulsions in patients physically dependent on benzodiazepines (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE and WARNINGS).

Administration of flumazenil to diagnose benzodiazepine-induced sedation in the ICU is not recommended due to the risk of adverse events as described above. In addition, the prognostic significance of a patient's failure to respond to flumazenil in cases confounded by metabolic disorder, traumatic injury, drugs other than benzodiazepines, or any other reasons not associated with benzodiazepine receptor occupancy is unknown.

Use in Benzodiazepine Overdosage

Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of airway, assisted breathing, circulatory access and support, internal decontamination by lavage and charcoal, and adequate clinical evaluation.

Necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation and intravenous access prior to administering flumazenil. Upon arousal, patients may attempt to withdraw endotracheal tubes and/or intravenous lines as the result of confusion and agitation following awakening.

Head Injury

Flumazenil should be used with caution in patients with head injury as it may be capable of precipitating convulsions or altering cerebral blood flow in patients receiving benzodiazepines. It should be used only by practitioners prepared to manage such complications should they occur.

Use With Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

Flumazenil should not be used until the effects of neuromuscular blockade have been fully reversed.

Use in Psychiatric Patients

Flumazenil has been reported to provoke panic attacks in patients with a history of panic disorder.

Pain on Injection

To minimize the likelihood of pain or inflammation at the injection site, flumazenil should be administered through a freely flowing intravenous infusion into a large vein. Local irritation may occur following extravasation into perivascular tissues.

Use in Respiratory Disease

The primary treatment of patients with serious lung disease who experience serious respiratory depression due to benzodiazepines should be appropriate ventilatory support (see PRECAUTIONS)rather than the administration of flumazenil injection. Flumazenil is capable of partially reversing benzodiazepine-induced alterations in ventilatory drive in healthy volunteers, but has not been shown to be clinically effective.

Midazolam — anticonvulsants, other; antianxiety agent; anxiolytics; benzodiazepines — binds receptors at several sites within the central nervous system (CNS), including the limbic system and reticular formation; effects may be mediated through gabba-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor system; an increase in neuronal membrane permeability to chloride ions enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA, and the shift in chloride ions causes hyperpolarization (less excitability).
