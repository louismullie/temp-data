bronchitis antibiotic

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics should be used for acute bronchitis and under what circumstances they might be appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining acute bronchitis and separating it from look-alike conditions such as pneumonia and COPD exacerbations. Then, I should verify the predominant etiology to see whether antibiotics have a plausible target. Next, I will review major guideline recommendations. After that, I need to examine randomized and systematic review evidence on benefits and harms of antibiotics. Then, I should consider diagnostic uncertainty and stewardship tools like delayed prescribing and biomarkers. I will now examine valid exceptions that justify antibiotics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management pathway and conclusion based on the totality of evidence and guidance [^113GmpYk] [^114VGSCJ] [^116Kxyq1].

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislabel the syndrome. Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection characterized primarily by cough lasting up to 3 weeks, with no radiographic evidence of pneumonia and no underlying chronic lung disease, and the diagnosis should exclude common cold, acute asthma, and COPD exacerbation, which have different management implications [^114VGSCJ] [^116Kxyq1] [^113GmpYk].

> Hold on, I should verify the etiologic landscape before assuming antibiotics help. The overwhelming majority of uncomplicated acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adults is viral, often > 90%, and purulent sputum is a poor discriminator of bacterial infection in this context, so the biological rationale for routine antibiotics is weak [^111Ltura] [^1156nhgo] [^114E7k7E]. Let me not conflate this with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis/COPD, where bacterial involvement can be higher and management differs, so separating these entities is essential to avoid inappropriate extrapolation [^115PTo5q] [^114k3YFH].

> Next, I should review guideline consensus to avoid anchoring bias. Multiple high-credibility bodies converge: the ACCP/CHEST 2020 expert panel advises against routine antibiotics in immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, and AAFP and ACP/CDC similarly recommend avoiding antibiotics unless pneumonia is suspected, aligning with IDSA "Choosing Wisely" statements that antibiotics are ineffective for viral URIs including bronchitis [^1179Kpu9] [^113Tn7jN] [^112YmzVc] [^1128x35v] [^114CZS4Q]. Wait, let me verify nuance: ACCP does allow that if the clinical course worsens and a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely, treatment should follow the condition identified, which is not a routine acute bronchitis indication but an exception pathway, not a contradiction [^113GmpYk].

> I need to check efficacy signals carefully because small benefits can be misleading in self-limited disease. Cochrane reviews and subsequent summaries show no significant difference in overall clinical improvement, with at most a very small reduction in cough duration (roughly half a day to one day), offset by higher adverse events in antibiotic groups, yielding an unfavorable NNT versus NNH profile in routine cases [^112JFNM3] [^111FGJZY] [^112yjRGd] [^117ABtD6]. Hmm, wait a minute — my initial thought was that colored sputum might predict benefit, but randomized data show that even in patients with discolored sputum without COPD, antibiotics were not better than placebo for time to cough resolution, correcting that misconception [^111sZQww] [^113wvMtz].

> Let me consider real-world prescribing, because practice often diverges from evidence. Despite viral predominance and minimal benefit, antibiotics are still prescribed in a majority of primary care acute bronchitis visits, which contributes to antimicrobial resistance; stewardship interventions that target diagnostic uncertainty and expectation management can reduce inappropriate use without harming outcomes [^111GMKWc] [^113e54oA] [^114jEj5y]. I should double-check whether point-of-care tools help: CRP testing in primary care for acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis, reduces antibiotic prescriptions without worsening recovery, though guidelines advise not to routinely obtain inflammatory markers and procalcitonin evidence in primary care is insufficient, so use should be judicious and context-specific [^114spc5q] [^111gXUJR].

> Next, I should review delayed prescribing as a middle path when uncertainty or patient preference pressures exist. Pragmatic randomized trials across RTIs, including chest infections, show that delayed prescriptions markedly reduce antibiotic use while maintaining similar symptom severity and duration compared with no antibiotics, and AAFP endorses this strategy when the diagnosis is in question or a prescription is requested; importantly, immediate antibiotics do not yield clinically meaningful symptom advantages in acute bronchitis [^112heeKh] [^114FGnqL] [^113hYQ39]. Let me verify outcomes: in these trials, median duration of moderately bad symptoms was similar between no-prescription and delayed groups, supporting safety of a watchful approach [^112heeKh].

> But wait, what if an exception applies where antibiotics are appropriate? I need to ensure I don't miss those. If pertussis is suspected (paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, posttussive emesis), test and treat to reduce transmission; if abnormal vitals, focal chest findings, advanced age with higher risk, or severe symptoms suggest possible pneumonia, obtain chest radiography and treat confirmed pneumonia rather than "bronchitis" [^114E7k7E] [^112fAS6d] [^1128x35v] [^116m7gc6]. I should also consider high-risk hosts or significant cardiopulmonary disease, and remember that AECOPD is a different entity in which antibiotics may be indicated per separate evidence and labeling, which should not be misapplied to otherwise healthy acute bronchitis [^114By5hM] [^114eN7Wy] [^113DzSSZ]. Rarely, Aspergillus bronchitis requires antifungals with diagnostic confirmation, highlighting that not all "bronchitis" is bacterial or viral, and certainly not an indication for routine antibacterial therapy [^113ypRvD] [^113uXGzz].

> I will now examine optimal management when none of those exceptions are present. Education that the cough commonly lasts 2–3 weeks, describing it as a "chest cold", and setting expectations reduce antibiotic demand and improve satisfaction; supportive care such as rest, hydration, humidified air, and antipyretics/analgesics is reasonable, while guidelines caution against initiating routine antitussives, inhaled beta-agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, or NSAIDs specifically for bronchitis symptom control in immunocompetent adults [^115uFvJ7] [^115NqVos] [^1123gz4m] [^116X18bo]. Hold on, I should verify that we also avoid unnecessary testing: routine sputum cultures, viral panels, spirometry, CRP, and procalcitonin are not recommended in typical outpatient acute bronchitis, which helps limit low-yield diagnostics [^116cXFqi] [^112WRnjT].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic decision pathway to ensure nothing is missed. First, rule out pneumonia clinically and with CXR when indicated by abnormal vitals or focal signs; second, check for pertussis features or high-risk hosts; if any exception is present, treat the specific condition; if none apply, do not prescribe antibiotics, consider a delayed prescription or shared-decision strategy if expectations are high, and reserve selective use of CRP POC testing for situations of persistent diagnostic uncertainty while acknowledging guidelines do not advise routine biomarker testing in acute bronchitis [^1128x35v] [^116zSTZN] [^113hYQ39] [^114spc5q].

> Conclusion: I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and consistent with evidence. For immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis, antibiotics should not be used routinely because they offer, at best, trivial symptomatic benefit and increase adverse effects and resistance pressure; management should focus on education and supportive care, reserving antibiotics for defined exceptions such as suspected pertussis, confirmed pneumonia, or non-bronchitis conditions like AECOPD and rare fungal bronchitis after appropriate confirmation [^1179Kpu9] [^112YmzVc] [^112JFNM3] [^114E7k7E].

Routine antibiotics are **not recommended** for acute bronchitis because it is usually viral and self-limited [^112YmzVc]; they provide only a modest ~0.5-day symptom reduction [^112yjRGd] [^117ABtD6] and increase adverse effects. Antibiotics are indicated only if **pertussis is suspected or confirmed**, or if a **bacterial infection is likely** in **high-risk patients** (e.g. COPD exacerbation with increased sputum purulence/volume or severe symptoms) [^113GmpYk] [^114eN7Wy]. When needed, use amoxicillin, doxycycline, or macrolides for 5 days; avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist [^114Zrbnc]. Emphasize patient education [^115NqVos], delayed prescribing [^112heeKh], and supportive care [^1123gz4m] to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and resistance [^113hYQ39].

---

## Indications for antibiotic use in bronchitis

Antibiotics are generally **not recommended** for acute bronchitis because most cases are viral and self-limited [^112JFNM3]. However, **specific clinical scenarios** warrant antibiotic therapy:

- **Suspected or confirmed pertussis**: Antibiotics are indicated to reduce transmission and severity.

- **High-risk patients**: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, immunocompromised individuals, or those with severe symptoms (e.g. high fever, tachypnea, hypoxia) may benefit from antibiotics if bacterial infection is likely [^113GmpYk] [^114eN7Wy].

- **Persistent or worsening symptoms**: If symptoms persist beyond 3–4 weeks or worsen, further evaluation and targeted antibiotic therapy may be considered [^112BptYu].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **use one of the following regimens** [^11575PLC]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | First-line for suspected bacterial bronchitis | 500 mg orally three times daily | 5 days |
| Doxycycline | Alternative for penicillin allergy or atypical pathogens | 100 mg orally twice daily | 5 days [^11575PLC] |
| Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) | Suspected pertussis or atypical pathogens | Azithromycin: 500 mg day 1, then 250 mg daily days 2–5; Clarithromycin: 500 mg twice daily | 5 days |
| Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) | Reserved for severe cases or resistance [^113xvMxS] [^114Zrbnc] | Levofloxacin: 500 mg daily; Moxifloxacin: 400 mg daily | 5 days |

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Antibiotics provide **modest benefits** in acute bronchitis — such as a slight reduction in cough duration (~0.5 days) and improved activity levels — but they do not significantly change overall clinical outcomes or prevent complications in most cases [^112JFNM3] [^112yjRGd]. In chronic bronchitis or COPD exacerbations, antibiotics show **greater effectiveness**, especially in patients with increased sputum purulence or volume or severe symptoms; clinical trials demonstrate reduced treatment failure and relapse rates and improved clinical outcomes in these populations [^114eN7Wy] [^113GmpYk].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Antibiotic use in bronchitis carries **several risks and adverse effects**:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort are common [^112yjRGd] [^117ABtD6].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, and rare severe hypersensitivity reactions.

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Overuse contributes significantly to antibiotic resistance, a major public health concern [^114jEj5y].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk, particularly with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines consistently **recommend against routine antibiotic use** in acute bronchitis:

- **American College of Physicians (ACP)**: Antibiotics should not be prescribed unless pneumonia is suspected or pertussis is confirmed.

- **American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)**: Avoid routine antibiotics in immunocompetent adult outpatients with acute bronchitis [^1179Kpu9].

- **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)**: Emphasize patient education, delayed prescribing, and supportive care to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use [^113hYQ39].

---

## Alternative treatments and supportive care

Supportive care remains the **cornerstone** of acute bronchitis management, with rest and hydration essential for symptom relief and recovery [^1123gz4m]. Humidified air and nasal saline irrigation also provide symptomatic relief [^1123gz4m]. Patient education, including setting expectations about **symptom duration (2–3 weeks)**, reduces **unnecessary antibiotic requests** [^115uFvJ7].

---

## Impact of antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistance **significantly impacts** bronchitis management by reducing antibiotic effectiveness and limiting treatment options, complicating management [^114jEj5y]. It also increases healthcare costs through longer illnesses, more doctor visits, and additional treatments [^114jEj5y]. Resistance is also a major global public health concern, necessitating **prudent antibiotic use** [^113CBRJd].

---

Antibiotics are **not recommended for routine** acute bronchitis treatment due to modest benefits and significant risks. They are reserved for specific clinical scenarios, with supportive care and patient education as primary management strategies.

### Poor congruence with guidelines in the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis: a descriptive study based on electronic health records [^111GMKWc]. Family Practice (2016).

Although acute bronchitis is frequently viral in nature, antibiotics are usually inappropriately prescribed in primary care to treat this condition, with serious public health consequences.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence and predictors of appropriate management of antibiotic use in acute bronchitis processes diagnosed in outpatients in the Spanish region of Aragón.

- **Methods**: Four different electronic health databases provided demographic and clinical information pertaining to patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis in primary care in Aragón during 2011, as well as data for corresponding antibiotic prescriptions dispensed at pharmacies. We evaluated adherence to recommendations for antibiotic use in acute bronchitis episodes in adults collected in both international and national guidelines. Finally, regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with appropriate antibiotic management.

- **Results**: A total of 54,701 episodes of acute bronchitis were registered, 9.5% of which corresponded to patients with an underlying chronic respiratory disease. In adults, antibiotics were prescribed in 64.9% of episodes, 17.9% of which involved prescription of a first-choice agent. Overall, 48.5% of episodes were appropriately managed according to guidelines. The likelihood of appropriate treatment was higher for female patients, and lower for patients who were older, presented chronic comorbidities, or were using corticoids.

- **Conclusions**: We observed poor levels of adherence to recommendations for antibiotic prescribing in adults with acute bronchitis.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages.

Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available.

Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including the use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limiting.

### An intervention with access to C-reactive protein rapid test reduces antibiotic overprescribing in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD [^115TzxAp]. Family Practice (2015). Low credibility.

In acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), antibiotic overprescribing leads to antimicrobial resistance, while underprescribing may result in poor patient outcomes.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate changes in over- and underprescribing of antibiotics after two interventions to optimize antibiotic prescribing in AECOPD in Spain.

- **Methods**: In 2008 and 2009, general practitioners (GPs) registered patients during a 3-week period before and after interventions. Two types of intervention were conducted: GPs in the full-intervention group (FIG) were exposed to a multifaceted intervention and given access to a C-reactive protein (CRP) rapid test. The partial-intervention group (PIG) was only exposed to the multifaceted intervention. Overprescribing was defined as antibiotics given to type III* exacerbation (≤ one Anthonisen Criteria), and underprescribing was defined as no antibiotics given to type I exacerbation (three Anthonisen Criteria). A multivariate logistic regression model was used, considering antibiotic prescribing as the dependent variable.

- **Results**: A total of 210 GPs and 70 GPs were assigned to FIG and PIG, respectively, and 952 AECOPD patients were eligible for the main analysis. After adjusting for clustering at the GP level and for patient age and sex, it was found that GPs in FIG significantly reduced antibiotic overprescribing (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18–0.68, P = 0.003) while underprescribing was not significantly increased (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.0, P = 0.075). No statistically significant changes were found in the PIG.

### Is co-morbidity taken into account in the antibiotic management of elderly patients with acute bronchitis and COPD exacerbations [^114By5hM]. Family Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Guidelines on acute lower respiratory tract infections recommend restrictive use of antibiotics; however, in patients with relevant co-morbid conditions, treatment with antibiotics should be considered. Presently, it is unknown whether GPs adhere to these guidelines and target antibiotic treatment more often at patients with risk-elevating conditions.

- **Objectives**: We assessed whether in elderly primary care patients with acute bronchitis or exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), antibiotics are more often prescribed to patients with risk-elevating co-morbid conditions.

- **Methods**: Using the Utrecht GP research database, we analysed 2,643 episodes in patients of 65 years of age or older with a GP-diagnosed acute bronchitis or exacerbation of COPD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to determine independent determinants of antibiotic use.

- **Results**: Antibiotic prescribing rates were high in both acute bronchitis (84%) and in exacerbations of COPD (53%). In acute bronchitis, only age was an independent determinant of antibiotic use [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003–1.048], whereas in exacerbations of COPD, antibiotics were more often prescribed to male patients (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.5), patients with diabetes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.4), and heart failure (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.7).

- **Conclusion**: Dutch GPs prescribe antibiotics in the majority of elderly patients with acute bronchitis and in half of the episodes of exacerbations of COPD. Tailoring their antibiotic treatment according to the presence or absence of high-risk conditions is necessary.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^112skr5A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections, including bacterial infections, viral infections, and infections of other etiologies. Early initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of bacterial ARIs and is associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, overuse of antibiotics by overprescription in outpatients with bronchitis, for instance, and prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with bacterial ARIs in the hospital and intensive care setting are associated with increased resistance for common bacteria, high costs, and adverse drug reactions. The safe reduction in antibiotic use is therefore of utmost importance.

In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections because higher levels are found in severe bacterial infections than in viral infections and nonspecific inflammatory diseases. Hence, PCT may be used to support clinical decision-making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of such a strategy in different ARI patient populations and different settings, ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). Most individual trials, however, lacked the statistical power to assess the risk of mortality and severe infectious disease complications associated with PCT-guided decision-making.

We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis of trials comparing th.

### Acute bronchitis: Rapid evidence review [^114spc5q]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend not routinely obtaining tests for inflammatory markers, such as CRP and procalcitonin levels, for diagnosing acute bronchitis or guiding antibiotic initiation. Recognize that CRP testing at the point-of-care in patients with acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis, may reduce antibiotic prescriptions in primary care without affecting recovery rates. There is insufficient evidence regarding the impact of procalcitonin testing on antibiotic prescriptions in primary care.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^117W6Ztp]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute bronchitis [^114E7k7E]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common symptom bringing patients to the primary care physician's office, and acute bronchitis is usually the diagnosis in these patients. Acute bronchitis should be differentiated from other common diagnoses, such as pneumonia and asthma, because these conditions may need specific therapies not indicated for bronchitis. Symptoms of bronchitis typically last about three weeks. The presence or absence of colored (e.g. green) sputum does not reliably differentiate between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections. Viruses are responsible for more than 90 percent of acute bronchitis infections.

Antibiotics are generally not indicated for bronchitis and should be used only if pertussis is suspected, to reduce transmission, or if the patient is at increased risk of developing pneumonia (e.g. patients 65 years or older). The typical therapies for managing acute bronchitis symptoms have been shown to be ineffective, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends against using cough and cold preparations in children younger than six years. The supplement pelargonium may help reduce symptom severity in adults.

As patient expectations for antibiotics and therapies for symptom management differ from evidence-based recommendations, effective communication strategies are necessary to provide the safest therapies available while maintaining patient satisfaction.

### Delayed antibiotic prescribing strategies for respiratory tract infections in primary care: Pragmatic, factorial, randomised controlled trial [^112heeKh]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of different strategies involving delayed antibiotic prescription for acute respiratory tract infections.

This research was designed as an open, pragmatic, parallel group, factorial, randomised controlled trial and was set in primary care in the United Kingdom. A total of 889 patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory tract infections were recruited between 3 March 2010 and 28 March 2012 by 53 health professionals in 25 practices.

- **Interventions**: Patients who were judged not to need immediate antibiotics were randomised to undergo four strategies of delayed prescription: recontact for a prescription, post-dated prescription, collection of the prescription, and being given the prescription (patient-led). During the trial, a strategy of no antibiotic prescription was added as another randomised comparison. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was mean symptom severity on a 0–6 scale at days 2–4. Additional measures included antibiotic use and patients' beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotic use. Secondary analysis considered comparisons with immediate use of antibiotics.

- **Results**: Mean symptom severity showed minimal differences between the strategies involving no prescription and delayed prescription (recontact, post-date, collection, patient-led; 1.62, 1.60, 1.82, 1.68, and 1.75, respectively; likelihood ratio test χ² = 2.61, P = 0.625). The duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse also showed no significant difference between no prescription and delayed prescription strategies combined (median 3 days versus 4 days; χ² = 4.29, P = 0.368). There were modest and non-significant differences in patient outcomes.

### Rescue therapy for refractory infection: current status and future concepts [^113m6Bkq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Optimization of antibiotic selection and duration is a critical yet challenging clinical decision, particularly in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance following treatment failure. Clinicians must consider multiple factors when selecting antibiotics, including drug allergies, previous antibiotic exposure, available testing tools, available antibiotics, and local prevalence of antibiotic resistance.

Ideally, susceptibility testing-guided therapy is recommended prior to rescue therapy and even before first-line therapy whenever feasible to improve eradication rates. When bacterial susceptibility is demonstrated, the regimen containing a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth plus two susceptible antibiotics, is not inferior to PPI with three susceptible antibiotics. Both regimens are recommended as rescue therapy.

- **Phenotypical method**: The gold standard for antibiotic susceptibility testing is the culture-based phenotypical method followed by endoscopic biopsy. However, the successful culture rate may be below 80% in patients who have had treatment failure, and culturing H. pylori is time-consuming and expensive.

- **Genotyping**: This method detects gene mutations to predict antibiotic resistance. H. pylori resistance against clarithromycin and levofloxacin by genotyping is reliable, but other antibiotic resistances are not well established.

Whole genome or next-generation sequencing might provide precise predictions of antibiotic resistance. Ultimately, although susceptibility-guided treatment is recommended in rescue therapy, the supporting evidence is limited.

### Delayed antibiotic prescribing strategies for respiratory tract infections in primary care: Pragmatic, factorial, randomised controlled trial [^114FGnqL]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of different strategies involving delayed antibiotic prescription for acute respiratory tract infections. The design was an open, pragmatic, parallel group, factorial, randomised controlled trial set in primary care in the United Kingdom.

A total of 889 patients aged 3 years and over, with acute respiratory tract infection, were recruited between 3 March 2010 and 28 March 2012 by 53 health professionals in 25 practices.

Patients judged not to need immediate antibiotics were randomized to undergo four strategies of delayed prescription: recontact for a prescription, post-dated prescription, collection of the prescription, and being given the prescription (patient led). During the trial, a strategy of no antibiotic prescription was added as another randomized comparison. The analysis was intention to treat.

- **Main outcome measures**: Mean symptom severity (0–6 scale) at days 2–4 (primary outcome), antibiotic use, and patients' beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotic use. Secondary analysis included comparison with immediate use of antibiotics.

Results indicated that mean symptom severity had minimal differences between the strategies involving no prescription and delayed prescription (recontact, post-date, collection, patient led; 1.62, 1.60, 1.82, 1.68, 1.75, respectively; likelihood ratio test χ² = 2.61, P = 0.625). The duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse also did not differ between no prescription and delayed prescription strategies combined (median 3 days vs 4 days; 4.29, P = 0.368). There were modest and non-significant differences in patient outcomes.

### Effect of point of care testing for C reactive protein and training in communication skills on antibiotic use in lower respiratory tract infections: Cluster randomised trial [^111gXUJR]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Contrasting broad approaches to improved management in general medicine have been emphasized. A disease-focused approach seeks to improve diagnosis, whereas the illness-focused, patient-centered approach emphasizes understanding the whole patient and sharing decisions. This latter approach may be more contingent on clear information about prognosis rather than making an accurate diagnosis. A combination of these approaches, however, may be required to achieve the best outcome for patients. We evaluated the effect of two interventions on achieving evidence-based management of lower respiratory tract infections in primary care.

Lower respiratory tract infection is one of the most common acute reasons for consultation, accounting for 17 million consultations in the European Union and 11 million in the United States each year. Acute bronchitis accounts for 80% of lower respiratory tract infections, and despite evidence of little or no benefit from antibiotics, up to 80% of patients consulting for this condition are prescribed them. Moreover, lower respiratory tract infection is associated with increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Everyday decisions about whether or what antibiotic to prescribe for lower respiratory tract infections therefore constitute an important part of the burden of antibiotic use that drives antimicrobial resistance.

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Diagnostic or disease-focused solutions address the limited value of medical history and physical examination in differentiating between pneumonia and self-limiting acute bronchitis. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the chances of inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Acute bronchitis: A review of diagnosis and evidence-based management [^111Ltura]. Primary Care Update for Ob/Gyns (2002). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bronchitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bronchitis is a transient inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree in response to infection without a history of chronic pulmonary disease or evidence of pneumonia or sinusitis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common cause of acute bronchitis is viruses (90%), including adenovirus, influenza, measles, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and HSV. Nonviral (10%) causes include bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and inhaled lung irritants.

- **Disease course**: Inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree results in acute bronchitis, which causes clinical manifestations of cough (dry or productive), chest tightness, burning with or without wheezing, headache, low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and myalgia.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute bronchitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^113ptkgp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease:

1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with a cough lasting three weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.

2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of the duration of the cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed, and antimicrobial therapy initiated.

3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. The BAAP study protocol [^113ket9Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In recent years, the idea that acute bronchitis is more of an inflammatory than an infectious process has begun to take shape. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to be effective in reducing the duration and intensity of cough in patients with bronchitis in observational studies and are therefore recommended in clinical practice guidelines. However, their effectiveness has not been observed in clinical trials; currently, no study has been published comparing the role of anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics. We designed this clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of ibuprofen (the most frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drug in Spain) compared with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (the antibiotic most often prescribed by Spanish primary care physicians), as well as compared to a placebo group of healthy adult patients with acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration.

- **Objectives**: The aim of the study is to evaluate the number of days of frequent cough (defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more) in the three treatment arms (oral anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, or placebo) taken during 10 days. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy on the second visit, assess the speed of action in the resolution of the symptoms of acute bronchitis in the three treatment arms, analyze the relationship between C-reactive protein concentrations and the resolution of the symptoms in each treatment arm, and evaluate the secondary effects and adverse reactions in the three treatment arms.

### Antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections and acute bronchitis: A longitudinal analysis of general practitioner trainees [^114jEj5y]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat, with an attributable mortality of 1.27 million deaths in 2019. The number of deaths is expected to rise if efforts to reduce antibiotic prescribing are not made. The majority of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care, and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing contributes significantly to this crisis. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing refers to prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics provide little-to-no benefit, including self-limiting respiratory diseases such as acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis (hereafter referred to as acute bronchitis) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs).

In Australian general practice, antibiotics were prescribed in 81.5% of diagnoses of acute bronchitis, and in 35.8% of cases of URTI in 2019. Although overall antibiotic use in Australia is trending downwards, greater reductions are needed. Guidelines clearly state that antibiotics are not indicated for these conditions due to compelling evidence for lack of substantive benefit.

General practitioner (GP) registrars, who are vocational trainees in general practice, are of particular interest regarding appropriate antibiotic prescribing. They comprised approximately 10% of the GP workforce in Australia by headcount in 2020. Although registrars have lower antibiotic prescribing rates compared to their established GP colleagues, their prescribing is still high. However, their antibiotic prescribing habits have been shown to be amenable to educational interventions. The effect of these interventions could have a long-term impact as antibiotic prescribing habits establish.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^111FGJZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

- **Main results**: We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5,099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3,841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome).

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: Review of recent statements and position papers [^114Zrbnc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasize the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113t7aCp]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi characterized by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (e.g. cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (e.g. genetic factors and respiratory infections) that result in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is known as COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, it is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, provided that conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of literature published in the English language.

### Prudent use of antibiotics: Are our expectations justified [^112Dsq6p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Prudent use of antibiotics has three components: rational use, adherence to local guidelines and policies, and avoidance or reversal of upward demographic trends in antibiotic resistance. Although rational use is mandatory, it must be recognized that adherence to policies will reduce clinical freedom, for good or ill. **Expectations**: Expectations that prudent use will deliver reversals in resistance trends should be accepted with caution. **Data and detection**: Sound, pertinent data are lacking, and our ability to detect change, if it does occur, and to attribute its cause correctly, is questionable.

**Are antibiotics effective for acute bronchitis?** Prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis was associated with reduced overall and nighttime cough and with an approximately half-day reduction in the duration of cough, days feeling ill, and days with impaired activities. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences between patients receiving antibiotics and those receiving a placebo in terms of overall clinical improvements or limitations in work or other activities. There was a significant increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114eN7Wy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

Most patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of their use remains uncertain. Some controlled trials of antibiotics have shown benefit (Berry 1960; Pines 1972) while others have not (Elmes 1965b; Nicotra 1982).

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of the literature estimating the value of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005); EMBASE (1974 to December 2005); Web of Science (December 2005), and other electronically available databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic (for a minimum of five days) and placebo.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were analysed using Review Manager software. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risks (RR) (and 95% CI) were calculated for all dichotomous data. Where appropriate, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and 95% CI were calculated.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials with 917 patients were included. Ten trials used increased cough, sputum volume, and purulence diagnostic criteria for COPD exacerbation. Eight hundred and fifty-seven patients provided data for outcomes including mortality, treatment failure, increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, PaCO₂, PaO₂, peak flow, and adverse events.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on Puhan et al [^115PTo5q]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low Credibility.

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities: acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease, with good evidence suggesting that antibiotics are of no benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can have bacterial, viral, or mixed etiology, with bacterial infections currently estimated to contribute to up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work and deterioration of health status to progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al. this month in BMC Medicine argues that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to "mild to moderate" exacerbations of COPD.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotics: What studies are still needed [^114k3YFH]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) remains a subject of controversy despite considerable medical and socioeconomic implications. The contribution of bacterial infection to AECBs is difficult to assess in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are chronically colonized with respiratory pathogens. Several studies suggest a major role of viral infections in AECBs. It is unlikely that all COPD patients will benefit from antibiotics during AECBs; in particular, the benefit in mild COPD remains uncertain. Unfortunately, the number of studies complying with evidence-based medicine requirements is too small for definite recommendations to be drawn up for AECBs. Considering the impact of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on COPD patients and the community, as well as the impact of antibiotic therapy on the development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for the design of appropriate multicentric studies to define the usefulness of this type of treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Kxyq1]. Chest (2006). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common respiratory condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and management strategies.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis are based on four key components. The first component is the presence of symptoms indicative of an acute respiratory infection, predominantly cough, with or without sputum production. The second component is the duration of these symptoms, which should be less than three weeks. The third component involves ruling out pneumonia, both clinically and radiographically, as the cause of the cough. The final component requires the exclusion of other potential causes of the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered likely if all four components are met. Conversely, if these criteria are not fully met, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the clinical assessment of patients presenting with cough and other symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection, helping to distinguish acute bronchitis from other respiratory conditions.

### Changing the antibiotic prescribing of Australian general practice registrars' for acute respiratory tract infections: a non-randomized controlled trial [^115Lr6Hh]. Family Practice (2025). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a global health concern, with over one million deaths estimated as attributable to bacterial resistance in 2019. Antibiotic overprescribing is a key contributor to antibiotic resistance, and much of this prescribing occurs in primary care. In Australia, a large proportion of antibiotic overprescribing occurs for non-pneumonia acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), of which acute bronchitis is an important component.

Evidence-based guidelines consistently recommend against prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis, as there is evidence of minimal, if any, clinical benefit. Despite this, Australian general practitioners (GPs) prescribed antibiotics in 81% of acute bronchitis cases in 2021. Prescribing rates for other ARTIs — such as upper respiratory tract infection (antibiotics not recommended), acute otitis media, acute sore throat, and acute sinusitis (antibiotics recommended in only a minority of cases) — are similarly in excess of Australian and international benchmarks. This evidence highlights a need to reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs in the primary care setting.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: Randomised placebo controlled trial [^117Trb6b]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The primary outcome measured was the mean duration of cough, which was 14.6 days (SD 6 days). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Figure 2) illustrated the time with frequent cough. The median number of days until the last day patients scored ≥ 1 in both daytime and nighttime cough after the baseline visit was 10 days (95% confidence interval: 9 to 11 days). Days with frequent cough were slightly fewer among patients assigned to ibuprofen (9 days, 95% confidence interval: 8 to 10 days) compared to those receiving amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (11 days, 95% confidence interval: 10 to 12 days) or placebo (11 days, 95% confidence interval: 8 to 14 days). No statistically significant differences were observed between the study groups (log rank test = 0.25).

- **Fig 2 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis**: Illustrates days with frequent cough — time (days) from baseline visit until the patient last scored ≥ 1 for both daytime and nighttime cough.

- **Table 2 Clinical efficacy results**: Summary at end of treatment visit in study arm. Values are medians (95% confidence interval) unless stated otherwise.

Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted on patients who returned their diaries (390 and 345, respectively). Neither amoxicillin-clavulanic acid nor ibuprofen significantly increased the likelihood of cough resolution compared with placebo (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 1.35 and 1.23, 95% confidence interval: 0.93 to 1.61, respectively). To investigate the hazard ratio for the probability of cough resolution, adjusting for potential confounders, three models were calculated: model 1 (crude model), model 2 (including treatment group, C-reactive protein ≥ 8 mg/L, and temperature).

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. The BAAP study protocol [^114B4Did]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care. In more than 90% of the cases, antibiotics are prescribed, especially when purulent expectoration is present. However, this condition is usually viral in origin, rendering the benefits of antibiotic treatment marginal. In recent years, bronchitis has been increasingly considered more of an inflammatory than an infectious process. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an oral anti-inflammatory treatment compared with an antibiotic regimen and a placebo group.

- **Methods and design**: A total of 420 patients, aged 15 to 70 years, with no associated comorbidity and presenting with a respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, will be included. The predominant symptom is a cough, with purulent expectoration and at least one other respiratory tract symptom (such as dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort, or pain), and no alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with placebo. Patients will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxycillin with clavulanic acid, or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough, as defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.

- **Discussion**: This trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough when treated with anti-inflammatory medication, compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo, in previously healthy patients with clinical symptoms of acute bronchitis.

### Antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections and acute bronchitis: a longitudinal analysis of general practitioner trainees [^113e54oA]. Family Practice (2022). High credibility.

Implications for practice

GP registrars prescribe considerably fewer antibiotics for both URTI and acute bronchitis compared with established GPs, and prescribing rates have declined in the past 10 years. URTI antibiotic prescribing is relatively low, more in line with clinical guidelines. An intervention to reduce antibiotic prescribing found no significant change in prescribing for URTI in this registrar population and may, thus, have been subject to a "ceiling" effect. Registrar prescribing for acute bronchitis, however, remains inappropriately high at 72%. This represents a continuing high burden of unnecessary antibiotic use.

Other countries have achieved much lower prescribing rates and have low rates of antibiotic resistance. National antibiotic prescribing levels need to reduce further to have the desired impact on antimicrobial resistance, which may be achieved through targeting the next generation of GPs. Previous evidence suggests that focused education of registrars can reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute bronchitis. Wider implementation of similar educational strategies is essential.

- **Chest X-ray**: Will be considered positive if there is any complication such as pulmonary condensation (in which case, the patient will be excluded from the study) or negative.

- **Symptom diary**: Five symptoms will be evaluated: disease severity, daytime cough, nighttime cough, limitation in daily activity, and febrile sensation. Each of the symptoms will be scored from 0 to 4. It will be recommended that the patient fill out this diary before going to bed. This symptom diary has previously been used in other studies.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^111sZQww]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

The efficacy of antibiotics is well established in purulent exacerbations of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recently our group demonstrated the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in outpatients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbations and increased purulence. However, in the study we show that these results in patients with purulent sputum cannot be extrapolated to people with milder acute bronchitis without underlying pulmonary disease, even if they produce discoloured sputum.

Evidence of the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in this acute respiratory tract infection is lacking. More studies have been published on the common cold, but these studies failed to show a consistent benefit. In a meta-analysis including six clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with placebo and other treatments on the signs and symptoms of the common cold, these drugs failed to shorten the duration of cough but significantly relieved discomfort and pain. In a placebo controlled double blind trial in experimental rhinovirus infection, the combination of ibuprofen (400 mg) plus chlorpheniramine (12 mg), administered every 12 hours for 4–5 days, reduced cough significantly, although the effect was optimal when combined with an intranasal antiviral compound (interferon alfa). Two clinical trials comparing oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics in acute bronchitis were published some time ago. In a small clinical trial carried out in Italy, Girbino…

### Prospective study of the incidence, aetiology and outcome of adult lower respiratory tract illness in the community [^115ZktcZ]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Acute lower respiratory tract illness in previously well adults is usually labeled as acute bronchitis and treated with antibiotics without establishing the aetiology. Viral infection is thought to be the cause in most cases. We have investigated the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of this condition.

- **Methods**: Previously well adults from a stable suburban population consulting over one year with a lower respiratory tract illness were studied. For the first six months, detailed investigations identified predetermined direct and indirect markers of infection. Evidence of infection was assessed in relation to presenting clinical features, indirect markers of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome.

- **Results**: Consultations were very common, particularly in younger women (70/1000 per year in previously well women aged 16–39 years), mainly in the winter months; 638 patients consulted, of whom 316 were investigated. Pathogens were identified in 173 (55%) cases: bacteria in 82 (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54, Haemophilus influenzae 31, Moraxella catarrhalis 7), atypical organisms in 75 (Chlamydia pneumoniae 55, Mycoplasma pneumoniae 23), and viruses in 61 (influenza 23). Seventy-nine (24%) had indirect evidence of infection. Bacterial and atypical infections correlated with changes in the chest radiograph and high levels of C-reactive protein but not with (a) the GP's clinical assessment of whether infection was present, (b) clinical features other than focal chest signs, and (c) outcome, whether or not appropriate antibiotics were prescribed.

- **Conclusions**: Over 50% of patients showed evidence of infection, indicating the significant presence of bacterial and viral pathogens in lower respiratory tract illnesses within the community.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116m7gc6]. Chest (2006). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute bronchitis, more specifically concerning chest X-rays (CXR), the 2006 ACCP guidelines recommend avoiding routine CXR in patients with acute cough and sputum production who meet all of the following criteria:

- **Heart rate**: ≤ 100 beats/min
- **Respiratory rate**: ≤ 24 breaths/min
- **Oral body temperature**: ≤ 38 °C
- **Chest examination**: Normal

These criteria help minimize unnecessary testing while ensuring patient safety.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: Randomised placebo controlled trial [^113wvMtz]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterized by a cough without pneumonia. It is a prevalent disease and one of the most common reasons for visits in primary care. Patients often return to their doctor or seek other medical help as symptoms may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be bothersome for some patients and could last for up to four weeks or more.

Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsy samples have never shown bacterial invasion. It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response of the epithelium of the bronchi to infections. Microscopic examination shows a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These findings are consistent with proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography.

### Acute bronchitis: Rapid evidence review [^115uFvJ7]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend informing patients that acute bronchitis lasts an average of 2–3 weeks to set appropriate expectations and reduce requests for antibiotics. Describing the infection as a chest cold can help improve patient satisfaction when antibiotics are not prescribed.

### Zithromax [^113DzSSZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of azithromycin in several conditions.

- **Adult patients**:

	- **Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis**: In a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial, azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) for treating acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate at Days 21 to 24. Among the 304 patients analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat analysis at the Days 21 to 24 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 85% (125/147) compared to 82% (129/157) for 10 days of clarithromycin.

	- **Clinical cure rates by pathogen for bacteriologically evaluable patients at Days 21 to 24 visit**:

		- *S. pneumoniae*: Azithromycin 29/32 (91%), Clarithromycin 21/27 (78%)

		- *H. influenzae*: Azithromycin 12/14 (86%), Clarithromycin 14/16 (88%)

		- *M. catarrhalis*: Azithromycin 11/12 (92%), Clarithromycin 12/15 (80%)

	- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: In another randomized, double-blind, double-dummy controlled clinical trial, azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg three times a day for 10 days). Clinical response assessments were made at Day 10 and Day 28. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate at Day 28. For the 594 patients analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat analysis at the Day 10 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 88% (268/303) compared to 85% (248/291) for 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate.

### Evaluating an urgent care antibiotic stewardship intervention: A multi-network collaborative effort [^113CBRJd]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). High credibility.

Overall, the antibiotic stewardship intervention was associated with reduced rates of inappropriate prescribing for both bronchitis and viral URTI diagnoses in this large, geographically diverse collection of UCCs. This study highlights the importance of direct clinician engagement with stewardship efforts and provides a broadly applicable approach to antibiotic stewardship implementation in UCCs.

### "Give me five": The case for 5 days of antibiotics as the default duration for acute respiratory tract infections [^113K67Vi]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) account for most antibiotic prescriptions in pediatrics. Although US guidelines continue to recommend ≥ 10 days of antibiotics for common ARTIs, evidence suggests that 5-day courses can be safe and effective. Academic imprinting seems to play a major role in the continued use of prolonged antibiotic durations.

In this report, we discuss the evidence supporting short antibiotic courses for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. We discuss the basis for prolonged antibiotic course recommendations and recent literature investigating shorter courses. Prescribers in the United States should overcome academic imprinting and follow international trends to reduce antibiotic durations for common ARTIs, where 5 days is a safe and efficacious course when antibiotics are prescribed.

In response to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which has led to increasing bacterial resistance and decreasing development of new antibiotics, the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) has developed criteria to guide appropriate and accurate antibiotic selection. The criteria are aimed at optimizing antibiotic therapy and include evidence-based results, therapeutic benefits, safety, selection of the optimal drug for the optimal duration, and cost-effectiveness.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114VGSCJ]. Chest (2006). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of acute bronchitis, specifically related to diagnostic criteria, the ACCP 2006 guidelines recommend diagnosing acute bronchitis in patients with an acute respiratory infection primarily manifested by cough, with or without sputum production, lasting ≤ 3 weeks. This diagnosis should be made if there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, common cold, acute asthma, or COPD exacerbation.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: Randomised placebo controlled trial [^116LYh4h]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

One of the results of this study indicates that antibiotic treatment was not more effective than placebo in shortening the duration of cough. Systematic analyses of clinical trials also suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit marginal, in the duration of the symptoms. A review of the Cochrane Library showed that patients given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough than those given placebo (risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.85), but these results came from only four clinical trials with 275 participants in total.

Another randomised clinical trial, based on data from the genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE) study, not included in the Cochrane Library review, has recently been published. It constitutes, by far, the largest study carried out, including 16 networks in 12 European countries with 2061 adults aged 18 or older with acute cough of less than one month's duration as the prominent symptom, once pneumonia was excluded on the basis of clinical grounds. Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, considered as the main outcome, lasted a median of six days in the group allocated to amoxicillin 3 g daily and seven days in the placebo group, with a non-significant difference (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.18).

Similar to our study design, Stott and colleagues included only patients with acute bronchitis and purulent sputum and did not observe any statistically significant differences in the outcomes.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. The BAAP study protocol [^114yaam3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We will accept a null hypothesis if the number of days of frequent cough in the anti-inflammatory arm is the same or ± 2 days as that observed in the other two treatment arms (placebo and antibiotic treatment). Based on the literature, the standard deviation of the duration of frequent cough is 5.5 days in patients with chronic bronchitis and purulent sputum. For an α: 0.05 and a β: 0.2 and accepting possible losses of 15%, we calculate that the sample size should be 140 patients per group, resulting in a total of 420 patients.

- **Analysis**: Intention-to-treat statistical analyses will be performed. To analyze the time until cure of the different symptoms and for the main result variable (days from the onset of the picture until the patient scores a maximum of 1 in the box related to cough in the symptom diary), survival analysis will be carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between the three survival curves will be undertaken using the log-rank test. In addition, bivariate analysis will be performed with comparison of proportions using the chi-square test to evaluate secondary variables of the study and variance analysis to assess the relationship between quantitative variables for both independent and paired data.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^112JFNM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014), and LILACS (1982 to January 2014).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

- **Main results**: Seventeen trials with 3,936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3,841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by a cough with or without phlegm production lasting for up to three weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for more than three weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

- **Results**: Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment strategies are incomplete or outdated, making it difficult to establish robust treatment protocols.

### Delayed antibiotic prescribing strategies for respiratory tract infections in primary care: Pragmatic, factorial, randomised controlled trial [^114jS2iN]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

Acute respiratory tract infections are the most common acute conditions managed in primary care, and controlling symptoms is a central concern for patients and parents of young patients. Patients' expectations and practitioners' perceptions of those expectations have contributed to increased prescribing, with antibiotic use in primary care rising progressively following a reduction following a peak in the late 1990s. This trend is a key driver for antibiotic resistance, potentially making major infections untreatable.

Delayed prescription is recommended in international guidance, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence currently advises using either a no antibiotic prescription strategy or a delayed antibiotic prescription strategy for dealing with uncomplicated acute sore throats and other respiratory infections. Systematic reviews of delayed prescription — where the patient is advised to wait for at least the expected natural history of the illness before using the prescription — have concluded that this strategy effectively reduces antibiotic use but may result in poor symptom control. There has been recent debate about whether completely withholding antibiotics is preferable to delayed prescription due to slightly lower antibiotic use.

Trial data for acute sore throat and chest infections suggest that an immediate prescription, and particularly a delayed antibiotic prescription, could reduce reconsultation compared to a no prescription strategy. However, the trials were underpowered to compare strategies and detect comprehensive outcomes.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. The BAAP study protocol [^112FbK2C]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care, and in more than 90% of the cases, antibiotics are prescribed, mainly when purulent expectoration is present. However, this process is usually viral in origin and the benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal. In recent years, bronchitis has been considered more as an inflammatory process than an infectious one. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a schedule of an oral anti-inflammatory compared with an antibiotic regimen and another group assigned to receive a placebo.

- **Methods and design**: A total of 420 patients from 15 to 70 years of age, with no associated comorbidity and presenting a respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, will be included in a prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trial with placebo. Patients will have cough as the predominant symptom, the presence of purulent expectoration, and at least one other symptom of the respiratory tract (such as dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort, or pain), with no alternative explanation such as pneumonia. They will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, or placebo for 10 days. The main outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough, defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.

- **Discussion**: This trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough with anti-inflammatory treatment compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo in previously healthy patients.
