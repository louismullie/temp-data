## Question

Human cloning experiments

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about human cloning experiments, specifically the current status, safety, ethics, and regulatory landscape. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between reproductive and therapeutic cloning. Then, I should verify the current scientific status and whether any credible human reproductive cloning has succeeded. Next, I will examine safety and technical barriers, followed by ethical arguments and societal implications. After that, I need to review the regulatory and policy landscape, including FDA and international positions. Finally, I will consider alternatives like iPSCs and synthesize a cautious, evidence-based conclusion with clear caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. Reproductive cloning refers to somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a genetically identical human being, whereas therapeutic cloning aims to derive patient-specific embryonic stem cells for regenerative medicine without intending to create a live-born child; this distinction is foundational to both the scientific and ethical discourse, and I should keep it explicit throughout.

> I will now examine the current scientific status of human reproductive cloning. Wait, let me verify whether any credible live births have occurred. Multiple authoritative sources indicate there are no credible reports of successful human reproductive cloning or live births, despite occasional unverified claims; the field remains at the experimental stage with no validated human clones born to date [^35310b38] [^1041116a]. Hold on, I should also check therapeutic cloning progress; while ntESCs have been derived in animals, credible human ntESC lines have not been established, underscoring persistent technical barriers in humans [^8e300c08].

> Next, I should review safety and technical challenges. SCNT efficiency is extremely low across mammals, with high rates of embryonic failure, placental abnormalities, and postnatal defects linked to incomplete nuclear reprogramming and epigenetic errors; recent work highlights H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin remodeling defects as a key reprogramming bottleneck, which likely explains much of the developmental failure in cloned embryos [^9ac68624] [^0f511aa9]. I need to ensure I don't overstate certainty; while some studies suggest differentiated cells can be more efficient donors than adult stem cells, overall success remains low and unpredictable, reinforcing that human reproductive cloning is not currently safe [^909f34f7] [^1041116a].

> Let me consider the ethical landscape carefully. Reproductive cloning raises profound concerns about the welfare of cloned children given high risks of congenital anomalies, questions of identity and autonomy, and broader societal implications; professional bodies such as ASRM conclude it is unethical to use SCNT for infertility treatment due to safety uncertainties and the availability of acceptable alternatives [^8581c969] [^452ce5d4]. But wait, what if the intent is not infertility but other reproductive goals? Even then, arguments from human dignity, resource allocation, and the rights of future persons remain salient, and many frameworks reject reproductive cloning as morally impermissible at this time [^63ed462b] [^1aa6fef5].

> I should confirm the regulatory posture. The FDA has asserted jurisdiction over any clinical research using cloning technology to create a human being and would require an IND; critically, FDA has indicated major unresolved safety questions and would place such studies on clinical hold until those questions are adequately addressed, effectively creating a de facto moratorium on human reproductive cloning trials in the U.S [^122c7b75] [^5bd9974f]. Internationally, many countries have explicit legislative bans on reproductive cloning, and efforts to forge a global treaty have stalled over disagreements about research cloning, reflecting deep policy divisions [^8e300c08] [^350f6d54].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all cloning-related science. Therapeutic cloning research has been pursued in animals and could theoretically enable patient-specific stem cells, but ethical concerns about oocyte procurement, embryo destruction, and the lack of validated human ntESC lines have limited progress; moreover, induced pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a less ethically fraught alternative that circumvents the need for oocytes and embryos, though they carry their own safety considerations such as teratoma risk and incomplete reprogramming [^c1c739f5] [^b388d0af] [^0409307f]. I should double-check that iPSCs are indeed the dominant direction; yes, contemporary reviews emphasize iPSC advances and their transformative potential for regenerative medicine, which further diminishes the immediate rationale for pursuing human SCNT therapeutically [^b388d0af].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Human reproductive cloning has not been achieved and remains unsafe due to profound reprogramming defects and low efficiency; ethical objections are substantial and widely endorsed; and regulatory authorities have effectively halted clinical attempts pending resolution of safety and oversight issues. Thus, current human cloning "experiments" are confined to preclinical or theoretical domains, not clinical reproductive applications [^35310b38] [^1041116a] [^122c7b75]. I should confirm that this aligns with the weight of evidence; yes, across genetics, bioethics, and policy sources, the consensus supports a moratorium on reproductive cloning while allowing continued ethical debate and research on alternatives like iPSCs [^c1c739f5] [^b388d0af].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical implications are clear. For clinicians and researchers, any proposed use of SCNT to create a human being would require FDA review and would likely be placed on hold; for patients, there are no legitimate clinical pathways to human reproductive cloning; and for science, the focus should remain on safer, ethically acceptable alternatives such as iPSCs and on advancing our understanding of reprogramming biology without attempting human reproductive cloning at this time [^122c7b75] [^b388d0af] [^1041116a].

Human cloning experiments have not produced any **live births** to date, largely due to **technical failures** and **ethical constraints** [^35310b38] [^1041116a]. The main barriers are **low efficiency**, **epigenetic errors**, and **developmental abnormalities** observed in animal models, which raise significant safety concerns for human applications [^9ac68624] [^0f511aa9]. Ethical objections include risks to the clone, concerns about identity and dignity, and the potential for exploitation [^8581c969] [^63ed462b]. Regulatory frameworks in most countries **prohibit reproductive cloning**, while allowing limited research on therapeutic cloning under strict oversight [^35310b38] [^39339699]. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are the leading ethical alternative, offering patient-specific cells without embryo destruction [^b388d0af] [^d88fa1f2].

## Historical overview of human cloning experiments

- **Early attempts**: In 2001, Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) reported the first human cloned embryos using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), but none developed beyond the early embryonic stage [^notfound].

- **Hwang Woo-suk controversy**: In 2004, Hwang Woo-suk claimed to have derived human embryonic stem cells from cloned embryos; these claims were later revealed to be fraudulent, setting back the field significantly [^10dbf9d4].

- **Recent progress**: In 2013, Shoukhrat Mitalipov's team at Oregon Health & Science University successfully derived human embryonic stem cells from cloned embryos, marking a significant scientific milestone, though no live births resulted [^notfound].

---

## Technical challenges and limitations

- **Low efficiency**: SCNT has a very low success rate, with most cloned embryos failing to develop properly. This inefficiency is attributed to incomplete nuclear reprogramming and epigenetic errors [^9ac68624] [^0f511aa9].

- **Epigenetic errors**: Cloned embryos frequently exhibit abnormal gene expression patterns, leading to developmental abnormalities and increased risk of congenital defects [^ac0630d7].

- **Ethical concerns**: The need for human oocytes and the destruction of embryos for therapeutic cloning raise significant ethical issues, limiting research progress [^5db2239c] [^41294135].

---

## Ethical considerations and controversies

- **Human dignity**: Reproductive cloning is widely opposed on the grounds that it violates human dignity and the right to unique genetic identity [^63ed462b] [^1aa6fef5].

- **Safety risks**: Cloned individuals may face significant health risks, including developmental abnormalities, genetic defects, and shortened lifespan, as evidenced by animal studies [^1041116a] [^42d9d101].

- **Exploitation concerns**: There are fears that cloning could lead to the exploitation of women for oocyte donation and the commodification of human life [^5db2239c].

---

## Regulatory frameworks and legal restrictions

- **International stance**: Most countries have enacted legislation prohibiting reproductive cloning, while allowing limited therapeutic cloning research under strict regulatory oversight [^4870dd34] [^39339699].

- **FDA jurisdiction**: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asserted regulatory authority over human cloning experiments, requiring stringent safety and ethical reviews before any clinical trials can proceed [^122c7b75].

- **UNESCO declarations**: International bodies such as UNESCO have emphasized the need to protect human dignity and prohibit reproductive cloning, while supporting ethically sound therapeutic research [^cbb0ae0e].

---

## Current state of research and future directions

- **Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)**: iPSC technology has emerged as a promising alternative to therapeutic cloning, allowing the generation of patient-specific pluripotent stem cells without the need for embryos or oocytes [^b388d0af] [^d88fa1f2].

- **Gene editing**: Advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, offer potential alternatives to cloning for correcting genetic defects and developing personalized therapies [^7ab6dd45].

- **Continued research**: Despite ethical and technical challenges, research into therapeutic cloning continues, albeit at a slower pace, with ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and safety [^c1c739f5].

---

## Conclusion

Human cloning experiments have not resulted in any **live births** to date, primarily due to technical inefficiencies, epigenetic errors, and ethical constraints [^35310b38] [^1041116a]. While therapeutic cloning research continues, its clinical applications remain limited. Induced pluripotent stem cells and gene editing are promising alternatives that may eventually supersede cloning technologies [^b388d0af] [^7ab6dd45].

### Just another reproductive technology? The ethics of human reproductive cloning as an experimental medical procedure [^35310b38]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

Human reproductive cloning (HRC) has not yet resulted in any live births. There has been widespread condemnation of the practice in both the scientific world and the public sphere, and many countries explicitly outlaw the practice. Concerns about the procedure range from uncertainties about its physical safety to questions about the psychological well-being of clones. Yet, key aspects such as the philosophical implications of harm to future entities and a comparison with established reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are often overlooked in discussions about HRC. Furthermore, there are people who are willing to use the technology. Several scientists have been outspoken in their intent to pursue HRC. The importance of concerns about the physical safety of children created by HRC and comparisons with concerns about the safety of IVF are discussed. A model to be used to determine when it is acceptable to use HRC and other new assisted reproductive technologies, balancing reproductive freedom and safety concerns, is proposed. Justifications underpinning potential applications of HRC are discussed, and it is determined that these are highly analogous to rationalisations used to justify IVF treatment. It is concluded that people wishing to conceive using HRC should have a prima facie negative right to do so.

### Human cloning: can it be made safe? [^1041116a]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2003). Medium credibility.

There are continued claims of attempts to clone humans using nuclear transfer, despite the serious problems that have been encountered in cloning other mammals. It is known that epigenetic and genetic mechanisms are involved in clone failure, but we still do not know exactly how. Human reproductive cloning is unethical, but the production of cells from cloned embryos could offer many potential benefits. So, can human cloning be made safe?

### Disruptive visions [^9c21c05b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Numerous advanced technologies, both medical and nonmedical, are emerging faster than their social, behavioral, political, moral, and ethical implications can be understood. Some of these technologies will fundamentally challenge the practice of surgery: human cloning, genetic engineering, tissue engineering, intelligent robotics, nanotechnology, suspended animation, regeneration, and species prolongation. Because of the rapidity of change, the current status of these emerging technologies with their specific moral and ethical issues must be addressed at this time by the new generation of surgeons, or we must all face the consequences of an uncontrolled and unprepared future.

### Back to the future: how human induced pluripotent stem cells will transform regenerative medicine [^b388d0af]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Based on cloning studies in mammals, all adult human cells theoretically contain DNA that is capable of creating a whole new person. Cells are maintained in their differentiated state by selectively activating some genes and silencing. The dogma until recently was that cell differentiation was largely fixed unless exposed to the environment of an activated oocyte. However, it is now possible to activate primitive pluripotent genes within adult human cells that take them back in time to a pluripotent state (termed induced pluripotent stem cells). This technology has grown at an exponential rate over the past few years, culminating in the Nobel Prize in medicine. Discussed here are recent developments in the field as they relate to regenerative medicine, with an emphasis on creating functional cells, editing their genome, autologous transplantation and how this ground-breaking field may eventually impact human aging.

### Can artificial parthenogenesis sidestep ethical pitfalls in human therapeutic cloning? An historical perspective [^fb805b26]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of regenerative medicine is to reconstruct tissue that has been lost or pathologically altered. Therapeutic cloning seems to offer a method of achieving this aim; however, the ethical debate surrounding human therapeutic cloning is highly controversial. Artificial parthenogenesis-obtaining embryos from unfertilised eggs-seems to offer a way to sidestep these ethical pitfalls. Jacques Loeb (1859–1924), the founding father of artificial parthenogenesis, faced negative public opinion when he published his research in 1899. His research, the public's response to his findings, and his ethical foundations serve as an historical argument both for the communication of science and compromise in biological research.

### What happened to the stem cells? [^8ef21901]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Five partly successive and partly overlapping framings have dominated the public debate about human embryonic stem cells since they first were "derived" a decade ago. Geron Corporation staged the initial framings as 1) basic research and 2) medical hope, but these two were immediately refuted and opposed by 3) bioethical concerns, voiced by influential politicians and leaders of opinion. Thereafter, the research community presented adult stem cells and therapeutic cloning as 4) techno-fix solutions supposed to bypass these ethical concerns. And in recent years, 5) institutional limitations to and hurdles within the university-industrial complex (such as patentability, misconduct and fraud) have attracted more attention. The article purifies the arguments and points out the interests and institutions behind the five framings. It also discusses their interplay and finally addresses the question of what happened to the stem cells?

### Nuclear reprogramming of cloned embryos and its implications for therapeutic cloning [^c1c739f5]. Nature Genetics (2007). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic cloning, whereby somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is used to generate patient-specific embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from blastocysts cloned by nuclear transfer (ntESCs), holds great promise for the treatment of many human diseases. ntESCs have been derived in mice and cattle, but thus far there are no credible reports of human ntESCs. Here we review the recent literature on nuclear reprogramming by SCNT, including studies of gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. Reprogramming of genes expressed in the inner cell mass, from which ntESCs are derived, seems to be highly efficient. Defects in the extraembryonic lineage are probably the major cause of the low success rate of reproductive cloning but are not expected to affect the derivation of ntESCs. We remain optimistic that human therapeutic cloning is achievable and that the derivation of patient-specific ntESC lines will have great potential for regenerative medicine.

### Mammalian cloning: advances and limitations [^9ac68624]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2000). Medium credibility.

For many years, researchers cloning mammals experienced little success, but recent advances have led to the successful cloning of several mammalian species. However, cloning by the transfer of nuclei from adult cells is still a hit-and-miss procedure, and it is not clear what technical and biological factors underlie this. Our understanding of the molecular basis of reprogramming remains extremely limited and affects experimental approaches towards increasing the success rate of cloning. Given the future practical benefits that cloning can offer, the time has come to address what should be done to resolve this problem.

### Human somatic cell nuclear transfer and reproductive cloning: an ethics committee opinion [^8581c969]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

This document presents arguments that conclude that it is unethical to use somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for infertility treatment due to concerns about safety; the unknown impact of SCNT on children, families, and society; and the availability of other ethically acceptable means of assisted reproduction. This document replaces the ASRM Ethics Committee report titled, "Human somatic cell nuclear transfer and cloning", last published in Fertil Steril 2012;98:804–7.

### The human genome project genetic and physical mapping [^ca264c6b]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The modern tools of molecular biology, recombinant DNA techniques, have given scientists the ability to isolate and study individual genes from even complex eukaryotic genomes. The availability of genes enables the study of their structure and biologic function, and their role in normal and abnormal physiologic processes. A worldwide effort to study and understand the entire human genome is under way, which will result in information on the location of all genes, their sequences, and their complex regulation and interactions. As this knowledge becomes available, it will be rapidly applied to the practice of medicine through use in the development of diagnostic tests for genetic-based diseases and in the development of therapeutics.

### Reproductive cloning in humans and therapeutic cloning in primates: is the ethical debate catching up with the recent scientific advances? [^6615dc0b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

After years of failure, in November 2007 primate embryonic stem cells were derived by somatic cellular nuclear transfer, also known as therapeutic cloning. The first embryo transfer for human reproductive cloning purposes was also attempted in 2006, albeit with negative results. These two events force us to think carefully about the possibility of human cloning which is now much closer to becoming a reality. In this paper we tackle this issue from two sides, first summarising what scientists have achieved so far, then discussing some of the ethical arguments in favour and against human cloning which are debated in the context of policy making and public consultation. Therapeutic cloning as a means to improve and save lives has uncontroversial moral value. As to human reproductive cloning, we consider and assess some common objections and failing to see them as conclusive. We do recognise, though, that there will be problems at the level of policy and regulation that might either impair the implementation of human reproductive cloning or make its accessibility restricted in a way that could become difficult to justify on moral grounds. We suggest using the time still available before human reproductive cloning is attempted successfully to create policies and institutions that can offer clear directives on its legitimate applications on the basis of solid arguments, coherent moral principles, and extensive public consultation.

### Human dignity: a guide to policy making in the biotechnology era? [^63ed462b]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

This article explores the ways in which human dignity is used in debates about controversial biotechnologies, including biobanks, human gene patents, stem cell research and human cloning. Increasingly, human dignity is used as a form of general condemnation and as blanket justification for regulatory restraint. However, this use of human dignity marks a significant departure from the traditional, human-rights informed view of human dignity that has dominated bioethics debates for decades. In addition, on its own, it stands as dubious justification for policies that are aimed at constraining controversial biotechnologies.

### Research resources-division of cancer biology-NCI… [^c7833a27]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Chernobyl Tissue Bank NCI supports and manages biospecimen resources that collect, store, process, and disseminate human biological specimens and associated data set for research on human cancer biology. The Chernobyl Tissue Bank is an international collaborative project that is supported by NCI and another global partner, with active participation from Russia and Ukraine, two countries heavily affected by the 1986 Chernobyl accident. The objective of the CTB is to establish and maintain a research resource that supports studies on the biology of thyroid cancer, the major health consequence of the Chernobyl accident. NCI has a significant amount of beamtime dedicated for the use of its grantees. Investigators interested in taking experiments to this facility should contact the beamline directly or email Dr. Anowarul Amin for additional information.

International Registry of Werner Syndrome The International Registry of Werner Syndrome is the primary repository of samples and data from patients with Werner Syndrome, and was established in 1988 as part of an objective to positionally clone the WS gene. The registry ascertains and genotypes new pedigree cases from around the world, using lymphoblastoids and/or fibroblasts from human research participants, and provides genetic confirmation of classical WS. It also establishes and cryopreserves cell lines and other material from these pedigrees, including Epstein-Barr transformed peripheral blood B lymphocytes, primary skin fibroblasts, immortalized skin fibroblasts, WRN cDNA constructs, and others. All these materials are available for research. In order to enhance novel information obtained on their role in cancer, 1501 genetically engineered mESC lines were produced, harboring conditional microRNA transgenes.

For more information, please visit the NCI Mouse Repository website. NIH MHC Tetramer Program This core facility provides custom synthesis and distribution of soluble MHC-peptide tetramer reagents that can be used to stain antigen-specific T cells. The facility is supported by a contract from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, with steering committee participation from NCI through DCB. This working group investigates, shares best practices, and engages in discussion with other agencies and groups promoting citizen science in other fields. The working group is composed of program officers, scientific review officers, and others from across NIH interested in furthering the adoption and incorporation of citizen science methodology into biomedical research.

### Law and policy in the era of reproductive genetics [^4870dd34]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

The extent to which society utilises the law to enforce its moral judgments remains a dominant issue in this era of embryonic stem cell research, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and human reproductive cloning. Balancing the potential health benefits and diverse moral values of society can be a tremendous challenge. In this context, governments often adopt legislative bans and prohibitions and rely on the inflexible and often inappropriate tool of criminal law. Legal prohibitions in the field of reproductive genetics are not likely to reflect adequately the depth and diversity of competing stakeholder positions. Rather, a comprehensive and readily responsive regulatory policy is required. Such a policy must attend to the evolving scientific developments and ethical considerations. We outline a proposal for effective, responsive, and coherent oversight of new reproductive genetic technologies.

### Therapeutic cloning research and ethical oversight [^0286fb51]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

Cloning Trevor, a story about therapeutic cloning research, appeared in the June issue of The Atlantic Monthly. The story gives a human face to the people whom therapeutic cloning could benefit. It presents an argument for government funding and it puts the usual calls for a moratorium on embryonic stem cell research to allow for more debate, in a less favourable light. The story also highlights some problems with ethical oversight.

### Perspectives for induced pluripotent stem cell technology: new insights into human physiology involved in somatic mosaicism [^a6b70b13]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Induced pluripotent stem cell technology makes in vitro reprogramming of somatic cells from individuals with various genetic backgrounds possible. By applying this technology, it is possible to produce pluripotent stem cells from biopsy samples of arbitrarily selected individuals with various genetic backgrounds and to subsequently maintain, expand, and stock these cells. From these induced pluripotent stem cells, target cells and tissues can be generated after certain differentiation processes. These target cells/tissues are expected to be useful in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug screening, toxicology testing, and proof-of-concept studies in drug development. Therefore, the number of publications concerning induced pluripotent stem cells has recently been increasing rapidly, demonstrating that this technology has begun to infiltrate many aspects of stem cell biology and medical applications. In this review, we discuss the perspectives of induced pluripotent stem cell technology for modeling human diseases. In particular, we focus on the cloning event occurring through the reprogramming process and its ability to let us analyze the development of complex disease-harboring somatic mosaicism.

### Embryonic stem cell production through therapeutic cloning has fewer ethical problems than stem cell harvest from surplus IVF embryos [^87fbcea0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

Restrictions on research on therapeutic cloning are questionable as they inhibit the development of a technique which holds promise for successful application of pluripotent stem cells in clinical treatment of severe diseases. It is argued in this article that the ethical concerns are less problematic using therapeutic cloning compared with using fertilised eggs as the source for stem cells. The moral status of an enucleated egg cell transplanted with a somatic cell nucleus is found to be more clearly not equivalent to that of a human being. Based on ethical considerations alone, research into therapeutic cloning should be encouraged in order to develop therapeutic applications of stem cells.

### Cell phoney: human cloning after quintavalle [^40eabbd3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

Reproductive cloning has thrown up new scientific possibilities, ethical conundrums, and legal challenges. An initial question, considered by the English courts in 2003, was whether the technique presently available, that of cell nucleus replacement, falls outside the provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. If it does, the creation and use, including use in research protocols, of human embryos would be unregulated, disclosing a need to consider remedial legislation. The resolution by the courts of this legal question dramatically engages them in a resolution of fundamental ethical dilemmas, and discloses the possibilities and limitation of negotiating science policy through the processes of litigation.

### Stem cells [^0409307f]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Stem cells derived from adult and embryonic sources have great therapeutic potential, but much research is still needed before their clinical use becomes commonplace. There is debate about whether adult stem cells can be used instead of those derived from embryos. Rationalisation is needed but can be exercised only once the various cells have been carefully compared and contrasted under appropriate experimental conditions. Some characteristics that might help resolve the issue of cell source can already be applied to the debate. Accessibility is important; some adult cells, such as neural stem cells, are difficult to obtain, at least from living donors. Other factors include the frequency and abundance of adult stem cells and their numbers and potency, which might decline with age or be affected by disease. For embryonic stem cells, ethical concerns have been raised, and the proposed practice of therapeutic cloning tends to be misrepresented in the lay media. For both adult and embryonic stem cells, stability, potential to transmit harmful pathogens or genetic mutations, and risk of forming unwanted tissues or even teratocarcinomas have yet to be fully assessed.

### Cloning of aged animals: a medical model for tissue and organ regeneration [^914c214f]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Cloning by nuclear transfer has great potential application in pharmaceutical protein production, xeno-transplantation, and perhaps most excitingly, therapeutic cloning. In therapeutic cloning a patient's own skin cells can be used to generate cloned embryos from which embryonic stem cells are isolated. Through targeted differentiation, embryonic stem cells can be directed to develop into the desired tissues/organs for replacement. The combination of homologous recombination of genes and nuclear transfer also offers the promise of correcting defective genes in humans. Demonstration of the successful cloning of aged animals is important for these future medical applications because degenerative diseases often afflict older adults. Our studies have demonstrated that skin fibroblast cells from aged adults, even after prolonged culture, provide nuclear donors equally as competent for cloning as cells from young adults or fetuses. These findings have paved the way for medically treating degenerative diseases of aged humans by tissue regeneration technologies made possible through cloning and homologous recombination.

### Inferring causality and functional significance of human coding DNA variants [^b923adf8]. Human Molecular Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Sequencing technology enables the complete characterization of human genetic variation. Statistical genetics studies identify numerous loci linked to or associated with phenotypes of direct medical interest. The major remaining challenge is to characterize functionally significant alleles that are causally implicated in the genetic basis of human traits. Here, I review three sources of evidence for the functional significance of human DNA variants in protein-coding genes. These include (i) statistical genetics considerations such as co-segregation with the phenotype, allele frequency in unaffected controls and recurrence; (ii) in vitro functional assays and model organism experiments; and (iii) computational methods for predicting the functional effect of amino acid substitutions. In spite of many successes of recent studies, functional characterization of human allelic variants remains problematic.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 347, November 2006: using preimplantation embryos for research [^41294135]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Human embryonic stem cell research promises an increased understanding of the molecular process underlying cell differentiation. Transplantation of embryonic stem cells or their derivatives may, in the future, offer therapies for human diseases. In this Committee Opinion, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on Ethics presents an ethical framework for examining issues surrounding research using preimplantation embryos and proposes ethical guidelines for such research. The Committee acknowledges the diversity of opinions among ACOG members and affirms that no physician who finds embryo research morally objectionable should be required or expected to participate in such research. The Committee supports embryo research within 14 days after evidence of fertilization but limits it according to ethical guidelines. The Committee recommends that cryopreserved embryos be the preferred source for research but believes that the promise of somatic cell nuclear transfer is such that research in this area is justified. The Committee opposes reproductive cloning. Intended parents for whom embryos are created should give informed consent for the disposition for any excess embryos. The donors of gametes or somatic cells used in the creation of such tissue should give consent for donation of embryos for research. Potential research projects should be described to potential donors as much as possible. Donation of embryos for stem cell research requires specific consent. The Committee believes that compensation for egg donors for research is acceptable, consistent with American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines.

### Adult stem cell lines in regenerative medicine and reconstructive surgery [^36e424bf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the understanding of stem cell biology. The potential clinical applications lead to an extended interest in the use of stem cells in many medical disciplines. Multipotent adult stem cells seem to be almost comparable to embryonic stem cells with respect to their ability to differentiate into various tissues in vitro and in vivo, a function that has been termed "stem cell plasticity". In vivo experiments in rodents have shown that adult stem cells participate in tissue- and organ regeneration in almost all lesions. Although stem cell populations isolated from the bone marrow are usually a heterogeneous mix of different subpopulations, cloned adult stem cell lines from any source also show a broad spectrum of differentiation potential, e.g., osteogenesis, myogenesis, neurogenesis, or angiogenesis in wound healing. Angiogenesis in particular is a subject in tissue regeneration with tremendous implication in reconstructive surgery. This comprehensive plasticity makes it possible to use stem cell lines for biomedical research, tissue engineering, regenerative surgery, and organ repair. Adult stem cell lines are molecularly well defined with respect to transcription factors, active signal transduction pathways, and expression of receptors/ligand pairs. We performed experiments with adult stem cell lines, which are not subject to stem cell heterogeneity. Results obtained with stem cell lines can reliably be ascribed to the stem cell population under scrutiny. Adult stem cell lines can be obtained with the necessary quality and quantity also to study many effects of human stem cells in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we summarize some of the tremendous therapeutic implications of adult stem cell lines in surgery and surgical research.

INTRODUCTION

Regenerative medicine is a new and expanding area that aims to replace lost or damaged tissues in the human body through either cellular transplantation or endogenous repair. Adult stem cells infused into the circulation are currently leading the clinical front of regenerative medicine. However, there is general acceptance that mesenchymal cells, cord blood, adipose tissues and other adult stem cell sources often do not survive for more than a few weeks in patients, and their effects are most likely through growth factor release, host inflammatory responses and vascular alterations rather than replacing tissues lost in the disease. To achieve this, it will be necessary to either grow new tissues within the affected organ, or transplant powerful cells that can integrate, survive and produce new functional tissues. Fourteen years ago, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were isolated from the inner cell mass of embryos and could be expanded indefinitely while retaining the potential to make any cell of the body and as such represented perhaps the ideal source for exploring cell therapy and endogenous repair in humans. However, there have been major roadblocks associated with (i) ethical issues with the isolation of hESCs, (ii) appropriate differentiation to mature functional phenotypes, (iii) potential immune rejection of the cells and (iv) possible tumor formation from residual pluripotent cells.

Recent events have moved the field to a new and exciting level of expectation. It has long been assumed that most somatic cells of the body retain the DNA required to produce a whole new organism. Indeed, somatic nuclear transfer techniques leading to cloned frogs and mammals were proof of concept that this was true. However, it was revolutionary when Takahashi and Yamanaka showed in 2006 that adult mouse fibroblasts could also be sent back in time to an embryonic-like state by simply exogenously expressing powerful pluripotency transcription factors. This was followed by similar experiments in human fibroblasts a few years later and even more recently, different sets of transcription factors have been shown to directly convert adult cells into different lineages. Unlike cloning techniques which have remained extremely difficult for human cells and have only been proven to work in a single very recent publication, reprogramming using transcription factors to produce human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is simple, reliable and yields a very usable cell type that is in most aspects similar to hESCs (Figs 1 and 2).

### Genetic counseling for psychiatric disorders [^074c3a05]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Like other medical conditions, some psychiatric disorders are inherited, whereas others are not. Human genetics research is moving at a rapid pace. Genes for over 450 genetic disorders have been cloned and many disease-causing mutations have also been identified. The explosion of this new knowledge has created many new exciting opportunities in the diagnosis of these heritable disorders. The rapid pace of gene discovery will aid the identification of susceptibility genes for psychiatric disorders. Indeed, we can look forward to answers to many clinical and research questions. These are some of the gifts that the expanding field of human genetics research will continue to bring to medical science. However, as genetic tests for the detection of psychiatric disorders become available, many ethical, legal, and social implications will need to be considered. In this article, we review the principles of genetic counseling for psychiatric disorders, as well as the social and ethical dilemmas that genetic testing may bring. Although medical and scientific advances may bring many gifts, we should approach this new knowledge with caution, as one of the gifts may be a Pandora's box.

### Research guidelines for embryoids [^230e0b57]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Human embryo models formed from stem cells-known as embryoids-allow scientists to study the elusive first stages of human development without having to experiment on actual human embryos. But clear ethical guidelines for research involving embryoids are still lacking. Previously, a handful of researchers put forward new recommendations for embryoids, which they hope will be included in the next set of International Society for Stem Cell Research guidelines. Although these recommendations are an improvement over the default approach, they are nonetheless unworkable, because they rely on a poorly conceived notion of an embryoid's 'potential' to trigger stringent research regulations.

### What exactly is an exact copy? And why it matters when trying to ban human reproductive cloning in Australia [^3798eaab]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

This paper examines the current Australian regulatory response to human reproductive cloning. The central consideration is the capacity of the current regulatory regime to effectively deter human cloning efforts. A legislative prohibition on human cloning must be both effective and clear enough to allow researchers to know what practices are acceptable. This paper asks whether the current Australian regime evinces these qualities and suggests that Australia should follow the example set in the UK by the enactment of the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001.

### Can diabetes be cured by therapeutic cloning? [^d1498347]. Pediatric Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

With the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM), it is imperative to develop novel treatments. Stem cells offer the potential for use as renewable sources of glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells. However, developing a consistent protocol to enrich beta-cells is not a trivial issue. The question whether embryonic, fetal, or adult stem cells offer particular advantages as the starting material remains to be resolved experimentally. While somatic cell nuclear transfer avoids many of the problems associated with heterologous transplantation, the problem of autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells in type 1 DM might still remain. This review summarizes the innovative treatment strategies for DM and considers the possible advantages and problems.

### Letter about human cloning… [^122c7b75]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

October 26, 1998 Dear Colleague: The purpose of this letter is to confirm to institutional review boards that the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over clinical research using cloning technology to create a human being, and to inform IRBs of the FDA regulatory process that is required before any investigator can proceed with such a clinical investigation. This letter is being sent to IRBs at this time because of reports in the media that scientists are contemplating the use of cloning technology to create human beings. As described more fully below, the appropriate mechanism to pursue a clinical investigation using cloning technology is the submission of an investigational new drug application to FDA. Clinical research using cloning technology to create a human being is subject to FDA regulation under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Under these statutes and FDA's implementing regulations, before such research may begin, the sponsor of the research is required to submit to FDA an IND describing the proposed research plan; to obtain authorization from a properly constituted and functioning IRB; and to obtain a commitment from the investigators to obtain informed consent from all human subjects of the research. Such research may proceed only when an IND is in effect. Since FDA believes that there are major unresolved safety questions pertaining to the use of cloning technology to create a human being, until those questions are appropriately addressed in the IND, FDA would not permit any such investigation to proceed. FDA may prohibit a sponsor from conducting a study proposed in an IND application for a variety of reasons.

If the Agency finds that "human subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, " that would be sufficient reason to put a study on clinical hold. Other reasons listed in the regulations include "the IND does not contain sufficient information required. to address the risks to subjects of the proposed studies, " or "the clinical investigators. are not qualified by reason of their scientific training and experience to conduct the investigation". The responsibilities of an investigator include: ensuring that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocols; obtaining informed consent from study subjects; and ensuring that an IRB that complies with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 56 reviews and approves the proposed clinical study and the informed consent form and procedures for obtaining informed consent, among other requirements specified in the regulations.

### How will our understanding of human development evolve over the next 10 years [^d4de8de2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Ethical challenges

We believe that human embryology research and its ethical challenges will be increasingly seen as a driving force in addressing societal changes toward gender equality, and reduction in experimental use of animals and embryos. By establishing a more prominent dialogue between scientists, ethicists, funding/governmental agencies, and the public, we can build the medicine of tomorrow, including currently still largely unimaginable progress in fertility and pregnancy management, disease prevention and regenerative medicine. As previously noted, the most appropriate bodies addressing issues in reproductive research and clinical care are constantly challenged by scientific progress and adapting appropriate ethical frameworks to oversee the rapidly advancing field.

As clinical perspectives become clear, ethical debates surrounding human embryology are likely to become centered around utilitarian arguments relative to health and diseases, rather than on cultural arguments, that are inherently diverse worldwide. Nevertheless, it is possible to foresee contradictory views on altering the genetic make-up of embryos, which would bring long-lasting genetic changes to future generations. The question will probably focus on whether there are clinical cases for which it would be ethical to modify preimplantation embryos considered as abnormal, with the intent of preventing pregnancy loss or diseases after birth. Whether such embryo transfers will become ethically acceptable is raised by two distinct clinical scenarios: the transfer of genetically-edited IVF embryos and the transfer of embryos produced by non-traditional means (e.g. issued from the fusion of gametes generated from genetically-edited stem cells). A recent opinion from the Ethics Committee of the ASRM under the heading "Ethics in embryo research " concluded that such research with reproductive intent should only be undertaken after pre-clinical research demonstrates acceptable levels of safety and efficacy and with the intent of improving the health and/or well-being of offspring. Although this opinion does not offer a precise framework, it points at the necessity to develop in vitro tests (e.g. human embryos cultures, embryo models) to assess the safety/efficacy of potential therapeutic approaches to treat, for example, monogenic inherited diseases.

Ethical considerations will always determine the pace of scientific, medical, and societal progress and we believe that these considerations should be based on a holistic evaluation of the risks and benefits. As such, it is important to remember that science is driven by an international community and must thus respect all ethical frameworks when establishing regulatory guidelines. We remain confident that the advances in human embryology over the next ten years will provide a tremendous window into our own origins and contribute to positive medical and societal changes.

### Human reproductive cloning and reasons for deprivation [^9379338b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Human reproductive cloning provides the possibility of genetically related children for persons for whom present technologies are ineffective. I argue that the desire for genetically related children is not, by itself, a sufficient reason to engage in human reproductive cloning. I show this by arguing that the value underlying the desire for genetically related children implies a tension between the parent and the future child. This tension stems from an instance of a deprivation and violates a general principle of reasons for deprivation. Alternative considerations, such as a right to procreative autonomy, do not appear helpful in making the case for human reproductive cloning merely on the basis of the desire for genetically related children.

### Bioethics: why philosophy is essential for progress [^99af4f5a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

It is the JME's 40th anniversary and my 20th anniversary working in the field. I reflect on the nature of bioethics and medical ethics. I argue that both bioethics and medical ethics together have, in many ways, failed as fields. My diagnosis is that better philosophy is needed. I give some examples of the importance of philosophy to bioethics. I focus mostly on the failure of ethics in research and organ transplantation, although I also consider genetic selection, enhancement, cloning, futility, disability and other topics. I do not consider any topic comprehensively or systematically or address the many reasonable objections to my arguments. Rather, I seek to illustrate why philosophical analysis and argument remain as important as ever to progress in bioethics and medical ethics.

### Somatic cell cloning: the ultimate form of nuclear reprogramming? [^c64c1425]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

With the increasing difficulties associated with meeting the required needs for organs used in transplantation, alternative approaches need to be considered. These include the use of stem cells as potential sources of specialized cells, the ability to transdifferentiate cell types in culture, and the development of complete organs that can be used in humans. All of the above goals will require a complete understanding of the factors affecting cell differentiation and nuclear reprogramming. To make this a reality, however, techniques associated with cloning and genetic modifications in somatic cells need to be continued to be developed and optimized. This includes not only an enhancement of the rate of homologous recombination in somatic cells, but also a thorough understanding of the nuclear reprogramming process taking place during nuclear transfer. The understanding of this process is likely to have an effect beyond the area of nuclear transfer and assist with better methods for transdifferentiation of mammalian cells.

### Origins of human genetics. A personal perspective [^2b843cb0]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Genetics evolved as a field of science after 1900 with new theories being derived from experiments obtained in fruit flies, bacteria, and viruses. This personal account suggests that the origins of human genetics can best be traced to the years 1949 to 1959. Several genetic scientific advances in genetics in 1949 yielded results directly relating to humans for the first time, except for a few earlier observations. In 1949 the first textbook of human genetics was published, the American Journal of Human Genetics was founded, and in the previous year the American Society of Human Genetics. In 1940 in Britain a textbook entitled Introduction to Medical Genetics served as a foundation for introducing genetic aspects into medicine. The introduction of new methods for analyzing chromosomes and new biochemical assays using cultured cells in 1959 and subsequent years revealed that many human diseases, including cancer, have genetic causes. It became possible to arrive at a precise cause-related genetic diagnosis. As a result the risk of occurrence or re-occurrence of a disease within a family could be assessed correctly. Genetic counseling as a new concept became a basis for improved patient care. Taken together the advances in medically orientated genetic research and patient care since 1949 have resulted in human genetics being both, a basic medical and a basic biological science. Prior to 1949 genetics was not generally viewed in a medical context. Although monogenic human diseases were recognized in 1902, their occurrence and distribution were considered mainly at the population level.

### Modeling the process of human tumorigenesis [^1e89cb08]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Modelling the genesis of human cancers is at a scientific turning point. Starting from primary sources of normal human cells, it is now possible to reproducibly generate several types of malignant cell populations. Powerful methods for clonally tracking and manipulating their appearance and progression in serially transplanted immunodeficient mice are also in place. These developments circumvent historic drawbacks inherent in analyses of cancers produced in model organisms, established human malignant cell lines, or highly heterogeneous patient samples. In this review, we survey the advantages, contributions and limitations of current de novo human tumorigenesis strategies and note several exciting prospects on the horizon.

### One small edit for humans, one giant edit for humankind? Points and questions to consider for a responsible way forward for gene editing in humans [^4eb528b3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Somatic gene editing

Although somatic gene editing is not free from ethical, legal and social implications — it is, in many respects, similar to more traditional 'gene therapy' approaches in humans — it has been suggested that in many cases, the use of somatic gene editing does not challenge existing ethical, legal and social frameworks as much as heritable gene editing. However, as with any new experimental therapeutic, the unknowns still outweigh what is known and issues of risk assessment and safety, risk/benefit calculation, patient monitoring (potentially for long periods), reimbursement, equity in access to new therapies and the potential for the unjustified draining of resources from more pressing (albeit less novel) therapies, particular protection for vulnerable populations (e.g. fetuses, children (lacking competencies)), and informed consent remain important to study further.

Furthermore, as with any new (disruptive) technology or application, there often remains a gap to be filled between the setting of abstract principles or guidelines and how to apply these in practice. Indeed, important questions and uncertainties surrounding somatic gene editing both in research and in the clinic remain, including, but not limited to: do the established (national and international) legal and regulatory frameworks (e.g. Regulation (EC) no. 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products) need further shaping/revisions to appropriately address somatic gene editing (including not just issues with the products per se but also for issues related to potential health tourism)? And if so, how would this best be accomplished? Do present clinical trial principles and protocols suffice? How exactly will trials in somatic gene editing be conducted and evaluated? Do we need particular protection or status for patients in such trials? What procedures will be instilled for patients receiving such treatments (e.g. consent, genetic counselling, follow-up monitoring)? Furthermore, to what extent will commercial companies be able to, or be allowed to offer, potentially upon consumer request, treatments based on techniques where so much uncertainty regarding harms remains? Importantly, which health-care professionals will be involved in the provision of somatic gene therapy and the care of patients who undergo such treatments? Who will decide on roles and responsibilities in this novel context? And, based on what criteria will the eligible diseases/populations to be treated be chosen? Indeed, these questions can also all be applied to the context of heritable gene editing, which is discussed below.

### Resource expenditure not resource allocation: response to mcDougall on cloning and dignity [^e1de6278]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

This paper offers some comments on bioethical debates about resource allocation in healthcare. It is stimulated by Rosalind McDougall's argument that it is an affront to the human dignity of people with below "liberties-level" health to fund human reproductive cloning. McDougall is right to underline the relevance of resource prioritisation to the ethics of research and provision of new biomedical technologies. This paper argues that bioethicists should be careful when offering comments about such issues. In particular, it emphasises the need to represent accurately the reality of the situation-especially when we are passing judgement on technologies that are in their infancy and whose practical application is yet to be confirmed. The paper also emphasises the importance of the actual context to bioethical debate, and note that it would be better to talk about resource expenditure rather than resource allocation when it comes to discussing the rights and wrongs of how money is spent. It also reiterates the claims made by other writers that social and political philosophy need to have a transparent and considered role in debates about resources.

### Current issues in medically assisted reproduction and genetics in Europe: research, clinical practice, ethics, legal issues and policy. European society of human genetics and European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology [^e74a1695]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Couples using ART have, in general, a higher prevalence of aberrant karyotypes than the general population, have more mutations of the CFTR gene and show more Y chromosome microdeletions (see the section 'Genetic aspects of male fertility'). These causes of infertility may be passed onto the successive generation if medical techniques are used to achieve successful pregnancies. The main question is whether it could be considered a medical/social problem if 1% of pregnancies carry an increased risk of infertility into the next generation. If infertility treatment will be even better than it is today, these aberrant karyotypes, Y-chromosomal deletions and/or carrier of CFTR gene mutations may hardly affect the overall quality of life.

Epidemiological studiesmay help to identify and address some increased risks, such as multiple births, preterm delivery or newborn birth weight. Nonetheless, if any other increased risks could be avoided, this should become policy. Population genetic effects (ie, transgenerational effects) are mostly unknown, thus far. To decide whether or not increased risk exists, or whether or not they are avoidable or acceptable, more interdisciplinary research is needed.

Human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells: pitfalls and promises for regenerative medicine and disease modelling

Pluripotency is usually defined as the ability of a cell to differentiate into derivatives of the three germ layers. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are the best-known example of pluripotent cell lines, and are, for the largest part, derived from the inner cell mass of 5- to 6-day-old blastocysts. These are usually originating from surplus embryos after IVF treatment. A particular example comprises hESC lines derived from embryos shown to be affected by a single-gene defect after PGD. Alternative sources have been described, such as hESC derived from a single blastomere biopsied from a cleavage-stage embryo, or from parthenogenetically activated oocytes. A major breakthrough in the field was the demonstration that terminally differentiated somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, could be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state to a great extent indistinguishable from hESC, by the induced expression of only four key pluripotency genes (OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and C-MYC). Many observers consider these induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to be the future replacement of hESC, as they do not carry the negative connotation of embryo research and embryo destruction that burden the utilisation of hESC.

### Stem-cell consequences of embryo epigenetic defects [^ac0630d7]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The genetic code in the DNA of virtually every somatic cell can produce the entire complement of encoded proteins. Acetylation of histones and methylation of histones and DNA cytosine residues are part of the complex epigenetic regulatory process determining lineage-specific gene expression by altering the local structure of chromatin. After fertilisation, sperm DNA exchanges protamines for histones recruited from oocyte cytoplasm, reconfiguring both parental genomes into an epigenetic state conducive to activating the embryonic developmental programme. The identification of epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms is a major interest, rekindled by the ability of at least some somatic cells to acquire totipotency after somatic-cell nuclear transfer.

Starting Point

Recently, Woo SukHwang and colleagues (Science 2004; 303: 1669–74) derived a human embryonic stem-cell line from embryo therapeutic cloning. Chad Cowan and colleagues (N Engl JMed 2004; 350: 1353–56) produced 17 new lines from embryos supernumerary to infertility treatments. However, increasing evidence from a range of mammals shows a propensity for epigenetic errors with embryo technologies. If paralleled in human embryos, the effect on tumorigenic and differentiation properties of embryonic stem cells needs to be established. WHERE NEXT? Identifying the mechanisms in the oocyte that reprogramme a somatic cell to the embryonic state might allow somatic cells to be reprogrammed ex ovo by in-vitro manipulation of the epigenome. Because the oocyte is designed to reprogramme the sperm genome, which is in a different chromatin state from a somatic cell, perhaps many of the epigenetic errors induced by somatic-cell nuclear transfer could be avoided by a more targeted approach.

### How do we get fat? An epidemiologic and metabolic approach [^b56c7b68]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Obesity results when the energy intake exceeds expenditure for a long period. The first law of thermodynamics, which describes this relationship, does not provide insight into the failures to couple energy intake and expenditure. Research over the past two decades has provided an unprecedented expansion of knowledge about the physiological and molecular mechanisms regulating body fat. Perhaps the greatest impact has resulted from the cloning of genes corresponding to the five mouse monogenic obesity syndromes and the subsequent characterization of the human counterparts to these syndromes. Extensive molecular and reverse genetic studies (mouse knockouts) have helped establish other critical pathways that regulate body fat and food intake, and also have either validated or refuted the importance of previously identified pathways.

### Guidelines for the use of cell lines in biomedical research [^39339699]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

2.1.4. Research using human embryonic stem cells

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 created the HFEA as an independent regulator of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and human embryo research. One of the statutory functions of the HFEA is to license and monitor establishments undertaking human embryo research and this will include production of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines.

The original Act defined 5 purposes for which a research licence could be issued by the HFEA:
Promoting advances in the treatment of infertility.
Increasing knowledge about the causes of congenital disease.
Increasing knowledge about the causes of miscarriages.
Developing more effective techniques for contraception.
Developing methods for detecting the presence of gene or chromosome abnormalities in embryos before implantation.

Although these purposes did not preclude the derivation of human ESC, the reasons for doing so would have been limited by them. The Act had been passed before human ESC had first been derived, and there had been several other scientific advances, notably SCNT or cloning, which suggested that it needed updating. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001 added three further purposes:
Increasing knowledge about the development of embryos.
Increasing knowledge about serious disease.
Enabling any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.

### Embryonic stem cells: protecting pluripotency from alloreactivity [^10dbf9d4]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

There can be little doubt that 2006 turned out to be the annus horribilis for therapeutic cloning by somatic nuclear transfer (SNT). As the full extent of the fraud surrounding the generation of patient-specific embryonic stem (ES) cell lines became apparent, hopes began to fade for the advent of cell replacement therapies (CRT), free from the confounding issues of immune rejection. While the dust begins to settle, it is perhaps pertinent to ask whether the promise of SNT is still worth pursuing or whether alternative strategies for immune evasion might help fill the void.

### A resource-based version of the argument that cloning is an affront to human dignity [^1aa6fef5]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

The claim that human reproductive cloning constitutes an affront to human dignity became a familiar one in 1997 as policymakers and bioethicists responded to the announcement of the birth of Dolly the sheep. Various versions of the argument that reproductive cloning is an affront to human dignity have been made, most focusing on the dignity of the child produced by cloning. However, these arguments tend to be unpersuasive and strongly criticised in the bioethical literature. In this paper I put forward a different argument that reproductive cloning is an affront to human dignity, one that looks beyond the dignity of the child produced. I suggest that allocating funds to such a pursuit can affront human dignity by diverting resources away from those existing people who lack sufficient health to enable them to exercise basic rights and liberties. This version of the argument posits cloning as an affront to human dignity in particular circumstances, rather than claiming the technology as intrinsically inconsistent with human dignity.

### Generation of nuclear transfer-derived pluripotent ES cells from cloned cdx2-deficient blastocysts [^a216a577]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells by nuclear transfer holds great promise for research and therapy but involves the destruction of cloned human blastocysts. Proof of principle experiments have shown that 'customized' ES cells derived by nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs) can be used to correct immunodeficiency in mice. Importantly, the feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated recently in humans, bringing the clinical application of NT-ESCs within reach. Altered nuclear transfer (ANT) has been proposed as a variation of nuclear transfer because it would create abnormal nuclear transfer blastocysts that are inherently unable to implant into the uterus but would be capable of generating customized ES cells. To assess the experimental validity of this concept we have used nuclear transfer to derive mouse blastocysts from donor fibroblasts that carried a short hairpin RNA construct targeting Cdx2. Cloned blastocysts were morphologically abnormal, lacked functional trophoblast and failed to implant into the uterus. However, they efficiently generated pluripotent embryonic stem cells when explanted into culture.

### The stem cell debate continues: the buying and selling of eggs for research [^5db2239c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

Now that stem cell scientists are clamouring for human eggs for cloning-based stem cell research, there is vigorous debate about the ethics of paying women for their eggs. Generally speaking, some claim that women should be paid a fair wage for their reproductive labour or tissues, while others argue against the further commodification of reproductive labour or tissues and worry about voluntariness among potential egg providers. Siding mainly with those who believe that women should be financially compensated for providing eggs for research, the new stem cell guidelines of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) legitimise both reimbursement of direct expenses and financial compensation for many women who supply eggs for research. In this paper, the authors do not attempt to resolve the thorny issue of whether payment for eggs used in human embryonic stem cell research is ethically legitimate. Rather, they want to show specifically that the ISSCR recommended payment practices are deeply flawed and, more generally, that all payment schemes that aim to avoid undue inducement of women risk the global exploitation of economically disadvantaged women.

### Reproductive and therapeutic cloning, germline therapy, and purchase of gametes and embryos: comments on Canadian legislation governing reproduction technologies [^350f6d54]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

In Canada, the Assisted Human Reproduction Act received royal assent on 29 March 2004. The approach proposed by the federal government responds to Canadians' strong desire for an enforceable legislative framework in the field of reproduction technologies through criminal law. As a result of the widening gap between the rapid pace of technological change and governing legislation, a distinct need was perceived to create a regulatory framework to guide decisions regarding reproductive technologies. In this article the three main topics covered in the new legislation are commented on: cloning, germline therapy, and purchase of gametes and embryos. Some important issues also covered in the new legislation, such as privacy and access to information, data protection, identity of donors, and inspection, will not be addressed.

### International policy failures: cloning and stem-cell research [^8e300c08]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

In late 2003, two international bodies were unable to resolve disagreements that involved bioethical issues. First, the United Nations General Assembly failed to pass a treaty on reproductive cloning because of insistence by some countries that the treaty include a ban on cloning for research. In view of the importance of enacting prohibition of reproductive cloning, the two issues should be separated and each argued on its own merits. Relevant objections to separation of the two issues can be refuted. Second, the European Union (EU) failed to agree on conditions for funding stem-cell research because of the diversity of views and policies of the countries of the EU. Because a stalemate was reached, funding decisions in the next programme cycle will be made on an ad hoc basis. Scientists will not have information they need to plan research programmes, suggesting that clear guidelines, even if restrictive, are preferable to vague unpublicised criteria.

### Reproductive cloning combined with genetic modification [^800866a5]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

Although there is widespread opposition to reproductive cloning, some have argued that its use by infertile couples to have genetically related children would be ethically justifiable. Others have suggested that lesbian or gay couples might wish to use cloning to have genetically related children. Most of the main objections to human reproductive cloning are based on the child's lack of unique nuclear DNA. In the future, it may be possible safely to create children using cloning combined with genetic modifications, so that they have unique nuclear DNA. The genetic modifications could be aimed at giving such children genetic characteristics of both members of the couple concerned. Thus, cloning combined with genetic modification could be appealing to infertile, lesbian, or gay couples who seek genetically related children who have genetic characteristics of both members. In such scenarios, the various objections to human reproductive cloning that are based on the lack of genetic uniqueness would no longer be applicable. The author argues that it would be ethically justifiable for such couples to create children in this manner, assuming these techniques could be used safely.

### One small edit for humans, one giant edit for humankind? Points and questions to consider for a responsible way forward for gene editing in humans [^77901f2f]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

A major contextual difference in the current discussions regarding germ line/heritable gene editing is that we have never been so close to having the technology to perform it in humans in a potentially safe and effective manner. Hence, as we move closer to this technical possibility and as we work out the scientific issues of efficiency and safety, the discussions orient themselves increasingly towards the ELSI regarding whether or not we want to even use heritable gene editing in a laboratory or clinical setting, and if so, how we want it to be used, by whom and based on which criteria? This includes, but is not limited to the following questions: should gene editing of human germ line cells, gametes and embryos be allowed in basic research — for the further understanding of human biology (e.g. human development) and without the intention of being used for creating modified human life? Some jurisdictions, such as the UK, have already answered this question, and are allowing this technique in the research setting in human cells in vitro (they will not be placed in a human body, the research will only involve studying the human embryos outside of the body) whereby researchers need to apply for permission to conduct such research. Some believe that allowing this will inevitably lead to the technology being used in the clinic (the so-called 'slippery slope' argument). This, then, brings us to the question at the centre of the debate: should gene editing of germ line cells, gametes or embryos or any other cell that results in a heritable alteration be allowed in humans in a clinical setting? Germane to this issue is another vital question: what, if any, principles or reasoning would justify the use of hereditary gene editing in humans in a clinical context given the current ban on such techniques in many jurisdictions? The new EU clinical trial Regulation (536/2014 Art 90 al.2.) does not allow germ line modification in humans. Should there be leeway for reconsidering this ban in the future in view of the possible benefits of therapeutic germ line gene editing? Should we first understand the risks and benefits of somatic gene editing before even seriously considering heritable gene editing? If we consider that it could be used in some situations, should we only consider using germ line gene editing in the clinic if there are absolutely no other alternatives? Should already established and potentially safer 4 reproductive alternatives, like PGD, be the approaches of choice before even considering germ line gene editing? If we do entertain its use, what, if any criteria, will be safe enough according to different stakeholders (scientists, ethicists, clinicians, policy makers, patients, general public) for it to be legitimate to consider using gene editing for reproductive use? Who will set this safety threshold and based on what risk/benefit calculations? Furthermore, if ever allowed, should heritable human gene editing be permitted only for specific medical purposes with a particular high chance of developing a disease (e.g. only when parents have a-near-100% risk of having a child affected with a serious disorder), and if so, would it matter if the risk is not 100%, but (much) lower? In addition, how can we, or should we define/demarcate medical reasons from enhancement? And, as was posed above for the use in somatic cells, for what medical conditions will gene editing be considered appropriate for use? What will the criteria be and who will decide?

### Generation, culture, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic applications [^34611f93]. Molecular Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from the inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocyst, can continuously proliferate in an undifferentiated state and can also be induced to differentiate into a desired cell lineage. These abilities make ES cells an appealing source for cell replacement therapies, the study of developmental biology, and drug/toxin screening studies. As compared to mouse ES cells, human ES cells have only recently been derived and studied. Although there are many differences in properties between mouse and human ES cells, the study of mouse ES cells has provided important insights into human ES cell research. In this review, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of methods used for human ES cell derivation, the expansion of human ES cells, and the current status of human ES cell differentiation research. In addition, we discuss the endeavor that scientists have undertaken toward the therapeutic application of these cells, which includes therapeutic cloning and the improvement of human ES cell culture conditions.

### Lazarus's gate: challenges and potential of epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells [^d88fa1f2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The past year has seen tremendous advances in epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells. Direct genesis of pluripotent stem cells, in contrast to earlier somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) techniques, removes significant ethical and regulatory concerns regarding the utilization of human oocytes and zygotes, and represents a significant step toward the development of nonxenogeneic production methods. While significant technical hurdles remain, this and related technologies are enabling new approaches toward clinical treatments, basic research and diagnostics, and drug evaluation.

### The support of human genetic evidence for approved drug indications [^f28a6aab]. Nature Genetics (2015). Medium credibility.

Over a quarter of drugs that enter clinical development fail because they are ineffective. Growing insight into genes that influence human disease may affect how drug targets and indications are selected. However, there is little guidance about how much weight should be given to genetic evidence in making these key decisions. To answer this question, we investigated how well the current archive of genetic evidence predicts drug mechanisms. We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0% at the preclinical stage to 8.2% among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas. We estimate that selecting genetically supported targets could double the success rate in clinical development. Therefore, using the growing wealth of human genetic data to select the best targets and indications should have a measurable impact on the successful development of new drugs.

### Modeling the process of human tumorigenesis [^74cb2566]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The use of massively parallel DNA sequencing has improved the sensitivity and efficiency of vector insert analysis to identify clones based on their semi-random integration sites, thus circumventing many of the limitations of LDA approaches. Nevertheless, ∼50% of insertion sites are still elusive to detection using the latest versions of this methodology. A more recent alternative has been the creation and use of libraries of DNA barcoded lentiviral vectors. When such libraries are used at a concentration that results in the transduction of less than one in three cells in the target population being interrogated, and the diversity of the library is greater than the number of cells being investigated, the likelihood that each of the initially marked cells contains a unique barcode is high. The frequency of each barcode in the DNA extracted from populations derived from barcoded cells can then be used to infer the number of cells present in different clones. For both vector strategies, phenotypic purification of the cells to be analysed before extracting the DNA for insert site or barcode analysis allows the phenotypic composition of each clone to also be characterized.

Application of these protocols has revealed complex clonal dynamics in human tumours derived from serially passaged cells. Interestingly, this exercise has documented highly diverse growth behaviours of single cells from cell lines when large numbers of these are transplanted, even though single-cell transplant experiments indicate more than one third can generate a tumour. Thus, to relate the growth activity of the clones with their genotype, it is necessary to isolate and sequence the individual clones generated, as has been done in human glioblastoma.

### Assisted reproduction developments in the islamic world [^1eedd4b8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

A November 2000 workshop organized by the International Islamic Center for Population Studies and Research, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, considered use of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) in the Islamic world. The workshop reinforced a 1997 recommendation that a Standing Committee for Shari'a Medical Ethics be constituted to monitor and assess developments in ART practice. Among issues the workshop addressed were equitable access to services for infertile couples of modest means, and regulation of standards of equipment and personnel that ART centers should satisfy to gain approval to offer services. Acceptable uses of preimplantation genetic diagnosis were proposed, and follicular maturation research in animals, including in vitro maturation and in vitro growth of oocytes, was encouraged, leading to human applications. Embryo implantation following a husband's death, induced postmenopausal pregnancy, uterine transplantation and gene therapy were addressed and human reproductive cloning condemned, but cloning human embryos for stem cell research was considered acceptable.

### The melanocortin-4 receptor: physiology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology [^e5cd86b5]. Endocrine Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) was cloned in 1993 by degenerate PCR; however, its function was unknown. Subsequent studies suggest that the MC4R might be involved in regulating energy homeostasis. This hypothesis was confirmed in 1997 by a series of seminal studies in mice. In 1998, human genetic studies demonstrated that mutations in the MC4R gene can cause monogenic obesity. We now know that mutations in the MC4R are the most common monogenic form of obesity, with more than 150 distinct mutations reported thus far. This review will summarize the studies on the MC4R, from its cloning and tissue distribution to its physiological roles in regulating energy homeostasis, cachexia, cardiovascular function, glucose and lipid homeostasis, reproduction and sexual function, drug abuse, pain perception, brain inflammation, and anxiety. I will then review the studies on the pharmacology of the receptor, including ligand binding and receptor activation, signaling pathways, as well as its regulation. Finally, the pathophysiology of the MC4R in obesity pathogenesis will be reviewed. Functional studies of the mutant MC4Rs and the therapeutic implications, including small molecules in correcting binding and signaling defect, and their potential as pharmacological chaperones in rescuing intracellularly retained mutants, will be highlighted.

### Very small embryonic-like stem-cell optimization of isolation protocols: an update of molecular signatures and a review of current in vivo applications [^3f9eb478]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The field of regenerative medicine is currently searching for a reliable source of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that could give rise to cells from all three germ layers. For almost 20 years, researchers have been attempting to harness embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that can be isolated from the embryos generated by in vitro fertilization, or therapeutic cloning. However, this strategy is burdened by ethical considerations. A promising source of PSCs can be generated by the genetic modification of adult tissues — induced PSCs, — but this strategy is still under development and risks the formation of teratomas in the injected cells, in addition to rejection by the host immune system.

Various potential types of adult stem and progenitor cells can now be isolated from bone marrow (BM), mobilized peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood (UCB) or derived from expanded in vitro cultures of adherent cells (such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs)) and are being investigated in clinical trials to determine their ability to regenerate damaged organs (for example, heart, kidney and neural tissues). Rare cases of chimerism after the infusion of unmanipulated donor BM, UCB or mobilized peripheral blood cells have been reported by some investigators; however, these results can be explained by cell fusion, or presence of rare populations of stem cells that are endowed with multi-tissue differentiation abilities.

### The promise and challenge of therapeutic genome editing [^7ab6dd45]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

A second question raised by applications of genome editing in human embryos concerns the appropriate professional and societal response. Organizations including the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the Royal Society and their equivalents in other countries have sponsored meetings and reports, as have professional societies including the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG), UK Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors, Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors, International Genetic Epidemiology Society, US National Society of Genetic Counselors, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asia Pacific Society of Human Genetics, British Society for Genetic Medicine, Human Genetics Society of Australasia, Professional Society of Genetic Counselors in Asia, and Southern African Society for Human Genetics. Key points on which these groups agree: (1) At this time, given the nature and number of unanswered scientific, ethical, and policy questions, it is inappropriate to perform germline genome editing that culminates in human pregnancy; (2) in vitro germline genome editing on human embryos and gametes should be allowed, with appropriate oversight and consent from donors, to facilitate research on the possible future clinical applications of gene editing, and there should be no prohibition on public funding of this research; (3) future clinical application of human germline genome editing should not proceed unless, at a minimum, there is (a) a compelling medical rationale, (b) an evidence base that supports its clinical use, (c) an ethical justification, and (d) a transparent public process to solicit and incorporate stakeholder input.

The third question raised by applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryos is how to move the technology forward while ensuring responsible use. At the time of this writing, international commissions convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the US National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine, together with the Royal Society, are drafting detailed requirements for any potential future clinical use. Medical needs must be defined so that risks versus possible benefits can be evaluated. Most importantly, procedures by which patients could be informed about the technology, its risks and a process for monitoring health outcomes must be determined.

### One small edit for humans, one giant edit for humankind? Points and questions to consider for a responsible way forward for gene editing in humans [^e896dc4c]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Internationally, some first position papers on human gene editing were published in 2015 and 2016. Interestingly, these different recommendations and statements do not entirely concur with one another. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) called for a temporary ban on any use of germ line gene editing. The Society for Developmental Biology 'supports a voluntary moratorium by members of the scientific community on all manipulation of pre- implantation human embryos by genome editing '. The Washington Summit (2015) organizers (National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the U.K.'s Royal Society) recommended against any use of it in the clinic at present and specified that with increasing scientific knowledge and advances, this stance 'should be revisited on regular basis'. Indeed, this was done, to some extent, in a follow-up report by the US National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine, in which the tone of the recommendations appear much more open towards allowing germ line modifications in the clinic. Meanwhile, the 'Hinxton group' also stated that gene editing 'is not sufficiently developed to consider human genome editing for clinical reproductive purposes at this time' and they proposed a set of general recommendations to move the science of gene editing ahead in an established and accepted regulatory framework. Despite these differences, at least two arguments are consistent throughout these guidance documents: (1) the recognition of the need for further research regarding the risks and benefits; and (2) the recognition of the need for on-going discussion and/or education involving a wide range of stakeholders (including lay publics) regarding the potential clinical use and ethical and societal issues and impacts of heritable gene editing. It should be noted, however, that in the 2017 National Academies of Science, and of Medicine Report, the role of public engagement (PE) and dialogue was presented within the context of having to discuss the use of gene editing for enhancement vs. therapy (rather than somatic vs. heritable gene editing, which was the case in the 2015 summit report).

### A ubiquitous splice variant and a common polymorphism affect heterologous expression of recombinant human SCN5A heart sodium channels [^e0124568]. Circulation Research (2003). Low credibility.

Amino acid sequence variations in SCN5A are known to affect function of wild-type channels and also those with coexisting mutations; therefore, it is important to know the exact sequence and function of channels most commonly present in human myocardium. SCN5A was analyzed in control panels of human alleles, demonstrating that the existing clones (hH1, hH1a, hH1b) each contained a rare variant and thus none represented the common sequence. Confirming prior work, the H558R polymorphism was present in approximately 30% of subjects. Quantitative mRNA analysis from human hearts showed that a shorter 2015 amino acid splice variant lacking glutamine at position 1077 (Q1077del) made up 65% of the transcript in every heart examined. Age, sex, race, or structural heart disease did not affect this proportion of Q1077del. Estimated population frequencies for the four common variants were 25% SCN5A, 10% [H558R], 45% [Q1077del], and 20% [H558R; Q1077del], where the reference sequence SCN5A is GenBank AC137587. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, these common variants had a more positive mid-point of the voltage dependence of inactivation than the standard clone hH1. Also, channels containing Q1077 expressed smaller currents. When H558R was present with Q1077 ([H558R]), current expression was profoundly reduced despite normal trafficking to the cell surface. Thus, four variant sequences for SCN5A are commonly present in human myocardium and they exhibit functional differences among themselves and with the previous standard clone. These results have implications for the choice of background sequence for experiments with heterologous expression systems, and possibly implications for electrophysiological function in vivo.

### Genetic screens in isogenic mammalian cell lines without single cell cloning [^f47977e4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Genetic interaction networks can reveal unexpected connections between genes and suggest the functions of uncharacterized genes, which may prove critical for interpreting genetic signal from genome-wide association studies of common disease states. Although yeast knockout crosses have yielded rich genetic interaction networks –, in mammalian cells, constructing such networks is orders of magnitude more complicated, due to increased genome size, diversity of cell types, and numerous technical factors. RNAiand CRISPR technology – have been used to study pairwise interactions for up to hundreds of genes; however, screening all combinations of protein coding genes in the human genome would require, at bare minimum, approximately 400 million perturbations and 200 billion cells, which is equivalent to 5000 concurrent genome-wide screens. This scale is exacerbated by the diversity of cell types in which to study such interactions.

A second, complementary approach to query genetic interactions leverages isogenic pairs of human cells. Initial gene knockout techniques in human cell lines have yielded valuable insights but were quite laborious to execute –. Recently, CRISPR technology has enabled cell line engineering for a broader range of researchers, but that is distinct from making it easy. Programming the Cas9 target site is as simple as ordering a short nucleic acid, in contrast to the more cumbersome task of assembling a customized pair of zinc-finger nucleases or TALENs. After design of the targeted nuclease, however, substantial work remains: isolation of single cells, often across multiple 96-well plates; expansion for several weeks while colonies form; isolation of genomic DNA from replicated plates; and finally, PCR, sequencing, and analysis to determine which colonies have the intended genotype. Indeed, off-the-shelf knockout clones, which are available in only a very limited number of cell lines, can be purchased from vendors for thousands of dollars, and the customized generation of a knockout clone in a cell line of interest costs tens of thousands of dollars. Thus, there is a great need for approaches that obviate the need to generate single-cell clones and enable the creation of large-scale genetic interaction maps for genes of interest in relevant cell types.

### Safety issues in cell-based intervention trials [^dc479c25]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

We report on the deliberations of an interdisciplinary group of experts in science, law, and philosophy who convened to discuss novel ethical and policy challenges in stem cell research. In this report we discuss the ethical and policy implications of safety concerns in the transition from basic laboratory research to clinical applications of cell-based therapies derived from stem cells. Although many features of this transition from lab to clinic are common to other therapies, three aspects of stem cell biology pose unique challenges. First, tension regarding the use of human embryos may complicate the scientific development of safe and effective cell lines. Second, because human stem cells were not developed in the laboratory until 1998, few safety questions relating to human applications have been addressed in animal research. Third, preclinical and clinical testing of biologic agents, particularly those as inherently complex as mammalian cells, present formidable challenges, such as the need to develop suitable standardized assays and the difficulty of selecting appropriate patient populations for early phase trials. We recommend that scientists, policy makers, and the public discuss these issues responsibly, and further, that a national advisory committee to oversee human trials of cell therapies be established.

### Modeling the process of human tumorigenesis [^bc21aa52]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Summary

Recreating the process of human tumorigenesis in naive human cells has been a challenging frontier not anticipated by the historically contrasting ease of achieving this outcome in mouse cells. However, several major developments are now changing this picture. One has been the generation of long-lived mice in which multiple components of the innate and acquired immune system have been suppressed. This advance now allows transformed human cells to grow and evolve into fully malignant populations in an in vivo setting. Together with improvements in lentiviral design and production, and methods to isolate and purify normal viable human cells, these advances are now enabling a growing number of de novo models of human tumorigenesis to be developed. The use of DNA barcoding of the initial cells is now also providing a tractable method to analyse the clonal composition and dynamics of the malignant cells generated and should provide a powerful approach to examine therapeutic effects in the future. These approaches coupled with emerging methods to modify and regulate cell behaviour even more precisely herald a new era of improved understanding of the complex processes of human tumorigenesis.

### Unreprogrammed H3K9me3 prevents minor zygotic genome activation and lineage commitment in SCNT embryos [^0f511aa9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) refers to the transfer of a terminally differentiated somatic cell into an enucleated oocyte, which can reprogram the reconstructed embryo to a pluripotent state. SCNT is of great value in animal resurrection and has vast prospective use in the treatment of human diseases –. To date, however, the development of cloned embryos is seriously defective, with undesired effects such as abnormal extraembryonic tissues and postnatal deficiency. A large amount of evidence shows that a contributory cause of SCNT inefficiency lies in the donor cell-specific epigenome, which is not completely reprogrammed, resulting in a very large divergence from the fertilized embryos. These epigenetic memories include but are not limited to DNA methylation, histone modifications and 3D chromatin structures –.

H3K9me3 is generally considered to be one of the hallmarks of heterochromatin regions and plays important roles in gene regulation and transposon silencing –. H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin remodeling is critical for natural reprogramming after fertilization, since either impairing or enforcing precocious acquisition of H3K9me3 results in compromised development –. During early embryonic development in mice, H3K9me3 exhibits distinct dynamic features in promoter and long terminal repeat (LTR) regions, and the precise deposition of H3K9me3 is pivotal to lineage specification.

### Therapeutic cloning and genome modification… [^5bd9974f]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Somatic Nuclear Transfer was successfully used in 1997 to create the cloned sheep Dolly. SCNT is a technique were the nucleus of a donor egg is removed and discarded and replaced with the nucleus from an adult somatic cell. On March 7, 1997 then President Clinton issued a memorandum that stated: "Recent accounts of advances in cloning technology, including the first successful cloning of an adult sheep, raise important questions. They potentially represent enormous scientific breakthroughs that could offer benefits in such areas as medicine and agriculture. But the new technology also raises profound ethical issues, particularly with respect to its possible use to clone humans".

The memorandum explicitly prohibited Federal Funding for cloning of a human being, and also directed the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to thoroughly review the legal and ethical issues associated with the use of cloning technology to create a human being. "NBAC found that concerns relating to the potential psychological harms to children and effects on the moral, religious, and cultural values of society merited further reflection and deliberation. " The report, Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research, September 1999, describes 5 recommendations. In March 2001, FDA sent a letter to the research community asserting regulatory authority over clinical research using cloning technology to create a human being, and to advise that FDA regulatory process is required in order to initiate these investigations. FDA jurisdiction includes human cells used in therapy involving the transfer of genetic material by means other than the union of gamete nuclei.

Examples of such genetic material include, but are not limited to: cell nuclei, oocyte nuclei, ooplasm, which contains mitochondria and genetic material contained in a genetic vector, transferred to gametes or other cells. Any clinical research involving these techniques would require an IND. In 2015 FDA requested that the Institute of Medicine produce a consensus report regarding the ethical and social policy issues related to genetic modification of eggs and zygotes to prevent transmission of mitochondrial disease 1. The report concluded that MRT in humans is ethically permissible as long as certain conditions and principles are met. One condition is that treatment should be limited to women who are at risk of transmitting severe mitochondrial disease and because female embryos would result in heritable genetic modification, MRT research should be restricted initially to male embryos.

### Single-cell genomics technology: perspectives [^b3a25e8f]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the last decade, molecular and cellular technologies have evolved to give rise to the era of single-cell genomics, which allows the simultaneous measurement of thousands of genes in thousands of 'single' cells all at once from a single specimen. Advancements in microfluidic and molecular cloning technologies have revolutionized our understanding of complex biological processes by improving resolution to a single-cell level. Single-cell sequencing technology has also evolved over time, from processing dozens of cells to millions of cells simultaneously. New approaches to well-established models are being explored at the single-cell level in the field of medical sciences, and new rare cell types are being reported, one after another.

The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project represents an international organized collaborative effort to develop a comprehensive reference dataset covering all cell types in the human body. Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM)and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)consortia represent previous global efforts to profile the transcriptomes of various human cell types. Such public transcriptome data on multiple major organs can be used as a reference in biological studies, as they provide single-cell genomic data for mice and humans. In particular, the HCA introduced the concept of harmonization and equity in data collection and analysis, thereby promoting single-cell genomics. Ando et al. have discussed the introduction of single-cell genomic consortia that take the regional environments for developing the universal human cell reference dataset into consideration.

### Current issues in medically assisted reproduction and genetics in Europe: research, clinical practice, ethics, legal issues and policy. European society of human genetics and European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology [^f8a86905]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Another area at the interface of assisted reproduction and genetics is the selection of gamete donors, as recently reviewed, for example, by The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. As more diseases with a strong genetic component are now being identified, and as there are increasing technical capacities to detect them, the question arises whether the present guidelines for genetic donor screening need revision. Case reports of serious genetic disorders occasionally being found in donor offspring or (past) donors also lead to calls for expanded screening. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain how far should we could go in genetic screening of potential donors. Clearly, a 'zero-risk' approach is unrealistic and is bound to lead to false reassurance in recipients. Moreover, as this would lead to excluding most if not all donors, such an approach would be counterproductive and disproportional. Relevant ethical issues not only relate to the interests of the prospective parents and the child to be, but also to those of the donor. For instance, with the prospect of broad screening based on genome-sequencing techniques, there is a risk of findings predictive of disorders that the donor (and his close relatives) may experience as a threat without meaningful options. Respect for autonomy would require donors to be informed about the possible implications of testing, both for themselves and for their close relatives. A specific question concerns the scope for allowing a meaningful 'right not to know'. Counterselected donors need to be offered genetic- and reproductive counselling. Donors need not be excluded because of heterozygosity for rare ('Mendelian') autosomal recessive diseases, because they can be matched with suitable recipients. However, in this instance the cost of additional genetic testing may have an impeding role.

### Clonal reconstruction from co-occurrence of vector integration sites accurately quantifies expanding clones in vivo [^0d9a3fc6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We acknowledge that the suggested and necessary filtering step may lead to incomplete assignments of IS to clones. However, rather than identifying all IS within one clone, we focus on the identification of how much-unaccounted co-occurrence of IS in the same clone biases the overall assessment of clonality. Trying to detect early signs of a developing clonal dominance, it is plausible to control how much the largest detected IS are truly independent clones or whether correlations in their abundance may indicate a common clonal origin. Inclusion of additional, minor IS that were neglected in the filtering step does not substantially change these conclusions, even if the IS would add to the already identified clones. The same applies for the unlikely case that the same IS occurs independently in two clones as the larger contribution would prevail and be correctly correlated to the dominating clone.

Current studies of clonal dynamics only quantify IS abundances relative to the total observed IS and interpret those time series as independent clones. We showed that this approach can clearly lead to an overestimation of the number of clones and an underestimation of their relative contribution. However, the quantitative assessment of clonal behaviors is crucial for the evaluation of the safety of GT as well as for the interpretation of experimental studies to understand physiological hematopoiesis and related malignancies or to study hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. The availability of repeated IS measurements at different time points as well as in different hematopoietic cell types, especially in a clinical context, represents the optimal data basis necessary for the successful application of our suggested methodology and to reach a more thorough understanding of temporal clonal developments.

### Somatic cell nuclear transfer [^630b23f5]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Cloning by nuclear transfer from adult somatic cells is a remarkable demonstration of developmental plasticity. When a nucleus is placed in oocyte cytoplasm, the changes in chromatin structure that govern differentiation can be reversed, and the nucleus can be made to control development to term.

### Experimentally-derived haplotypes substantially increase the efficiency of linkage disequilibrium studies [^95ca96fa]. Nature Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

The study of complex genetic traits in humans is limited by the expense and difficulty of ascertaining populations of sufficient sample size to detect subtle genetic contributions to disease. Here we introduce an application of a somatic cell hybrid construction strategy called conversion that maximizes the genotypic information from each sampled individual. The approach permits direct observation of individual haplotypes, thereby eliminating the need for collecting and genotyping DNA from family members for haplotype-based analyses. We describe experimental data that validate the use of conversion as a whole-genome haplotyping tool and evaluate the theoretical efficiency of using conversion-derived haplotypes instead of conventional genotypes in the context of haplotype-frequency estimation. We show that, particularly when phenotyping is expensive, conversion-based haplotyping can be more efficient and cost-effective than standard genotyping.

### Ethics of DNA research on human remains: five globally applicable guidelines [^df61684a]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Once a consensus has been reached to proceed, professional scientific ethics requires that researchers are able to pursue their work up to the point of publication without requiring further approval. The suggestion that there should be a requirement for manuscripts to be approved by stakeholder groups who are not members of the research team prior to publication, is not feasible, as researchers cannot ethically participate in a study in which this is mandated. The imperative of scientific independence once a study begins does not mean that researchers should publish results without considering stakeholder perspectives about the implications of the data. It is valuable to invite stakeholders to engage with research results through the addition of their perspectives or by providing critical feedback prior to publication especially when results are surprising and challenge previous assumptions. Continued engagement with other stakeholders after the beginning of a study is an effective mechanism by which researchers can address their professional ethical obligation to understand whether reporting a result in a particular way is likely to cause harm. If these conversations indicate that a result cannot be shared in a way that avoids significant harm to a stakeholder group, researchers should not publish such results.

Researchers should be available to provide regular updates and must commit to returning results at the culmination of a project. It should be made clear from the outset what the study's potential findings may be, that genetic data may be inconsistent with other forms of knowledge, and that while the results of scientific analyses are reported as scholarly output, they do not discredit, diminish, or decrease the importance of traditional expertise and deeply held beliefs. Discrepancies between results from genetic analyses and other lines of evidence should be reported as important elements of the compound nature of understanding the past.

Researchers should commit to working with stakeholders on outreach efforts that create additional outputs accessible to communities. This may involve working with local collaborators to translate the results of papers into local languages, developing children's educational resources –, producing brochures and pamphlets for libraries or other community centers, or working with museums to design exhibits. When relevant, researchers should contribute to training and education, especially for members of stakeholder groups and local communities, and should consider ways in which to improve the curatorial state of collections. This can include supplying the resources needed for participating in the generation, interpretation, and dissemination of data, for example training in sampling of human remains or laboratory techniques, and financial support for further training or attending professional meetings. It is important for granting agencies to ensure that adequate funding is allocated to capacity-building initiatives.

### Engineering large animal models of human disease [^3182d0c5]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Engineering large animals:versus zygote injections

The majority of genetically engineered livestock are pigs and in this species, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) or cloning remains by far the most popular production method (see Figure 2). The technique involves the generation of somatic cells (typically porcine fetal fibroblasts) carrying the intended genetic modification and using these cells as donors in cloning experiments (Figure 2 B). For cloning, the metaphase II plate within the oocyte comprising the genetic material is removed, and the genetically modified cell fused with the enucleated oocyte to restart embryo development. Reconstituted oocytes are typically transferred into the oviducts of recipient animals. Editor technology can be easily applied to create either NHEJ‐ or HDR‐driven mutations within the donor cell(Figures 2 A and 2 B). Usually a pre‐screening or selection strategy is used to enable enrichment for cells carrying the desired mutation.

(A) For gene targeting without editors, a double‐stranded DNA targeting vector with the intended gene modification (purple square) with a selectable marker, eg a neomycin resistance cassette, is used and the cells that survive the selection are used for gene targeting. (B) For targeting with editors, a selection of tools such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), TAL‐effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR associated 9 (Cas9) nuclease can be used to introduce double‐strand breaks in the genome. When used by themselves, the editors will generate knockout of genes. In combination with either a single‐stranded or a double‐stranded DNA as the repair template, the editors will facilitate gene targeting. The editors, with or without the targeting vectors, can be electroporated into somatic cells and used as donors for nuclear transfer or cloning to generate edited animals (Option‐I), or microinjected into the cytoplasm of embryos (Option‐II). (C) A comparison of conventional gene targeting and genome editing with editors is shown.

### AAN position statement: ethical issues in clinical research in neurology [^f420e2a5]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

AAN position statement — human gene editing risks and consent: When applied to human somatic or germ cells, gene editing also introduces the additional risk of unintended consequences to individual participants through imperfectly understood genotype–phenotype interactions, or through off-target mutations in which the new genetic sequence is accidentally inserted in an incorrect location. In addition, genetic modifications of germ cells may violate the requirements of informed consent since affected future generations would have no choice about participation in the study. For these reasons, the AAN endorses a moratorium on human germline editing until the research community establishes a better understanding of the risks entailed, and until a framework for international oversight and regulation is established.

### Potentiality of embryonic stem cells: an ethical problem even with alternative stem cell sources [^1abdb71e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

The recent discussions about alternative sources of human embryonic stem cells (White Paper of the US President's Council on Bioethics, 2005), while stirring new interest in the developmental potential of the various abnormal embryos or constructs proposed as such sources, also raise questions about the potential of the derived embryonic stem cells. The data on the developmental potential of embryonic stem cells that seem relevant for ethical considerations and aspects of patentability are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the meaning of "totipotency, omnipotency and pluripotency" as illustrated by a comparison of the developmental potential of three-dimensional clusters of blastomeres (morula), embryonic stem cells, somatic or (adult) stem cells or other somatic (non-stem) cells. This paper focuses on embryoid bodies and on direct cloning by tetraploid complementation. Usage and patenting of these cells cannot be considered to be ethically sound as long as totipotency and tetraploid complementability of embryonic stem cells are not excluded for the specific cell line in question. Testing this poses an ethical problem in itself and needs to be discussed in the future.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^1e14cc6d]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Ethical challenges and professionalism related to billing, coding, documentation, and EHRs — clinical documentation should capture the patient's active problems, history, assessment, and medical decision making in a manner that is accurate, current, respectful, consistent, confidential, secure, and transparent, and the primary role of an electronic health record (EHR) is to facilitate patient care rather than be impeded or usurped by billing, regulatory, research, documentation, or administrative functions. Information housed within an EHR belongs to and should be accessible to the patient, documentation should adhere to principles of patient-centeredness and patient welfare, respect and awareness, truthfulness and accuracy, privacy and security, and transparency and disclosure, and the use of medical scribes may facilitate entry but all information recorded by the scribe must be attested to by the responsible clinician. "Copying and pasting" ("cloning") should be used judiciously, all information copied should be reviewed and edited with each encounter to ensure that it is accurate, relevant, and current, and routine audits of EHRs and clinical documentation should be performed to promote professionalism, ethical practice, and optimal patient care.

### DNA barcoding reveals diverse growth kinetics of human breast tumour subclones in serially passaged xenografts [^534e8017]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

A majority of human breast tumours have acquired extensive genomic diversity by the time they become clinically evident, and whole-genome sequencing approaches have identified clonal genotypes that emerge or diminishpresumably as a result of their response to a variety of selection pressures. In contrast, limiting dilution assays (LDAs) are not constrained to detect clones based on their genotype. However, they are highly sensitive to the end point used to discriminate a 'positive' from a 'negative' result. In addition, LDAs are, by definition, unable to examine the concurrent growth behaviour of multiple subclones within a given tumour and that may have different kinetics of expansion. Hence, LDA experiments are unsuited to large-scale screens of agents that may influence tumour growth or recurrence.

Vector-marking strategies also enable transplanted clonal growth patterns to be investigated, either by identifying unique sites of randomly integrated vector DNA into the genome of each transduced cell, or by identifying unique vector DNA sequences (referred to as 'barcodes') integrated at single copy level into individual cells exposed to a highly diverse library of viral vectors. Use of the first approach has shown biologically determined as well as chemotherapy-induced variations in the clonal growth dynamics of malignant human cells in xenografts initiated with different primary sources of tumour cells, as well as different established cancer cell lines. Cellular barcoding offers an attractive alternative strategy to address these issues because of its potentially greater sensitivity of clone detection, as recently illustrated in analyses of cells produced by normal human hematopoietic and mammary cells transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Here, we demonstrate the highly complex clonal growth dynamics that barcoding reveals in serially passaged xenografts of widely used cell lines originally derived from established human mammary cancers and related complexity in barcoded transplants of cells more immediately derived from primary human breast cancers.

### Heritable human genome editing is' currently not permitted', but it is no longer' prohibited': so says the ISSCR [^89e22074]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

The Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation, recently issued by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), include a number of substantive revisions. Significant changes include: (1) the bifurcation of 'Category 3 Prohibited research activities' in the 2016 Guidelines into 'Category 3A Research activities currently not permitted' and 'Category 3B Prohibited research activities' in the 2021 guidelines and (2) the move of heritable human genome editing research out of the 'prohibited' category and into the 'currently not permitted' category. These changes are noteworthy because of the absence of a clear demarcation line between the two categories insofar as, by definition, that which is 'prohibited' is 'currently not permitted', and vice versa. Permanence is not part of the definition of 'prohibition'. In principle, a prohibition can be rescinded at any time. This begs the question 'Why make a policy change that has no apparent practical effect?' One hypothesis is that the recategorisation of specific 'prohibited' research activities as 'currently not permitted' is meant to seed intuitions about which prohibited research activities should 'soon' be permitted subject to specialised scientific and ethics review and approval.

### Regulation of mother-to-offspring transmission of mtDNA heteroplasmy [^f27e6595]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exists in populations within eukaryotic cells and encodes genes that are vital for cellular energetics and metabolism. Cellular populations of mtDNA may be genetically identical (homoplasmy) or consist of a genetic admixture (heteroplasmy) arising from mutation, inheritance, or gene therapies. The interaction between different variants of mtDNA within the same cytoplasm is a fascinating biological problem with evolutionary, physiological, pathological, and ethical implications. It has come to the forefront of public awareness due to debate concerning the use of mitochondrial replacement therapy in human oocytes to prevent transmission of mtDNA-linked diseases, and the proposal to improve fertility by injecting young donor oocyte cytoplasm and mtDNA to oocytes of sub-fertile women. However, the dynamics of heteroplasmic mtDNA populations and the factors that affect these dynamics remain poorly understood.

In mammals, mtDNA encodes a reduced number of genes: 13 mRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs. All proteins encoded in the mtDNA are structural components of the multiprotein mitochondrial respiratory complexes. It is critical that these mtDNA-encoded proteins match physically and functionally with up to 70 nDNA-encoded structural proteins of the same complexes to build a functional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Animal models with identical nuclear genomes but with different mtDNA haplotypes (conplastic mice) generate functionally different OXPHOS systems that shape organismal metabolism, supporting the conclusion that different wild-type mtDNA variants have phenotypically important consequences.

Selection between non-pathological mtDNA haplotypes in the female germline of heteroplasmic engineered mice was first thought not to exist, but this conclusion has been recently questioned. Solving this dispute is of major interest in addressing the potential medical implications of mixed mtDNA populations. The analysis of mtDNA heteroplasmy progression in genetically manipulated monkey heteroplasmic oocytes revealed that, during embryo development, one of the mtDNA variants may become predominant. In human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from embryos cultured in vivo after nuclear transfer to exchange mtDNA complements, similar expansion of the residual mtDNA haplotype has been observed. Very recently, expansion of the minority copies of paternal mtDNA (70 versus 200,000) was documented in human families where the active elimination of the sperm mitochondria failed. The driving forces responsible for the selective advantage of mtDNA during embryo development is still unknown.

Here, we address these questions by elucidating mtDNA behavior between non-pathological mtDNA variants in unprecedented detail in a set of novel model organisms. We identify stages at which mtDNA haplotype selection occurs during early embryo development and a set of metabolic and nuclear genetic factors that drive this selection.

### Gamete and embryo donation guidance [^49fc44e5]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Gamete donor use limits — In a population of 800,000, limiting a single donor to no more than 25 births would avoid any significant increased risk of inadvertent consanguineous conception, and oocyte donors should be limited to six (6) treatment cycles per donor, with concern for cumulative risk after more than six ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval procedures. When splitting donor embryo batches, the potential risk of siblings in close geographic proximity should be considered, and donors should be informed about the potential future request for follow-up testing or receipt of follow-up medical information that stems from a medical diagnosis in a donor-conceived child.

### Engineering large animal models of human disease [^42d9d101]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

The major advantage of SCNT over direct embryo injection with editor reagents is the predictable genotype of piglets and the ability to generate clonal lines of edited animals. However, SCNT suffers from serious disadvantages, such as the relatively low viability of reconstituted embryos and, consequently, pregnancy losses following embryo transfer. Therefore, a high number of reconstituted embryos, normally in the range of 100–150 embryos, are typically transferred into recipient animals to establish pregnancies. Difficulty in maintaining primary somatic cells in culture for a sufficient period to allow pre‐screening and expansion prior to performing SCNT constitutes an additional drawback. Moreover, offspring derived from SCNT often have developmental defects, which preclude analysis of the intended phenotype in the first generation. Finally, SCNT is technically challenging and resource‐intensive, and therefore remains unavailable to all but specialized laboratories. Even in established labs, the outcome of SCNT is unpredictable. However, efficiencies of SCNT are steadily rising owing to improvements in culture regimes 64 and SCNT remains a major driver for generating gene‐edited and other genetically engineered livestock, especially pigs.

### FDA oversight of NSIGHT genomic research: the need for an integrated systems approach to regulation [^96255eac]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2013, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) co-founded the Newborn Sequencing In Genomic medicine and public HealTh (NSIGHT) Consortium to better understand the use of genomic testing in the newborn period. Respondents to the request for proposals were asked to address one or more of the following scientific questions: for disorders currently screened for in newborns, how can genomic sequencing replicate or augment known newborn screening results? What knowledge about conditions not currently screened for in newborns could genomic sequencing of newborns provide? And, what additional clinical information could be learned from genomic sequencing relevant to the clinical care of newborns? In addressing these questions, applicants were required to develop a research project with three components: genomic sequencing, clinical research, and ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) research. The NICHD and NHGRI ultimately funded the proposals of four academic medical institutions, and here we describe their unique experiences responding to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) unexpected oversight of NIH-sponsored clinical research projects, and provide insight and recommendations for regulators, researchers, and policy-makers.

### Stem cell therapy and the retina [^0972b277]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Retinal degeneration culminating in photoreceptor loss is the leading cause of untreatable blindness in the developed world. In this review, we consider how photoreceptors might be replaced by transplantation and how stem cells might be optimised for use as donor cells in future clinical strategies for retinal repair. We discuss the current advances in human and animal models of retinal cell transplantation, focussing on stem cell and reproductive cloning biology, in relation to the practical issues of retinal transplantation surgery. Stem and progenitor cells can be isolated from a number of sources including embryonic tissue, adult brain and even the retina, prompting many researchers to investigate the potential for using these cells to generate photoreceptors for transplantation. Nevertheless, several obstacles need to be overcome before these techniques can be applied in a clinical setting. Embryonic or stem cells have so far shown little ability to differentiate into retinal phenotypes when transplanted into the adult retina. We have recently noted, however, that donor cells harvested much later, at the photoreceptor precursor developmental stage, can be transplanted successfully and restore visual function. The current challenge is to understand the developmental processes that guide embryonic or adult stem cells towards photoreceptor differentiation, so that large numbers of these cells might be transplanted at the optimal stage. Future advances in reproductive cloning technology could lead to the successful generation of stem cells from adult somatic cells, thereby facilitating auto-transplantation of genetically identical cells in patients requiring photoreceptor replacement.

### Guidelines for the use of cell lines in biomedical research [^0c28af6f]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

1.1.1. Tissue

In addition to tissue taken for culture, if donor or patient consent and/or ethical review permit (see Section 2.1), it is recommended that additional material is stored for:

Confirmation of origin (authentication) (see Section 1.2.2). A small portion of the sample used for primary culture (or a blood sample or DNA derived from the donor) should be frozen or processed immediately. The tissue or DNA can then be used to demonstrate unequivocally that the cell line is derived from the putative donor. Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling is a recommended method for the purpose of authentication, although additional information on genotype (karyotype, copy number variation (CNV) mapping, or even whole-genome sequence) will sometimes help ensure identity.

Histopathological confirmation. A small portion of the sample being used to originate the culture should be fixed in formalin and used for histopathological assessment, ideally by the same histopathologist reporting the surgical specimen if this is from a patient. This step is particularly important if a patient sample is supplied to the laboratory directly by a clinician, because it may not be representative of the surgical specimen sent to the histopathologist. For instance, it may be taken at some distance from a tumour and consequently lack cancer cells, or it may be from a region that is unaffected by a specific pathology caused by a genetic or epigenetic defect.

Normal tissue for comparison. A small quantity of blood (e.g. 10 ml) or normal tissue should be frozen. This tissue can later be used to look for genetic differences and could also be used for authentication. In the case of iPSC lines, or when direct reprogramming is used to derive one somatic cell type from another, it is also good practice to cryopreserve stocks of the original cells used. These could be important to derive additional cell lines using new reprogramming technology, but also to provide original donor material for validation of later discoveries made using the cell line. If somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) or 'cloning' technology is used to derive cell lines, such as ES cells, then cells or tissue from both the somatic cell donor and oocyte donor should be kept in order to match nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, respectively.

### Differentiated cells are more efficient than adult stem cells for cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer [^909f34f7]. Nature Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

Since the creation of Dolly via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), more than a dozen species of mammals have been cloned using this technology. One hypothesis for the limited success of cloning via SCNT (1%-5%) is that the clones are likely to be derived from adult stem cells. Support for this hypothesis comes from the findings that the reproductive cloning efficiency for embryonic stem cells is five to ten times higher than that for somatic cells as donors and that cloned pups cannot be produced directly from cloned embryos derived from differentiated B and T cells or neuronal cells. The question remains as to whether SCNT-derived animal clones can be derived from truly differentiated somatic cells. We tested this hypothesis with mouse hematopoietic cells at different differentiation stages: hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and granulocytes. We found that cloning efficiency increases over the differentiation hierarchy, and terminally differentiated postmitotic granulocytes yield cloned pups with the greatest cloning efficiency.

2.1.6. Ownership and patent rights

There are many who might lay claim to the ownership of specimens and their derivatives, including the donor and relatives, the surgeon and pathologists, the hospital authority where the sample was taken, the scientists engaged in the research, the institution where the research work was performed, the funding body and any collaborating commercial companies. The ultimate control of ownership, intellectual property rights and patent rights will need to be negotiated by the various interested parties. Most universities and research institutes will have a research office that deals with such negotiations, as do most of the larger funding agencies.

2.1.7. Material-transfer agreements

An MTA is a legally binding contract governing the transfer of research materials between two organisations where the recipient intends to use the materials for his or her own research purposes. Biological materials including reagents, cell lines, plasmids and vectors are the most frequently transferred materials and the MTA will define the rights of the provider and recipient with respect to the materials and any derivatives. This should include details of ownership, intellectual property rights and patent rights. The MTA should be signed by the legal representative of both the provider and recipient before any materials are transferred. If primary human tissue or cells are involved the MTA should include a statement confirming that ethical approval and informed consent have been obtained and the recipient should confirm that, on receipt, they will become responsible for using, storing and tracking the material in full compliance with the HT Act. The provider may also wish to state that no liability can be accepted for any problem arising from the use of the cells or tissue and that no guarantee of freedom from microbial contamination can be given.

Restrictions on the use of transferred cell lines should be minimal, but it is reasonable to insist on acknowledgement and even co-authorship where the originating laboratory has made a substantial contribution to the subsequent work. However, merely supplying a cell line would not in itself normally warrant co-authorship of any paper describing work carried out using that cell line. The MTA should also indicate that the cells must not be passed on to a third party or used for commercial exploitation. If the recipient derives a sub-line by cloning and/or genetic manipulation, then a new agreement of ownership will need to be established and this proviso should also be contained in the MTA. Again most universities and research institutes will have a research office that deals with agreeing and issuing MTAs, and will usually arrange for them to be signed by a legal representative.

4 Communicate and Translate GxE Research Findings

4.1 Historical Context for Reporting Genomics and Environmental Health Research Results

For over two decades, researchers have faced the ethical dilemma of what information should be communicated back to study participants — an issue often referred to as "return" (in genomics research) or "report back" (in environmental health studies) of results. In recent years, increased evidence of potential benefits, minimal harms, and participant desire to receive results have led to prominent bodies supporting the practice of report back, such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report in 2018 ("National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine"). NASEM recommends that investigators testing human biospecimens routinely consider whether and how to report back individual results and include plans in their protocols. These recommendations are rooted in principles of reciprocity, respect, and transparency. These guidelines also demonstrate the responsibility of researchers to share "right‐to‐know" information and highlight researcher/community "co‐ownership" of data. Researchers, in addition to participants, benefit from report back since this practice may increase participant recruitment and retention, as well as promote greater public trust in research ("National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine"). However, many challenges remain regarding the scope of what to report back to individuals and communities and how best to communicate findings to maximize the benefits and minimize harms.

### Contributions from medical geneticists in clinical trials of genetic therapies: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^6a696346]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Safety of genetic therapies and long-term follow-up (LTFU) — owing to their novelty, the knowledge of the long-term effects of these interventions is limited, and sponsors should engage with the medical genetics community to disseminate new safety data. The reporting and LTFU of therapy-related adverse events, adverse events of special interest, or serious adverse events (SAEs) during a clinical trial or in the postapproval period are of primary concern; once a therapy is approved, ongoing surveillance is of paramount importance. Although postmarketing surveillance is required by the regulatory agencies, it is less intensive than monitoring during clinical trials in phases 1 to 3, and ongoing LTFU is critical to understanding post-treatment phenotypes, complications, and side effects. Long-lasting or permanent human gene delivery, editing, and modification reagents may introduce an increased risk of unexpected adverse events, including SAEs, and the FDA has recognized the need for LTFU studies on permanent or long-acting human gene therapy products. In one example, the most common SAEs observed in clinical trials of suspension were related to lumbar puncture and not the drug itself; however, the drug administration is part of the treatment and must be considered when prescribing a therapy, and patients' concerns about SAEs influence clinical trial enrollment and treatment decisions after marketing approval.

### The interplay of ethics and genetic technologies in balancing the social valuation of the human genome in UNESCO declarations [^cbb0ae0e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

The three waves of the UNESCO declarations and the International Bioethics Committee Report

The IBC is a core international forum for in-depth reflection on bioethics. As a representative institution among the UN agencies responsible for the promotion of scientific research, it is appropriate for UNESCO to fulfill the role of establishing an international legal framework for the protection of the human genome, considering both its individual and collective responsibilities. However, from the outset, the intricacies of the declaration development process were evident because of the diversity of value systems and disparate social and cultural standings.

The three waves of the UNESCO declarations and the IBC report reveal the internal ethical logic underlying the evolution of the dominant explanation. This evolution in the IBC program begins from the first declaration, the UDHGHR (1997), with a general outline aiming to balance genomic research with human rights and social virtues. The second declaration, the IDHGD (2003), complements the first by offering more practical, biomedically oriented ethical guidelines for the use of human genetic data. The third declaration, the UDBHR (2005), provides an integrated view of bioethics in which genomics is one challenge among many. The IBC report (2015) includes reflections on ethical perspectives and key challenging areas.

The link between the first declaration and the HGP is well known, and there has been much discussion about how the declarations provide an ethical framework for particularly challenging genetic and related technologies, including human cloning, and avoid sensitive issues, such as embryo research, that invoke religious or cultural controversies. However, this outlook interprets the use of these technologies as disconnected ethical challenges and fails to consider their underlying patterns of technological change. Our theoretical contribution is to broaden the analytical perspective to examine how the ethical foci of the declarations and the IBC report are embedded in the context of evolving genetic technologies and social settings. We also apply this perspective to account for changes in the declarations' ethical balancing. Such a sociological analysis raises new questions as to why these issues were defined as ethical concerns in those times and places. We use the term "valuation" to highlight the socially dynamic and contextually embedded interplay of genetic technologies and ethics, as it juxtaposes changes in the construction and sequencing of the human genome with the ethical challenges emphasized by the declarations.
