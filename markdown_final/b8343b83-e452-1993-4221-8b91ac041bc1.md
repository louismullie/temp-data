## Question

In a critically ill adult you are about to intubate, should you provide bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy, and what benefits and risks did PreVent quantify?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to provide bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy in a critically ill adult, and what benefits and risks the PreVent trial quantified. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why this question matters. Then, I should verify the PreVent trial design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and primary and secondary outcomes. Next, I will examine the magnitude and clinical significance of the benefits, followed by the safety signals, especially aspiration. After that, I need to consider external validity and how guidelines interpret the data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions and special situations, anchoring everything to the trial and contemporary reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Hypoxemia during intubation of critically ill adults is common and dangerous, with nearly 40% experiencing hypoxemia, hypotension, or cardiac arrest, so any intervention that reduces severe desaturation without increasing aspiration risk is clinically important [^1158AaYw].

> I will now examine the PreVent trial itself. PreVent was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study of 401 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in seven U.S. ICUs, comparing bag-mask ventilation after induction versus no ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy, with the primary outcome of lowest oxygen saturation and a key secondary outcome of severe hypoxemia, defined as SpO₂ < 80% [^11466h6T] [^115QzdmF].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. The median lowest SpO2 was 96% with bag-mask ventilation versus 93% without, and severe hypoxemia occurred in 10.9% with bag-mask ventilation versus 22.8% without, yielding a relative risk of 0.48 and an absolute risk reduction of 12 percentage points. This is a large, clinically meaningful effect that suggests approximately one fewer severe desaturation event for every eight patients treated [^11466h6T] [^115QzdmF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check aspiration outcomes. Operator-reported aspiration occurred in 2.5% with bag-mask ventilation versus 4.0% without, and new opacities on chest radiography within 48 hours were 16.4% versus 14.8%, respectively. Neither difference was statistically significant, suggesting no increase in aspiration with bag-mask ventilation in this population and setting [^11466h6T] [^117PgUtK].

> Next, I should review external validity and applicability. The trial excluded patients with urgent intubation precluding randomization and those with very high aspiration risk features such as active vomiting, hematemesis, or hemoptysis, so the safety signal cannot be extrapolated to those scenarios. Additionally, the intervention was performed with two-person technique, oral airway as needed, and careful attention to minimizing gastric insufflation, which may not be replicated if technique is suboptimal [^11466h6T] [^117PgUtK].

> I need to ensure how guidelines interpret this. Contemporary reviews and guidelines increasingly support providing positive pressure ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy in critically ill adults without specific contraindications, citing PreVent and related evidence that it reduces hypoxemia without clear increases in aspiration, while emphasizing individualized risk assessment for aspiration and technique quality [^1158UWdM] [^112aB9sW] [^115bYYz7].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for aspiration or in a special context like COVID-19. In patients with active vomiting, hematemesis, or hemoptysis, or when aerosolization risk is paramount, many experts recommend avoiding bag-mask ventilation and prioritizing alternative strategies such as apneic oxygenation or a supraglottic airway to minimize risk, recognizing that the PreVent trial did not enroll these high-risk patients and that aerosolization concerns complicate routine bag-mask ventilation in COVID-19 [^115QzdmF] [^116uK6Fw] [^114cgn6S].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most critically ill adults without clear high-aspiration-risk features, bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy should be offered because it substantially reduces severe hypoxemia without increasing aspiration in the PreVent trial, provided you use a two-person technique, oral or nasopharyngeal airways as needed, and aim for gentle ventilations with visible chest rise while avoiding excessive tidal volumes or pressures. If aspiration risk is high or technique is unreliable, prioritize alternatives and document the rationale [^11466h6T] [^1158UWdM] [^112aB9sW].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Yes, in critically ill adults undergoing intubation, bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy improves oxygenation and halves the risk of severe hypoxemia without increasing aspiration in the PreVent randomized trial, and this strategy is increasingly reflected in modern practice recommendations when aspiration risk is acceptable and technique is sound [^11466h6T] [^1158UWdM] [^112aB9sW].

Bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy **reduces severe hypoxemia** [^11466h6T] in critically ill adults undergoing intubation, with no increase in aspiration risk [^117PgUtK]. The PreVent trial showed a **12% absolute reduction** in severe hypoxemia (SpO₂ < 80%) and a 3% improvement in median lowest SpO2 with bag-mask ventilation versus no ventilation, without significant differences in operator-reported aspiration or new opacities on chest radiography [^11466h6T]. This supports routine bag-mask ventilation during the apneic interval unless there is a high risk of aspiration or a contraindication to positive pressure ventilation [^1158UWdM].

## PreVent trial: study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial in seven U.S. ICUs [^11466h6T].
- **Population**: 401 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation [^117PgUtK].
- **Intervention**: Bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy vs no ventilation (except for rescue) [^11466h6T].
- **Primary outcome**: Lowest oxygen saturation between induction and 2 minutes post-intubation [^11466h6T].
- **Secondary outcome**: Incidence of severe hypoxemia (SpO₂ < 80%) [^117PgUtK].

## Quantified benefits of bag-mask ventilation

The PreVent trial demonstrated **significant benefits** with bag-mask ventilation:

| **Outcome** | **Bag-mask ventilation group** | **No-ventilation group** | **Relative risk (rr) or absolute difference** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Median lowest SpO2 | 96% (IQR 87–99) | 93% (IQR 81–99) | Absolute difference +3% (95% CI 1.4–6.5) [^11466h6T] |
| Severe hypoxemia (SpO₂ < 80%) | 10.9% | 22.8% | RR 0.48 (95% CI 0.30–0.77) [^11466h6T] |
| Median oxygen saturation decline | 1% (IQR 0–4) | 5% (IQR 1–10) | Absolute difference −4.5% (95% CI −6.8 to −2.2) [^117PgUtK] |

---

These results indicate that bag-mask ventilation **significantly reduces severe hypoxemia** and maintains higher oxygen saturations during the apneic period [^1158UWdM].

---

## Quantified risks of bag-mask ventilation

The PreVent trial also assessed **aspiration risk**:

- **Operator-reported aspiration**: 2.5% in the bag-mask ventilation group vs 4.0% in the no-ventilation group (P = 0.41) [^11466h6T].
- **New opacities on chest radiography within 48 hours**: 16.4% vs 14.8% (P = 0.73) [^117PgUtK].

These findings indicate **no significant increase** in aspiration or pulmonary complications with bag-mask ventilation [^112aB9sW].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

The PreVent trial provides **robust evidence** supporting bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy in critically ill adults [^1158UWdM]. The benefits of reduced severe hypoxemia outweigh the potential risks, particularly given the lack of increased aspiration events. Clinicians should consider bag-mask ventilation as a **standard practice** unless specific contraindications exist, such as a high risk of aspiration or facial trauma that impedes effective mask seal [^1158UWdM].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the PreVent trial provides strong evidence, clinicians should consider the following:

- **Aspiration risk**: Although no significant increase was observed, patients with known aspiration risk factors (e.g. full stomach, severe gastroesophageal reflux) may still warrant caution [^11466h6T].
- **Operator technique**: Effective bag-mask ventilation requires proper technique, including maintaining a tight seal, using appropriate tidal volumes, and monitoring for gastric insufflation [^114cgn6S].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, pregnancy, and anatomical abnormalities may complicate bag-mask ventilation and require individualized assessment [^115tKW4G].

---

Bag-mask ventilation after induction and before laryngoscopy **significantly reduces severe hypoxemia** in critically ill adults without increasing aspiration risk, as demonstrated by the PreVent trial [^11466h6T]. This practice should be adopted routinely, with caution applied in patients at high risk of aspiration or with contraindications to positive pressure ventilation [^1158UWdM].

Background

Hypoxemia is the most common complication during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults and may increase the risk of cardiac arrest and death. Whether positive-pressure ventilation with a bag-mask device (bag-mask ventilation) during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults prevents hypoxemia without increasing the risk of aspiration remains controversial.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized trial conducted in seven intensive care units in the United States, we randomly assigned adults undergoing tracheal intubation to receive either ventilation with a bag-mask device or no ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy. The primary outcome was the lowest oxygen saturation observed during the interval between induction and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation. The secondary outcome was the incidence of severe hypoxemia, defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 80%.

Results

Among the 401 patients enrolled, the median lowest oxygen saturation was 96% (interquartile range, 87 to 99) in the bag-mask ventilation group and 93% (interquartile range, 81 to 99) in the no-ventilation group (P = 0.01). A total of 21 patients (10.9%) in the bag-mask ventilation group had severe hypoxemia, as compared with 45 patients (22.8%) in the no-ventilation group (relative risk, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30 to 0.77). Operator-reported aspiration occurred during 2.5% of intubations in the bag-mask ventilation group and during 4.0% in the no-ventilation group (P = 0.41). The incidence of new opacity on chest radiography in the 48 hours after tracheal intubation was 16.4% and 14.8%, respectively (P = 0.73).

Conclusions

Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, patients receiving bag-mask ventilation had higher oxygen saturations and a lower incidence of severe hypoxemia than those receiving no ventilation.

### Bag-mask ventilation during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults [^117PgUtK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study PreVent (tracheal intubation) was published by Jonathan D Casey and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Endotracheal intubation. In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the trial question was: what is the role of bag-mask ventilation among critically ill adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation? In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the population was: 401 patients (175 female, 226 male). The inclusion criteria were ICU adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation. The key exclusion criteria were urgent need for intubation precluding randomization; a specific approach to ventilation between induction and intubation is required or contraindicated; pregnancy; incarceration. In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the interventions were: n = 199 manual ventilation (bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy) n = 202 no manual ventilation (no bag-mask ventilation; except after a failed attempt at laryngoscopy, as a treatment for hypoxemia). In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median lowest oxygen saturation (96 percent vs. 93 percent; AD 3.9 percent, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.5). In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in lowest oxygen saturation of < 80% (10.9% vs. 22.8%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.77) No significant difference in death before hospital discharge (35.7% vs. 35.6%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.3) Significant decrease in median oxygen saturation decline (1% vs. 5%; ARD -4.5, 95% CI -6.8 to -2.2). In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in operator-reported aspiration, new opacity on chest radiography in the 48 hours after tracheal intubation. significant difference in oxygen saturation of < 90% (29.5% vs. 40.1%). In the PreVent (tracheal intubation) study, the conclusion was: in ICU adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation, manual ventilation was superior to no manual ventilation with respect to median lowest oxygen saturation.

Between Induction and Laryngoscopy

For nearly 50 years, clinicians debated whether to administer or avoid positive pressure ventilation during the 45- to 90-second interval between the administration of sedation and neuromuscular blockade and the point at which the medications have taken effect and laryngoscopy can be initiated. Whether positive pressure ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy could decrease the incidence of hypoxemia during intubation was uncertain, as was whether positive pressure ventilation would cause gastric insufflation and aspiration. The recent PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) trial compared bag mask ventilation versus no ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy among 401 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in seven ICUs in the United States. The trial found that bag mask ventilation reduced the incidence of hypoxemia from 22.8% to 10.9% (absolute difference, −12.0 percentage points; 95% CI, −19.3 to −4.6). Aspiration occurred in 2.5% of patients in the bag mask ventilation group versus 4.0% of patients in the no-ventilation group. Together, the results of the PreVent trial, PREOXI trial, and other recent trials suggest that critically ill adults without a specific contraindication to positive pressure ventilation should receive supplemental oxygen and positive pressure ventilation from induction of anesthesia until the initiation of laryngoscopy.

Should Mask Ventilation Be Avoided?

Critically ill patients are at risk for aspiration and for potentially severe sequelae of aspiration in the presence of acute respiratory failure. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI), which avoids mask ventilation, has long been thought to help minimize the risk of aspiration, although the supporting evidence is limited. Furthermore, RSI itself may confer risks related to induction agent selection and dose and risk of hypoxemia in patients with severe respiratory failure.

The PreVent trial compared bag-mask ventilation versus its avoidance during the interval between induction and tracheal intubation in 401 critically ill adults with a primary outcome of lowest SpO2. SpO2 was higher in the bag-mask ventilation group (96% vs. 93%), and the incidence of a SpO₂ < 80% was lower compared to the control group (10.9% vs. 22.8%). The overall rate of reported aspiration was 3.2%. Although not designed or powered to critically examine safety outcomes, such as aspiration, the PreVent results challenge the dogma that mask ventilation must be strictly avoided and supports clinicians who choose to employ bag-mask ventilation to safely temporize hypoxemia during the apneic interval. Secondary analysis of trial data also suggests that bag-mask ventilation may be associated with higher oxygen saturation during intubation than apneic oxygenation.

Physiologically difficult intubation

Patients with severe chronic lung disease, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, or an SpO₂ < 100% after pre-oxygenation are at increased risk for hypoxemia during intubation. Providing positive pressure ventilation for these high-risk patients during pre-oxygenation and between induction and laryngoscopy can help prevent hypoxemia. The primary concern regarding positive pressure ventilation in this setting is aspiration. For patients at high risk for hypoxemia and low risk for aspiration (e.g. those without vomiting, hematemesis, or hemoptysis), we pre-oxygenate with non-invasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation with 100% FiO₂ for 5 min whenever feasible. For patients at high risk for hypoxemia and high risk for aspiration, we pre-oxygenate with 60 l per minute of 100% FiO₂ via high-flow nasal cannula or with supplemental oxygen via standard face mask and nasal cannula. The recent PreVent trial found that positive pressure bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy reduced severe hypoxemia during tracheal intubation in the ICU. The PreVent trial excluded patients with very high risk for aspiration (e.g. vomiting, hematemesis, hemoptysis). Therefore, for patients with very high risk of aspiration, we provide supplemental oxygen alone without positive pressure after induction, whereas for patients at high risk for hypoxemia and without high-risk features for aspiration, we provide positive pressure ventilation with either BiPAP or bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^115bYYz7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Millions of critically ill adults undergo tracheal intubation in an emergency department or intensive care unit each year, nearly 40% of whom experience hypoxemia, hypotension, or cardiac arrest during the procedure. Over the last two decades, a series of randomized trials have evaluated the tools, techniques, devices, and drugs used to perform emergency tracheal intubation to determine which interventions improve outcomes and which are ineffective or harmful. Results of these trials have demonstrated that: preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation and administration of positive pressure ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy prevent hypoxemia during intubation; video laryngoscopy facilitates successful intubation on the first attempt and may prevent esophageal intubation; use of a stylet is superior to intubation with an endotracheal tube alone and is comparable to use of a bougie; and administration of a fluid bolus before induction does not prevent hypotension. Many additional decisions clinicians face during emergency tracheal intubation are not yet informed by rigorous evidence. Randomized trials must continue to examine systematically each aspect of this common and high-risk procedure to improve patient outcomes and bring forth an era of evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation.

### Preoxygenation strategies for endotracheal intubation in resource-limited settings: reframing the basics [^112H49AC]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges and practical solutions in Low-Resource settings

Although advanced preoxygenation modalities such as HFNC and NIPPV have proven clinical benefits, these are often unavailable in LRS. In such contexts, clinicians must individualize preoxygenation strategies based on available devices and patient-specific factors.

In patients with no or mild AHRF, combining an oxygen mask at a flush rate (fully opening a standard oxygen flowmeter beyond 15 L/min) with a nasal cannula at 15 L/min may increase the FiO₂ and help maintain apneic oxygenation after mask removal. The nasal oxygenation approach may be a widely applicable technique for apneic oxygenation when HFNC is unavailable. In critically ill patients who sustained moderate-to-severe AHRF or risk factors for reduced oxygen reserves (e.g. obesity, pleural effusion, and intra-abdominal hypertension), preoxygenation methods that provide PEEP, such as NIPPV or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), should be used to improve FRC and enhance alveolar recruitment. If NIPPV is unfeasible, BMV with a PEEP valve is a practical, low-cost alternative for preoxygenation. PEEP valves are generally available in most ICU emergency kits. This BMV approach was demonstrated by the PREVENT trial, which showed that using BMV peri-intubation reduced the incidence of severe hypoxemia without increasing the risk of aspiration. Furthermore, the Mapleson C circuit with 100% oxygen may offer similar benefits to BMV with a PEEP valve. It allows clinicians to feel the patient's respiratory effort, rate, and lung compliance, enabling better control of tidal volumes than self-inflating bags, as illustrated in Fig. 1. However, these circuits are limited by insufficient delivered flow in patients with high inspiratory demand or mask leak, leading to dilution with ambient air and reduced FiO₂. Adequate staff training is essential, as these techniques are often unfamiliar outside of anesthesiology practice (Supplement material in Table S1). Routine use of BMV with a PEEP valve or a Mapleson C circuit after induction and prior to laryngoscopy as well as in cases of failed or prolonged intubation, is vital to prevent severe hypoxemia, or other life-threatening events. Maintaining spontaneous ventilation during EIT should be considered in patients who are anticipated to have a difficult airway or require prolonged intubation. Additionally, strategic triage and targeted allocation of available equipment, such as reserving limited NIPPV-capable ventilators or HFNC devices for the most critical patients, may significantly influence outcomes. Finally, leveraging low-cost tools and contextual expertise can bridge the gap in preoxygenation quality across settings.

Before Induction (Preoxygenation)

Preoxygenation is the administration of supplemental oxygen before induction of anesthesia (Figure 1). By increasing the content and volume of oxygen in the lung at induction, preoxygenation decreases the risk of hypoxemia during the tracheal intubation procedure. Critically ill adults may receive preoxygenation with supplemental oxygen without positive pressure ventilation (i.e. a standard nasal cannula, a high-flow nasal cannula, or an oxygen mask) or with supplemental oxygen and positive pressure ventilation (i.e. noninvasive ventilation or bag mask ventilation). Three randomized trials have found the incidence of hypoxemia during intubation of critically ill adults to be lower when preoxygenation is performed with noninvasive ventilation as compared with an oxygen mask. The largest of these, the recent PREOXI (Pragmatic Trial Examining Oxygenation Prior to Intubation) trial, found that noninvasive ventilation reduced the incidence of hypoxemia from 18.5% to 8.1% (absolute risk difference, −9.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] −13.2 to −5.6) and reduced the incidence of cardiac arrest from 1.1% to 0.2% (absolute difference, −0.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −1.8 to −0.1). Aspiration occurred in six patients (0.9%) in the noninvasive ventilation group and nine patients (1.4%) in the oxygen mask group. Noninvasive ventilation appeared to decrease the incidence of hypoxemia in all subgroups, including patients undergoing intubation for encephalopathy and patients who were not requiring any supplemental oxygen in the hour before enrollment.

Neuromuscular Blocking Agent

For many critically ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation in current clinical care, the administration of a sedative medication to induce anesthesia is accompanied by the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent ("paralytic"). However, this practice is not universal, and, in some EDs and ICUs, tracheal intubation is routinely performed without a neuromuscular blocking agent (,–).

Administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent is intended to relax the muscles of the head and neck to facilitate laryngoscopy and prevent movement of the vocal cords to facilitate placement of an endotracheal tube in the trachea. The potential benefits of administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent include increasing the likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt and facilitating the ease of bag mask ventilation. The potential risks of administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent include the risks of the medication itself (e.g. hyperkalemia with succinylcholine) and the risks of paralysis in a critically ill adult (e.g. potentially greater risk of hypoxemia during intubation because of apnea). The relative risks and benefits of administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent during emergency tracheal intubation have never been examined in a randomized trial. However, a recent 1,150-patient randomized trial of patients undergoing tracheal intubation in the operating room suggested that neuromuscular blockade improved successful intubation on the first attempt (93.5% vs. 88.5%). Although these results may not generalize directly to intubations in the ED and ICU — most patients in the trial were intubated with a direct laryngoscope and hypoxemia was rare — until data from randomized trials in the ED and ICU setting are available, routine administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent for most tracheal intubations in these settings is reasonable.

### Preoxygenation before intubation in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113g8mfF]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension statement for reporting network meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA) (Additional file 1). The protocol for this review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42018085866).

Data sources and searches

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2019 for potentially relevant studies published in English. Our PubMed search strategy is presented in Additional file 2: Table S1. Reference lists of relevant articles were also reviewed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) of adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure investigating any form of preoxygenation devices during endotracheal intubation. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined by the individual authors in the included studies. Preoxygenation devices included COT via bag-valve mask or face mask, HFNC, or NIV. We defined preoxygenation as oxygen delivery during the period before induction of anesthesia, till initiation of laryngoscopy. Apneic oxygenation was defined as oxygen delivery to the nasopharynx during the time between initiation of laryngoscopy to the intubation of the trachea (Additional file 2: Figure S1). We excluded studies focusing only on apneic oxygenation. The following were excluded: studies evaluating only the duration of preoxygenation, decision on ventilation or preoxygenation during anesthesia or interventional procedures, or enrolling healthy volunteers or animals.

Study selection and data extraction

Two authors (KF and SA) independently screened citations and abstracts in duplicate and independently. All references judged potentially relevant were evaluated for full-text eligibility. Discrepancies were solved by consensus with the third author (GN). When relevant data or information was missing, we attempted to contact authors of the studies.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the lowest SpO 2 during the intubation procedure (from beginning of laryngoscopy to confirmation of endotracheal intubation by capnography). The secondary outcomes were proportion of patients with severe desaturation (SpO 2 < 80%), intubation-related complications (aspiration or new infiltrate on post-intubation chest radiograph, hemodynamic instability, and cardiac arrest), and mortality.

Risk of bias assessment

Two authors (SA and GN) independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We assessed the risk of bias of RCTs using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. In case of disagreement for the attribution of risk of bias, it was solved by discussion and consensus with the third author (KF).

Mitigating Hypoxemia

Hypoxemia is the second most common adverse event associated with tracheal intubation in critically ill adults. Maintaining adequate oxygenation between induction and intubation, sometimes called the apneic interval, is a key element of safe airway management. Acute or chronic lung disease coupled with concerns about aspiration serve to limit the efficacy of traditional pre-oxygenation strategies and diminish enthusiasm for certain rescue approaches.

Are Standard Pre-oxygenation Strategies Adequate?

Conventional pre-oxygenation approaches often do not meaningfully extend the safe apneic interval, particularly in patients with impaired gas exchange at baseline. Secondary analysis of airway management trial data has revealed a nearly linear, proportionate relationship between SpO2 at induction and the lowest SpO2 during tracheal intubation. This was exemplified in a study by Mort et al. in which 34 consecutive critically ill patients were pre-oxygenated prior to tracheal intubation with 100% inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) through an adult resuscitator bag for 8 min with serial arterial blood gas analysis. From 0 to 4 min, the mean PaO2 increased from approximately 62 mmHg to 84 mmHg, and from 4 to 8 min the mean increase was only 9 mmHg, with a quarter of patients demonstrating a reduction in PaO2, likely due to atelectasis.

What About Non-Invasive Ventilation?

NIV has been associated with improved oxygenation during tracheal intubation with fewer adverse events compared to conventional pre-oxygenation. Positive pressure likely helps overcome the absorption atelectasis that develops during pre-oxygenation with high FiO2 and unsupported spontaneous breathing. Despite these advantages, INTUBE showed that NIV use was infrequent in clinical practice, although not all patients may require advanced approaches to pre-oxygenation. From a speculative standpoint, there are several potential barriers to wider adoption. One may be the time required to initiate support de novo or other barriers to easy implementation. Another is that the mask interface must be removed prior to airway instrumentation, at which point oxygen delivery is interrupted. Finally, NIV may risk gastric insufflation and aspiration, which will be discussed subsequently.

### Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients: a comprehensive systematic review of randomized trials [^113eBJ2i]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The only RCT comparing a pre-intubation checklist to no checklist did not find any positive effect: these results are in contrast with the above mentioned before-after study, and in line with another observational study. A different choice of items could at least in part explain the difference: the positive results were obtained in a center with extensive experience in intubation specifically in critically ill patients, while the checklist of the RCT derived from the opinions of experts in airway management and from guideline-recommended steps for intubation, not focused on critically ill patients. The present systematic review could contribute to identify the most relevant items to be included in future checklists.

Pre-oxygenation of patients to be intubated has a strong rationale, extending the duration of safe apnea during laryngoscopy before the patient reaches critical levels of hypoxemia. Apneic oxygenation can be complementary to pre-oxygenation techniques. Pre-oxygenation before intubation of critically ill patients and, above all, of hypoxemic patients, is crucial. However, the techniques commonly applied in the operating room (spontaneous breathing of high concentration of oxygen applied by face mask for some minutes, followed by manual ventilation by a bag-valve mask) might be not effective or feasible in the deranged physiology of ICU and ED patients. Our findings suggest that HFNC might improve pre-oxygenation; on the other hand, apneic oxygenation with HFNC seems ineffective. These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis also including a non-randomized trial: apneic oxygenation with HFNC reduced severe desaturation in elective intubation in the operating room (OR), but not in ICU patients with respiratory failure. On the contrary, NIV applied for 3 minutes before laryngoscopy resulted in a better safety profile reducing the incidence of severe desaturation episodes, without NIV-related complications: NIV may be regarded as a useful approach to pre-oxygenation in critically ill patients, above all in hypoxemic patients, even if it was evaluated only in a single, small study.

### Beginning of the end? End-tidal oxygen as an outcome in airway management research [^111sqw4e]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue of EClinicalMedicine, Vourc'h and colleaguesreport the results of the PREOPTIPOP trial, the first randomized trial to compare non-invasive ventilation (NIV) versus high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) during tracheal intubation in the operating room. The trial enrolled 100 obese adults undergoing elective intubation in the operating room of a single medical center. Patients randomized to NIV received 100% oxygen with an inspiratory positive airway pressure of 15 cmH₂O and an expiratory positive airway pressure of 5 cmH₂O from the start of pre-oxygenation until the patient developed apnea after induction. Patients randomized to HFNC received 60 L/min of 100% oxygen via nasal prongs from the start of pre-oxygenation until intubation of the trachea. Patients randomized to NIV had higher end-tidal oxygen concentrations following intubation (88%, inter-quartile range 82% to 90% vs. 76%, inter-quartile range 66% to 82%; P < 0.0001) and a lower incidence of arterial oxygen saturation less than 95% (30% vs. 12%; P = 0.03). The incidence of moderate or severe complications did not differ between groups. These results are consistent with those of other recent trials demonstrating the benefit of providing positive pressure during preoxygenation, and during the period from induction to laryngoscopy.

High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been proposed for use in preoxygenation because it provides a high concentration of inhaled oxygen, decreases work of breathing, washes out anatomic dead space, and provides a low level of continuous positive airway pressure. Additionally, HFNC can be left in place after induction, providing "apneic oxygenation", at a time when laryngoscopy requires removal of face masks used for bag-mask ventilation or non-invasive ventilation. Trials evaluating preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation with HFNC, however, have largely shown disappointing results, particularly when HFNC is compared against NIV. The higher mean airway pressures achieved by non-invasive ventilation may outweigh the potential benefits of apneic oxygenation. Alternatively, non-invasive ventilation may assist ventilation, delivering highly oxygenated air to the distal alveolar spaces more effectively than apneic oxygenation. Although incomplete, the data currently available suggest that, for many patients, positive pressure ventilation with NIV may be more effective than HFNC for preventing hypoxemia during tracheal intubation.

### Benefits and risks of manual hyperinflation in intubated and mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients: a systematic review [^117PaT48]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Risk of bias within studies

The risk of bias among included studies is summarized in Table 4. Quality assessment revealed that five studies did not describe concealment of allocation. Only three studies clearly reported standardization of important co-interventions to prevent performance bias. Most studies did not report the use of intention-to-treat analysis. Description of the losses to follow-up was not included in three studies. All studies were open label, because blinding of the ICU clinicians was not feasible for these types of studies.

+, mentioned; -, not mentioned; ±, uncertain.

Synthesis of results

Studies varied widely in terms of patient populations, with dissimilar reasons for (acute and/or persistent) intubation and mechanical ventilation, MH intervention, and outcome measurements. Because of the substantial clinical heterogeneity, we focused on describing individual study results, rather than using a meta-analysis.

### An expiration date for etomidate? [^112mQTvh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, mitigation of hemodynamic instability following endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients should involve a suite of interventions, with the induction agent (and dose) being just one component. Other key interventions include the proactive use of vasopressors and appropriate fluid loading to counterbalance the anticipated decrease in preload associated with positive-pressure ventilation. For example, the Montpellier intubation protocol employs a bundle of interventions intended to reduce the risk of periintubation complications. In a pre-versus-post study, implementation of the Montpellier intubation protocol was associated with reduced rates of life-threatening (21% vs. 34%; P = 0.03) and other (9% vs. 21%) complications.

Fourth, the popularity of etomidate as an induction agent in critically ill patients is closely related to its use as a component of rapid sequence intubation (RSI). RSI involves administration of precalculated doses of an induction agent and paralytic drug in rapid succession, followed by immediate placement of an endotracheal tube before assisted ventilation. Although the predetermined dosing of an induction agent without titration can easily lead to hemodynamic instability, the stated benefit of RSI is to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Recent data bring this assumption into question. The PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) trial randomized 401 critically ill patients to receive mask ventilation or no ventilation during the period between induction and intubation. Patients receiving mask ventilation experienced a lower incidence of severe hypoxemia, whereas the rates of pulmonary aspiration did not differ significantly between the no-ventilation (2.5%) and ventilation (4%) arms. Although the trial was not designed to precisely detect between-group differences in the secondary outcome of pulmonary aspiration, these data offer support for avoiding RSI when intubating a critically ill patient.

Has etomidate reached its "best before" date when it comes to its routine use in endotracheal intubation? Wunsch and colleagues provide convincing findings that require attention and consideration. As we outline above, safer alternatives to etomidate exist, and airway management of critically ill patients should be considered to constitute a suite of interventions, with the induction agent (and dose) being just one component. While we await the results of other RCTs (NCT06179485, NCT05277896), we recommend careful consideration of the choice of induction drug when proceeding with endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.

### Ventilation by mask before and after the administration of neuromuscular blockade: a pragmatic non-inferiority trial [^112qo8Jr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Irrespective of which definition used, overall, patients who were difficult to ventilate achieved statistically greater tidal volumes following the administration of a NMBD. On average, the increase in exhaled volumes was 46–110 ml. As noted by other investigators, this increase should not be discounted solely as one of statistical relevance. Based on a respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min, as we suggested in our study, minute ventilation would increase by 690–1650 ml/min, an amount that is greater than two-times the average oxygen consumption in an otherwise healthy patient. Thus, we conclude that this difference is clinically relevant.

We acknowledge that our study has limitations. We employed convenience sampling, which could have introduced selection bias. The only portion of the study protocol that was mandated was the timing between anaesthetic induction and administration of the NMBD. Positioning of the airway and the use of airway adjuncts to maximise upper airway patency were left to the discretion of the primary anaesthesia providers. Also, as already stated, a standard airway pressure profile throughout the respiratory cycle, as would be the case when using the mechanical ventilator of the anaesthesia machine in pressure control mode, was not provided. Thus, some of the differences observed between study periods could be independent of the effects from the NMBDs. While study methods standardising every aspect of airway managment may have been more scientifically valid, we believe the generalisability to routine anaesthetic practice would have been severely limited. Using mechanically generated breaths from the anaesthesia ventilator rather than the breathing bag is much less common. It should also be noted that the most commonly used FMV grading scale, the Han scale, was derived from patients who were hand ventilated. The same is true of the Warter's scale. Furthermore, the most widely cited studies on the incidence of DMV, IMV, DMV/IMV, or DMV combined with difficult laryngoscopy are reporting on patients who were hand ventilated after the induction of anaesthesia.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^1158AaYw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

More than 1.5 million critically ill adults undergo tracheal intubation each year in the United States. Unlike tracheal intubation in the operating room before elective surgery, during which serious complications are rare, nearly 40% of tracheal intubations in the emergency department (ED) or ICU are complicated by hypoxemia, hypotension, or cardiac arrest, making tracheal intubation one of the highest-risk periods of a patient's critical illness. During each emergency tracheal intubation, clinicians must select between available 1) approaches to oxygenation and ventilation; 2) medications for sedation, paralysis, and hemodynamic support; and 3) devices for laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea, each of which may affect the likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt and the risk of serious complications (Figure 1). Over the last 25 years, a series of randomized trials have provided rigorous evidence that directly informs the optimal approach to many aspects of tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. This review summarizes what the evidence from randomized trials tells us about how best to intubate a critically ill adult in clinical care today and what knowledge gaps remain. This review does not address the many aspects of emergency tracheal intubation for which evidence from randomized trials is not yet available to complement clinical knowledge of anatomy and physiology, expert opinion, clinician judgment, observational studies, and extrapolation from the operating room. Many of these topics, such as the anatomically difficult airway, the physiologically difficult airway, awake intubation, and crisis resource management, have been well summarized in previous reviews and guidelines.

Figure 1.
Clinical decisions in each phase of emergency tracheal intubation may affect procedural and patient-centered outcomes. During the three phases of emergency tracheal intubation (preoxygenation, induction of anesthesia to initiation of laryngoscopy, and laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea), clinicians make numerous treatment decisions regarding 1) the approach to administration of supplemental oxygen and positive pressure ventilation; 2) medications related to induction of anesthesia, neuromuscular blockade, and hemodynamic support; and 3) the tools and approach to laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea. Conceptually, these choices may affect procedural outcomes (e.g. hypoxemia, hypotension, and failure to intubate on the first attempt), downstream short-term clinical outcomes (e.g. cardiac arrest), or long-term patient-centered outcomes (e.g. death, post-traumatic stress disorder). In the last two decades, how treatment choices during emergency tracheal intubation affect procedural and patient outcomes has been the focus of a series of randomized trials.

### In-hospital airway management of COVID-19 patients [^116uK6Fw]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Bag-mask ventilation should be avoided in COVID-19 patients when possible. Prior studies have found that manual ventilation before intubation was associated with an increased risk of SARS transmission and poses a similar risk for COVID-19 transmission. High-quality preoxygenation with 100% inspired oxygen for 5–10 min is important to optimize patients prior to airway management. Some centers recommend using NIV for preoxygenation based on studies of non-COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. If this approach is used, the ventilator must be switched off between preoxygenation and intubation to decrease aerosolization. Our institution does not use this approach.

If post-induction ventilation is required prior to intubation, some experts recommend placing an LMA immediately after induction for potentially lower risk of aerosolization. If bag-mask ventilation is required, low tidal volumes should be used and all precautions should be taken to avoid leaks. Air flows should be switched off during laryngoscopy. If a difficult airway is anticipated, or if the patient shows signs of tenuous oxygenation and a risk of rapid desaturation, a surgical airway team should be prepared at bedside. Routine use of video laryngoscopy has been suggested to provide additional distance between the intubating clinician and the airway. We also recommend a low threshold to escalate to a surgical airway in order to avoid repeated instrumentation of a difficult airway in COVID-19 patients and the subsequent precipitous emergent surgical airway. All clinicians involved in airway management should be clearly informed of the patient's COVID-19 confirmed or presumptive diagnosis, and the most experienced provider should perform the intubation. To further minimize exposure, the number of providers present in the room during intubation should be limited to only those who are essential.

Given the extremely high risk of viral transmission to all involved in the care of an arresting COVID-19 patient actively receiving chest compressions, it is crucial that all providers properly don PPE prior to attempting intubation or bag-mask ventilation. Although PPE should be made available, if a circumstance arises where it is not possible to don PPE, LMA placement rather than endotracheal intubation should be considered. Intubation may be attempted in a more controlled setting after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

### DirEct versus VIdeo laryngosCopE trial (DEVICE) [^111rwwzf]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

DirEct Versus VIdeo LaryngosCopE Trial ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Clinicians perform rapid sequence induction, laryngoscopy, and tracheal intubation for more than 5 million critically ill adults as a part of clinical care each year in the United States. Failure to intubate the trachea on the first attempt occurs in more than 10% of all tracheal intubation procedures performed in the emergency department and intensive care unit. Improving clinicians rate of intubation on the first attempt could reduce the risk of serious procedural complications. Clinicians frequently perform tracheal intubation of critically ill patients in the emergency department or intensive care unit. In 10–20% of emergency tracheal intubations, clinicians are unable to intubate the trachea on the first attempt, which increases the risk of peri-intubation complications.

The "Facilitating EndotracheaL intubation by Laryngoscopy technique and apneic Oxygenation Within the ICU " randomized clinical trial, conducted under waiver of informed consent, compared these two standard-of-care approaches during 150 emergency tracheal intubations at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, finding no difference in the rate of successful intubation on the first attempt between use of a video and use of a direct laryngoscope. The "McGrath Mac Videolaryngoscope Versus Macintosh Laryngoscope for Orotracheal Intubation in the Critical Care Unit " randomized clinical trial among 371 critically ill adults found no difference between use of a video vs direct laryngoscope in the rate of successful intubation on the first attempt. However, a hypothesis-forming post-hoc exploratory analysis of peri-intubation complications suggested that use of a video laryngoscope may be associated with a higher rate of complications than direct laryngoscope. To address this knowledge gap, the investigators propose to conduct a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing use of a video laryngoscope versus use of a direct laryngoscope with regard to successful intubation on the first attempt among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^113mmBth]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

How to Perform an Evidence-based Tracheal Intubation of a Critically Ill Adult

The approach to emergency tracheal intubation of a critically ill adult in the ED or ICU must be tailored to the patient, clinician, and context. Based on the available evidence from randomized trials (Table 1), the following represents a reasonable standard approach to tracheal intubation of a critically ill adult in the ED or ICU without an anticipated anatomically difficult airway for whom use of sedation and neuromuscular blockade is planned:
Unless a contraindication to noninvasive ventilation is present, administer noninvasive ventilation through either a dedicated bilevel positive inspiratory pressure machine or a tight-fitting mask connected to a conventional invasive mechanical ventilator beginning 3–5 minutes before induction of anesthesia and ending at the initiation of laryngoscopy (settings, FiO₂ of 100%, inspiratory pressure ⩾10 cmH₂O, expiratory pressure ⩾5 cmH₂O, respiratory rate ⩾10 breaths per minute).
In addition to the general management of shock and resuscitation in critically ill patients, for patients at risk of hypotension during intubation, it may be reasonable for clinicians to choose to initiate a vasopressor infusion or administer a bolus dose of vasopressor before or with the induction of anesthesia or to have these medications available to treat hypotension if it occurs after induction of anesthesia.
Administer either ketamine or etomidate for induction of anesthesia and either rocuronium or succinylcholine (if no contraindications are present) for neuromuscular blockade.
With the patient in a sniffing position, perform laryngoscopy using a video laryngoscope with either a standard geometry or hyperangulated blade.
While viewing the video screen, use either an endotracheal tube with stylet or a bougie to place an endotracheal tube in the trachea.
Use either colorimetric end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring or waveform capnography plus auscultation to confirm placement in the trachea.

Table 1.
Summary of Evidence from Randomized Trials on Emergency Tracheal Intubation

Beyond the treatment choices for which rigorous evidence now exists to inform care, clinicians must make numerous other treatment decisions during emergency tracheal intubation for which evidence is currently lacking (Table 1). Generating rigorous evidence to inform these knowledge gaps represents an important opportunity to continue to improve the safety of this common and high-risk procedure for critically ill adults.

### Preoxygenation in critically ill patients requiring emergency tracheal intubation [^112BtUN8]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of preoxygenation with 100% oxygen in the critically ill patient in preparation for emergency tracheal intubation.

Design

Nonrandomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Large, level 1 trauma center, tertiary care intensive care unit.

Patients

Critically ill patients failing noninvasive respiratory support techniques who require tracheal intubation followed by mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

A baseline arterial blood gas was obtained on noninvasive therapy and 4 mins post-100% oxygen therapy with a bag-mask assembly. Best effort to achieve a tight-fitting mask seal was pursued coupled with other mask ventilation maneuvers to optimize noninvasive oxygenation and ventilation.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 42 patients consecutively intubated during the 15-month study period were studied. The baseline Pao2 (mean ± sd) with concurrent noninvasive support was 67 ± 19.6 mm Hg (range, 43–88 mm Hg) and increased a mean of 37 mm Hg to 103.8 ± 63.2 mm Hg after 4 mins of preoxygenation with 100% oxygen. A total of 36% of patients had minimal changes (± 5%) in their baseline Pao2, and only 19% increased their baseline Pao2 by at least 50 mm Hg after preoxygenation maneuvers.

Conclusions

The critically ill patient has little reserve to tolerate interruption of oxygen delivery and, thus, is at risk for hypoxemia during emergency airway management. Preoxygenation efforts as described in this clinical trial appear to be marginally effective in regard to providing a reasonable safeguard against hypoxemia during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^114f2LWW]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is compared across studies, noting that "continuous oxygen flow of 40–60 L throughout the respiratory cycle may lead to gastric insufflation, which may increase the risk of regurgitation and aspiration". A prospective before-and-after study reported a 14% incidence of desaturation in the face-mask group and 2% in the HFNO group, with HFNO independently preventing desaturation less than 80% (adjusted odds ratio: 0.17; 95% CI, 0.01–0.90; p = 0.04). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients with more severe hypoxemia (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 150), desaturation incidence was 25.8% for HFNO and 22.3% for face-mask oxygenation. A retrospective analysis reported a 23% incidence for HFNO versus 2.5% for NIPPV; none of the patients who received HFNO desaturated to less than 70%, compared with 13% of those who received NIPPV. Another trial showed desaturation rates of 27% with HFNO and 23% with NIPPV; among patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200, desaturation rates were 35% with HFNO and 24% with NIPPV. In one study of lowest saturation, 12% desaturated to less than 93% in the facemask group, whereas all patients in the HFNO group maintained an oxygen saturation of greater than 93%. Synthesis on aspiration risk indicates seven studies reporting gastric insufflation or aspiration, and "based on very low-quality evidence, it appears as though HFNO does not affect aspiration risk". For severe complications, eight studies reported cardiac arrest or severe cardiovascular collapse and "all are very low quality of evidence; therefore, no conclusions could be drawn". Overall, "in patients with severe hypoxemia, NIPPV appears to have the strongest evidence for decreasing the incidence of critical desaturation during RSI", while "HFNO provides the added benefit of continued oxygen flow into the nasopharynx during laryngoscopy", and "HFNO seemed to reduce the occurrence rate of desaturation, prolonged safe apnea times, and overall limited the degree of desaturation compared with studies of preoxygenation with a face mask, but not necessarily when compared with studies in which NIPPV was used". Implementation varies because "many rural hospitals and essentially all prehospital and interfacility transport services cannot provide HFNO due to oxygen-capacity limitations". Evidence gaps are noted: "Definitive research is not feasible to determine the optimal method of preoxygenation in patients with difficult airways, prolonged laryngoscopy".

### Preoxygenation strategies for endotracheal intubation in resource-limited settings: reframing the basics [^115tKW4G]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The Evidence-Based preoxygenation strategies for ETI

Preoxygenation is essential to increasing oxygen reserves, prolonging the safe apnea time during ETI, and reducing hypoxemia-related complications. However, traditional preoxygenation using a non-rebreather mask or bag-mask ventilation (BVM) with 100% oxygen is often inadequate in critically ill patients due to low flow rates and lack of PEEP.

Recent evidence supports that both HFNC and NIPPV are effective preoxygenation strategies in patients with AHRF. A recent network meta-analysis by Pitre et al. which included 15 randomized trials and over 3400 patients, found that HFNC and NIPPV were superior to facemask oxygenation in reducing the incidence of peri-intubation hypoxemia. Importantly, NIPPV reduced the risk of hypoxemia compared with HFNC (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.55–0.98) and facemask oxygen (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.39–0.65). HFNC also demonstrated superiority over the facemask (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54–0.88), likely due to its ability to deliver high and stable oxygen flow during apnoeic oxygenation, wash out pharyngeal dead space, and improve FRC. Additionally, NIPPV might reduce the risk of serious adverse events compared with HFNC (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11–0.91) and probably does so compared to facemasks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12–0.77). These findings reinforce prior individual trial results, highlighting the efficacy and safety of NIPPV, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe AHRF. Furthermore, the strategy combined NIPPV and HFNC effectively maintained oxygen saturation during laryngoscopy in severe AHRF patients. Similarly, in the PREOXI trial, the benefit of NIPPV was more evident in the subgroups of patients with AHRF, pre-intubation FiO₂ > 70%, or body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m². These findings support the use of HFNC as an effective strategy for mild hypoxemia, whereas NIPPV is beneficial for moderate to severe hypoxemia, and a combination of multiple modalities is necessary for more severe patients.

### Video laryngoscopy may improve the intubation outcomes in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111LN1DU]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study included and analysed the most current RCTs, including the DEVICE trial, a large-scale trial involving more than 1000 patients from multiple EDs and ICUs. Quality assessment of bias showed that 15 of 26 studies could be classified as low risk. Due to the significant heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses based on potential clinical factors contributing to this variability. Our study highlights the effects of different intubation settings and operators' experience on the outcomes.

However, the current meta-analysis has certain limitations. First, there was significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome. On further subgroup analyses, we found that across subgroups all but five studies reported effect estimates in a consistent direct. Previous research indicated that VL improved the success rate of intubation in patients with difficult airways. Whether enrolled patients had anticipated difficult airways could be an important factor contributing to heterogeneity. Future research should further compare the efficacy of VL versus DL in specific cases, such as patients with difficult airways. The use of anaesthetics and peri-intubation medications during induction may be another important factor contributing to heterogeneity. Due to the lack of strict protocols for peri-intubation medications in most of the included studies, conducting subgroup analyses based on medications was not feasible. In addition, the absence of patient-level data prevented a more detailed assessment of factors that could influence the relative efficacy of VL versus DL, such as the operators' experience and proportion of patients with difficult airways.

### Official executive summary of an American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline: liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults [^1178jXpb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation after extubation — high-risk adults: For patients at high risk for extubation failure who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours and who have passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), the panel states we recommend extubation to preventive noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence). Patients at high risk may include those with hypercapnia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or other serious comorbidities, and clinicians may avoid extubation to NIV when patient-specific factors such as inability to receive ventilation through a mask or similar interface are present; if NIV is used, it should be applied immediately after extubation to realize the outcome benefits.

### Randomized trial of apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation of the critically ill [^117WSsco]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Hypoxemia is common during endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients and may predispose to cardiac arrest and death. Administration of supplemental oxygen during laryngoscopy (apneic oxygenation) may prevent hypoxemia.

Objectives

To determine if apneic oxygenation increases the lowest arterial oxygen saturation experienced by patients undergoing endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit.

Methods

This was a randomized, open-label, pragmatic trial in which 150 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation in a medical intensive care unit were randomized to receive 15 L/min of 100% oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula during laryngoscopy (apneic oxygenation) or no supplemental oxygen during laryngoscopy (usual care). The primary outcome was lowest arterial oxygen saturation between induction and 2 minutes after completion of endotracheal intubation.

Measurements and Main Results

Median lowest arterial oxygen saturation was 92% with apneic oxygenation versus 90% with usual care (95% confidence interval for the difference, -1.6 to 7.4%; P = 0.16). There was no difference between apneic oxygenation and usual care in incidence of oxygen saturation less than 90% (44.7 vs. 47.2%; P = 0.87), oxygen saturation less than 80% (15.8 vs. 25.0%; P = 0.22), or decrease in oxygen saturation greater than 3% (53.9 vs. 55.6%; P = 0.87). Duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay, and in-hospital mortality were similar between study groups.

Conclusions

Apneic oxygenation does not seem to increase lowest arterial oxygen saturation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients compared with usual care. These findings do not support routine use of apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 02051816).

### High-flow oxygen therapy versus facemask preoxygenation in anticipated difficult airway management (PREOPTI-DAM): an open-label, single-centre, randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^115VAH1c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the occurrence of oxygen desaturation ≤ 94% measured by pulse oximetry (Nellcor OxiMax Durasensor DS 100A) or bag-mask ventilation whatever the value of SpO₂. Bag-mask ventilation was included in the primary outcome to account for the potential use of bag-mask ventilation to prevent hypoxemia in this unblinded trial. This criterion was assessed from the end of the preoxygenation time to 2 min following intubation (i.e. detection of oxygen desaturation by pulse oximetry may be delayed by 60 s according to manufacturer instructions).

Secondary outcomes were the quality of preoxygenation, intubation-related adverse events, and respiratory outcomes during and after surgery. Quality of preoxygenation was assessed by pulse oximetry at the end of preoxygenation, leaks during preoxygenation (i.e. 15% difference between inspired and expired volume in the facemask group or leaks though the mouth in the HFNC group), the end-tidal oxygen (EtO₂) and the end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO₂) levels at the end of preoxygenation. During intubation, the following items were recorded: first operator, the number of operators, first pass success, the number of laryngoscopy and alternative device, the duration of the procedure (from the injection of anaesthetic drugs to the start of mechanical ventilation), the Intubation Difficulty Score, the lowest SpO₂, oxygen desaturation below 90%, EtO₂ and EtCO₂ levels within 2 min of intubation (Fig. 2). Severe intubation-related adverse events during intubation and the following hour included: death, cardiac arrest, severe desaturation < 80%, severe hypotension with systolic blood pressure < 80 mm of mercury (mmHg) or the need for a vasopressor (i.e. ephedrine, neosynephrine or norepinephrine). Mild-to-moderate complications included: Nasolaryngotracheal injury or bleeding, oesophageal intubation, dangerous agitation defined by a Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale > 3, ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia, dental injury, vomiting with aspiration of gastric content, intubation failure. Respiratory outcomes during surgery were: the highest FiO₂ (i.e. to achieve an SpO₂ 95%), the highest peak and plateau pressure at 5, 30 and 60 min after intubation, need for recruitment manoeuvres (i.e. for oxygen desaturation below 95%) or need for tidal volume reduction owing to peak pressure > 40 cm of water. After surgery, in the post-anaesthesia care unit, the following outcomes were assessed: length of stay, respiratory status (duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen desaturation below 90% or below 80%, the lowest SpO₂ recorded after extubation, non-invasive ventilation support, inspiratory dyspnoea after extubation, extubation failure), the occurrence of nausea or vomiting. Satisfaction scores (1 = Excellent, 2 = Good, 3 = Reasonable, 4 = Poor) were noted before discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit.

### Effect of preoxygenation using non-invasive ventilation before intubation on subsequent organ failures in hypoxaemic patients: a randomised clinical trial [^112VPELe]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous data showed that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) applied for 3 min before tracheal intubation ensured better oxygenation compared with using a non-rebreather bag-valve-mask. We aimed to determine whether preoxygenation using NIV is effective in reducing the incidence of organ dysfunction in hypoxaemic, critically ill patients in intensive care.

Methods

A multicentre, randomised, open-label trial evaluating 100% FiO 2 administered with NIV (99 patients) vs with face mask (102 patients) for 3 min before tracheal intubation. The primary endpoint was the maximal value of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 7 days after intubation.

Results

The median (inter-quartile range) values of the maximal value of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 7 days post-intubation were not significantly different between the two randomised groups: nine (6–12) in the NIV group vs 10 (6–12) in the face mask group (P = 0.65). In patients treated by NIV prior to the randomisation, there was a significant increase in the occurrence in adverse events in patients randomised to face mask [odds ratio = 5.23 (1.61;16.99), P = 0.0059].

Conclusions

This study failed to demonstrate any benefits of using NIV as a preoxygenation method to reduce organ dysfunction compared with usual preoxygenation in hypoxaemic, critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation for invasive ventilation. NIV should not be discontinued for preoxygenation in the cases of patients treated by NIV before the decision to intubate.

Adult basic life support — supporting evidence for ventilations in respiratory arrest highlights rapid desaturation during apnea and effects of ventilation strategy: a study of 14 patients who underwent general anesthesia while breathing room air found that oxygen saturation dropped to dangerously low levels within 90 seconds after onset of apnea (mean oxygen saturation, 62.1%; range, 43.9%–81.9%); a randomized trial in critically ill apneic adult patients found that bag-mask ventilation at a rate of 10 breaths per minute compared with no ventilation decreased the incidence of severe hypoxic events before intubation, and the tidal volume used was enough to cause visible chest rise; and an in-hospital study found that any hypocapnia, severe hypercapnia, and swings in both hypocapnia and hypercapnia were associated with a higher rate of 1-month unfavorable neurological outcome compared with mild hypercapnia.

### Association between use of lung-protective ventilation with lower… [^113eDgDK]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Meta-analysis using a random-effects model showed, in protective ventilation groups, a lower incidence of pulmonary infection, lower mean hospital length of stay. Some observational studies have suggested that use of higher VT in patients without ARDS or ALI, at the initiation of mechanical ventilation, increases morbidity and mortality. 8–10 As suggested by the "biotrauma hypothesis, " ventilation with higher VT and peak pressures may lead to recruitment of neutrophils and local production and release of inflammatory mediators. 11 We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether conventional or protective tidal volumes would be associated with lung injury, mortality, pulmonary infection, and atelectasis in patients without lung injury at the onset of mechanical ventilation.

We extracted data regarding the study design, patient characteristics, type of ventilation, mean change in arterial blood gases, lung injury development, ICU and hospital length of stay, time to extubation, overall survival, and incidence of atelectasis. For the analysis of lung injury development, mortality, pulmonary infection, and atelectasis, we used the most protracted follow-up in each trial up to hospital discharge. We calculated a pooled estimate of risk ratio in the individual studies using a fixed-effects model according to Mantel and Haenszel and graphically represented these results using forest plot graphs. Overall mortality was lower in patients receiving protective ventilation. The incidence of pulmonary infection and atelectasis were lower in the group receiving ventilation with a lower VT. We found evidence that a ventilation strategy using lower tidal volumes is associated with a lower risk for developing ARDS. Furthermore, the strategy was associated with lower mortality, fewer pulmonary infections, and less atelectasis when compared with higher tidal volume ventilation in patients without lung injury at the onset of mechanical ventilation. These benefits were associated with a shorter hospital length of stay.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^115DFagS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Laryngoscopy and Tracheal Intubation

After a patient has received preoxygenation and medications for induction of anesthesia, a clinician confirms that the patient is positioned for the procedure, obtains a view of the vocal cords (laryngoscopy), and inserts the endotracheal tube between the vocal cords and into the trachea (intubation). Decisions regarding the devices used for laryngoscopy and intubation affect the likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt (Figure 1).

Laryngoscope

Two types of laryngoscopes are commonly used to perform emergency tracheal intubation: a direct laryngoscope and a video laryngoscope. A direct laryngoscope consists of a handle, a blade, and a light (Figure 2). A video laryngoscope has the same components but also contains a camera near the tip of the blade that transmits images to a screen. At least 20 randomized trials have compared video versus direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. The largest of these trials, the DEVICE (Direct versus Video Laryngoscope) trial, found that among 1,417 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in 17 EDs and ICUs, the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt was 85.1% in the video laryngoscope group and 70.8% in the direct laryngoscope group (absolute difference, 14.3%; 95% CI, 9.9 to 18.7; P < 0.001). Use of a video laryngoscope appeared to be beneficial in every subgroup, and the effect was largest for intubations performed by clinicians with the least prior intubating experience. A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials found that use of a video laryngoscope probably leads to a higher rate of successful intubation on the first attempt (relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06–1.21; moderate certainty) and a lower rate of esophageal intubation (relative risk, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27–0.82; moderate certainty). Except for the purpose of training in direct laryngoscopy or in settings where a video laryngoscope is unavailable, a video laryngoscope should be the primary device used for laryngoscopy during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults.

ASA difficult airway algorithm: adult patients — pre-intubation guidance directs clinicians to choose between an awake or post-induction airway strategy based on patient risk, to screen for specific hazards, and to maintain oxygenation. Pre-intubation, the algorithm states, "Before attempting intubation, choose between either an awake or post-induction airway strategy. Choice of strategy and technique should be made by the clinician managing the airway". It prompts evaluation for "Suspected difficult laryngoscopy?", "Suspected difficult ventilation with face mask/supraglottic airway?", "Significant increased risk of aspiration?", "Increased risk of rapid desaturation?", and "Suspected difficult emergency invasive airway", noting that "Any one factor alone (assessed difficulty with intubation, ventilation, or aspiration or desaturation risk) may be clinically important enough to warrant an awake intubation". The figure emphasizes "Always evaluate for emergency invasive airway", "OPTIMIZE OXYGENATION THROUGHOUT", and then proceeding via "INTUBATION ATTEMPT WITH PATIENT AWAKE" or "INTUBATION ATTEMPT AFTER INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA".

### Compared efficacy of four preoxygenation methods for intubation in the ICU: retrospective analysis of mcGrath mac videolaryngoscope versus Macintosh laryngoscope (MACMAN) trial data [^112wmQnA]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Severe hypoxemia is the most common serious adverse event during endotracheal intubation. Preoxygenation is performed routinely as a preventive measure. The relative efficacy of the various available preoxygenation devices is unclear. Here, our objective was to assess associations between preoxygenation devices and pulse oximetry values during endotracheal intubation.

Design

Post hoc analysis of data from a multicenter randomized controlled superiority trial (McGrath Mac Videolaryngoscope Versus Macintosh Laryngoscope [MACMAN]) comparing videolaryngoscopy to Macintosh laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in critical care.

Setting

Seven French ICUs.

Patients

Three-hundred nineteen of the 371 critically ill adults requiring endotracheal intubation who were included in the MACMAN trial.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Minimal pulse oximetry value during endotracheal intubation was the primary endpoint. We also sought risk factors for pulse oximetry below 90%. Of 319 patients, 157 (49%) had bag-valve-mask, 71 (22%) noninvasive ventilation, 71 (22%) non-rebreathing mask, and 20 (7%) high-flow nasal oxygen for preoxygenation. Factors independently associated with minimal pulse oximetry value were the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II severity score (p = 0.03), baseline pulse oximetry (p < 0.001), baseline PaO2/FIO2 ratio (p = 0.02), and number of laryngoscopies (p = 0.001). The only independent predictors of pulse oximetry less than 90% were baseline pulse oximetry (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64–0.79; p < 0.001) and preoxygenation device: with bag-valve-mask as the reference, odds ratios were 1.10 (95% CI, 0.25–4.92) with non-rebreathing mask, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.01–0.80) with noninvasive ventilation, and 5.75 (95% CI, 1.15–28.75) with high-flow nasal oxygen.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that the main determinants of hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation may be related to critical illness severity and to preexisting hypoxemia. The differences across preoxygenation methods suggest that noninvasive ventilation may deserve preference in patients with marked hypoxemia before endotracheal intubation. Ongoing studies will provide further clarification about the optimal preoxygenation method for endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.

### Difficult airway management in adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients: statement by the society of airway management [^114ywHQh]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), often results in severe hypoxemia requiring airway management. Because SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread via respiratory droplets, bag-mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation may place health care workers (HCW) at risk. While existing recommendations address airway management in patients with COVID-19, no guidance exists specifically for difficult airway management. Some strategies normally recommended for difficult airway management may not be ideal in the setting of COVID-19 infection. To address this issue, the Society for Airway Management (SAM) created a task force to review existing literature and current practice guidelines for difficult airway management by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway. The SAM task force created recommendations for the management of known or suspected difficult airway in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The goal of the task force was to optimize successful airway management while minimizing exposure risk. Each member conducted a literature review on specific clinical practice section utilizing standard search engines (PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar). Existing recommendations and evidence for difficult airway management in the COVID-19 context were developed. Each specific recommendation was discussed among task force members and modified until unanimously approved by all task force members. Elements of Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Reporting Checklist for dissemination of clinical practice guidelines were utilized to develop this statement. Airway management in the COVID-19 patient increases HCW exposure risk. Difficult airway management often takes longer and may involve multiple procedures with aerosolization potential, and strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols is mandatory to reduce risk to providers. When a patient's airway risk assessment suggests that awake tracheal intubation is an appropriate choice of technique, and procedures that may cause increased aerosolization of secretions should be avoided. Optimal preoxygenation before induction with a tight seal facemask may be performed to reduce the risk of hypoxemia. Unless the patient is experiencing oxygen desaturation, positive pressure bag-mask ventilation after induction may be avoided to reduce aerosolization. For optimal intubating conditions, patients should be anesthetized with full muscle relaxation. Videolaryngoscopy is recommended as a first-line strategy for airway management. If emergent invasive airway access is indicated, then we recommend a surgical technique such as scalpel-bougie-tube, rather than an aerosolizing generating procedure, such as transtracheal jet ventilation. This statement represents recommendations by the SAM task force for the difficult airway management of adults with COVID-19 with the goal to optimize successful airway management while minimizing the risk of clinician exposure.

### Noninvasive ventilation for preoxygenation during emergency intubation [^115Xah4e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, hypoxemia increases the risk of cardiac arrest and death. The effect of preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation, as compared with preoxygenation with an oxygen mask, on the incidence of hypoxemia during tracheal intubation is uncertain.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized trial conducted at 24 emergency departments and intensive care units in the United States, we randomly assigned critically ill adults (age, ≥ 18 years) undergoing tracheal intubation to receive preoxygenation with either noninvasive ventilation or an oxygen mask. The primary outcome was hypoxemia during intubation, defined by an oxygen saturation of less than 85% during the interval between induction of anesthesia and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation.

Results

Among the 1301 patients enrolled, hypoxemia occurred in 57 of 624 patients (9.1%) in the noninvasive-ventilation group and in 118 of 637 patients (18.5%) in the oxygen-mask group (difference, -9.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.2 to -5.6; P < 0.001). Cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient (0.2%) in the noninvasive-ventilation group and in 7 patients (1.1%) in the oxygen-mask group (difference, -0.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.1). Aspiration occurred in 6 patients (0.9%) in the noninvasive-ventilation group and in 9 patients (1.4%) in the oxygen-mask group (difference, -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.6 to 0.7).

Conclusions

Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation resulted in a lower incidence of hypoxemia during intubation than preoxygenation with an oxygen mask. (Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense; PREOXI ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05267652.).

### How to improve intubation in the intensive care unit. update on knowledge and devices [^116YDbbg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Tracheal intubation in the critically ill is associated with serious complications, mainly cardiovascular collapse and severe hypoxemia. In this narrative review, we present an update of interventions aiming to decrease these complications. MACOCHA is a simple score that helps to identify patients at risk of difficult intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Preoxygenation combining the use of inspiratory support and positive end-expiratory pressure should remain the standard method for preoxygenation of hypoxemic patients. Apneic oxygenation using high-flow nasal oxygen may be supplemented, to prevent further hypoxemia during tracheal intubation. Face mask ventilation after rapid sequence induction may also be used to prevent hypoxemia, in selected patients without high-risk of aspiration. Hemodynamic optimization and management are essential before, during and after the intubation procedure. All these elements can be integrated in a bundle. An airway management algorithm should be adopted in each ICU and adapted to the needs, situation and expertise of each operator. Videolaryngoscopes should be used by experienced operators.

### Nasal high-flow preoxygenation for endotracheal intubation in the critically ill patient: a randomized clinical trial [^115ywoYj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Preoxygenation with high-flow therapy by nasal cannulae (HFNC) is now widespread in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, no large randomized study has assessed its relevance in non-severely hypoxemic patients. In a randomized controlled trial (PROTRACH study), we aimed to evaluate preoxygenation with HFNC vs. standard bag-valve mask oxygenation (SMO) in non-severely hypoxemic patients during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the ICU.

Methods

Randomized controlled trial including non-severely hypoxemic patients requiring intubation in the ICU. Patients received preoxygenation by HFNC or SMO during RSI. HFNC was maintained throughout the intubation procedure whereas SMO was removed to perform laryngoscopy. The primary outcome was the lowest pulse oximetry (SpO₂) throughout the intubation procedure. Secondary outcomes included drop in SpO₂, adverse events related to intubation, and outcome in the ICU.

Results

A total of 192 patients were randomized. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 184 patients (HFNC n = 95; SMO n = 89), the median [IQR] lowest SpO₂ was 100% [97; 100] for HFNC and 99% [95; 100] for the SMO group (P = 0.30). Mild desaturation below 95% was more frequent with SMO (23%) than with HFNC (12%) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–0.99, P = 0.045). There were fewer adverse events in the HFNC group (6%) than in the SMO group (19%) (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13–0.76, P = 0.007), including fewer severe adverse events, respectively 6 (6%) and 14 (16%) with HFNC and SMO (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15–0.95, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Compared with SMO, preoxygenation with HFNC in the ICU did not improve the lowest SpO 2 during intubation in the non-severely hypoxemic patients but led to a reduction in intubation-related adverse events.

### Managing the physiologically difficult airway in critically ill adults [^113EJ1EL]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Airway management (i.e. tracheal intubation) in critically ill adults has long been recognized as technically difficult. Myriad patient and environment-specific factors conspire to increase the difficulty of conventional laryngoscopy and other approaches to the airway. However, intubation in critical care settings has benefitted from advances in equipment and techniques originally developed for application in procedural environments: algorithmic approaches, video laryngoscopy, supraglottic airways, and other adjuncts. Their application to critical care settings has helped to increase the accessibility and safety of airway management.

Among this mitigation of technical difficulties, the latent physiologic difficulties of tracheal intubation in critically ill adults have become a new focus. These patients typically require definitive airway management due to organ dysfunction or other manifestations of critical illness, including altered consciousness, respiratory failure, and shock. These and other pathophysiological states increase the risks associated with sedative hypnotic (i.e. induction) agents and their hemodynamic sequelae, apnea during tracheal intubation, and/or transition to positive pressure mechanical ventilation. Therefore, successful airway management in critically ill adults requires planning and execution of strategies that mitigate potential technical and physiological difficulties.

### High-flow nasal cannula versus bag-valve-mask for preoxygenation before intubation in subjects with hypoxemic respiratory failure [^11151deS]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients with respiratory failure undergoing intubation have an increased risk of hypoxemia-related complications. Delivering oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has theoretical advantages and is increasingly used. This study was conducted to compare HFNC with bag-valve-mask (BVM) for preoxygenation and to assess oxygenation during intubation in subjects with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Methods

This study was a randomized controlled trial including 40 critically ill subjects with hypoxemic respiratory failure who received either HFNC or BVM for preoxygenation before intubation in the ICU. The primary outcome was the mean lowest SpO2 during intubation.

Results

The mean lowest SpO2 during intubation was 89 ± 18% in the HFNC group and 86 ± 11% in the BVM group (P = 0.56). In subjects receiving HFNC, a significant increase in SpO2 after preoxygenation was only seen in those previously receiving low-flow oxygen (P = 0.007), whereas there was no significant difference in SpO2 in subjects previously receiving noninvasive ventilation or HFNC (P = 0.73). During the 1 min of apnea after the induction of anesthesia, SpO2 dropped significantly in the BVM group (P = 0.001), whereas there was no significant decrease in the HFNC group (P = 0.17). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups at any of the predefined time points before or after intubation concerning SpO2, PaO₂/FiO₂, and PaCO₂.

Conclusions

Preoxygenation using HFNC before intubation was feasible and safe compared with BVM in critically ill subjects with acute, mild to moderate hypoxemic respiratory failure. There was no significant difference in the mean lowest SpO2 during intubation between the HFNC and the BVM group. There was also no significant difference in SpO2 between the 2 groups at any of the predefined time points. However, on continuous monitoring, there was a significant decrease in SpO2 during the apnea phase before intubation in the BVM group, which was not seen in the HFNC group.

### Randomized trial of video laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults [^117UY9J2]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of video laryngoscopy on the rate of endotracheal intubation on first laryngoscopy attempt among critically ill adults.

Design

A randomized, parallel-group, pragmatic trial of video compared with direct laryngoscopy for 150 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation by Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine fellows.

Setting

Medical ICU in a tertiary, academic medical center.

Patients

Critically ill patients 18 years old or older.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to video or direct laryngoscopy for the first attempt at endotracheal intubation.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients assigned to video (n = 74) and direct (n = 76) laryngoscopy were similar at baseline. Despite better glottic visualization with video laryngoscopy, there was no difference in the primary outcome of intubation on the first laryngoscopy attempt (video 68.9% vs direct 65.8%; p = 0.68) in unadjusted analyses or after adjustment for the operator's previous experience with the assigned device (odds ratio for video laryngoscopy on intubation on first attempt 2.02; 95% CI, 0.82–5.02, p = 0.12). Secondary outcomes of time to intubation, lowest arterial oxygen saturation, complications, and in-hospital mortality were not different between video and direct laryngoscopy.

Conclusions

In critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation, video laryngoscopy improves glottic visualization but does not appear to increase procedural success or decrease complications.

### Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults [^116pNa21]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Cricoid pressure is applied to protect the airway from contamination during the period between loss of consciousness and placement of a cuffed tracheal tube. This is a standard component of a rapid sequence induction in the UK. It is often overlooked that cricoid pressure has been shown to prevent gastric distension during mask ventilation and was originally described for this purpose. Gentle mask ventilation after the application of cricoid pressure and before tracheal intubation prolongs the time to desaturation. This is most useful in those with poor respiratory reserve, sepsis, or high metabolic requirements and also provides an early indication of the ease of ventilation. A force of 30 N provides good airway protection, while minimizing the risk of airway obstruction, but this is not well tolerated by the conscious patient.

Cricoid pressure should be applied with a force of 10 N when the patient is awake, increasing to 30 N as consciousness is lost. Although the application of cricoid pressure creates a physical barrier to the passage of gastric contents, it has also been shown to reduce lower oesophageal sphincter tone, possibly making regurgitation more likely. Current evidence suggests that if applied correctly, cricoid pressure may improve the view on direct laryngoscopy. However, there are many reports demonstrating that it is often poorly applied, and this may make mask ventilation, direct laryngoscopy, or SAD insertion more difficult. – If initial attempts at laryngoscopy are difficult during rapid sequence induction, cricoid pressure should be released. This should be done under vision with the laryngoscope in place and suction available; in the event of regurgitation, cricoid pressure should be immediately reapplied.

Second-generation SADs offer greater protection against aspiration than first-generation devices and are recommended should intubation fail during a rapid sequence induction.

### Airway and ventilation management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and after successful resuscitation [^112k72oi]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Steps for airway and ventilation management during CPR and after ROSC

During CPR, airway interventions range from compression-only CPR with or without airway opening, mouth-to-mouth ventilation, mouth-to-mask ventilation, bag-mask ventilation (with or without an oropharyngeal airway) or advanced airways (supraglottic airways (SGAs) and tracheal intubation using direct or video laryngoscopy) (Fig. 1). In a feasibility study to inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of OHCA, patients in the 'usual' airway management group were observed to have both basic and advanced airway interventions which changed according to the skills of the rescuer present and the time-point during resuscitation.

Fig. 1
Stepwise approach to airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation

After ROSC for both IHCA and OHCA, most patients have a post-cardiac arrest syndrome, are comatose with impaired airway reflexes and ventilation and/or have an indication for tracheal intubation based on their underlying condition. Patients who remain conscious and do not require airway interventions tend to have an initial shockable rhythm, are treated early with defibrillation and have better outcomes. Tracheal intubation enables controlled ventilation to facilitate onwards transportation to the emergency department after OHCA, cardiac catheterisation laboratory or intensive care unit. Drug-assisted intubation by critical care teams for both IHCA and OHCA patients with ROSC using a protocol-based approach (e.g. with ketamine or midazolam, fentanyl and rocuronium) can be safe and effective.

The clinical question compares an NMBA plus sedative-hypnotic versus sedative-hypnotic alone for FPS, respiratory arrest or cardiovascular collapse, need for a surgical airway, and vomiting/aspiration during the peri-intubation period; rationale cites concerns about awareness and cannot-intubate/cannot-ventilate but notes that intubations without an NMBA may provide less-than-ideal conditions and lower FPS. Evidence included six studies, with five evaluating FPS (three observational, prospective and two observational, retrospective).

### Laryngeal mask airway versus bag-mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation for neonatal resuscitation [^114LjTCA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Providing effective positive pressure ventilation is considered to be the single most important component of successful neonatal resuscitation. Ventilation is frequently initiated manually with bag and face mask (BMV) followed by endotracheal intubation if respiratory depression continues. These techniques may be difficult to perform successfully resulting in prolonged resuscitation or neonatal asphyxia. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may achieve initial ventilation and successful resuscitation faster than a bag-mask device or endotracheal intubation.

Objectives

Among newborns requiring positive pressure ventilation for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, is LMA more effective than BMV or endotracheal intubation for successful resuscitation? When BMV is either insufficient or ineffective, is effective positive pressure ventilation and successful resuscitation achieved faster with the LMA compared to endotracheal intubation?

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 15 February 2017), Embase (1980 to 15 February 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 15 February 2017). We also searched clinical trials registers, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared LMA for neonatal resuscitation with either BMV or endotracheal intubation and reported on any outcomes related to neonatal resuscitation specified in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated studies for risk of bias assessments, and extracted data using Cochrane Neonatal criteria. Categorical treatment effects were described as relative risks and continuous treatment effects were described as the mean difference, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of estimates.

Main Results

We included seven trials that involved a total of 794 infants. Five studies compared LMA with BMV and three studies compared LMA with endotracheal intubation. We added six new studies for this update (754 infants).LMA was associated with less need for endotracheal intubation than BMV (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.47 and typical risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.06; 5 studies, 661 infants; moderate-quality evidence) and shorter ventilation time (mean difference (MD) -18.90 seconds, 95% CI -24.35 to -13.44; 4 studies, 610 infants). Babies resuscitated with LMA were less likely to require admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (typical RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.90 and typical RD -0.18, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.04; 2 studies,191 infants; moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference in deaths or hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) events. Compared to endotracheal intubation, there were no clinically significant differences in insertion time or failure to correctly insert the device (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.17 to 5.42; 3 studies, 158 infants; very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in deaths or HIE events.

Authors' Conclusions

LMA can achieve effective ventilation during neonatal resuscitation in a time frame consistent with current neonatal resuscitation guidelines. Compared to BMV, LMA is more effective in terms of shorter resuscitation and ventilation times, and less need for endotracheal intubation (low- to moderate-quality evidence). However, in trials comparing LMA with BMV, over 80% of infants in both trial arms responded to the allocated intervention. In studies that allowed LMA rescue of infants failing with BMV, it was possible to avoid intubation in the majority. It is important that the clinical community resorts to the use of LMA more proactively to provide effective ventilation when newborn is not responding to BMV before attempting intubation or initiating chest compressions.LMA was found to offer comparable efficacy to endotracheal intubation (very low- to low-quality evidence). It therefore offers an alternate airway device when attempts at inserting endotracheal intubation are unsuccessful during resuscitation. Most studies enrolled infants with birth weight over 1500 g or 34 or more weeks' gestation. As such, there is lack of evidence to support LMA use in more premature infants.

### Diabetes mellitus is not a risk factor for difficult intubation among critically ill adults: a secondary analysis of multicenter trials [^115Tbnfq]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diabetes mellitus has been associated with greater difficulty of tracheal intubation in the operating room. This relationship has not been examined for tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. We examined whether diabetes mellitus was independently associated with the time from induction of anesthesia to intubation of the trachea among critically ill adults.

Design

A secondary analysis of data from five randomized trials completed by the Pragmatic Critical Care Research Group (PCCRG).

Setting

Emergency departments (EDs) or ICUs at 11 centers across the United States that enrolled in randomized trials of a pre-intubation checklist, fluid bolus administration, bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy, and intubation using a bougie vs. stylet.

Patients

Critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation with a laryngoscope in an ED or an ICU.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 2654 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 638 (24.0%) had diabetes mellitus. The mean time from induction of anesthesia to intubation of the trachea was 169 seconds (sd, 137s). Complications occurred during intubation in 1007 patients (37.9%). Diabetes mellitus was not associated with the time from induction of anesthesia to intubation of the trachea (-4.4s compared with nondiabetes; 95% CI, -17.2 to 8.3s; p = 0.50). Use of a video vs. direct laryngoscope did not modify the association between diabetes mellitus and the time from induction to intubation (p for interaction = 0.064). Diabetes mellitus was not associated with the probability of successful intubation on the first attempt (85.6% vs. 84.3%; p = 0.46) or complications during intubation (39.8% vs. 37.4%; p = 0.52).

Conclusions

Among 2654 critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation in an ED or an ICU, diabetes mellitus was not independently associated with the time from induction to intubation, the probability of successful intubation on the first attempt, or the rate of complications during intubation.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^117UU8iH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

High-flow nasal cannula is a potential alternative to noninvasive ventilation for preoxygenation of critically ill adults. Whether using the high-flow nasal cannula for preoxygenation of critically ill adults prevents hypoxemia during intubation of critically ill adults compared with use of either noninvasive ventilation or an oxygen mask remains uncertain. Multiple moderate-sized randomized trials compared preoxygenation with the high-flow nasal cannula with preoxygenation with an oxygen mask among critically ill adults, with inconclusive results. The one randomized trial to date that directly compared preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation versus the high-flow nasal cannula among critically ill adults found that hypoxemia occurred in 23% of patients in the noninvasive ventilation group and 27% of patients in the high-flow nasal cannula (absolute difference, −4.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −13.7 to 5.5). Among the subgroup of patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia before intubation, the incidence of hypoxemia was 24% in the noninvasive ventilation group and 35% in the high-flow nasal cannula group (95% CI, −22.3 to 0.3; P = 0.053).

Together, these results suggest that most patients undergoing tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU should receive preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation with either a dedicated noninvasive ventilator (i.e. a bilevel positive inspiratory pressure machine) or a tight-fitting mask attached to a conventional invasive mechanical ventilator. Patients with a clear contraindication to noninvasive ventilation should receive preoxygenation with a high-flow nasal cannula, an oxygen mask, or both.

### A comparison of deep versus awake tracheal extubation in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^114KabRp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

The standardized intravenous induction regimen consisted of midazolam 0.02–0.04 mg/kg, lidocaine 1–1.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 1–2 mcg/kg, propofol 1–2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6–1.2 mg/kg. Additional medications were allowed at the discretion of the anesthetist. After induction, ease of mask ventilation was assessed. Use of an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway was permissible. Patients were intubated utilizing direct laryngoscopy. Trainees were permitted one attempt at laryngoscopy. Maintenance of anesthesia was accomplished with sevoflurane titrated to an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration greater than 0.5, hydromorphone 2–6 mcg/kg as needed for pain, rocuronium boluses as needed, and additional medications at the anesthetist's discretion.

Subjects were disenrolled if mask ventilation required a two-hand technique or was otherwise difficult, three or more attempts were made, or a technique other than direct laryngoscopy was used. The anesthetist could withdraw the patient from the study if they believed the assigned extubation method would result in an unacceptable risk of harm. In that event, data would be excluded from final analysis.

When approaching end-of-surgery, ondansetron was given unless contraindicated. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade was accomplished with sugammadex 2–4 mg/kg as determined by train-of-four monitoring. Spontaneous respirations with adequate minute ventilation were established for all patients, as judged by the anesthetist. No significant changes to the anesthetic regimen, such as initiation of a remifentanil or dexmedetomidine infusion, were allowed.

### Airway management in critical illness: an update [^117F6WWM]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Expertise in airway management is a vital skill for any provider caring for critically ill patients. A growing body of literature has identified the stark difference in periprocedural outcomes of elective intubation in the operating room when compared with emergency intubation in the ICU. A number of strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with airway management in the critically ill have been described. In this review, we provide an updated framework for airway assessment before direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy, and use of newer pharmacologic agents; comment on current concepts in tracheal intubation in the ICU; and address human factors around critical decision-making during ICU airway management.

### Video laryngoscopy vs direct laryngoscopy on successful first-pass orotracheal intubation among ICU patients: a randomized clinical trial [^114Q9Ctb]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the intensive care unit (ICU), orotracheal intubation can be associated with increased risk of complications because the patient may be acutely unstable, requiring prompt intervention, often by a practitioner with nonexpert skills. Video laryngoscopy may decrease this risk by improving glottis visualization.

Objective

To determine whether video laryngoscopy increases the frequency of successful first-pass orotracheal intubation compared with direct laryngoscopy in ICU patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial of 371 adults requiring intubation while being treated at 7 ICUs in France between May 2015 and January 2016; there was 28 days of follow-up.

Interventions

Intubation using a video laryngoscope (n = 186) or direct laryngoscopy (n = 185). All patients received general anesthesia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with successful first-pass intubation. The secondary outcomes included time to successful intubation and mild to moderate and severe life-threatening complications.

Results

Among 371 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [15.8] years; 136 [36.7%] women), 371 completed the trial. The proportion of patients with successful first-pass intubation did not differ significantly between the video laryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy groups (67.7% vs 70.3%; absolute difference, -2.5% [95% CI, -11.9% to 6.9%]; P = 0.60). The proportion of first-attempt intubations performed by nonexperts (primarily residents, n = 290) did not differ between the groups (84.4% with video laryngoscopy vs 83.2% with direct laryngoscopy; absolute difference 1.2% [95% CI, -6.3% to 8.6%]; P = 0.76). The median time to successful intubation was 3 minutes (range, 2 to 4 minutes) for both video laryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy (absolute difference, 0 [95% CI, 0 to 0]; P = 0.95). Video laryngoscopy was not associated with life-threatening complications (24/180 [13.3%] vs 17/179 [9.5%] for direct laryngoscopy; absolute difference, 3.8% [95% CI, -2.7% to 10.4%]; P = 0.25). In post hoc analysis, video laryngoscopy was associated with severe life-threatening complications (17/179 [9.5%] vs 5/179 [2.8%] for direct laryngoscopy; absolute difference, 6.7% [95% CI, 1.8% to 11.6%]; P = 0.01) but not with mild to moderate life-threatening complications (10/181 [5.4%] vs 14/181 [7.7%]; absolute difference, -2.3% [95% CI, -7.4% to 2.8%]; P = 0.37).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients in the ICU requiring intubation, video laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy did not improve first-pass orotracheal intubation rates and was associated with higher rates of severe life-threatening complications. Further studies are needed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these 2 strategies in different clinical settings and among operators with diverse skill levels.

### Effect of placement of a supraglottic airway device vs endotracheal intubation on return of spontaneous circulation in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in taipei, Taiwan: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^113PyBiX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Randomization

The randomization was based on clusters of biweekly periods during the study from November 11, 2016, to December 31, 2019. Four advanced life support ambulance teams were divided into 2 randomization clusters. Each cluster was assigned to either ETI or SGA in a biweekly period. The study center would instruct the clusters to alternatively change to either the ETI or SGA insertion according to the sequence random allocation. A total of 164 randomization units were generated under this randomization process. The detailed randomization scheme is illustrated in the eFigure in Supplement 2. Per-protocol analysis was performed initially but the results of intention-to-treat analysis are also included. To guarantee a balanced per-protocol case number in the final analysis, we decided the allocation periods of ETI vs SGA in the fashion of 3 periods of ETI to 2 periods of SGA (3:2 ratio), which was based on the baseline of the first attempt success rates of ETI and SGA in the background data of the Taipei emergency medical service system (ie, the success rate of 60% with ETI vs 90% with SGA).

Intervention

The intervention in our trial was either an initial SGA insertion or an initial ETI. The SGA was a second-generation SGA device (i-gel; Intersurgical Ltd). Tracheal intubation was performed using direct laryngoscopy but not video laryngoscopy during the study.

The protocol limited the insertion attempts of both SGA and ETI groups to once. End-tidal capnographic data to prevent esophageal intubation were also applied to the ETI group. If the first advanced airway attempt failed, rescue airway management, including ETI or SGA insertion or bag-valve-mask ventilation, was allowed. Apart from advanced airway management, all other care delivered at the scene followed the standard resuscitation guidelines. The paramedics participating in the trial did not receive additional training programs, and advanced airway management reflected the daily practice of their work.

### Part 8: pediatric advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^114owEYf]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric advanced life support — use of cricoid pressure during intubation recommends that routine use of cricoid pressure to reduce the risk of regurgitation is not recommended during bag-mask ventilation of infants and children and that routine use of cricoid pressure is not recommended during tracheal intubation of infants and children; if cricoid pressure is used, discontinue if it interferes with ventilation or the speed or ease of tracheal intubation in infants and children. The guideline notes that uniform application of cricoid pressure may impede bag-mask ventilation or obscure visualization of the airway during laryngoscopy, and supportive evidence includes a retrospective study from a large international pediatric ICU intubation registry showing that cricoid pressure during bag-mask ventilation before tracheal intubation was not associated with lower rates of regurgitation and a bronchoscopic study of 30 children revealing distortion of the airway with cricoid pressure at forces below those recommended by usual intubation guidelines.

### Association of two preoxygenation approaches with hypoxemia during tracheal intubation: a secondary analysis [^1116cq9K]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Oxygen masks (bag-valve-mask device and nonrebreathing facemask oxygen) are the most common method of preoxygenation in critically ill patients undergoing emergency tracheal intubation in the emergency department and intensive care unit. Whether the type of oxygen mask used for preoxygenation alters the risk of hypoxemia during intubation is uncertain. We sought to compare the incidence of hypoxemia during intubation in patients preoxygenated with a bag-valve-mask device to the incidence of hypoxemia in patients preoxygenated with facemask oxygen.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of 2 randomized trials of emergency tracheal intubation. The primary outcome of hypoxemia was defined as a peripheral oxygen saturation < 85% between induction of anesthesia and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation. We used a propensity-weighted multivariable logistic regression model to compare the incidence of hypoxemia between groups. We hypothesized that preoxygenation with a bag-valve-mask device would be associated with a lower incidence of hypoxemia compared to preoxygenation with facemask oxygen.

Results

We included 1,156 patients in this analysis, of whom 136 were preoxygenated with a bag-valve-mask device and 1,020 were preoxygenated with facemask oxygen. Hypoxemia occurred in 20 of 136 (14.7%) participants in the bag-valve-mask device group and 153 of 1,020 (15.0%) participants in the facemask oxygen group. In the multivariable analysis, participants preoxygenated with a bag-valve-mask device had similar odds of hypoxemia to those preoxygenated with facemask oxygen (adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 2.16).

Conclusion

In critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation, preoxygenation with a bag-valve-mask device did not reduce the risk of hypoxemia compared to preoxygenation with facemask oxygen.

Anaesthetic and airway technique for emergency tracheal intubation

1 A rapid sequence induction (RSI) approach is likely to be adopted. Use of cricoid force is controversial 28, so use it where a trained assistant can apply it but promptly remove it if it contributes to tracheal intubation difficulty.
2 Meticulous pre‐oxygenation should be with a well‐fitting mask for 3–5 min. A closed circuit is optimal (e.g. anaesthetic circle breathing circuit) and a rebreathing circuit (e.g. Mapleson's C ('Waters') circuit is preferable to a bag‐mask which expels virus‐containing exhaled gas into the room.
3 Place a heat and moisture exchange (HME) filter between the catheter mount and the circuit. Non‐invasive ventilation should be avoided. High‐flow nasal oxygen is not recommended.
4 Patient positioning, including ramping in the obese and reverse Trendelenburg positioning, should be adopted to maximise safe apnoea time.
5 In agitated patients, a delayed sequence tracheal intubation technique may be appropriate.
6 If there is increased risk of cardiovascular instability, ketamine 1–2 mg.kg −1 is recommended for induction of anaesthesia. Rocuronium 1.2 mg.kg −1 for neuromuscular blockade, should be given as early as practical. These measures minimise apnoea time and risk of patient coughing. If suxamethonium is used the dose should be 1.5 mg.kg −1.
7 Ensure full neuromuscular blockade before tracheal intubation is attempted. A peripheral nerve stimulator maybe used or wait 1 minute.
8 Ensure a vasopressor for bolus or infusion is immediately available for managing hypotension.
9 Only after reliable loss of consciousness – to avoid coughing – gentle continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be applied, if the seal is good, to minimise the need for mask ventilation. Bag‐mask ventilation may be used to assist ventilation and prevent hypoxia if indicated. Use a Guedel airway to maintain airway patency. Use the 2‐handed, 2‐person technique with a VE‐grip to improve seal particularly in the obese patient 29. When bag‐mask ventilation is applied, minimal oxygen flows and airway pressures consistent with achieving this goal should be used.
10 Alternatively, a second‐generation SGA may be inserted, after loss of consciousness and before tracheal intubation, to replace the role of bag‐mask ventilation or if this is difficult 7, 30.
11 Laryngoscopy should be undertaken with the device most likely to achieve prompt first‐pass tracheal intubation in all circumstances in that operator's hands – in most fully trained airway mangers this is likely to be a videolaryngoscope. a Stay as distant from the airway as is practical to enable optimal technique, whatever device is used b Using a videolaryngoscope with a separate screen enables the operator to stay further from the airway and this technique is recommended for those trained in their use. c If using a videolaryngoscope with a Macintosh blade, a bougie may be used. d If using a videolaryngoscope with a hyperangulated blade, a stylet is required. e Where a videolaryngoscope is not used, a standard MacIntosh blade and a bougie (either pre‐loaded within the tracheal tube or immediately available) is likely the best option f If using a bougie or stylet, be careful when removing it so as not to spray secretions on the intubating team
12 Intubate with a tracheal tube size 7.0–8.0 mm internal diameter (ID) in women or 8.0–9.0 mm ID in mens, in line with local practice. Use a tracheal tube with a subglottic suction port where possible.
13 At tracheal intubation, place the tracheal tube without losing sight of it on the screen and pass the cuff 1–2 cm below the cords, to avoid bronchial intubation.
14 Inflate the cuff with air to a measured cuff pressure of 20–30 cmH₂O immediately after tracheal intubation.
15 Secure the tracheal tube as normal.
16 Start mechanical ventilation only after cuff inflation. Ensure there is no leak.
17 Confirm tracheal intubation with continuous waveform capnography.
18 Confirming correct depth of insertion may be difficult. a Auscultation of the chest is difficult when wearing airborne precaution PPE and is likely to risk contamination of the stethoscope and staff, so is not recommended. b Watching for equal bilateral chest wall expansion with ventilation is recommended. c Lung ultrasound or chest x‐ray may be needed if there is doubt about bilateral lung ventilation.
19 Once correct position is established record depth of tracheal tube insertion prominently.
20 Pass a nasogastric tube after tracheal intubation is complete and ventilation established to minimise the need for later interventions.
21 If the patient has not yet been confirmed as COVID‐19 positive collect a deep tracheal sample using closed suction for COVID‐19 testing. Some upper airway samples are false negatives.

### A multicenter, randomized trial of ramped Position vs Sniffing position during Endotracheal intubation of critically Ill adults [^111EnQux]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoxemia is the most common complication during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. Intubation in the ramped position has been hypothesized to prevent hypoxemia by increasing functional residual capacity and decreasing the duration of intubation, but has never been studied outside of the operating room.

Methods

Multicenter, randomized trial comparing the ramped position (head of the bed elevated to 25°) with the sniffing position (torso supine, neck flexed, and head extended) among 260 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation by pulmonary and critical care medicine fellows in four ICUs between July 22, 2015, and July 19, 2016. The primary outcome was lowest arterial oxygen saturation between induction and 2 minutes after intubation. Secondary outcomes included Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic view, difficulty of intubation, and number of laryngoscopy attempts.

Results

The median lowest arterial oxygen saturation was 93% (interquartile range [IQR], 84%-99%) with the ramped position vs 92% (IQR, 79%-98%) with the sniffing position (P = 0.27). The ramped position appeared to increase the incidence of grade III or IV view (25.4% vs 11.5%, P = 0.01), increase the incidence of difficult intubation (12.3% vs 4.6%, P = 0.04), and decrease the rate of intubation on the first attempt (76.2% vs 85.4%, P = 0.02), respectively.

Conclusions

In this multicenter trial, the ramped position did not improve oxygenation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults compared with the sniffing position. The ramped position may worsen glottic view and increase the number of laryngoscopy attempts required for successful intubation.

### Effect of bag-mask ventilation vs endotracheal intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation on neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest: a randomized clinical trial [^114c2C59]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) is a less complex technique than endotracheal intubation (ETI) for airway management during the advanced cardiac life support phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation of patients with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest. It has been reported as superior in terms of survival.

Objectives

To assess noninferiority of BMV vs ETI for advanced airway management with regard to survival with favorable neurological function at day 28.

Design, Settings, and Participants

Multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing BMV with ETI in 2043 patients with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in France and Belgium. Enrollment occurred from March 9, 2015, to January 2, 2017, and follow-up ended January 26, 2017.

Intervention

Participants were randomized to initial airway management with BMV (n = 1020) or ETI (n = 1023).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was favorable neurological outcome at 28 days defined as cerebral performance category 1 or 2. A noninferiority margin of 1% was chosen. Secondary end points included rate of survival to hospital admission, rate of survival at day 28, rate of return of spontaneous circulation, and ETI and BMV difficulty or failure.

Results

Among 2043 patients who were randomized (mean age, 64.7 years; 665 women [32%]), 2040 (99.8%) completed the trial. In the intention-to-treat population, favorable functional survival at day 28 was 44 of 1018 patients (4.3%) in the BMV group and 43 of 1022 patients (4.2%) in the ETI group (difference, 0.11% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -1.64% to infinity]; P for noninferiority = .11). Survival to hospital admission (294/1018 [28.9%] in the BMV group vs 333/1022 [32.6%] in the ETI group; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -7.7% to 0.3%]) and global survival at day 28 (55/1018 [5.4%] in the BMV group vs 54/1022 [5.3%] in the ETI group; difference, 0.1% [95% CI, -1.8% to 2.1%]) were not significantly different. Complications included difficult airway management (186/1027 [18.1%] in the BMV group vs 134/996 [13.4%] in the ETI group; difference, 4.7% [95% CI, 1.5% to 7.9%]; P = 0.004), failure (69/1028 [6.7%] in the BMV group vs 21/996 [2.1%] in the ETI group; difference, 4.6% [95% CI, 2.8% to 6.4%]; P < .001), and regurgitation of gastric content (156/1027 [15.2%] in the BMV group vs 75/999 [7.5%] in the ETI group; difference, 7.7% [95% CI, 4.9% to 10.4%]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, the use of BMV compared with ETI failed to demonstrate noninferiority or inferiority for survival with favorable 28-day neurological function, an inconclusive result. A determination of equivalence or superiority between these techniques requires further research.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^111dqsg3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions to Prevent Hypotension

Hypotension occurs during 25–40% of emergency tracheal intubations and may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest and death. Physiological mechanisms that contribute to the development of hypotension during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults include 1) vasodilation from induction medications, 2) decreased endogenous catecholamine release after sedation, and 3) decreased venous return and cardiac output from the initiation of positive pressure ventilation. In addition to ongoing treatments critically ill adults may be receiving for existing hypotension, the two treatments most commonly proposed to prevent the development of hypotension during emergency tracheal intubation are the administration of an intravenous fluid bolus or the administration of vasopressors before or with induction.

Two randomized trials have examined whether the initiation of a 500-ml bolus of intravenous crystalloid solution before induction of anesthesia prevents hypotension during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. The PrePARE (Preventing Cardiovascular Collapse with Administration of Fluid Resuscitation before Tracheal Intubation) trial examined 337 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in nine EDs or ICUs, and the PREPARE II (Preventing Cardiovascular Collapse with Administration of Fluid Resuscitation during Induction and Intubation) trial examined 1,067 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation with positive pressure ventilation in 11 ICUs. In both trials, administration of a fluid bolus did not prevent hypotension, vasopressor receipt, or cardiac arrest.

The administration of vasopressors before or with induction of anesthesia is a commonly recommended alternative for attempting to prevent hypotension during tracheal intubation. Such "prophylactic" vasopressors may be administered as either 1) an intravenous bolus ("push") or 2) a continuous infusion. No completed randomized trials have examined whether the administration of a vasopressor before induction of anesthesia prevents hypotension or cardiac arrest during tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU. A propensity score–matched analysis reported that the prophylactic administration of vasopressors before induction was not associated with a lower incidence of hypotension during intubation (40.6% vs. 32.1%; P = 0.08). Moreover, multiple observational studies have reported the potential for serious dosing errors with the use of intravenous boluses of vasopressors before emergency tracheal intubation. To address this uncertainty, an ongoing multicenter randomized trial is comparing the effect of prophylactic norepinephrine infusion with no vasopressor administration on the incidence of hypotension or cardiac arrest among 420 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation (NCT05014581).

### A prospective, randomised trial of pre-oxygenation strategies available in the pre-hospital environment [^113ptrfS]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation aims to increase safe apnoea duration by denitrogenation of the functional residual capacity of the lungs, and increasing oxygen stores at the onset of apnoea. Pre-oxygenation options in the pre-hospital environment are limited due to oxygen availability and equipment portability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies available in this setting. This was a prospective, randomised, crossover study of 30 healthy volunteers who underwent 3-min periods of pre-oxygenation by tidal volume breathing with a non-rebreather mask, a bag-valve-mask and a portable ventilator. The primary outcome measure was fractional expired oxygen concentration of the first exhaled breath after each technique. The secondary outcome measure was ease of breathing, assessed using a visual analogue scale. The mean (95%CI) fractional expired oxygen concentrations achieved with the non-rebreather mask were 64 (60–68)%, bag-valve-mask 89 (86–92)% and portable ventilator 95 (94–96)%. Pre-oxygenation efficacy with the non-rebreather mask was significantly worse than with either the bag-valve-mask (p < 0.001) or ventilator (p < 0.001). No significant difference in ease of breathing was identified between the bag-valve-mask and ventilator, but both were perceived as being significantly more difficult to breathe through than the non-rebreather mask. We conclude that, in healthy volunteers, the effectiveness of pre-oxygenation by bag-valve-mask and portable ventilator was superior to pre-oxygenation with a non-rebreather mask, although the non-rebreather mask was easier to breathe through than the other pre-oxygenation devices.

### In-hospital airway management of COVID-19 patients [^116NPGLf]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-intubation considerations

Following intubation, providers should minimize the time to inflation of the ETT cuff and connection to the ventilator circuit. Any equipment that was in contact with the airway such as laryngoscope blades and masks should be immediately disposed of or contained within a plastic bag for decontamination. While disposal is preferred from an infectious risk, containment may be appropriate to conserve supplies for repeat use on the same patient. Any contaminated PPE should be removed as soon as possible.

Protective ventilation should only be initiated after hemodynamic stabilization in order to minimize the hemodynamic effects associated with high PEEP and respiratory rates, such as right heart dysfunction and decreases in preload. Data on the ideal ventilation parameters specific to COVID-19 patients is lacking. Because many (up to 67% by recent report) of critically ill COVID-19 patients may develop ARDS, clinicians should consider lung ventilation strategies that have been established for the management of ARDS (Fig. 3). Tidal volume and PEEP may then be titrated based on each patient's lung compliance.

Fig. 3
Summary of current recommendations for airway management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients

It is also important to maintain appropriate levels of sedation and, if necessary, paralysis to limit patient-ventilator dyssynchrony. Adequate paralysis should be confirmed prior to performing any recruitment maneuvers. Dyssynchrony can lead to inadequate ventilation, lung injury, hemodynamic instability, and increased risk of exposure if healthcare workers are needing to repeatedly enter patient rooms for ventilator adjustments. Proning, nitric oxide, and veno-venous ECMO are additional measures that can be considered for refractory hypoxemia. While there is conflicting evidence on potential benefits of nitric oxide in patients with severe ARDS, the use of nitric oxide in COVID-19 patients is being actively studied.

### Preoxygenation strategies for intubation of patients who are critically ill: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^112XBJWX]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Preoxygenation is a crucial preparatory step for intubation. Several strategies for preoxygenation exist, including facemask oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). However, the comparative efficacy of these strategies remains largely uncertain. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of HFNC, NIPPV, and facemask oxygen for preoxygenation of patients who are critically ill requiring tracheal intubation.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised clinical trials published from database inception until Oct 31, 2024, with no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials that compared HFNC versus NIPPV, HFNC versus facemask oxygen, or NIPPV versus facemask oxygen in adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who were critically ill requiring intubation in the intensive care or emergency department setting. We had no additional eligibility criteria for our network meta-analysis. We used Covidence software to screen eligible trials. Two reviewers independently screened trials for titles and abstracts, and then subsequently screened full-text reports. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or a third party adjudicator. Summary-level data were extracted manually using a structured data collection form. Outcomes of interest were hypoxaemia during intubation, successful intubation on the first attempt, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality. We performed a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of bias using the modified Cochrane tool (RoB 2.0) and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. The protocol is registered on the Open Science Framework.

Findings

We initially identified 6900 records, of which 48 were assessed via full-text screening, and 15 eligible studies with 3420 patients were included in our systematic review and network meta-analysis. Findings suggested that use of NIPPV for preoxygenation probably reduces the incidence of hypoxaemia during intubation versus HFNC (relative risk 0.73 [95% CI 0.55–0.98]; p = 0.032; moderate certainty) and reduces the incidence of hypoxaemia versus facemask oxygen (0.51 [0.39–0.65]; p < 0.0001; high certainty). HFNC for preoxygenation reduces the incidence of hypoxaemia during intubation versus facemask oxygen (0.69 [0.54–0.88]; p = 0.0064; high certainty). None of the preoxygenation strategies affected the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt (all low certainty). None of the preoxygenation strategies appeared to affect all-cause mortality (very low-to-moderate certainty). NIPPV probably reduces the risk of serious adverse events versus facemask oxygen (0.30 [0.12–0.77]; p = 0.011; moderate certainty) and might reduce the risk of serious adverse events versus HFNC (0.32 [0.11–0.91]; p = 0.035; low certainty). HFNC might not reduce the risk of serious adverse events versus facemask oxygen (0.95 [0.60–1.51]; p = 0.83; low certainty).

Interpretation

Preoxygenation with NIPPV or HFNC rather than facemask oxygen might prevent hypoxaemia during tracheal intubation of adults who are critically ill. Compared with HFNC, NIPPV probably decreases the incidence of hypoxaemia during intubation. Our findings will inform updated international guidelines on preoxygenation.

### Benefits and risks of manual hyperinflation in intubated and mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients: a systematic review [^116DnNDt]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Manual hyperinflation (MH), a frequently applied maneuver in critically ill intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, is suggested to mimic a cough so that airway secretions are mobilized toward the larger airways, where they can easily be removed. As such, MH could prevent plugging of the airways.

Methods

We performed a search in the databases of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from January 1990 to April 2012. We systematically reviewed the literature on evidence for postulated benefits and risks of MH in critically ill intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.

Results

The search identified 50 articles, of which 19 were considered relevant. We included 13 interventional studies and six observational studies. The number of studies evaluating physiological effects of MH is limited. Trials differed too much to permit meta-analysis. It is uncertain whether MH was applied similarly in the retrieved studies. Finally, most studies are underpowered to show clinical benefit of MH. Use of MH is associated with short-term improvements in lung compliance, oxygenation, and secretion clearance, without changes in outcomes. MH has been reported to be associated with short-term and probably clinically insignificant side effects, including decreases in cardiac output, alterations of heart rates, and increased central venous pressures.

Conclusions

Studies have failed to show that MH benefits critically ill intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. MH is infrequently associated with short-term side effects.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^114iBePg]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — positioning and preoxygenation recommendations state: We suggest use of the head and torso inclined (semi-Fowler) position during RSI. We suggest preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) when laryngoscopy is expected to be challenging. We suggest preoxygenation with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in patients with severe hypoxemia Pao2/FiO2 < 150. We suggest using medication-assisted preoxygenation to improve preoxygenation in patients undergoing RSI who are not able to tolerate a face mask, NIPPV, or HFNO because of agitation, delirium, or combative behavior.

### Videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for adults undergoing tracheal intubation [^111YAKr8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tracheal intubation is a common procedure performed to secure the airway in adults undergoing surgery or those who are critically ill. Intubation is sometimes associated with difficulties and complications that may result in patient harm. While it is traditionally achieved by performing direct laryngoscopy, the past three decades have seen the advent of rigid indirect videolaryngoscopes (VLs). A mounting body of evidence comparing the two approaches to tracheal intubation has been acquired over this period of time. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess whether use of different designs of VLs in adults requiring tracheal intubation reduces the failure rate compared with direct laryngoscopy, and assess the benefits and risks of these devices in selected population groups, users and settings.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and Web of Science on 27 February 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and conducted forward and backward citation searches.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with adults undergoing laryngoscopy performed with either a VL or a Macintosh direct laryngoscope (DL) in any clinical setting. We included parallel and cross-over study designs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We collected data for the following outcomes: failed intubation, hypoxaemia, successful first attempt at tracheal intubation, oesophageal intubation, dental trauma, Cormack-Lehane grade, and time for tracheal intubation.

Main Results

We included 222 studies (219 RCTs, three quasi-RCTs) with 26,149 participants undergoing tracheal intubation. Most studies recruited adults undergoing elective surgery requiring tracheal intubation. Twenty-one studies recruited participants with a known or predicted difficult airway, and an additional 25 studies simulated a difficult airway. Twenty-one studies were conducted outside the operating theatre environment; of these, six were in the prehospital setting, seven in the emergency department and eight in the intensive care unit. We report here the findings of the three main comparisons according to videolaryngoscopy device type. We downgraded the certainty of the outcomes for imprecision, study limitations (e.g. high or unclear risks of bias), inconsistency when we noted substantial levels of statistical heterogeneity and publication bias. Macintosh-style videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy (61 studies, 9883 participants) We found moderate-certainty evidence that a Macintosh-style VL probably reduces rates of failed intubation (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.65; 41 studies, 4615 participants) and hypoxaemia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.99; 16 studies, 2127 participants). These devices may also increase rates of success on the first intubation attempt (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09; 42 studies, 7311 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably improve glottic view when assessed as Cormack-Lehane grade 3 and 4 (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.48; 38 studies, 4368 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We found little or no clear difference in rates of oesophageal intubation (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.21; 14 studies, 2404 participants) but this finding was supported by low-certainty evidence. We were unsure of the findings for dental trauma because the certainty of this evidence was very low (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.89; 18 studies, 2297 participants). We were not able to pool data for time required for tracheal intubation owing to considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 96%). Hyperangulated videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy (96 studies, 11,438 participants) We found moderate-certainty evidence that hyperangulated VLs probably reduce rates of failed intubation (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.76; 63 studies, 7146 participants) and oesophageal intubation (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.81; 14 studies, 1968 participants). In subgroup analysis, we noted that hyperangulated VLs were more likely to reduce failed intubation when used on known or predicted difficult airways (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.48; P = 0.03 for subgroup differences; 15 studies, 1520 participants). We also found that these devices may increase rates of success on the first intubation attempt (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.05; 66 studies, 8086 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the glottic view is probably also improved (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.24; 54 studies, 6058 participants; data for Cormack-Lehane grade 3/4 views; moderate-certainty evidence). However, we found low-certainty evidence of little or no clear difference in rates of hypoxaemia (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.11; 15 studies, 1691 participants), and the findings for dental trauma were unclear because the certainty of this evidence was very low (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.59; 30 studies, 3497 participants). We were not able to pool data for time required for tracheal intubation owing to considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 99%). Channelled videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy (73 studies, 7165 participants) We found moderate-certainty evidence that channelled VLs probably reduce rates of failed intubation (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.61; 53 studies, 5367 participants) and hypoxaemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.50; 15 studies, 1966 participants). They may also increase rates of success on the first intubation attempt (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15; 47 studies, 5210 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and probably improve glottic view (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.21; 40 studies, 3955 participants; data for Cormack-Lehane grade 3/4 views; moderate-certainty evidence). We found little or no clear difference in rates of oesophageal intubation (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.75; 16 studies, 1756 participants) but this was supported by low-certainty evidence. We were unsure of the findings for dental trauma because the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.12; 29 studies, 2375 participants). We were not able to pool data for time required for tracheal intubation owing to considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 98%).

Authors' Conclusions

VLs of all designs likely reduce rates of failed intubation and result in higher rates of successful intubation on the first attempt with improved glottic views. Macintosh-style and channelled VLs likely reduce rates of hypoxaemic events, while hyperangulated VLs probably reduce rates of oesophageal intubation. We conclude that videolaryngoscopy likely provides a safer risk profile compared to direct laryngoscopy for all adults undergoing tracheal intubation.

### Peri-intubation complications in critically ill obese patients: a secondary analysis of the international INTUBE cohort [^11645Haz]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In the anesthesia setting the benefit of ramp and different degrees of head-up positions have been documented, with an improvement of FRC and, consequently, of oxygenation as the primary mechanism. In the critically ill setting, evidence on the benefit of patient's position in terms of improved oxygenation and/or first pass success has been conflicting. We unexpectedly found an association of 30–45° head-up positioning with higher incidence of severe hypoxemia and 20° head-up positioning with greater first-pass intubation failure. Further research is warranted to determine if these associations reflect worse intubating conditions or patient selection characteristics.

Positive pressure ventilation, delivered either as NPPV or CPAP, was not associated with reduced peri-intubation hypoxemia in our cohort. This is in contrast with recent findings from a randomized trial showing the benefit of noninvasive ventilation compared to oxygen mask at preventing severe hypoxemia (SpO 2 < 85%) in critically ill patients. In this trial, severe hypoxemia occurred in 9.1% in the noninvasive ventilation group and in 18.5% in the oxygen mask group. In the sub-group analysis of this study including obese patients, authors showed an even higher benefit of noninvasive ventilation at preventing desaturation compared to oxygen mask.

CHEST/ATS guideline — preventive noninvasive ventilation (NIV) immediately after extubation in high-risk patients: For patients at high risk for extubation failure who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h and who have passed an SBT, we recommend extubation to preventive NIV (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Quality Evidence). Patients at high risk for failure of extubation may include those patients with hypercapnia, COPD, congestive heart failure, or other serious comorbidities, and physicians who choose to use NIV should apply such treatment immediately after extubation to realize the outcome benefits. The evidence synthesis indicated that preventive NIV was superior to no preventive NIV regarding extubation success, ICU length of stay, and both short- and long-term mortality.

### Optimisation of airway management strategies: a prospective before-and-after study on events related to airway management [^114xNCPx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor medical outcomes often result from series of minor events. The present study assessed events related to airway management to determine whether targeted changes to departmental strategies for airway management can reduce the incidence.

Methods

This prospective before-and-after study was performed with ethics committee approval and written informed consent from patients. Major and minor events related to airway management were prospectively recorded for 9 weeks. After implementation of changes to departmental strategies for airway management, events were again prospectively recorded over 9 weeks. Primary outcome was number of cases with events. Secondary outcomes were various predefined events.

Results

At study baseline, 3668 cases and at follow-up 3786 cases were assessed. Cases with events decreased from 566 (15.4%) to 433 (11.4%) (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66–0.83; P < 0.01). As secondary outcomes, the following events decreased: Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4 (4.3–2.9%; RR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.85; P < 0.01); difficult bag-mask ventilation (3.8–2.7%; RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54–0.89; P < 0.01); hypoxaemia (3.8–2.9%; RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.96; P = 0.03); unplanned use of special equipment (3.2–2.0%; RR = 0.62; (95% CI, 0.47–0.83; P < 0.01); oesophageal intubation (1.3–0.8%; RR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.96; P = 0.03); bleeding (0.8–0.2%; RR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14–0.63; P < 0.01); insufficient spontaneous breathing (0.3–0.0%; RR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.68; P < 0.01); communication errors (0.1–0.0%; RR = 0; 95% CI, 0-NA; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Implementation of changes to departmental strategies for airway management significantly reduced cases with events related to airway management. Analysis of events and implementation of strategies that specifically target identified issues might be key to improving airway management.

### Reintubation in critically ill patients: procedural complications and implications for care [^113896n3]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Between 10 and 20% of critically ill patients who are extubated will be reintubated within 72 hours. Observational data suggest that 40 to 90% of these patients show signs of laryngeal damage or edema on laryngoscopy. Furthermore, reintubation is often performed emergently, a situation in which complication rates are as high as 5 to 24%. Providers may therefore assume that reintubation will be more difficult or associated with more complications than the initial intubation procedure, and may approach these procedures with caution. While these assumptions might have face validity, they may not be evidence based.

We are aware of no prospective studies that directly compare the technical difficulty or procedural complication rates of reintubation with first intubation in repeatedly intubated patients. Being able to accurately anticipate the potential for a difficult intubation and identify high-risk patients can help inform the appropriate selection of medications, equipment and personnel, and allow time for patient optimization, which is important for clinical management and reduction of risk in these potentially high-risk intubations. We present an analysis of a large, prospective registry of in-hospital airway management testing the null hypothesis that reintubations are neither more difficult nor associated with more procedural complications than first intubations in repeatedly intubated critically ill patients.

### Ventilation by mask before and after the administration of neuromuscular blockade: a pragmatic non-inferiority trial [^113jg3dx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Facemask ventilation was performed using a generic single-handed technique, which incorporated a chin-lift head-tilt manoeuvre via an appropriately sized adult facemask (Anaesthesia Face Mask by Vital Signs, Medline Industries, Mundelein, IL). An audible metronome was used to provide a timing prompt in order to achieve a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1-to-1. Per usual care, providers were instructed to maintain peak airway pressure < 20 cmH₂O, as displayed by the pressure manometer on the anaesthesia machine. Use of oro- or nasopharyngeal airways, two-hand jaw thrust technique with a second operator squeezing the breathing bag, and repositioning of the airway to maximise upper airway patency during each measurement period was at the discretion of the airway managers; however, an algorithm for dealing with increasing levels of difficulty with facemask ventilation based on typical practice was suggested (see Additional file 1). Exhaled tidal volumes (V te) in mL and peak inspiratory airway pressure (PIP) in cmH 2 O were measured using a FloTrak Elite sensor (Phillips Healthcare, Andover, MD) placed in-line with the anaesthesia circuit at the patient wye and attached to a Respironics NM3 respiratory monitor (Phillips Healthcare, Andover, MD) for display and recording purposes. Data was stored real-time to a USB storage device and then imported into Microsoft Excel® for Mac 2011 v14.4.4 (Microsoft Inc. Redmond, WA). At a V te of 40–2500 mL and PIP up to 120 cmH₂O, the device is accurate to within the greater of 10 mL or 5% of the reading and the greater of 0.5 cmH 2 O or 2% of the reading, respectively. 1 Providers performing the FMV could see the anaesthesia monitor displaying vital signs, including pulse oximetry (SpO 2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO₂), inhalation anaesthetic concentration, and pressure manometer of the anaesthesia machine, but were blinded to inspiratory/expiratory gas flows. Respiratory data was recorded for one minute after induction of general anaesthesia (the "before" NMBD study period). A NMBD was then administered. Recording was performed for another minute after waiting 60 s post succinylcholine administration or 90 s post rocuronium or vecuronium administration, respectively (the "after" NMBD study period). In accordance with local practice, monitoring neuromuscular function was not used during induction of anaesthesia. Patient flow through the study is shown in Fig. 1.

### Airway management in neonates and infants: European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care and British Journal of Anaesthesia joint guidelines [^112s8r8k]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

What should be the gold standard for anticipated difficult airway management and who should be involved?

Clinical practice statement: For anticipated difficult airway management, at least one type of videolaryngoscope, flexible intubating scope, or rigid or semirigid scope should be available, including appropriate sizes for the patient's age, in addition to routinely used equipment such as supraglottic airway devices and face masks.

Evidence summary: There is no ' one solution fits all ' for difficult airway management for neonates and infants. In any medical care area where infants might need respiratory support, established equipment for bag-mask ventilation, for opening of the upper airway (such as oral or nasal airways), supraglottic airway devices, suction tubes, laryngoscopes, and tracheal tubes in appropriate sizes should be readily available. Every instrument for instrumentation of the difficult airway has limitations in certain situations. As the source of airway difficulties varies individually, individuals' airway restrictions inevitably demand one of the various types of airway devices.

Recommendation: We recommend limiting the number of tracheal intubation attempts by reassessing the clinical condition and by considering a change to a different technique, different provider, or both after each attempt (1C).

Clinical practice statement: after four attempts, clinicians should consider aborting intubation attempts and waking the patient if feasible.

Evidence summary: Multiple attempts at tracheal intubation with the same technique result in a higher probability of complications and can cause airway oedema or bleeding. This reduces the chance of success of subsequent attempts with the same or other techniques (Supplementary Table S12). A single centre retrospective analysis of 1341 intubations in healthy infants for routine operative procedures found an increased risk for hypoxaemia (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.30–2.43) when multiple intubation attempts occurred. In a prospective observational single centre trial including 171 intubations on neonatal intensive care wards, occurrence of more than two intubations was identified as the only independent risk factor (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.3–33.6) for adverse outcomes (brady-cardia, hypotension, or hypertension). Comparable results have been reported in a retrospective analysis of an international multicentre database for neonatal intubations because of respiratory failure. Two attempts had an OR of 1.6 and three or more attempts an OR of 1.8 for severe adverse events. Thus, after an initial failed attempt, assistance by additional personnel with special airway expertise and supportive devices must be consulted immediately.

### Video versus direct laryngoscopy in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115nBKuK]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Four authors (B. A. S.M. P.C. and M.S.) independently extracted the data for each study using a standardized study form to determine: authors, clinical trial registration, enrollment period, study publication year, main exclusion criteria (Additional file 1: Supplemental Methods 4), sample size, follow-up period, endpoint definition, baseline patient characteristics, and operator's characteristics. Any discrepancies were settled through a panel discussion with a fifth author (A.R.).

The definition of operators' experiences slightly varied among studies. To allow subgroup analysis based on this characteristic, we classified operators into two groups, experienced and inexperienced, following specific criteria outlined in Additional file 1: Supplemental Methods 5. Moreover, the Additional file 1: Supplemental Methods 6 highlights how each study selected the device for the second intubation attempt. The classification of a difficult airway was made in accordance with either the study's definition or the Mallampati 3/4 classification.

Endpoints

Our primary efficacy endpoint was (1) successful intubation on the first attempt, as defined by each individual study. Other efficacy endpoints were (2) successful intubation on the second attempt, (3) Cormack Lehane (CL) laryngeal view grade I, and (4) CL laryngeal view grade I/II. Safety endpoints were (5) incidence of aspiration, (6) esophageal intubation, (7) cardiac arrest, (8) severe hypoxemia, (9) dental injury, and (10) all-cause mortality. Additional file 1: Supplemental Methods 7 describes the endpoint definition of some outcomes.

We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary outcome. Studies were grouped based on the (1) VL brands and (2) operators' experience. A sensitivity analysis of the subgroup analysis evaluating the operator's experience was performed changing the threshold of from 50 to 100 prior intubations to be considered experienced. Subgroup analyses were performed if two or more studies were available in the group.

Quality assessment

Two independent authors (B. A. and R. A.) assessed the risk of bias in the included RCTs using Cochrane's Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB 2). Any disagreements were resolved through consensus between authors. We explored the potential for publication bias by visual inspection of the comparison-adjusted funnel plots and Egger's test for the primary endpoint.

### Management of the difficult airway [^114hZrNG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Airway management is a fundamental component of care during resuscitation of critically ill and injured children. In addition to predicted anatomic and physiologic differences in children compared with adults, certain conditions can predict potential difficulty during pediatric airway management. This review presents approaches to identifying pediatric patients in whom airway management is more likely to be difficult, and discusses strategies to address such challenges. These strategies include optimization of effective bag-mask ventilation, alternative approaches to laryngoscopy, use of adjunct airway devices, modifications to rapid sequence intubation, and performance of surgical airways in children. The importance of considering systems of care in preparing for potentially difficult pediatric airways is also discussed.

### Non-invasive ventilation for preoxygenation before general anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1118SGMr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of NIV and conventional preoxygenation methods in patients scheduled for surgeries were included in this review. Studies were selected only if the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients, preoxygenation technique, and definitions of each recorded outcome were clearly reported. We excluded trials that met at least one of the following criteria: (1) pediatric patients, (2) critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure or ventilation distress that required emergency intubation, (3) trials that only recruited healthy volunteers, (4) overlap of authors, centers, or patient cohorts in two or more trials.

Search strategy and study selection

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible studies published from database inception to September 2021. The following Medical Subject Headings were used: ((positive pressure) OR (non-invasive)) AND ((preoxygenation) OR (ventilation) OR (anesthesia)). The detailed search strategy is described in the supplementary files (Additional file 1: Appendix 1). The "related articles" option in PubMed was used to broaden the search, and all abstracts, trials, and citations retrieved were reviewed. In addition, we identified some relevant trials from the reference sections of relevant papers and through correspondence with subject experts. Finally, unpublished trials were collected from the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. No language restrictions were applied. The systematic review described herein is accepted by PROSPERO, an online international prospective register of systematic reviews curated by the National Institute for Health Research (CRD42020203173).

Data extraction

Baseline and outcome data were independently retrieved by two reviewers (TLC and KWT), and study designs, study population characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, preoxygenation techniques, and collected data outcomes were extracted. Decisions recorded individually by the reviewers were compared, and disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (JRO). The authors of the trials were contacted for additional information.

Appraisal of methodological quality

The reviewer independently assessed the methodological quality of each trial by using the Risk of Bias Assessment 2.0 recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Several domains were assessed, including randomization adequacy, allocation concealment, outcome assessor blinding to patient information, follow-up duration, information provided to participants regarding trial withdrawal, whether intention-to-treat analysis was performed, and freedom from other biases. We also assess the quality of evidences by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Table 3).

### 2022 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway [^113q3EoS]. Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Anticipated difficult airway — awake intubation criteria and approach: When appropriate, perform awake intubation if the patient is suspected to be a difficult intubation and one or more of the following apply: difficult ventilation (face mask/supraglottic airway), increased risk of aspiration, the patient is likely incapable of tolerating a brief apnea episode, or there is expected difficulty with emergency invasive airway rescue, and any one factor alone may be of sufficient clinical importance to warrant an awake intubation. The uncooperative or pediatric patient may restrict the options for difficult airway management and may require an approach (e.g., intubation attempts after induction of general anesthesia) that might not be regarded as a primary approach in a cooperative patient. Proceed with airway management after induction of general anesthesia when the benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. Before attempting intubation of the anticipated difficult airway, determine the benefit of a noninvasive versus invasive approach to airway management, provide and test mask ventilation after each attempt when feasible, limit the number of attempts at tracheal intubation or supraglottic airway placement, and if the selected approach fails or is not feasible, identify an alternative invasive intervention and initiate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) when/if appropriate and available.

### Effect of paratracheal pressure on the glottic view during direct laryngoscopy: a randomized double-blind, noninferiority trial [^111WM3AQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cricoid pressure has been used as a component of the rapid sequence induction and intubation technique. However, concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness and safety of cricoid pressure. Paratracheal pressure, a potential alternative to cricoid pressure to prevent regurgitation of gastric contents or aspiration, has been studied to be more effective to cricoid pressure in preventing gastric insufflation during positive pressure ventilation. However, to adopt paratracheal compression into our practice, adverse effects including its effect on the glottic view during direct laryngoscopy should be studied. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial comparing paratracheal and cricoid pressures for any adverse effects on the view during direct laryngoscopy, together with other secondary outcome measures.

Methods

In total, 140 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia randomly received paratracheal pressure (paratracheal group) or cricoid pressure (cricoid group) during anesthesia induction. The primary end point was the incidence of deteriorated laryngoscopic view, evaluated by modified Cormack-Lehane grade with a predefined noninferiority margin of 15%. Secondary end points included percentage of glottic opening score, ease of mask ventilation, change in ventilation volume and peak inspiratory pressure during mechanical mask ventilation, ease of tracheal intubation, and resistance encountered while advancing the tube into the glottis. The position of the esophagus was assessed by ultrasound in both groups to determine whether pressure applied to the respective area would be likely to result in esophageal compression. All secondary outcomes were tested for superiority, except percentage of glottic opening score, which was tested for noninferiority.

Results

Paratracheal pressure was noninferior to cricoid pressure regarding the incidence of deterioration of modified Cormack-Lehane grade (0% vs 2.9%; absolute risk difference, -2.9%; 95% confidence interval, -9.9 to 2.6, P < .0001). Mask ventilation, measured on an ordinal scale, was found to be easier (ie, more likely to have a lower score) with paratracheal pressure than with cricoid pressure (OR, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.21–0.79; P = 0.008). The increase in peak inspiratory pressure was significantly less in the paratracheal group than in the cricoid group during mechanical mask ventilation (median [min, max], 0 [-1, 1] vs 0 [-1, 23]; P = 0.001). The differences in other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant between the groups. The anatomical position of the esophagus was more suitable for compression in the paratracheal region, compared to the cricoid cartilage region.

Conclusions

Paratracheal pressure was noninferior to cricoid pressure with respect to the effect on glottic view during direct laryngoscopy.

### Randomized trial of sedative choice for intubation (RSI) [^1161tDvY]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Each year more than 1. 5 million critically ill adults receive invasive mechanical ventilation in the United States, at a cost of nearly $30 billion dollars annually. Recent research has dramatically improved patient safety during the maintenance, weaning, and liberation stages of invasive mechanical ventilation. In contrast, the optimal approach to the initiation of mechanical ventilation remains an important knowledge gap in the care of adults with respiratory failure. Among critically ill adults, life-threatening complications during tracheal intubation and initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation remain common. One in five patients experiences hypotension and one-in-forty experiences cardiac arrest during the two-minute tracheal intubation procedure. Cardiovascular collapse is a peri-procedural outcome defined as severe hypotension, new or increased vasopressors, cardiac arrest or death.

The occurrence of cardiovascular collapse during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults increases patients' risk of in-hospital mortality. Randomized trials examining intubation technique commonly target cardiovascular collapse as an outcome. Adherence to recommended best-practices for tracheal intubation are insufficient to prevent 20–40% of critically ill adults from experiencing cardiovascular collapse during tracheal intubation. The results, however, demonstrated significant heterogeneity. Patients with trauma experienced a non-significant 4% absolute increase in mortality when intubated with ketamine compared to etomidate.

All other patients experienced a non-significantly lower mortality when intubated with ketamine, particularly patients with sepsis who experienced a non-significant 7% absolute mortality benefit. Experts have pointed out that the currently available data on sedative choice during tracheal intubation of critically ill patients are inadequate and have called for additional randomized clinical trials. Because cardiovascular collapse is common during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults sedatives are a driver of cardiovascular collapse, use of ketamine or etomidate varies between centers, specialties, and operators, and prior data suggests the potential for ketamine to significantly decrease mortality for patients without trauma, a large, multicenter trial is needed to determine the effects of ketamine and etomidate on mortality in non-traumatic critical illness.

### Laryngeal mask airway versus bag-mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation for neonatal resuscitation [^11498Pqj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Providing effective positive pressure ventilation is the single most important component of successful neonatal resuscitation. Ventilation is frequently initiated with a manual resuscitation bag and face-mask (BMV) followed by endotracheal intubation (ETT) if depression continues. These techniques may be difficult to perform successfully resulting in prolonged resuscitation or severe neonatal depression. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may achieve initial ventilation and successful resuscitation faster than a bag-mask device or endotracheal intubation.

Objectives

Among newborns requiring positive pressure ventilation for resuscitation, is effective ventilation and successful resuscitation achieved faster with the LMA compared with either BMV or ETT?

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-November 2004), Pre-MEDLINE (November 15, 2004), CINAHL 1982-November 2004), reference lists of published trials, and Society for Pediatric Research abstracts were searched. Experts were contacted for additional references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently evaluated studies, assessed methodologic quality, and extracted data using the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group criteria. Categorical treatment effects were described as relative risks and risk differences and continuous treatment effects were described as the mean difference. There were insufficient data to perform pooled analyses.

Main Results

No eligible studies compared the LMA with BMV. One small randomised controlled trial comparing the LMA with ETT when BMV had been unsuccessful was included. There was no statistically significant difference between the LMA and ETT with the exception of a clinically insignificant difference in time to complete insertion of the device favouring the ETT.

Authors' Conclusions

The LMA can achieve effective ventilation during neonatal resuscitation in a time-frame consistent with current guidelines. There is no evidence to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of the LMA compared with BMV as the primary airway device. A single, small randomised controlled trial found no clinically significant difference between the LMA and ETT when BMV was unsuccessful. Case series and case reports suggest that the LMA can provide an effective rescue airway during resuscitation if both BMV and ETT have been unsuccessful. A well-designed randomised controlled trial comparing the LMA with BMV during neonatal resuscitation is warranted.

Early tracheostomy — potential benefits and limits: Consider early tracheostomy (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). A meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials suggests that early tracheostomy (within 7 days of intubation) may be associated with a 40% decrease in VAP rates, less time on mechanical ventilation, and fewer ICU days but no difference in mortality. Decision makers should integrate these potential benefits with each patient's values and preferences when determining whether and when to proceed with tracheostomy.

### Effect of fluid bolus administration on cardiovascular collapse among critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation: a randomized clinical trial [^112sEqZp]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypotension is common during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults and increases the risk of cardiac arrest and death. Whether administering an intravenous fluid bolus to critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation prevents severe hypotension, cardiac arrest, or death remains uncertain.

Objective

To determine the effect of fluid bolus administration on the incidence of severe hypotension, cardiac arrest, and death.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial enrolled 1067 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation with sedation and positive pressure ventilation at 11 intensive care units in the US between February 1, 2019, and May 24, 2021. The date of final follow-up was June 21, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 500-mL intravenous fluid bolus (n = 538) or no fluid bolus (n = 527).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was cardiovascular collapse (defined as new or increased receipt of vasopressors or a systolic blood pressure < 65 mm Hg between induction of anesthesia and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation, or cardiac arrest or death between induction of anesthesia and 1 hour after tracheal intubation). The secondary outcome was the incidence of death prior to day 28, which was censored at hospital discharge.

Results

Among 1067 patients randomized, 1065 (99.8%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis (median age, 62 years [IQR, 51–70 years]; 42.1% were women). Cardiovascular collapse occurred in 113 patients (21.0%) in the fluid bolus group and in 96 patients (18.2%) in the no fluid bolus group (absolute difference, 2.8% [95% CI, -2.2% to 7.7%]; P = 0.25). New or increased receipt of vasopressors occurred in 20.6% of patients in the fluid bolus group compared with 17.6% of patients in the no fluid bolus group, a systolic blood pressure of less than 65 mm Hg occurred in 3.9% vs 4.2%, respectively, cardiac arrest occurred in 1.7% vs 1.5%, and death occurred in 0.7% vs 0.6%. Death prior to day 28 (censored at hospital discharge) occurred in 218 patients (40.5%) in the fluid bolus group compared with 223 patients (42.3%) in the no fluid bolus group (absolute difference, -1.8% [95% CI, -7.9% to 4.3%]; P = 0.55).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, administration of an intravenous fluid bolus compared with no fluid bolus did not significantly decrease the incidence of cardiovascular collapse.

### Ketamine versus etomidate as an induction agent for tracheal intubation in critically ill adults: a Bayesian meta-analysis [^1112smiK]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tracheal intubation is a high-risk intervention commonly performed in critically ill patients. Due to its favorable cardiovascular profile, ketamine is considered less likely to compromise clinical outcomes. This meta-analysis aimed to assess whether ketamine, compared with other agents, reduces mortality in critically ill patients undergoing intubation.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception until April 27, 2023, for randomized controlled trials and matched observational studies comparing ketamine with any control in critically ill patients as an induction agent. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up available, and the secondary outcomes included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, ventilator-free days at day 28, vasopressor-free days at day 28, post-induction mean arterial pressure, and successful intubation on the first attempt. For the primary outcome, we used a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis on the risk ratio (RR) scale with a weakly informative neutral prior corresponding to a mean estimate of no difference with 95% probability; the estimated effect size will fall between a relative risk of 0.25 and 4. The RR and 95% credible interval (CrI) were used to estimate the probability of mortality reduction (RR < 1). The secondary outcomes were assessed with a frequentist random-effects model. We registered this study in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2vf79/).

Results

We included seven randomized trials and one propensity-matched study totaling 2978 patients. Etomidate was the comparator in all the identified studies. The probability that ketamine reduced mortality was 83.2% (376/1475 [25%] vs. 411/1503 [27%]; RR, 0.93; 95% CrI, 0.79–1.08), which was confirmed by a subgroup analysis excluding studies with a high risk of bias. No significant difference was observed in any secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

All of the included studies evaluated ketamine versus etomidate among critically ill adults requiring tracheal intubation. This meta-analysis showed a moderate probability that induction with ketamine is associated with a reduced risk of mortality.

### Video vs Direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation after cardiac arrest: a secondary analysis of the direct vs Video laryngoscope trial [^115yNyzC]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of the DEVICE trial. The DEVICE trial was a randomized controlled study that enrolled adults who were critically ill undergoing intubation at 17 sites in the Pragmatic Critical Care Research Group, including 7 EDs and 10 ICUs. All adults undergoing tracheal intubation in a participating ED or ICU were eligible except patients who were known to be pregnant or serving a prison sentence and patients for whom the clinician performing the procedure determined that the use of a video laryngoscope or a direct laryngoscope on the first attempt was either required or contraindicated. Patients were enrolled and randomized by treating clinicians or a delegate using sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Clinicians were allowed to exclude patients when the urgency of the clinical situation and available team resources precluded safe completion of trial procedures, but clinicians were also allowed to enroll patients undergoing emergency intubations, including patients in cardiac arrest, when safe completion of trial procedures was feasible. In the DEVICE trial, a total of 1,417 patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to use of video or direct laryngoscopy. This secondary analysis of a de-identified data set represented nonhuman subjects research (Institutional Review Board Identifier: 160158); secondary review and concurrence of nonhuman subjects research was performed by the Department of Defense Office of Human Research Oversight.

The current secondary analysis of the DEVICE trial included patients (1) for whom the indication for intubation was cardiac arrest, (2) who had experienced a cardiac arrest before initiation of the intubation procedure as reported by the clinician performing the tracheal intubation procedure, and (3) for whom cardiac arrest was listed as an active problem at time of intubation. The exposure of interest was randomized trial group assignment (video laryngoscope group vs direct laryngoscope group). The primary outcome was the same as the original trial: successful intubation on the first attempt, defined as placement of an endotracheal tube in the trachea with a single insertion of a laryngoscope blade into the mouth and either a single insertion of an endotracheal tube into the mouth or a single insertion of a bougie into the mouth, followed by a single insertion of an endotracheal tube into the mouth. All sites used either colorimetric or waveform capnography to confirm successful intubation. Additional outcomes included the duration of laryngoscopy (defined as the time from initial laryngoscope insertion to successful endotracheal tube placement), Cormack-Lehane grade of view, death within 1 hour after intubation, and death by 28 days after intubation.

### COVID-19 PICU guidelines: for high-and limited-resource settings [^112Tpgmo]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Patients with progressive hypoxemia, altered mental status, or continued increased work of breathing on NIPPV should undergo endotracheal intubation (e.g. evolving ARDS). Multiple intubation attempts can result in poorer outcomes for the patientand place the provider at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19; therefore, intubation by the most-skilled provider is recommended. Before endotracheal intubation, bag-mask respiratory assistance may become an aerosol-generating procedure; therefore, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) using muscle relaxant is recommended. Pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen (unless contraindicated, e.g. cyanotic heart lesion patients) is recommended to minimize hypoxia with RSI; children are at great risk of hypoxia due to a smaller functional residual capacity. Video laryngoscopy, if available, can be used to increase the distance between the patient and provider. Once the patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube cuff must be inflated immediately to prevent aerosolization. Endotracheal intubation is an aerosol-generating procedure; the provider therefore requires full PPE to protect himself/herself. PPE includes disposable fluid-resistant long-sleeved gowns, goggles or disposable full-face shields, and N95 masks. If available, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) can be used in place of an N95 mask. Disposable operating room caps should be worn to reduce contaminating hairs by droplets.

In order to provide further protection of health-care workers, other procedures have also been introduced, including an acryl intubation box, plastic drapes, as well as mask-over-tube technique. Use of hydrophobic viral filters placed at the ventilator outlets and inline closed suction are suggested to minimize the risk of transmission. Extubation is also an aerosol-generating procedure; therefore, PPE must be worn.

General management guidelines or protocolsfor mechanical ventilation in ARDS can be applied to the COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. A low tidal volume, 4−6 ml/kg for ideal body weight, lung protective strategy is usually recommended. However, larger tidal volumes are frequently used in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) around the world; therefore, it is advised to continue to use tidal volumes familiar to each institution. A meta-analysis of observational studies in children did not demonstrate a survival benefit by reducing tidal volumesand a retrospective analysis of ARDS patients at a single center also did not show a relation between tidal volumes and outcomes.

Semi-Fowler positioning during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in critically ill adults — Compared with the supine sniffing position in a single randomized controlled trial, the semi-Fowler position "decreased the FPS rate (76.2% vs 85.4%, p = 0.02), increased the incidence of Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view (25.4% vs 11.5%, p = 0.01), and increased the rate of difficult intubation (laryngoscopy attempts ≥ 3; 12.3% vs 4.6%, p = 0.04)". A meta-analysis reported a pooled risk ratio of "0.97 (95% CI, 0.86–1.09; I2 = 55%)" and "failed to demonstrate that the semi-Fowler position was more favorable compared with supine positioning". Regarding oxygenation and aspiration, "The semi-Fowler position reduced oxygen desaturation in the observational studies, and in one study reduced aspiration compared with the supine position", whereas "The RCT did not find a difference between groups for either oxygen desaturation or aspiration". Outside ICU populations, evidence "suggests that the semi-Fowler position is beneficial for improving several intubation-related outcomes", with desaturation thresholds "defined as 92% and 95%", but "none of these studies specifically examined the semi-Fowler position in critically ill patients with these conditions". The panel "determined that head and torso inclined, semi-Fowler position was feasible in most critically ill patients undergoing RSI", notes as a caveat "patients requiring spine immobilization", states "There is no cost associated with using the semi-Fowler position", and adds it "does not preclude incorporation of other optimization techniques and maneuvers, such as the sniffing position".
