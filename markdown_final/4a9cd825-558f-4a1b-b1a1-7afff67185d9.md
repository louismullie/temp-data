## Question

left groin pain following hernia repair

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage left groin pain after inguinal hernia repair. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define chronic postoperative inguinal pain and set a timeline for evaluation. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and the sequence of ruling out recurrence, mesh-related issues, and non-hernia causes. Next, I will review the initial conservative management pathway and when to escalate. After that, I need to check the indications, timing, and surgical strategies for refractory cases, including neurectomy and mesh removal. Finally, I should consider prevention, special populations, and the role of centralized care and multidisciplinary teams, while continuously validating claims against guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and timing of chronic postoperative inguinal pain, because this frames the entire workup and treatment cadence. Chronic postoperative inguinal pain is generally defined as bothersome pain lasting at least 3 months after surgery that impacts daily activities, with many experts extending the observation window to 6 months to account for ongoing inflammatory remodeling around mesh and nerves, so I should not jump to invasive decisions before that window unless there is a clear structural lesion or severe neuropathic pain unresponsive to conservative care [^112F1G4B] [^113i5SEq] [^116rVYMd].

> Wait, let me verify the prevalence and burden to contextualize risk and counseling. Chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair affects roughly 10–15% of patients, with about 2–4% experiencing persistent severe pain that significantly impairs function, and women appear to have a higher risk than men, which should influence preoperative planning and postoperative surveillance in female patients [^113czHqR] [^117SsQZ3] [^114FYjd6].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, and I need to ensure I do not anchor on neuropathic pain too early. Recurrence remains a common and treatable cause of pain and should be ruled out early with targeted examination and imaging, while mesh-related complications such as meshoma, nerve entrapment, and inflammatory foreign-body reactions should be considered alongside non-hernia etiologies like hip pathology, pubalgia, urologic or gynecologic sources, and lumbar radiculopathy, so a broad but prioritized differential is essential before labeling pain as neuropathic [^115HWmJz] [^1125GcEa] [^111VmaKa].

> Hold on, I should verify the initial diagnostic steps and imaging strategy. A careful history of the original operation, mesh type, fixation method, and nerve handling, plus a focused exam for a bulge, Tinel sign, or sensory changes, guides the workup. Ultrasound is a reasonable first-line modality to assess recurrence or mesh-related pathology, but MRI provides superior sensitivity and specificity when ultrasound is negative yet suspicion remains high, and I should remember that meshoma or nerve entrapment may be radiographically evident even when the exam is equivocal [^111VmaKa] [^113czHqR].

> Let me think about the initial conservative management phase, and I should double-check the timing before escalating. For many patients, pain diminishes over months; watchful waiting with education, activity modification, and basic analgesics is appropriate initially, with pharmacologic therapy escalated to neuropathic agents such as gabapentinoids, TCAs, or SNRIs if pain persists, and diagnostic/therapeutic ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerve blocks can both clarify pain mechanisms and provide temporary relief while informing next steps [^111Lh6b5] [^1138UKLX] [^113czHqR].

> But wait, what if the pain is severe or clearly neuropathic early on; should I still wait 6 months. Immediate severe or excruciating postoperative pain warrants early evaluation for acute nerve injury or vascular compromise, and guidelines support considering early reoperation in that scenario, whereas for persistent moderate pain without red flags, maintaining conservative therapy for at least 3–6 months is prudent to allow spontaneous improvement and to optimize selection for surgery [^113JH2Gy] [^116rVYMd].

> Next, I should review when to consider surgery and which operations to choose, and I need to ensure I match the remedial approach to the index repair. Indications for operative intervention include failure of at least 3–6 months of conservative therapy, discrete neuroanatomic pain correlating with positive diagnostic blocks, or identifiable structural lesions such as meshoma or recurrence; timing is typically at or beyond 6–12 months after the index repair to maximize the chance of spontaneous resolution and to reduce unnecessary reoperations [^112EC3kM] [^113M1Xmt].

> I will now examine surgical strategy after an anterior open repair, and I should confirm the recommendation for triple neurectomy. After Lichtenstein or other anterior approaches, open anterior mesh removal with triple neurectomy of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genital branch of the genitofemoral nerves is the most definitive option, because selective neurectomy risks missing cross-innervation and leaves injured nerves that may look grossly normal yet harbor ultrastructural damage; in selected patients, laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy can be considered to avoid the scarred inguinal field [^117ECq4A] [^111Lh6b5] [^112EC3kM].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach after a posterior repair such as TEP or TAPP. In this setting, a posterior laparoscopic approach with exploration, removal of tacks or fixation material, and selective or triple neurectomy in the preperitoneal plane is favored, and I need to remember that nonfixation or glue fixation reduces early postoperative pain compared with tacks, which may also mitigate chronic pain risk in some contexts, though evidence quality varies and technique should be individualized [^117ECq4A] [^113k41pa] [^116PAW1o].

> Let me reconsider the role of prophylactic neurectomy at the time of primary repair, because I initially thought it might broadly reduce chronic pain. Hmm, wait a minute, the balance of evidence is mixed. Meta-analyses suggest prophylactic ilioinguinal neurectomy during Lichtenstein reduces early chronic pain at 6 months without a clear long-term advantage at 12 months, and contemporary observational data do not show differences in 6‑month pain across strategies of one, two, or three‑nerve identification and preservation, so routine prophylactic neurectomy is not recommended; instead, meticulous nerve identification with pragmatic resection only when the nerve is injured or interferes with mesh placement is advised [^1147fBSA] [^116L9UyS] [^112ULsG2].

> I should confirm the expected outcomes and risks of remedial surgery, and I need to be transparent about uncertainties. In highly selected patients with discrete neuropathic pain generators, triple neurectomy with or without mesh removal achieves substantial pain reduction in roughly 70–90%, but there is a risk of persistent or new paresthesias, and failure of conservative measures alone is not an indication for surgery; careful patient selection and counseling are essential to avoid iatrogenic worsening [^112EC3kM] [^1123nA8Z] [^1143Dqhy].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies, because reducing incident chronic pain is preferable to treating it. Lightweight mesh reduces chronic pain and foreign-body sensation after open anterior repair compared with heavyweight mesh, whereas for laparoendoscopic repairs, heavyweight mesh is favored in large direct hernias to minimize recurrence without clear chronic pain benefit from lightweight constructs; atraumatic fixation with glue or nonfixation when feasible, and routine identification and protection of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genital branch nerves reduce iatrogenic neuropathy risk [^113tvAXM] [^117Q5aJX] [^114qx1JZ].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and risk modifiers. Women have a higher risk of chronic pain after groin hernia repair and should be counseled accordingly, adolescents and very young patients may be considered for nonmesh tissue repairs when appropriate to mitigate long-term mesh-related concerns, and patients with high preoperative pain intensity, younger age, and open repair are at increased risk, which should shape perioperative analgesic planning and follow-up intensity [^117SsQZ3] [^112z3WKX] [^116DKDD7].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of centralized care and multidisciplinary teams, because outcomes hinge on expertise. International guidelines recommend centralizing chronic postoperative inguinal pain evaluation and management in specialist centers with experienced multidisciplinary teams, and integrating pain specialists, physical therapy, and psychological support improves outcomes; prehabilitation with cognitive behavioral therapy may further enhance results in patients proceeding to remedial surgery [^112em4C5] [^113czHqR] [^116ypQkq].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check that it aligns with guidelines. Start with a thorough history and exam to characterize pain and screen for recurrence or mesh-related pathology, use ultrasound and MRI selectively to confirm diagnosis, pursue conservative therapy for at least 3–6 months including neuropathic medications and targeted nerve blocks, and if pain remains severe and function-limiting with concordant diagnostic findings, refer to a hernia pain center for consideration of remedial surgery matched to the index approach, with triple neurectomy and mesh removal as indicated and explicit counseling about risks, benefits, and uncertain long-term outcomes [^114j4seS] [^116rVYMd] [^1143Dqhy].

Left groin pain after hernia repair is most often due to **nerve injury** (ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral) [^116yfBfy] or **mesh-related complications** (meshoma, fixation trauma, recurrence) [^1133AENw] [^1125GcEa]. Other causes include infection, hematoma, or musculoskeletal issues [^114WkCz7]. Management is **stepwise**: confirm the diagnosis with history, exam, and imaging (ultrasound/MRI) [^111VmaKa]; start with NSAIDs, gabapentin, and physical therapy; if pain persists, use nerve blocks; and if refractory, consider triple neurectomy or mesh removal [^114j4seS] [^1117gxkW]. Most patients improve with conservative care, but 2–4% may need surgery [^111RrEph].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Left groin pain after hernia repair is **multifactorial**; the following are the most common causes and risk factors:

| **Etiology** | **Description** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Nerve injury | Injury to the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, or genitofemoral nerves during surgery, leading to neuropathic pain [^1123nA8Z] [^116yfBfy] | - Open repair <br/> - Mesh fixation <br/> - Nerve entrapment [^1123nA8Z] |
| Mesh-related complications | - Meshoma (mesh shrinkage/ball) <br/> - Mesh migration <br/> - Mesh infection <br/> - Recurrence of hernia [^1133AENw] | - Heavyweight mesh <br/> - Staple/tack fixation <br/> - Large hernia defects [^113tvAXM] |
| Infection | Chronic low-grade infection or inflammation around the mesh or surgical site [^114WkCz7] | - Immunocompromised state <br/> - Poor surgical technique <br/> - Inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis |
| Hematoma/seroma | Collection of blood or serous fluid causing pressure and discomfort [^notfound] | - Anticoagulant use <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Poor hemostasis |
| Musculoskeletal issues | - Hip joint pathology <br/> - Pubalgia <br/> - Myofascial pain syndromes [^115HWmJz] | - Pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions <br/> - Overuse injuries <br/> - Poor posture |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause of persistent groin pain:

- **Clinical history and physical examination**: Detailed history of pain characteristics, surgical technique, and postoperative course. Physical examination to identify recurrence, meshoma, or nerve entrapment signs [^113czHqR].

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality to assess for recurrence, mesh-related complications, or hematoma. MRI is useful for detecting occult hernias, nerve entrapment, or soft tissue abnormalities [^111VmaKa].

- **Diagnostic nerve blocks**: Injection of local anesthetics (e.g. lidocaine) into the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, or genitofemoral nerves can help confirm neuropathic pain and guide further management [^112EC3kM].

---

## Management strategies

Management of left groin pain after hernia repair follows a **stepwise approach**, starting with conservative measures and escalating to interventional or surgical options if necessary:

---

### Conservative management

- **Pharmacological therapy**: NSAIDs, gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^113M1Xmt].

- **Physical therapy**: Pelvic floor rehabilitation, core strengthening, and myofascial release techniques [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, activity modification, and ergonomic adjustments [^notfound].

---

### Interventional management

Interventional options include **nerve blocks** — diagnostic and therapeutic injections of local anesthetics and corticosteroids for temporary relief and to confirm the diagnosis — and **radiofrequency ablation**, which provides longer-term pain relief by thermally ablating the affected nerves [^113M1Xmt].

---

### Surgical management

- **Triple neurectomy**: Removal of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves, typically reserved for refractory cases with confirmed neuropathic pain [^1117gxkW].

- **Mesh removal**: Indicated in cases of meshoma, mesh infection, or severe foreign body reaction [^1133AENw].

- **Recurrent hernia repair**: If recurrence is identified, surgical repair is indicated [^1129sSfq].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis for patients with left groin pain after hernia repair varies depending on the underlying cause and the effectiveness of treatment. Conservative management is effective in approximately 70% of patients, whereas **surgical interventions**, such as triple neurectomy or mesh removal, provide significant relief in 80–90% of refractory cases. Persistent pain can significantly impact quality of life, causing functional impairment, psychological distress, and reduced productivity [^1147ZfRW].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing chronic groin pain after hernia repair involves **meticulous surgical technique**, including careful nerve identification and preservation, atraumatic mesh fixation, and the use of lightweight meshes [^113tvAXM] [^114qx1JZ]. Multimodal analgesia with preoperative and postoperative nerve blocks, NSAIDs, and gabapentinoids is recommended [^114zifSJ] [^113M1Xmt]. Patient selection — avoiding surgery in high-risk patients (e.g. chronic pain syndromes, psychological comorbidities) — and thorough preoperative counseling about chronic pain risks further reduce incidence [^111ThsZd].

Left groin pain after hernia repair is a **complex condition** with multiple potential causes. A **systematic diagnostic approach** and stepwise management strategy are essential for effective treatment. Most patients improve with conservative measures, but a minority require surgical intervention. Prevention through meticulous surgical technique and patient selection is crucial.

Chronic postoperative inguinal pain, CPIP, afflicts 10% to 15% of the nearly 700,000 Americans who have inguinal hernia surgery every year. CPIP is challenging to manage because it poses many diagnostic dilemmas that can be overcome with a thorough history, examination, differential diagnosis, and imaging. The initial treatment of CPIP should explore all nonsurgical therapies including medications, physical therapy, interventional pain management and cognitive therapy. When nonoperative methods fail, surgical interventions including neurectomy and hernia mesh removal have proven to be beneficial for patients with CPIP.

### Somatosensory outcomes following Re-surgery in persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair: a prospective observational study [^111PRYJu]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

After groin hernia repair (globally more than 20 million/year) 2–4% will develop persistent severe pain (PSPG). Pain management is challenging and may require multimodal interventions, including re-surgery. Quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) is an investigational psychophysiological tool with the potential to uncover the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the pain, ie, revealing neuropathic or inflammatory components. The primary objective was to examine and describe the underlying pathophysiological changes in the groin areas by QST before and after re-surgery with mesh removal and selective neurectomy.

Patients and Methods

Sixty patients with PSPG scheduled for re-surgery and with an inflammatory "component" indicated by blunt pressure algometry were examined in median (95% CI) 7.9 (5.8–11.5) months before and 4.0 (3.5–4.6) months after re-surgery. The QST-analyses included standardized assessments of cutaneous mechanical/thermal detection and pain thresholds. Suprathreshold heat stimuli were applied. Deep tissue sensitivity was tested by pressure algometry. Testing sites were the groin areas and the lower arm. Before/after QST data were z-transformed.

Results

Re-surgery resulted in median changes in rest, average, and maximal pain intensity scores of -2.0, -2.5, and -2.0 NRS (0/10) units, respectively (P = 0.0001), and proportional increases in various standardized functional scores (P = 0.0001). Compared with the control sites, the cutaneous somatosensory detection thresholds of the painful groin were increased before re-surgery and increased further after re-surgery (median difference: 1.28 z-values; P = 0.001), indicating a successive post-surgical loss of nerve fiber function ("deafferentation"). Pressure algometry thresholds increased after re-surgery (median difference: 0.30 z-values; P = 0.001).

Conclusion

In this subset of patients with PSPG who underwent re-surgery, the procedure was associated with improved pain and functional outcomes. While the increase in somatosensory detection thresholds mirrors the surgery-induced cutaneous deafferentation, the increase in pressure algometry thresholds mirrors the removal of the deep "pain generator". The QST-analyses are useful adjuncts in mechanism-based somatosensory research.

### Controversies in inguinal hernia [^111S6ZcK]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Inguinal hernias represent one of the most common pathologic conditions presenting to the general surgeon. In surgical practice, several controversies persist: when to operate, the utility of a laparoscopic versus open approach, the applicability of robotic surgery, the approach to bilateral hernias, management of athletic-related groin pain ("sports hernia"), and the role of tissue-based repairs in modern hernia surgery. Ideally, surgeons should approach each patient individually and tailor their approach based on patient factors and preferences. The informed consent process is critical, especially given increasing recognition of the risk of long-term chronic pain following hernia repair.

Introduction

Surgical treatment of inguinal hernia is one of the most frequent general surgical procedures with more than 20 million patients annually. Both, open and minimally-invasive procedures exist, although, apart from the recommendation to use a mesh, there is no standard repair technique. The open procedure "Lichtenstein" and two endoscopic techniques, extraperitoneal (TEP) or transperitoneal (TAPP), are proposed as the optimal repair techniques. Some studies have associated endoscopic techniques with shorter recovery time and lower risk of chronic postoperative inguinal pain (CPIP), as well as a higher risk of recurrence in hernias. However, analyses also reported a similar chronic pain rate and the same recurrence and complication rate (hematoma, seroma, wound infections) after open and minimal-invasive surgical procedures. Despite all the advances in surgery, countless studies, and the evolution of hernia meshes (e.g. in terms of pore sizes and amount of material), this significant CPIP incidence has not been reduced in the last 30 years, hernia surgery is treading water. CPIP affects up to 14% of patients. CPIP is defined as pain (≥ 3 in a visual analogue or numeric rating scale (V/NRS) from 0–10 for pain) lasting at least 3 months postoperatively that interferes with daily activities, is perceived as bothersome and sometimes has neuropathic components. Although CPIP resolves within one year postoperatively in up to 70% of cases, 30% of patients suffer from it permanently. Young age, female gender, severe perioperative pain, recurrent hernia and open hernia repair have previously been reported as risk factors for the development of CPIP. However, high early perioperative pain intensity has not been clearly defined or quantified in previous publications although this represents a risk factor that can be modified by adequate pain medication. On the other hand, it is unclear whether the need of pain medication to ameliorate perioperative pain itself is a risk factor or whether the adequate perioperative pain management reduces the risk of developing CPIP. Therefore, we performed a detailed retrospective analysis of patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair with a specific focus on perioperative pain management to further identify the aspect of perioperative pain management as a risk factor for CPIP.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^1133AENw]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Recurrence and meshoma are obvious anatomic pathologies amenable to surgical correction. When recurrence is identified, surgical correction is typically recommended using an alternative approach (ie, laparoscopic repair after initial open repair or vice versa). However, if accompanied by neuropathic pain, an anterior, open approach allows for correction of the hernia as well as access to the nerves. Meshoma may cause neuropathic pain from nerve entrapment, direct contact with mesh, or compressive effects. It may also cause nociceptive pain from compression of adjacent structures and foreign body sensation. Imaging is useful to help identify meshoma and involvement of adjacent structures. Operative removal of the meshoma is indicated with the need for simultaneous neurectomy directed by the type of mesh, approach, symptoms, imaging, and anatomy. If coexisting neuropathic pain is present, all nerves within the reoperative field should be addressed, as neuropathy cannot be assessed visually, and mesh removal will often compromise unaffected nerves within the inguinal canal.

Neuropathy of the nerve fibers within the lamina propria of the vas deferens, referred to as "paravasal nerves" and originating from the deep pelvic plexus, may be partially responsible for postherniorrhaphy orchialgia. In patients with groin pain associated with orchialgia, segmental resection of the lamina propria of the vas together with triple neurectomy has improved outcomes and helped in the management of testicular pain. Orchialgia, however, is a complex entity, and remedial surgery to correct this is less predictable and effective.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^111Lh6b5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Watchful waiting

First-line management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair is to examine the patient and explain the condition. Since pain is declining with time after surgery, a watchful strategy can be tried in the beginning. However, a lifestyle change to sedentary activities is not recommended, and chronic pain can severely affect quality of life. Basic analgesics can be used in the period of watchful waiting. If there are no improvements in the condition after a few months, then systematic pharmacological interventions should be tried, preferably in collaboration with pain specialists. If the pain is bearable, it is import to inform the patient that pain will, for many patients, diminish with time.

Surgery

If other treatments (watchful waiting, systemic analgesics, and injections) have been tried and failed, it should be considered to operate the patients for their pain (Figure 1). Different surgical approaches can be used to remove the mesh, perform a neurectomy, or a combination of both. Neurectomy can be performed via an anterior open approach or via a posterior laparoscopic technique. Surgical strategy will be determined by the initial technique for inguinal hernia repair. Following anterior approaches, a repeated anterior approach with neurectomy and mesh removal is recommended. Following posterior approaches (ie, laparoscopy), a posterior approach is recommended with exploration of the field and removal of tacks and mesh.

If it is thought that the mesh is causing the problem, and not a recurrence, a surgical removal of the mesh should be considered. The pain can be due to damage to the nerves caused by the mesh, but simply removal of the mesh might not reverse the neuropathic pain. Peroperatively, the nerves might seem normal without macroscopically visible damage, but there can still be ultrastructural damages to the nerves that will cause pain and even the removal of the mesh might not reverse the damage and the patient might still have pain. It is therefore recommended to always conduct a triple neurectomy since it is difficult if not impossible to diagnose which nerves are involved in the pain, and a subsequent surgical procedure in the scarred surgical field after mesh removal may be difficult. Thus, when performing mesh removal after a previous Lichtenstein repair, it is recommended to remove as much of the mesh as possible (preferably all mesh material) together with triple neurectomy anterior to the annulus, ie, outside of the abdominal cavity without dissection behind the transversalis fascia.

Surgical treatment of pain following a posterior approach such as laparoscopy can be divided in two methods. The first method is to remove tacks and mesh with a laparoscopic approach. The second method is a neurectomy that should be reserved for skilled hands.

The laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy has been developed to avoid the scared field of the groin after open approaches and in order to conduct neurectomy proximal to the nerves following preperitoneal or intraperitoneal approaches. In a highly selected group of patients (62 out of 567 with chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair), 95% of patients experienced decrease of their pain to "manageable levels" after laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^113os3No]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures in the world. Annually, more than 20 million inguinal hernia repairs are conducted worldwide, and in the US alone the number reaches 800,000.–In industrialized countries, lifetime risk for undergoing reparative surgery of inguinal hernia has been estimated to be 27% for men, and 3% for women. For a majority of patients, the operative correction of an inguinal hernia is successful with a minimum of postoperative sequelae, followed by a few weeks convalescenceand no long-term complications. However, considering the vast number of patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair, any, even rare, severe long-term complication would be of great impact.

The techniques of operative repair, or herniorrhaphy, have been refined over the last decades and have resulted in open and laparoscopic tension-free approaches utilizing advanced prosthetic mesh-material as gold standard. Consequently, hernia recurrence rates have decreased dramatically (1%–5%), and today, chronic pain is instead recognized as the most significant complication. Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) has been defined as pain that develops after surgical intervention and lasts for at least 2 months, other causes of pain excluded.CPSP has been historically reported with every common operation, including appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and cesarian section.

Discussion

This review aimed to provide an overview of possible strategies for the treatment of chronic pain after inguinal hernia surgery. At the moment, there is not a single treatment or management strategy that will be appropriate for all patients. Experts and expert-based guidelines recommend to use a scaled intervention, meaning that the patient should start out with watchful waiting, especially in the first 6 months, and then, systemic pain killers and if that cannot relieve the pain, injections should be tried; surgical treatment should be considered as the final option. It is also recommended to always consult a surgeon or, preferably, a regional or a national center with the expertise in chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery since causes and treatments vary from patient to patient and because one strategy might not fit all.

Several guidelines exist in this area; however, they are mostly based on expert opinions and personal experience and less on solid high-quality evidence. A regional, national, or maybe even international setup should be in place in order to deal with the most severe and complex cases. This allows for gathering of expertise and ensures that patients are uniformly treated and receive the best standard of care for this condition. An international collaboration could be beneficial in order to share knowledge and collect data for development of treatments. It is likely that the individual surgeon does not see their own patients with chronic pain if the patients go to a different surgeon or institution. Thus, just for reoperation for recurrence, up to 25% of patients go to a different hospital than for the primary repair.

In general, there is a high need for evidence regarding chronic postsurgical pain management, not only for pain following inguinal hernia surgery but also for pain following many different kinds of surgery. The treatment of chronic postoperative pain is difficult, and a simple treatment that works well for all has not been found. Therefore, individualized management is becoming more important, and the optimal management is what every surgeon or doctor treating these patients should aim for.

### Update of the international herniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^117Q5aJX]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, mesh repair, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use a heavyweight mesh for laparoendoscopic repair, especially in a large and direct hernia, to reduce the risk of recurrence. Do not use lightweight mesh, as it does not reduce the risk of postoperative pain but increases the risk of recurrence.

### Chronic pain after open inguinal hernia repair: expertise-based randomized clinical trial of heavyweight or lightweight mesh [^114Wjm7A]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a shortage of high-quality studies regarding choice of mesh in open anterior inguinal hernia repair in relation to long-term chronic pain. The authors hypothesized that heavyweight compared with lightweight mesh causes increased postoperative pain.

Methods

An RCT was undertaken between 2007 and 2009 at two sites in Sweden. Men aged 25 years or older with an inguinal hernia evaluated in the outpatient clinic were randomized in an unblinded fashion to heavyweight or lightweight mesh for open anterior inguinal hernia repair. Data on pain affecting daily activities, as measured by the Short-Form Inguinal Pain Questionnaire 9–12 years after surgery, were collected as the primary outcome. Differences between groups were evaluated by generalized odds and numbers needed to treat.

Results

A total of 412 patients were randomized; 363 were analysed with 320 questionnaires sent out. A total of 271 questionnaires (84.7 per cent) were returned; of these, 121 and 150 patients were in the heavyweight and lightweight mesh groups respectively. Pain affecting daily activities was more pronounced in patients randomized to heavyweight versus lightweight mesh (generalized odds 1.33, 95 per cent c.i. 1.10 to 1.61). This translated into a number needed to treat of 7.06 (95 per cent c.i. 4.28 to 21.44). Two reoperations for recurrence were noted in the heavyweight mesh group, and one in the lightweight mesh group.

Conclusion

A large-pore lightweight mesh causes significantly less pain affecting daily activities a decade after open anterior inguinal hernia repair. Registration number: NCT00451893 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

### Laparoscopic repair of groin pain in athletes [^114cNRor]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There has been increasing interest regarding the cause and treatment of groin pain in athletes. The most common finding is a deficiency of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, often repaired with bilateral inguinal myorrhaphy.

Hypothesis

Laparoscopic repair will offer a shorter convalescent period and better results as compared with open myorrhaphy.

Study Design

Retrospective review of prospectively collected data.

Methods

Between October 1993 and October 2002, 131 athletes with groin pain unrelieved after 2 to 8 months of conservative management underwent bilateral laparoscopic repair with the transabdominal preperitoneal technique for hernias. In 123 (94%) patients, physical examination revealed a dilated external ring, unilateral or bilateral, of the inguinal canal, and in 8 patients (6%) it was normal.

Results

During laparoscopy, a deficiency of the posterior inguinal wall was seen in all athletes. All patients left the hospital 24 hours after the procedure, discontinued oral analgesics within 72 hours of surgery, and were back to full sporting activities within 2 to 3 weeks. Four patients (3%) complained of thigh pain. After a mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 4 months to 10 years), there was 1 recurrence (0.76%).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic repair is an efficient method for the treatment of groin pain originating from a deficiency of the posterior inguinal wall, having fast recovery and excellent long-term results.

### What are the influencing factors for chronic pain following TAPP inguinal hernia repair: an analysis of 20, 004 patients from the herniamed registry [^114FYjd6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

After mesh-based inguinal hernia repair 10–12% of patients experience at least a level of moderate pain that impacts daily activities. Chronic pain is defined as any pain reported by the patient at or beyond 3 months postoperatively. More than one-quarter of these patients (2–4%) have moderate to severe pain. Risk factors for chronic postoperative inguinal pain include young age, female gender, high preoperative pain, early high postoperative pain, recurrent hernia, and open hernia repair.

In all statements in the guidelines of the international hernia societies, laparo-endoscopic techniques are associated with less chronic pain than the Lichtenstein repair. However, after laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia repair, 2–5% of patients may still suffer from persistent pain influencing everyday activities, and about 0.4% are referred to pain clinics.

On the basis of three meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials mesh fixation in total extraperitoneal patch plasty (TEP) can only be recommended in large medial/direct (EHS MIII) hernias.

In the Guidelines of the International Endohernia Society, a recommendation is given for consideration of non-fixation of the mesh in transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair in types LI, II and MI, II (EHS classification). For TAPP repair of larger defects (LIII, MIII), the mesh should be fixed. In TAPP inguinal hernia repair, mesh fixation is still used in 66.1% of all primary unilateral cases in men.

Considering the fact that five meta-analyses compared non-penetrating vs. mechanical mesh fixation, high-quality evidence could be expected. However, the meta-analyses can only conclude that the evidence is mostly of low or moderate quality, or that more high-quality multicenter studies are needed. In view of the guidelines, fibrin glue should be considered for fixation to minimize the risk of postoperative acute and chronic pain.

In a nationwide registry-based study, no differences were found in the frequency of recurrence and chronic pain between permanent and no/non-permanent fixation of the mesh in endoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Another registry-based study from the Danish Hernia Database also found no difference in chronic pain after mesh fixation with fibrin glue vs. tacks in TAPP inguinal hernia repair.

The following analysis of data from the Herniamed Registry now investigates the influencing factors for chronic pain in male patients after primary, unilateral inguinal hernia repair in TAPP technique.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^1156iKg1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Centralization

The treatment of patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery should be considered centralized. In Germany, dedicated hernia centers have been established. The specialized management of the patients with this pain should be considered as an expert area. Centralized evaluation and treatment would also allow for proper data collection and high volume research. In Denmark, these patients are all referred to one clinic, which has resulted in good data collection and a uniform treatment of the patients.

### The incidence and success of treatment for severe chronic groin pain after open, transabdominal preperitoneal, and totally extraperitoneal hernia repair [^113ejN5j]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic groin pain (CGP) is a significant cause of postoperative morbidity after inguinal hernia repair. Open, transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP), and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair are all commonly performed methods of herniorrhaphy. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of attendance at a chronic pain clinic (CPC) for CGP after open, TAPP or TEP repair.

Methods

A retrospective review of all inguinal hernia repairs between January 1997 and December 2006 identified patients attending the CPC for CGP post-herniorrhaphy. In this study CGP post-herniorrhaphy was defined as pain that limited daily activities despite simple analgesia thereby requiring referral to the specialist CPC following surgical review.

Results

A total of 8513 patients underwent 9607 inguinal hernia repairs; 6497 (75.5%) were open, 1916 (22.3%) were TAPP, and 198 (2.3%) were TEP. Of these, 46 (0.71%) open, 22 (1.15%) TAPP, and 6 (3.03%) TEP repairs required attendance at CPC. A statistically significant difference in frequency of CPC attendance following laparoscopic versus open (P = 0.008), TEP versus open (P ≤ 0.001), and TEP versus TAPP repair (P = 0.027) was observed. After an average of 1 year, 69% of patients were discharged symptom-free from the CPC. In 16%, CGP resolved prior to CPC attendance.

Conclusions

In contrast to previous reports, laparoscopic hernia repair is associated with a greater frequency of attendance at CPC than open repair, a finding that merits further investigation. Of those requiring treatment, the majority were discharged pain-free after an average of 1 year.

### Somatosensory outcomes following Re-surgery in persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair: a prospective observational study [^113frf1i]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The pathophysiologic data indicate that the beneficial effects of re-surgery on pain and functional outcomes in persistent pain after groin hernia repair are attributed to "meshectomy" and selective "neurectomy", leading to the removal of the peripheral pain generator and a loss of nerve fiber function, respectively. See Table 5 for a qualitative conclusion of the study findings.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^112EC3kM]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Recommended timing for surgical treatment of chronic postherniorrhaphy pain not responding to nonsurgical management is 6 months to 1 year after the original hernia repair. A systematic and thorough preoperative evaluation to identify the specific etiologies of pain is imperative. This assessment should include symptomatology, review of the prior operative report for technique (specifically, type of repair, type of mesh used, position of the mesh, method of fixation, and nerve handling), imaging to assess for meshoma or other anatomic abnormality, and response with prior interventions. Neuropathic pain isolated to the inguinal distribution, that was not present prior to the original operation, and with improvement from diagnostic and therapeutic nerve blocks has the highest likelihood of improvement with operative neurectomy.

Operative management for pain after inguinal surgery has been reported as early as 1942 with Mageedescribing genitofemoral causalgia as a source for post-inguinal surgery pain. Selective IIN, IHN, and GFN neurolysis or neurectomy, removal of mesh and fixation material, and revision of the prior herniorrhaphy are common options for treatment.–Neurolysis, which does not address ultrastructural changes of nerve fibers, has limited efficacy and is not recommended. Simple removal of entrapping sutures or fixating devices while leaving the injured nerves behind is also inadequate. Selective single or double neurectomy may be effective for some patients but does not address ultrastructural changes of seemingly normal appearing nerves during reoperation.–From a technical perspective, reoperating in the scarred field becomes increasingly more difficult and morbid for subsequent remedial operations. Anatomically, the significant variation and cross-innervation of the inguinal nerves in the retroperitoneum and inguinal canal make selective neurectomy less reliable. Triple neurectomy of the IIN, IHN, and GFN, described in our institute in 1995, is currently a universally accepted surgical treatment for neuropathic pain refractory to conservative measures and is arguably the most effective option. Our experience has included over 650 patients utilizing an open approach with an over 85% success rate and 37 cases using a laparoscopic retroperitoneal approach with a 92% success rate. Operative neurectomy in conjunction with removal of meshoma, when present, provides effective relief in the majority of patients with refractory inguinodynia.

### Somatosensory outcomes following Re-surgery in persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair: a prospective observational study [^111RrEph]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Persistent severe pain occurring in the aftermath of a surgical procedure is frequently associated with significant impairment of physical and psycho-social functions. After groin hernia repair (GHR), 2–4% of patients develop persistent severe pain. The GHR procedure, previously considered belonging to "minor" surgeries, qualifies as a rather complex procedure performed in a territory with a high density of nerve fibers, accommodating essential functions for locomotion and reproduction. More than 20 million repairs are performed annually worldwide, and consequently, it is estimated that 400.000–800.000 patients each year will develop persistent severe pain after the groin hernia repair (PSPG). Management of PSPG is medically challenging and may require re-surgery with mesh removal and selective neurectomy. After re-surgery for pain after open primary GHR, a potential pain-relieving effect, as well as an improvement of the deteriorated physical functions, has been demonstrated.

Quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) is an investigational psychophysiological tool with the potential to uncover the putative pathophysiological substrate in PSPG, ie, neuropathic and inflammatory constituents. The cutaneous thermal and mechanical stimulation modalities may preferentially indicate a neuropathic origin of pain, while the deep mechanical stimulation by pressure algometry may preferentially uncover an inflammatory origin of pain. The QST method may also facilitate the quantitation of changes induced by the re-surgery. Since re-surgery is a potential neuroablative procedure, essentially performed in previously damaged tissue, it is of interest to examine the extent of neurological perturbations, ie, "loss" and "gain" of sensory functions and the relation to clinical outcome measures.

The authors are only aware of one previous PSPG-study (n = 21) finding that re-surgery, including meshectomy and selective neurectomy, was associated with increased pressure pain thresholds, decreased pain ratings, and improved pain-related functional measures. The objectives of the current study, comparing pre with post-re-surgery data of patients with PSPG and an inflammatory "component" indicated by blunt pressure algometry, were to perform a more detailed analysis of the quantitative somatosensory data regarding "loss" and "gain" of sensory functions and their relation to clinical outcome measures using a threefold larger cohort.

### Ilioinguinal nerve neurectomy is better than preservation in lichtenstein hernia repair: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^1147fBSA]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of chronic groin pain (primary outcome) and alterations of sensitivity (secondary outcome) after Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair, comparing neurectomy with ilioinguinal nerve preservation surgery.

Summary background data

The exact cause of chronic groin postoperative pain after mesh inguinal hernia repair is usually unclear. Section of the ilioinguinal nerve (neurectomy) may reduce postoperative chronic pain.

Methods

We followed PRISMA guidelines to identify randomized studies reporting comparative outcomes of neurectomy versus ilioinguinal nerve preservation surgery during Lichtenstein hernia repairs. Studies were identified by searching in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from April 2020. The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was submitted and accepted from PROSPERO: CRD420201610.

Results

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 16 RCTs were included and 1550 patients were evaluated: 756 patients underwent neurectomy (neurectomy group) vs 794 patients underwent ilioinguinal nerve preservation surgery (nerve preservation group). All included studies analyzed Lichtenstein hernia repair. The majority of the new studies and data comes from a relatively narrow geographic region; other bias of this meta-analysis is the suitability of pooling data for many of these studies.

A statistically significant percentage of patients with prosthetic inguinal hernia repair had reduced groin pain at 6 months after surgery at 8.94% (38/425) in the neurectomy group versus 25.11% (113/450) in the nerve preservation group [relative risk (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28–0.54; Z = 5.60 (P < 0.00001)]. Neurectomy did not significantly increase the groin paresthesia 6 months after surgery at 8.5% (30/353) in the neurectomy group versus 4.5% (17/373) in the nerve preservation group [RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.94–2.80; Z = 1.74 (P = 0.08)]. At 12 months after surgery, there is no advantage of neurectomy over chronic groin pain; no significant differences were found in the 12-month postoperative groin pain rate at 9% (9/100) in the neurectomy group versus 17.85% (20/112) in the inguinal nerve preservation group [RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24–1.05; Z = 1.83 (P = 0.07)]. One study (115 patients) reported data about paresthesia at 12 months after surgery (7.27%, 4/55 in neurectomy group vs. 5%, 3/60 in nerve preservation group) and results were not significantly different between the two groups [RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.34, 6.21; Z = 0.51 (P = 0.61)]. The subgroup analysis of the studies that identified the IIN showed a significant reduction of the 6th month evaluation of pain in both groups and confirmed the same trend in favor of neurectomy reported in the previous overall analysis: statistically significant reduction of pain 6 months after surgery at 3.79% (6/158) in the neurectomy group versus 14.6% (26/178) in the nerve preservation group [RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13–0.63; Z = 3.10 (P = 0.002)].

Conclusion

Ilioinguinal nerve identification in Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair is the fundamental step to reduce or avoid postoperative pain. Prophylactic ilioinguinal nerve neurectomy seems to offer some advantages concerning pain in the first 6th month postoperative period, although it might be possible that the small number of cases contributed to the insignificancy regarding paresthesia and hypoesthesia.

Nowadays, prudent surgeons should discuss with patients and their families the uncertain benefits and the potential risks of neurectomy before performing the hernioplasty.

### Reoperation for recurrence after groin hernia repair in adolescents: a nationwide register-based cohort study [^112z3WKX]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonmesh repair may be sufficient for primary groin hernia repair in adolescents which could have clinical implications as the evidence on mesh‐related complications is conflicting. For young patients, postoperative chronic pain may be the most worrisome complication after hernia surgery — a concern also raised by surgeons in relation to mesh‐based repairs. For patients experiencing postoperative chronic pain, management can be difficult, escalating from an initial wait‐and‐see strategy to systemic painkillers, injections, and ultimately surgical treatment. The cause of postoperative chronic pain is probably multifactorial, and the pathogenesis may vary between individuals, but the implantation of synthetic meshes in human tissue is a concern. Data have indicated that open mesh repair for inguinal hernia may cause postoperative chronic pain in young patients, and the recently updated international guideline on groin hernia management suggests that simple annulorrhaphy could be sufficient in young men with small indirect inguinal hernia. Still, evidence on chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair in the general adult population has not found a difference between mesh and nonmesh repair. In theory, implanting a foreign material may be troublesome in growing tissue. The long‐term tension on the mesh and surrounding tissue occurring as the groin and pelvis grow during adolescence, and as the mesh shrinks with time, may contribute to chronic pain. Additionally, although no impact on fertility has been shown in adults, concerns remain regarding potential effects in young male patients after mesh implantation, which, to our knowledge, has not been studied in adolescents. To improve our understanding of potential long‐term harms after groin hernia repair in adolescents, future studies focusing on patient‐reported outcomes, including postoperative chronic pain, in young patients are encouraged.

### The association of permanent versus absorbable fixation on developing chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair [^116nMVUs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

In the USA, an estimated 800,000 inguinal hernia operations are done annually, with up to 1 in 4 men and 1 in 30 women undergoing a repair in their lifetime. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, the trend has shifted toward laparoscopic approaches, such as the totally extraperitoneal (TEP) or trans-abdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair techniques, both of which commonly include placement and fixation of mesh. While postoperative complications are rare, post-herniorrhaphy groin pain is a relatively common adverse outcome.

However, the etiology of this pain is not well understood and is likely multifactorial in nature. Age, gender, BMI, preoperative pain level, hernia size, presence of postoperative complications and history of prior inguinal hernia repair have all previously been identified as potential predictors for postoperative pain. Additionally, there exists controversy surrounding the impact of fixation on post-herniorrhaphy groin pain. Permanent titanium tacks have historically been used, but a number of reported complications and their possible association with severe postoperative pain has generated concern regarding the type of tacks that should be used for fixation. Though few studies have definitively identified a significant effect of permanent fixation on pain, the theoretical concern has led to the development of more costly alternatives, such as absorbable tacks.

The effect of permanent versus absorbable fixation on chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain after inguinal hernia repair has been assessed in only a handful of studies with small patient cohorts. Comparatively, it has been evaluated in more studies in incisional or ventral hernias. The data there has not shown an increased risk of chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain with permanent tacks and therefore, no conclusive data exist to justify the use of the more expensive absorbable tacks for fixation. Still, randomized controlled trials were relatively small and lacked long-term follow-up of pain. We aim in this study to compare the rates of chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair between permanent versus absorbable tack fixation at maximum follow-up of a large cohort of patients.

### Outcome of patients with severe chronic pain following repair of groin hernia [^1147ZfRW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is the most serious long-term complication that can occur after repair of a groin hernia. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of patients who report severe or very severe pain 3 months after groin hernia repair.

Methods

This was a population-based study of all patients who underwent repair of a groin hernia between April 1998 and March 1999 in Scotland. All received a postal questionnaire 3 months after hernia repair and those who reported severe or very severe pain at the operation site were asked to complete a further questionnaire 2.5 years later. The main outcome measure included the number of patients with persistent pain and the effect of pain on daily activities and quality of life.

Results

Of 5506 patients who underwent repair of a groin hernia, 4062 (74 per cent) returned the first questionnaire and 125 (3 per cent) reported severe or very severe pain. Eight-six (72 per cent) of 120 patients (five had died or could not be contacted at the original address) replied to the second questionnaire; 61 (71 per cent) still reported pain, which was severe or very severe pain in 22 (26 per cent) and mild or very mild in 39 (45 per cent). Twenty-nine (48 per cent) sought further medical help from their general practitioner or surgeon. Nine (15 per cent) attended a pain clinic while five (8 per cent) had further surgery. Chronic pain had significant effects (P < 0.001) on all daily activities including walking, work, sleep, relationships with other people, mood and general enjoyment of life.

Conclusion

Chronic pain persists in most patients who report severe or very severe pain at 3 months after hernia repair, and has a significant effect on the patients' daily activities and quality of life.

### Risk factors for long-term pain after hernia surgery [^116DKDD7]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of residual pain 2 to 3 years after hernia surgery, to identify factors associated with its occurrence, and to assess the consequences for the patient.

Summary Background Data

Iatrogenic chronic pain is a neglected problem that may totally annul the benefits from hernia repair.

Methods

From the population-based Swedish Hernia Register 3000 patients aged 15 to 85 years were sampled from the 9280 patients registered as having undergone a primary groin hernia operation in the year 2000. Of these, the 2853 patients still alive in 2003 were requested to fill in a postal questionnaire.

Results

After 2 reminders, 2456 patients (86%), 2299 men and 157 women responded. In response to a question about "worst perceived pain last week", 758 patients (31%) reported pain to some extent. In 144 cases (6%), the pain interfered with daily activities. Age below median, a high level of pain before the operation, and occurrence of any postoperative complication were found to significantly and independently predict long-term pain in multivariate logistic analysis when "worst pain last week" was used as outcome variable. The same variables, along with a repair technique using anterior approach, were found to predict long-term pain with "pain right now" as outcome variable.

Conclusion

Pain that is at least partly disabling appears to occur more often than recurrences. The prevalence of long-term pain can be reduced by preventing postoperative complications. The impact of repair technique on the risk of long-term pain shown in our study should be further assessed in randomized controlled trials.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^1135xHQE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with self-fixated meshes: a randomized controlled trial [^111ZGWGD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Hernia in the inguinal area is fairly common; approximately 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia during their lifetime. Hernia treatment mainly involves surgery, with more than 20 million procedures performed annually. Multiple treatment options exist for inguinal hernia surgery, including open or laparoscopic techniques. According to guidelines, usage of mesh is recommended both in open and laparoscopic procedures as it reduces hernia recurrences. However, mesh is associated with both acute and chronic post-operative pain.

Laparoscopic techniques include transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal repair (TEP). In TAPP, the procedure is performed through the abdominal cavity, while in TEP the preperitoneal space is entered directly. Both TAPP and TEP have good results with low complication and recurrence rates and rapid recovery after surgery. Guidelines recommend both techniques for laparoscopic hernia surgery. Both techniques have comparable results regarding chronic pain and quality of life after surgery. In laparoscopic procedures, mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space to cover the myopectineal orifice and posterior part of the inguinal area. The mesh can be fixated by tacks, glue or sutures. Alternatively, the mesh is not fixated at all or a self-fixating mesh can be used. Studies recommend avoiding tacks, as they appear to cause more post-operative pain than glue or non-fixation.

### Open preperitoneal techniques versus lichtenstein repair for elective inguinal hernias [^115hBXRE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current techniques for inguinal hernia repair show similar recurrence rates. Therefore, recurrence is no longer the main issue discussed when considering improving the current standards for groin hernia repair. Post surgical chronic pain represents a major, largely unrecognised clinical problem. Consequently, there is a need to not only decrease an extensive dissection in the inguinal canal with less manipulation of the inguinal nerves, but also to minimize the interaction between the mesh and major surrounding structures. As a result, placing the mesh in the preperitoneal space is a valuable option.

Objectives

To compare elective open preperitoneal mesh techniques with Lichtenstein mesh repair in terms of pain.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1947 to October 2009), and ISI WEB OF KNOWLEDGE (1900 to April 2011) for randomized controlled trials. The reference list of identified trials, the World Journal of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery, and relevant book chapters were handsearched for useful trials. If we found relevant ongoing trials using national and international trials registers, we contacted the main investigators for further information. The language of the trials was not an exclusion criterion.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled studies comparing elective open preperitoneal mesh techniques with Lichtenstein mesh repair.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted the pre-specified data and assessed the methodological quality using domain-based evaluation. Missing information was obtained by contacting the original investigators using open-ended questions.

Main Results

Three eligible trials involving 569 patients were identified. Due to methodological limitations in the included studies, there was considerable variation in the results of acute (risk range 38.67% to 96.51%) and chronic pain (risk range 7.83% to 40.47%) across the control groups. Therefore, meta-analysis was not performed but the results of the outcomes in the individual trials were compared. Two trials involving 322 patients reported less chronic pain after preperitoneal repair (relative risk (RR) 0.18, number needed to treat (NNT) 8; RR 0.51, NNT 5), whereas one trial, including 247 patients, described more chronic pain after this repair (RR 1.17, NNT 77). The same trials favoured the preperitoneal technique concerning acute pain (RR 0.17, NNT 3; RR 0.78, NNT 7), whereas in the third trial it was almost omnipresent and thus comparable in both intervention arms (RR 0.997, NNT 333). Early and late hernia recurrence rates were similar across the studies, whereas contrasting results were reported for other early outcomes as infection and hematoma. No late mesh infection occurred in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Both techniques are valid as they result in similar low recurrence rates. Evaluation of pain results in the individual trials shows some evidence that preperitoneal repair causes less or comparable acute and chronic pain compared to the Lichtenstein procedure. We emphasize the need for homogeneous high quality randomized trials comparing elective preperitoneal inguinal hernia techniques and Lichtenstein repair in terms of chronic pain.

### Is chronic post-herniorrhaphy pain always chronic? A literature review [^111ThsZd]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Since the main indication for hernia surgery is to reduce pain, great care in decision-making should be taken in order not to cause iatrogenic pain following a procedure undertaken on vague indications. Patients who are at risk for developing CPSP (young patients, women, patients perceiving intense preoperative pain, patients with tendency to develop anxiety and depression, and patients with previous history of high sensibility to nociceptive pain) should be identified before the decision to perform surgery is taken. Even if some of the symptoms may resolve with time, great care should be taken not to cause iatrogenic pain that may persist for many years.

### Association of mesh and fixation options with reoperation risk after laparoscopic groin hernia surgery: a Swedish hernia registry study of 25, 190 totally extraperitoneal and transabdominal preperitoneal repairs [^115X6xSx]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

With a growing interest in reducing chronic postoperative pain, 2 potential improvements were introduced about 2 decades ago: lightweight mesh (LWM) and atraumatic fibrin glue fixation. Whether these modifications might influence reoperation risk, and if so, in which direction and to which extent, have previously not been conclusively investigated.

The HerniaSurge Group in 2018 compiled the current evidence concerning groin hernias in the extensive International Guidelines for Hernia Management. These guidelines are endorsed by affected surgical societies and are now widely acknowledged.

Concerning risks for recurrence after TEP/TAPP, HerniaSurge states that there are no relevant long-term differences between standard (aka "heavyweight") and lightweight meshes. In contrast, a large RCT with a 5-year follow-up published in 2018 and more recent meta-analyses have shown that LWM for laparoscopic groin hernia repairs confers a higher recurrence risk without reducing chronic postoperative pain. - However, these studies have not illuminated whether different fixation modalities might modify the less satisfactory outcome with LWM.

On TEP/TAPP, HerniaSurge favors glue fixation instead of staples and tacks (hereafter denoted "tacks" only), however, solely for reducing early postoperative pain. Foremost, the guidelines state that nonfixation will suffice in almost all cases, except for large medial hernias.

Notably, the HerniaSurge statements and recommendations about mesh and fixation in TEP/TAPP are generally based on relatively low levels of evidence; hence, further research is warranted. There is a knowledge gap concerning how different mesh and fixation options interact.

We hypothesized that when evaluating the influence of mesh type and fixation method on the risk of recurrence, it is insufficient to study these 2 variables separately. Rather, each mesh/fixation combination should be assessed as an entity.

The current study was designed to detect relative differences in risk for reoperation associated with the type of flat mesh, depending on the type of fixation (tacks vs fibrin glue vs nonfixation).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to management of postoperative pain, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider continuing pharmacologic and interventional measures, including therapeutic injection therapy, for at least 3 months (minimum of 6 months after hernia surgery).

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^1138UKLX]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Interventions and management of chronic pain

Authors of a recent review aimed to characterize management and treatment strategies for chronic postoperative pain; however, the authors of the review concluded that there was a lack of evidence, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding effectiveness or harm. A problem might be to investigate all interventions to treat all postoperative chronic pain conditions, and it is likely that each of the different procedures resulting in chronic pain needs to have their own specific treatment and diagnostic algorithm.

For chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery, a range of interventions can be used to treat or manage the chronic pain. Interventions include watchful waiting, pharmacological treatments, local anesthetic blocks, sensory stimulation or ablation of nerves, and surgery (mesh removal, reoperation for recurrence, and neurectomy).

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112hQ1U4]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) — definition, burden, presentation, and evaluation are described as follows: "CSCP or chronic testicular pain or chronic orchialgia is defined as unilateral scrotal pain interfering with activities of daily living that has persisted for greater than three months of time", and it "is usually diagnosed after excluding other potential causes (e.g., testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, abscess, testicular mass, varicocele)". The condition's impact is noted as "CSCP constitutes approximately 2.5% to 4.8% of all urology visits and is believed to affect over 100,000 men annually". Patients often have tenderness and neuropathic features: "The pain is commonly described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord appreciated on physical examination", and "Neuropathic changes such as hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia in the region of the groin may accompany these findings", with a fluctuating course — "The pain typically waxes and wanes". Care "requires a multi-disciplinary approach to management", and "Managing patient expectations through supportive counseling during this path is important to overall success". For workup, "potential underlying causes should be ruled out with a thorough physical exam and detailed history", and examples include "post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS), post-inguinal hernia repair, pain caused by trauma, after abdominal surgery, radiation, and radicular pain from spinal or sacral issues".

Pathogenesis

The cause of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery can be multifactorial and often it is not possible to point to a distinct reason for the pain in a specific patient. Pain can be caused by perioperative injury to nerves or nerves that are being stuck and damaged by sutures or perforated by fixation devices such as tacks. Nerves can also be trapped in a "meshoma", which is when the mesh has shrunk with folding and wrinkling making a ball of mesh material, the so-called meshoma. It is reasonable to imagine that some shrinking of the mesh, which is seen in most patients, can also entrap a nerve and thereby cause chronic pain. Pain can also be caused by the inflammation process around the mesh. It is sometimes not possible to diagnose the specific cause of pain in the individual patient. Furthermore, the distinction between neuropathic pain (pain caused by damage to nerves) and nociceptive pain (pain caused by the release of substances due to tissue damage or damage to organs) can be difficult. Some patients might have groin pain from other sources than their hernia repair such as hip pathology or pubalgia. Furthermore, some patients might have received a hernia repair due to these other pathologies, resulting in symptoms similar to a hernia.

When investigating the patient with chronic postoperative pain, it is important to look for a possible recurrence since the recurrence could be the reason for pain or discomfort. If a recurrence is present, it is indicated to repair the recurrence and hopefully that will relieve the complaints and discomfort of the patient. However, care should be taken when repairing recurrent hernias if there is also signs of neuropathic pain, since the patient might at the same time have damaged nerves. If there are damaged nerves, repair of the recurrence might not solve the problem for, and it is therefore recommended to also consider a neurectomy at the same time.

### Somatosensory outcomes following Re-surgery in persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair: a prospective observational study [^111nKsze]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Synopsis

The current study examined somatosensory and clinical outcomes after re-surgery in patients (n = 60) suffering from persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair. Regarding the somatosensory outcomes, first, a "loss" of non-nociceptive thermal and mechanical sensory function was observed, demonstrating that re-surgery was associated with an enhanced deafferentation compared to the primary surgery. Second, the "gain" in mechanical deep nociceptive function, generated by the primary surgery, was attenuated by the dual mechanisms of the re-surgery; mitigation of the inflammatory drive by the meshectomy, and deafferentation, by the selective neurectomy. The study results corroborated an improvement in clinical outcomes following the re-surgical procedure by decreasing pain severity and increasing ADL-outcome.

Neurectomy Issue

Neurectomy in GHR procedures has been discussed as a prophylactical measure preventing the development of PSPG or as a selective procedure in the management of PSPG. While prophylactic neurectomy has been debated, it is presently not recommended. Other pain-relieving procedure includes triple neurectomy by a laparoscopic extraperitoneal approachor, as in the current study, selective neurectomy of damaged nerves in the surgical field (cf. "Re-Surgery: Clinical Outcomes").

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

Surgical pain management

While the majority of patients with CPIP can be managed with pharmacologic, interventional, and behavioral measures, those refractory to a systematic regimen of diagnostic and interventional measures may be considered for operative remediation. Successful outcomes, however, are entirely dependent upon choosing patients with discrete, neuroanatomic problems that may be corrected with surgery. Failure of conservative measures, in and of itself, is not an indication for further surgery. There is no level 1 or 2 evidence regarding the operative management of inguinodynia, and best available recommendations are derived from case reports, case series, expert opinion, and expert consensus. Development of inguinodynia is independent of the method of hernia repair, but an in-depth understanding of the causes of pain, groin neuroanatomy, and technical aspects of the initial operation are necessary to successfully manage these patients. These factors determine the operative options available to address chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair.

The neuroanatomy of the groin is complex and highly variable from the retroperitoneal lumbar plexus to the terminal branches exiting through the inguinal canal. Understanding the location of potential nerve injury is crucial. In front of transversalis fascia, the IIN, the visible and intramuscular segment of the IHN, and the inguinal segment of the genital branch of the GFN must be considered. These structures may potentially be injured during open anterior repairs (tissue repair, Lichtenstein, PHS [prolene hernia system], and plug) and from mesh fixation during laparoscopic repair (TEP [totally extraperitoneal] and TAPP [transabdominal preperitoneal]). Behind the transversalis fascia within the preperitoneal space, the main trunk of the genitofemoral and the preperitoneal segment of genital branch of GFN are at risk. These must be considered during open preperitoneal repair (plug, PHS, and Kugel) and laparoscopic repair (TEP and TAPP). Finally, injury to the nerves within the retroperitoneal space including the main trunk of the GFN over the psoas muscle and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve must also be considered after open and laparoscopic posterior repair.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^112FcxEt]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Body weight, hernia defect size, hernia defect location, and mesh size are not related to acute and chronic pain. In the current literature on endoscopic groin hernia repair, insufficient or no data are available about the relationship between pain and the management of strangulated and incarcerated hernias, port defects, scrotal hernias, and cord lipomas. Although several publications have reported on pain and nerve management in open groin hernia surgery [48–53], no data are available on nerve manipulation and pain in endoscopic hernia repair.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^112TZE7B]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed worldwide. With the success of modern hernia repair techniques, recurrence rates have significantly declined, with a lower incidence than the development of chronic postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain (CPIP). The avoidance of CPIP is arguably the most important clinical outcome and has the greatest impact on patient satisfaction, health care utilization, societal cost, and quality of life. The etiology of CPIP is multifactorial, with overlapping neuropathic and nociceptive components contributing to this complex syndrome. Treatment is often challenging, and no definitive treatment algorithm exists. Multidisciplinary management of this complex problem improves outcomes, as treatment must be individualized. Current medical, pharmacologic, interventional, and surgical management strategies are reviewed.

### Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair without mesh fixation, early results of a large randomised clinical trial [^116PAW1o]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A new persistent groin pain is reported by a significant number of patients following laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernia repair (TEP). Mesh fixation has been implicated as a possible cause, but is widely considered essential for mesh stabilization and early recurrence prevention. This study investigates whether any association exists between mesh fixation by metal tacks and the incidence of new groin pain or early hernia recurrence.

Methods

A prospective multicenter double-blinded randomised trial was conducted between December 2004 and January 2006. Standardized TEP repair was performed with a rectangular 10 x 15cm polypropylene mesh. Hernia were randomized to either mesh fixation by metal tacks or left entirely unfixated. Clinical review by physical examination was performed by a separate blinded surgeon after a minimum of six months, with another review planned after two years. The incidence of new groin pain and recurrence were compared.

Results

Five hundred herniae in 360 patients were entered into the study. At the first wave of clinical follow-up (median eight, range 6–13 postoperative months) a new pain was reported by 38 versus 23% (p = 0.003), occurring at least once a week in 22 versus 15% (p = 0.049), or several times per week in 16 versus 8% (p = 0.009) for fixated versus unfixated repairs, respectively. Patients with bilateral repairs were five times more likely to report the unfixated side being more comfortable (p = 0.006). There was one recurrence in the fixated group (1/247) whilst none have yet occurred in the unfixated group. Fixation increased operative costs by approximately 375 AUD.

Conclusion

Mesh fixation in TEP is associated with increased operative cost and chronic pain but no difference in the risk of hernia recurrence at six months was observed.

### Ilioinguinal nerve neurectomy is better than preservation in lichtenstein hernia repair: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^116ewbLX]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of chronic groin pain (primary outcome) and alterations of sensitivity (secondary outcome) after Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair, comparing neurectomy with ilioinguinal nerve preservation surgery. The exact cause of chronic groin postoperative pain after mesh inguinal hernia repair is usually unclear. Section of the ilioinguinal nerve (neurectomy) may reduce postoperative chronic pain.

Methods

We followed PRISMA guidelines to identify randomized studies reporting comparative outcomes of neurectomy versus ilioinguinal nerve preservation surgery during Lichtenstein hernia repairs. Studies were identified by searching in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from April 2020. The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was submitted and accepted from PROSPERO: CRD420201610.

Results

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 16 RCTs were included and 1550 patients were evaluated: 756 patients underwent neurectomy (neurectomy group) vs 794 patients underwent ilioinguinal nerve preservation surgery (nerve preservation group). All included studies analyzed Lichtenstein hernia repair. The majority of the new studies and data comes from a relatively narrow geographic region; other bias of this meta-analysis is the suitability of pooling data for many of these studies. A statistically significant percentage of patients with prosthetic inguinal hernia repair had reduced groin pain at 6 months after surgery at 8.94% (38/425) in the neurectomy group versus 25.11% (113/450) in the nerve preservation group [relative risk (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28–0.54; Z = 5.60 (P < 0.00001)]. Neurectomy did not significantly increase the groin paresthesia 6 months after surgery at 8.5% (30/353) in the neurectomy group versus 4.5% (17/373) in the nerve preservation group [RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.94–2.80; Z = 1.74 (P = 0.08)]. At 12 months after surgery, there is no advantage of neurectomy over chronic groin pain; no significant differences were found in the 12-month postoperative groin pain rate at 9% (9/100) in the neurectomy group versus 17.85% (20/112) in the inguinal nerve preservation group [RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24–1.05; Z = 1.83 (P = 0.07)]. One study (115 patients) reported data about paresthesia at 12 months after surgery (7.27%, 4/55 in neurectomy group vs. 5%, 3/60 in nerve preservation group) and results were not significantly different between the two groups [RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.34, 6.21; Z = 0.51 (P = 0.61)]. The subgroup analysis of the studies that identified the IIN showed a significant reduction of the 6th month evaluation of pain in both groups and confirmed the same trend in favor of neurectomy reported in the previous overall analysis: statistically significant reduction of pain 6 months after surgery at 3.79% (6/158) in the neurectomy group versus 14.6% (26/178) in the nerve preservation group [RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13–0.63; Z = 3.10 (P = 0.002)].

Conclusion

Ilioinguinal nerve identification in Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair is the fundamental step to reduce or avoid postoperative pain. Prophylactic ilioinguinal nerve neurectomy seems to offer some advantages concerning pain in the first 6th month postoperative period, although it might be possible that the small number of cases contributed to the insignificancy regarding paresthesia and hypoesthesia. Nowadays, prudent surgeons should discuss with patients and their families the uncertain benefits and the potential risks of neurectomy before performing the hernioplasty.

Definitions and types of pain

Chronic (postoperative) pain has been defined as pain lasting at least 2–3 months (after surgery), but modifications are proposed to this timeframe. A group of experts in hernia surgery and chronic pain has suggested modifying the definition for chronic pain after hernia repair as pain lasting at least 6 months after operation. The reason for this extended period of time is because the inflammation around the mesh is still ongoing after 3 months, and there is a chance that some patients will improve substantially from 3 to 6 months postoperatively.

### Open versus laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernia: an overview of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials [^116GycxG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernia has a lifetime incidence of 27% in men and 3% in women. Surgery is the recommended treatment, but there is no consensus on the best method. Open repair is most popular, but there are concerns about the risk of chronic groin pain. Laparoscopic repair is increasingly accepted due to the lower risk of chronic pain, although its recurrence rate is still unclear. The aim of this overview is to compare the risk of recurrence and chronic groin pain in laparoscopic versus open repair for inguinal hernia.

Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Only reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults published in English were included. Conference proceedings and editorials were excluded. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 checklist. Two outcomes were considered: hernia recurrence and chronic pain.

Results

Twenty-one systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. Laparoscopic repair was associated with a lower risk of chronic groin pain compared with open repair. In the four systematic reviews assessing any laparoscopic versus any open repairs, laparoscopic repair was associated with a statistically significant (range: 26–46%) reduction in the odds or risk of chronic pain. Most reviews showed no difference in recurrence rates between laparoscopic and open repairs, regardless of the types of repair considered or the types of hernia that were studied, but most reviews had wide confidence intervals and we cannot rule out clinically important effects favouring either type of repair.

Conclusion

Meta-analyses suggest that laparoscopic repairs have a lower incidence of chronic groin pain than open repair, but there is no evidence of differences in recurrence rates between laparoscopic and open repairs.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^112whGkG]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The optimal management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery should begin with a thorough clinical examination to rule out other causes of chronic pain and to rule out a recurrence. If other causes of chronic groin pain have been excluded and the groin pain is caused by the inguinal hernia repair, a scaled approach is recommended. Initially, watchful waiting can be tried if it can be tolerated by the patient and then systemic pain killers, escalating to blocks, and surgery as the final option. Surgery should include mesh removal and triple neurectomy following anterior approaches or mesh and tack removal following a posterior approach. These procedures should be performed by experts in the field. There is a need for new developments and evidence-based guidelines, and this will require centralization of treatment in order to gather the necessary data to support future best practice guidelines.

### Ultrasound guided peripheral nerve stimulation implant for management of intractable pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy [^116c71CG]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common operations performed worldwide. Intractable pain following this operation is a potential debilitating complication. The exact etiology of this complex pain is unknown and the treatment of chronic pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy can be a difficult task for both the patient and the clinician.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are to identify the ability of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation to decrease post inguinal herniorrhaphy pain, increase patients' functionality, and decrease pain medication use.

Study Design

Three patients with intractable pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy were included in this case series. Two patients had right-sided inguinal repair and one had a left-sided repair. Pain in these patients all began after the inguinal repair and had an average pain duration of 3.4 years after surgery. All 3 patients had been treated with multiple pain management modalities without significant pain improvement. We will describe the clinical course of these patients who presented with chronic intractable pain. After a period of failed conservative medical management and repetitive successful nerve blocks, we decided to proceed with utilizing electrical nerve stimulation as a treatment modality.

Setting

This retrospective study was done at the university hospital and has an IRB assigned number.

Results

After careful consideration of the patients' history and physical examination and a thorough psychological assessment, we proceeded with a temporary percutaneous electrical neurostimulation that provided significant pain relief. Ultrasound guided permanent percutaneous electrical neurostimulation implant was shown to provide significant pain relief at 12-month follow-ups. We reviewed all existing pertinent medical literature related to the management of post herniorrhaphy pain. This case series adds to our current knowledge for chronic intractable post herniorrhaphy pain management.

Limitations

This study is a retrospective assessment of a new technique that was applied to a limited number of cases. It remains to be determined whether this technique is superior to the classical open surgical technique in the future. Our findings warrant further studies on the utilization of peripheral nerve stimulation with chronic post herniorrhaphy pain.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^113M1Xmt]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Chronic inguinodynia is a problem for which there is no universally accepted definition, etiology, classification, and surgical treatment. In-depth knowledge of groin neuroanatomy is critical, as the best measure to address this disabling complication is prevention by refining the technique of hernia repair. Meticulous adherence to surgical principles, with three-nerve identification, preservation, or pragmatic neurectomy during open anterior repair, decreases the incidence of chronic inguinodynia. Avoidance of the preperitoneal nerves below the iliopubic tract and limited or no mesh fixation decreases the risk of pain after laparoscopic herniorrhaphy.

Patients at high risk of developing CPIP should be identified preoperatively, and preventive multimodal analgesia and anesthesia should be given high priority. Preventive measures such as peri- and postoperative gabapentinoids or ketamine treatment, or infiltration of local anesthetic, might minimize the inflammatory cascade, decrease central sensitization, and prevent development of severe chronic pain. The recommended timing for surgical treatment of chronic postherniorrhaphy pain not responding to nonsurgical management is 6 months to 1 year after the original inguinal hernia repair. A systematic and thorough evaluation to identify the potential causes of pain is mandatory. This assessment should include symptoms, review of the prior operative report for technique, imaging to assess for meshoma or other anatomic abnormalities, and thorough conservative management with pharmacologic and interventional modalities.

All patients with CPIP should undergo multidisciplinary treatment with evaluation by a pain specialist. Pharmacologic intervention including anti-inflammatories, topical anesthetics, neuropathic medications, antidepressants, and opioid analgesics should be optimized. All patients should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic nerve block of the IIN, IHN, and GFN as appropriate. Nerve ablation and neuromodulation are promising interventional modalities that may help in the non-operative management of CPIP and may serve as adjunctive therapy for patients who have failed reoperative surgery or with centralization of pain. For patients with pain refractory to conservative measures, operative neurectomy, meshoma removal, and repair of recurrence may provide relief. A multidisciplinary, logical, stepwise approach to chronic postoperative inguinal pain will afford patients the greatest opportunity to minimize symptoms, manage pain, decrease further morbidity, and improve quality of life.

### Approach to the patient with chronic groin pain [^1117gxkW]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic postoperative inguinal pain has become a primary outcome parameter after elective inguinal hernia repair with significant consequences affecting patient productivity, employment, and quality of life. A systematic and thorough preoperative evaluation is important to identify the etiologies and types of pain. Owing to the complex nature of chronic pain, a multimodal and multidisciplinary treatment approach is recommended. Patients with chronic pain refractory to conservative measures may be considered for surgical intervention. Triple neurectomy remains the most definitive and accepted remedial operation performed and provides effective relief in the majority of patients.

Secondary Outcome Measures at 2 Weeks Stratified by Allocation Arm in the Intention-to-Treat Analysis a

The 1-year mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.81 (0.04) years in both arms. The majority of the participants reported less groin symptoms than before the operation (92 of 97 [94.8%] and 93 of 98 [94.9%] in the control and intervention arms, respectively). Overall, the mean (SD) IPQ at 1 year was 1.53 (1.1) and 1.56 (0.94) in the control and intervention arms, respectively (absolute difference = −0.03; (95% CI, −3.2 to 2.5; p = 0.81). The mean (SD) IPQ difference (Δ IPQ) between baseline and 1 year postoperatively was 1.96 (1.5) and 1.85 (1.2) in the control and intervention arms, respectively (absolute difference = 0.11; 95% CI, −2.7 to 5.0; p = 0.56); however, 1 participant still reported severe pain (IPQ score = 7) at 1-year follow-up. Participants with severe pain were reviewed a second time to differentiate more thoroughly between pain due to hernia and other possible causes of chronic groin pain. This was done by A.M. P.N. and J.L. It was concluded that most complaints presenting as groin pain were most likely musculoskeletal in origin.

### Is chronic post-herniorrhaphy pain always chronic? A literature review [^111zJ918]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The trauma inflicted by a surgical intervention sometimes results in persistent pain. In contrast to acute postoperative pain, which is a physiological reaction to tissue trauma, chronic post-surgery pain (CPSP) persists beyond the usual course of natural healing. Pain persisting at the sight of surgery beyond the usual course of natural postoperative pain usually differs in character from that suffered during the first weeks after an operation. It may be burning, tingling, or electric shock-like, and may be associated with paresthesia, hyperalgesia or allodynia. It is often neuropathic in nature, but may also be caused by chronic inflammation, tension or local compression from a dislocated mesh ("meshoma").

CPSP is a condition that has gained increased recognition in recent years. Several reports have focused on chronic pain, in particular after hernia repair.–Since the main indication for performing a hernia repair is discomfort or pain from the hernia, the risk of developing iatrogenic pain is something that must be taken into account when deciding on a procedure that could cause more harm than good. Studies on CPSP after hernia surgery have reported prevalence ranging from 0% to 54%.–There are probably several explanations for this spread such as the lack of a uniformly accepted instrument for the assessment of pain. Another factor that may have had a large influence on outcome is the timing of follow-up. Pain persisting longer than 3 months is often considered a criterion for CPSP. In most cases, however, pain gradually decreases with time.

Measurement of pain prevalence with adequate external validity requires standardized patient-related outcome measures. Standardized tools for assessment of postoperative pain include the Brief Pain Inventoryand Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. There are also instruments specifically aimed at assessing post-herniorrhaphy pain, including the Carolina Comfort Scaleand Inguinal Pain Questionnaire.

In most cases, CPSP is not constant. With time, it may progress as well as regress. Fortunately, however, there is a tendency to decrease with time. There are few studies that have explored the natural course of CPSP. An understanding of the natural course can, however, be achieved by considering the prevalence of pain at two different points in time following surgery, and in the same population. By assuming an exponential course, the halvation time can be determined using the following formula:

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^114e8w1h]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Groin hernia repairs and pain

For the initial repair of groin hernia, recommendations include use of a mesh. Dedicated centers have shown good results with nonmesh-based techniques, but the overall recommendation for routine care includes use of a mesh. Globally, the most used types of mesh-based repairs are the Lichtenstein open repair and one of the variations of the laparoscopic repair. The Lichtenstein repair is known to cause discomfort and disabling pain in some patients. The laparoscopic techniques seem to lower the risk of chronic pain but still cause chronic pain in some people.

Several potential causes of pain have been investigated for these repair methods. The role of the meshes has been investigated, and the weight of the mesh (g/m 2) has been hypothesized to influence the risk of pain. Heavyweight meshes have been compared with lightweight meshes but demonstrated no advantages for laparoscopic repairs. However, the lightweight meshes seem to lower the risk of chronic pain following the Lichtenstein repair technique. Besides meshes, the choice of fixation method for the mesh can influence the risk of pain. Glue has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of chronic pain in open mesh-based repairs, but the advantage of glue could not be found in a recent nationwide study of the laparoscopic repair.

When operating inguinal hernias, there is a risk of causing injuries that will cause pain. If there is injury to tissue, it can cause nociceptive pain, and damage to nerves can cause neuropathic pain. In order to prevent or minimize the risks of pain, surgeons always take care when performing repairs and handle tissue gently. Peroperatively, the role of identification and/or resection of nerves has been investigated in order to minimize the occurrence of chronic pain. The nerves can be in the way when placing the mesh, can be caught or injured during fixation, and can be injured by accident or by dissection in the operative field. It is recommended, in the recently published World Guidelines for inguinal hernia repair, to identify the nerves but not to do a planned resection; however, if the nerves are in the way when placing the mesh, a "pragmatic resection" is recommended.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^113gfRpf]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair is a common problem and feared complication. Up to 16% of people experience chronic pain following the repair of a groin hernia. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair based on best practice guidelines and current clinical routines. The optimal management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery should begin with a thorough clinical examination to rule out other causes of chronic pain and to rule out a recurrence. A scaled approach to treatment is recommended. Initially, watchful waiting can be tried if it can be tolerated by the patient and then systemic painkillers, escalating to blocks, and surgery as the final option. Surgery should include mesh removal and triple neurectomy following anterior approaches or mesh and tack removal following a posterior approach. The diagnosis and treatment strategies should be performed by or discussed with experts in the field.

### Chronic pain after open inguinal hernia repair: expertise-based randomized clinical trial of heavyweight or lightweight mesh [^114vWj3b]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia in men, with a lifetime risk of 27 per cent. Therefore, with estimated 20 million inguinal repairs performed each year, each improvement in surgical technique translates into substantial public health benefits.

Mesh repairs have become standard practice for inguinal hernias, as recurrence rates are lower than those associated with classical tissue repair. Because recurrence rates are now low, the focus of technical improvements has shifted to outcomes such as chronic postoperative pain, which affects up to 30 per cent of all patients after inguinal hernia repair. Chronic postoperative pain is classified by the ICD-11 as pain lasting more than 3 months after surgery. This pain is often neuropathic in character, believed to be caused by tissue and nerve trauma induced by surgical dissection, as well as inflammation and a foreign body reaction owing to the suture material and mesh.

Some studies, have reported that the use of lightweight mesh is associated with decreased postoperative chronic pain compared with heavyweight mesh at 6 months after inguinal hernia repair. However, results are conflicting, as other studies, evaluating pain 3–5 years after surgery did not show such differences. Unfortunately, there are very limited long-term data addressing this topic from RCTs.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term impact of heavyweight or lightweight mesh on chronic pain, discomfort, and recurrence rates a decade after open anterior inguinal hernia repair. It was hypothesized that the lightweight mesh group would have less pain and discomfort than the heavyweight mesh group, whereas recurrence rates would be similar in the two groups.

### Chronic pain after childhood groin hernia repair [^111mSGje]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In contrast to the well-described 10% risk of chronic pain affecting daily activities after adult groin hernia repair, chronic pain after childhood groin hernia repair has never been investigated. Studies of other childhood surgery before the age of 3 months suggest a risk of increased pain responsiveness later in life, but its potential relationship to chronic pain in adult life is unknown.

Methods

This was a nationwide detailed questionnaire study of chronic groin pain in adults having surgery for a groin hernia repair before the age of 5 years (n = 1075).

Results

The response rate was 63.3%. In the 651 patients available for analysis, pain from the operated groin was reported by 88 (13.5%) patients whereof 13 (2.0%) patients reported frequent and moderate or severe pain. Pain occurred primarily when exercising sports or other leisure activities. Patients operated on before the age of 3 months (n = 122) did not report groin pain more often or with higher intensity than other patients did.

Conclusions

Groin pain in adult patients operated on for a groin hernia in childhood is uncommon and usually mild and occurs in relation to physical activity. Operation before the age of 3 months does not increase the risk of chronic pain.

### Evaluating effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy within multimodal treatment for chronic groin pain after inguinal hernia repair [^116ypQkq]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The development of chronic groin pain after inguinal hernia repair is a complex problem with many potential factors contributing to its development. Surgical options for alleviation of symptoms are limited and only performed by a few centers dedicated to its treatment. Opportunities to apply the principles of a prehabilitation program, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), aim to improve the surgical outcomes for this condition.

Methods and Procedures

A multi-disciplinary hernia team has implemented a clinical quality improvement (CQI) effort in an attempt to better measure and improve outcomes for patients suffering with chronic groin pain after inguinal hernia repair. Between April 2011 and August 2018, 129 patients (157 groins) underwent surgical treatment for chronic groin pain after inguinal hernia repair. Data were collected to compare outcomes for those undergoing preoperative CBT and patients who did not have CBT prior to their operation.

Results

Of 129 total patients, baseline demographics were similar in terms of gender, age, and BMI. In total, 27 patients (32 groins) underwent prehabilitation with CBT (20.93%). We found none of the patients who underwent preoperative CBT had new postoperative pain and all patient procedures were able to be performed on an outpatient basis. Overall, 15 (14.7%) patients had no improvement in symptoms after surgery from the non-CBT group, whereas there was improvement in chronic pain for all patients who underwent CBT.

Conclusion

This attempt at process improvement demonstrated beneficial effects for patients who had CBT as part of a prehabilitation program prior to a surgical procedure to attempt to relieve groin pain after inguinal hernia repair. As with any CQI analysis, other factors may have contributed to these outcomes and these results may be different in another local environment.

### Groin hernia [^114R1JuK]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Groin hernias are among the most common indications for surgery worldwide, affecting both men and women, with a significantly higher prevalence in men. These hernias occur when intra-abdominal contents protrude through a weakened area in the groin region, most commonly as inguinal or femoral hernias. The pathogenesis of groin hernias is a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, connective tissue abnormalities and mechanical strain. While watchful waiting is an option for some asymptomatic patients, surgical repair remains the definitive treatment, with both open and minimally invasive techniques available. Tension-free mesh repair has significantly reduced the overall recurrence rates and is now the standard approach in adults in most clinics. However, tissue-based repairs are still preferred in select populations such as children, teenagers and those in resource-limited settings. Advances in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques offer benefits such as reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery. Despite surgical advancements, complications, such as chronic postoperative pain and recurrence, continue to pose challenges. Future research aims to refine surgical techniques, look at mesh-related complications, develop bioengineered meshes and explore the genetic basis of hernia formation.

### Management of chronic postoperative groin pain [^1132sLMg]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Postoperative groin pain is a common complaint following surgery of the abdomen and groin. Although this pain usually resolves in the early postoperative period, some experience prolonged, debilitating pain lasting months to years. There is currently a lack of consensus as to the appropriate transition from medical to surgical management of these patients. A retrospective review of 19 consecutive patients with postoperative pain symptoms suspicious for neuropathic origin was undertaken. Neuromas or entrapment of 1 or more nerves was identified in all patients. Improvement of pain and quality of life was reported in 84%, with a minimum 1 year's follow-up. Average preoperative and postoperative pain was 7.6 and 1.2, respectively, a statistically significant reduction. This study confirms high success rates for patients surgically treated for chronic postoperative groin pain when proper selection criteria and appropriate surgical techniques are applied. A management approach is proposed and the surgical technique is described for treatment of these patients.

### Long-term follow-up evaluation of chronic pain after endoscopic total extraperitoneal repair of primary and recurrent inguinal hernia [^116qK1ZD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The 10 years of follow-up evaluation seem to show that chronic groin pain after TEP repair of primary and recurrent inguinal hernia has a low incidence and intensity. The presentation and cause of groin pain after TEP is variable and probably not always caused by the procedure. Randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up evaluation that includes and describes prospective, objective, qualitative pain measurements are needed.

### Repair of groin hernia with synthetic mesh: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112TmzKH]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure the effects of laparoscopic and open placement of synthetic mesh on recurrence and persisting pain following groin hernia repair.

Summary Background Data

Synthetic mesh techniques are claimed to reduce the risk of recurrence but there are concerns about costs and possible long-term complications, particularly pain.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched and experts consulted to identify randomized or quasi-randomized trials that compared mesh with non-mesh methods, or laparoscopic with open mesh placement. Individual patient data were sought for each trial. Aggregated data were used where individual patient data were not available. Meta-analyses of hernia recurrence and persisting pain were based on intention to treat.

Results

There were 62 relevant comparisons in 58 trials. These included 11,174 participants: individual patient data were available for 6,901 patients, supplementary aggregated data for 2,390 patients, and published data for 1883 patients. Recurrence and persisting pain were less after mesh repair (overall recurrences: 88 in 4,426 vs. 187 in 3,795; OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34–0.55; P < .001) (overall persistent pain: 120 in 2,368 vs. 215 in 1,998; OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.29–0.46; P < .001), regardless of the non-mesh comparator. Whereas the reduction in recurrence was similar after laparoscopic and open mesh placement (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.76–2.08; p = 0.36), persistent pain was less common after laparoscopic than open mesh placement (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52–0.78; P < .001).

Conclusions

The use of synthetic mesh substantially reduces the risk of hernia recurrence irrespective of placement method. Mesh repair appears to reduce the chance of persisting pain rather than increase it.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to management of postoperative pain, HSG 2018 guidelines recommend to consider using a tailored approach to neurectomy, with or without mesh removal, depending on the original repair method and presentation. Decide on the neurectomy type (selective or triple) at the surgeon's discretion.

### Postherniorrhaphy groin pain and how to avoid it [^112noSkH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Groin pain following inguinal hernia repair remains a challenge to most general surgeons. Prevention of groin pain may be the most effective solution to this management problem and necessitates careful anatomic dissection and precise knowledge of surgical anatomy of the groin as well as potential pitfalls of surgical intervention. When complications arise, a period of watchful waiting is warranted, but surgical intervention with triple neurectomy offers the most definitive resolution of symptoms. This article aims to provide a thorough review of pertinent anatomic landmarks for the proper identification of the nerves that, if injured, result in chronic groin pain and to provide a treatment algorithm for patients suffering with this morbidity.

### Five-year follow-up of patients undergoing laparoscopic or open groin hernia repair: a randomized controlled trial [^116asofk]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare laparoscopic with open hernia repair in a randomized clinical trial at a median follow-up of 5 years.

Summary Background Data

Follow-up of patients in clinical trials evaluating laparoscopic hernia repair has been short.

Methods

Of 379 consecutive patients admitted for surgery under the care of one surgeon, 300 were randomized to totally extraperitoneal hernia repair or open repair, with the open operation individualized to the patient's age and hernia type. All patients, both randomized and nonrandomized, were followed up by clinical examination annually by an independent observer.

Results

Recurrence rates were similar for both randomized groups. In 1 of the 79 nonrandomized patients, a recurrent hernia developed. Groin or testicular pain was the most common symptom on follow-up of randomized patients. The most common reason for reoperation was development of a contralateral hernia, which was noted in 9% of patients; 11% of all patients died on follow-up, mainly as a result of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

Conclusions

These data show a similar outcome for laparoscopic and open hernia repair, and both procedures have a place in managing this common problem.

### Watchful waiting versus totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair for occult inguinal hernia and pain (EFFECT trial)-a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^113GNuQk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Groin pain in adults is a frequent complaint encountered in surgical practice and is often associated with inguinal hernias. However, the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with groin pain in the absence of clinical signs of an inguinal hernia can be challenging. Current international guidelines advise further investigation in these patients using ultrasonography and, if inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When additional imaging reveals an inguinal hernia that is not detectable by physical examination, this is referred to as occult. To date, no standardized therapeutic guidelines have been established for occult inguinal hernias accompanied by groin pain. In clinical practice, this diagnosis often results in surgical treatment; however, there is a lack of evidence to support this decision.

Few studies have reported the prevalence of occult inguinal hernias without any related symptoms. One study observed a prevalence of 16% for occult inguinal hernias when groin ultrasonography was conducted in 100 healthy males. Although contralateral exploration during unilateral laparoendoscopic inguinal hernia repair remains controversial, the HerniaSurge Group International Guidelines for Groin Hernia Management report that the prevelance of occult inguinal hernias ranges from 5 to 58% during this procedure. However, the prevelance of occult inguinal hernias and associated groin pain remains unknown.

It is important to recognize that an occult inguinal hernia may not be the true origin of inguinal pain and could merely represent an incidental finding alongside an alternative diagnosis. First, the accuracy of ultrasound is reduced if no palpable hernia is present. Second, given the positive predictive value (PPV) of 70% for ultrasound in detecting occult inguinal hernias, there is a high chance of negative groin exploration, indicating that radiologic findings may not always be accurate. Therefore, it is likely that in some cases, complaints persist or even increase after surgical management. Conversely, delaying treatment could lead to prolonged suffering.

At present, knowledge regarding the optimal treatment strategy for patients with groin pain and diagnosis of an occult inguinal hernia is insufficient and may result in unnecessary surgical interventions and inadequate patient counseling. To answer this question, a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), the EFFECT trial, was conducted to compare pain levels and quality of life (QoL) between a watchful waiting (WW) approach and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair in this specific patient population. The trial hypothesizes that WW is non-inferior to TEP repair for patients with inguinal pain and an occult inguinal hernia.

### Persistent postsurgical pain: risk factors and prevention [^116yfBfy]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Acute postoperative pain is followed by persistent pain in 10–50% of individuals after common operations, such as groin hernia repair, breast and thoracic surgery, leg amputation, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Since chronic pain can be severe in about 2–10% of these patients, persistent postsurgical pain represents a major, largely unrecognised clinical problem. Iatrogenic neuropathic pain is probably the most important cause of long-term postsurgical pain. Consequently, surgical techniques that avoid nerve damage should be applied whenever possible. Also, the effect of aggressive, early therapy for postoperative pain should be investigated, since the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing a persistent pain state. Finally, the role of genetic factors should be studied, since only a proportion of patients with intraoperative nerve damage develop chronic pain. Based on information about the molecular mechanisms that affect changes to the peripheral and central nervous system in neuropathic pain, several opportunities exist for multimodal pharmacological intervention. Here, we outline strategies for identification of patients at risk and for prevention and possible treatment of this important entity of chronic pain.

Patients below 40 years of age experienced pain before the surgery more often (63.3%) than the patients aged 40–60 years (59.2%) and the patients older than 60 years (53.5%). Moreover, the intensity of preoperative pain was significantly higher in the youngest group (VAS 4.9) than that in the middle-aged group (VAS 4.3; p = 0.008) and the oldest group (VAS 3.8; p = 0.014). Twelve months after the operation, pain intensity scores in these groups were 0.63, 0.41, and 0.29 (p = 0.038) for patients younger than 40, aged 40–60, and older than 60 years, respectively.

No serious complications, i.e. life-threatening complications or those requiring another intervention or additional treatment, were observed, including bowel, bladder, or large vessel trauma.

### Penetrating versus non-penetrating mesh fixation in laparoscopic groin hernia repair [^1157nbm6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with groin hernias have symptoms ranging from minor cosmetic concerns to severe pain. It is often difficult to determine preoperatively if a groin hernia is femoral or inguinal, but the distinction is clear during a laparoscopic repair. Compared with inguinal hernias, femoral hernias have a higher risk of strangulation, which is associated with higher morbidity and increased mortality. Since femoral hernias in women are fairly common, women with groin hernias are recommended to undergo surgery regardless of their symptoms. In contrast, not all adult men need surgery. Groin hernia repair can induce chronic postoperative pain, and men with no or mild symptoms can avoid surgery due to the low risk of acute repair. Ultimately, around 70% of these men will require surgery within 10 years due to the development of pain. However, men with a symptomatic groin hernia are recommended to undergo surgery due to the unknown risk of strangulation if surgery is postponed.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for groin hernias, and the use of mesh to reinforce the groin is recommended in adults. The implementation of mesh has reduced the risk of recurrence compared with non‐mesh repairs without increasing the risk of chronic pain. The reoperation rate for recurrence after mesh repair is around 5% five years postoperatively, and the frequency of chronic pain has traditionally been described as 10% to 12%. However, pain is highly dependent on the definition and assessment method used, and an updated overview is warranted. This Cochrane review will assess different mesh fixation methods during laparoscopic groin hernia repair. The review will therefore mainly include adults, since mesh repairs are not used in young children and are usually avoided in teenagers due to their developing groin area.

### Chronic pain after open inguinal hernia repair: expertise-based randomized clinical trial of heavyweight or lightweight mesh [^115UEdTD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

There is a shortage of high-quality studies regarding choice of mesh in open anterior inguinal hernia repair in relation to long-term chronic pain. The authors hypothesized that heavyweight compared with lightweight mesh causes increased postoperative pain.

Methods

An RCT was undertaken between 2007 and 2009 at two sites in Sweden. Men aged 25 years or older with an inguinal hernia evaluated in the outpatient clinic were randomized in an unblinded fashion to heavyweight or lightweight mesh for open anterior inguinal hernia repair. Data on pain affecting daily activities, as measured by the Short-Form Inguinal Pain Questionnaire 9–12 years after surgery, were collected as the primary outcome. Differences between groups were evaluated by generalized odds and numbers needed to treat.

Results

A total of 412 patients were randomized; 363 were analysed with 320 questionnaires sent out. A total of 271 questionnaires (84.7 per cent) were returned; of these, 121 and 150 patients were in the heavyweight and lightweight mesh groups respectively. Pain affecting daily activities was more pronounced in patients randomized to heavyweight versus lightweight mesh (generalized odds 1.33, 95 per cent c.i. 1.10 to 1.61). This translated into a number needed to treat of 7.06 (95 per cent c.i. 4.28 to 21.44). Two reoperations for recurrence were noted in the heavyweight mesh group, and one in the lightweight mesh group.

Conclusion

A large-pore lightweight mesh causes significantly less pain affecting daily activities a decade after open anterior inguinal hernia repair. Registration number: NCT00451893.

Chapter 10: Risk factors and prevention of acute and chronic pain

W. Reinpold

Introduction

It is well established that surgical injury can lead to chronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting for 3 months or more by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) [1]. In the literature, chronic pain rates after groin hernia repair vary between 0% and 75.5% [1–9]. Overall, moderate-to-severe pain was experienced by 10–12% of patients. The use of mesh seems to reduce the risk of chronic pain [10]. After a mesh-based inguinal hernia repair, 11% of the patients suffer from chronic pain, more than a quarter of these report moderate-to-severe pain [11].

Methods

The conclusions and recommendations for risk factors and prevention of acute and chronic pain after endoscopic hernia repair are based on a systematic review of the literature and a consensus conference for the development of technical guidelines in endohernia surgery, which was held in February 2009 in New Delhi, India, during the fourth meeting of the International Endohernia Society (IEHS).

Search terms: Pubmed, Medline, Embase, British Journal of Surgery database, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane database were searched for studies on acute and chronic pain after endoscopic hernia repair. Search terms were "TEP" and "pain"; "TAPP" and "pain"; "groin hernia" and "pain"; "inguinal hernia" and "pain". Additionally experts in the field of endoscopic hernia repair were contacted. The levels of evidence and grades of the recommendation are based on the Oxford evidence-based medicine criteria [12].

Surgery-related risk factors have to be differentiated from those not related to surgery. Risk factors for acute and chronic pain after endoscopic groin hernia repair and recommendations for its prevention:

### Somatosensory outcomes following Re-surgery in persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair: a prospective observational study [^114WLBue]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

After groin hernia repair (globally more than 20 million/year) 2–4% will develop persistent severe pain (PSPG). Pain management is challenging and may require multimodal interventions, including re-surgery. Quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) is an investigational psychophysiological tool with the potential to uncover the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the pain, ie, revealing neuropathic or inflammatory components. The primary objective was to examine and describe the underlying pathophysiological changes in the groin areas by QST before and after re-surgery with mesh removal and selective neurectomy.

Patients and Methods

Sixty patients with PSPG scheduled for re-surgery and with an inflammatory "component" indicated by blunt pressure algometry were examined in median (95% CI) 7.9 (5.8–11.5) months before and 4.0 (3.5–4.6) months after re-surgery. The QST-analyses included standardized assessments of cutaneous mechanical/thermal detection and pain thresholds. Suprathreshold heat stimuli were applied. Deep tissue sensitivity was tested by pressure algometry. Testing sites were the groin areas and the lower arm. Before/after QST data were z-transformed.

Results

Re-surgery resulted in median changes in rest, average, and maximal pain intensity scores of −2.0, −2.5, and −2.0 NRS (0/10) units, respectively (P = 0.0001), and proportional increases in various standardized functional scores (P = 0.0001). Compared with the control sites, the cutaneous somatosensory detection thresholds of the painful groin were increased before re-surgery and increased further after re-surgery (median difference: 1.28 z-values; P = 0.001), indicating a successive post-surgical loss of nerve fiber function ("deafferentation"). Pressure algometry thresholds increased after re-surgery (median difference: 0.30 z-values; P = 0.001).

Conclusion

In this subset of patients with PSPG who underwent re-surgery, the procedure was associated with improved pain and functional outcomes. While the increase in somatosensory detection thresholds mirrors the surgery-induced cutaneous deafferentation, the increase in pressure algometry thresholds mirrors the removal of the deep "pain generator". The QST-analyses are useful adjuncts in mechanism-based somatosensory research.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^114hEa9W]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative chronic pain is a special entity within the domain of chronic pain. Chronic postoperative pain occurs following numerous kinds of surgery, from amputations to thoracotomies to inguinal hernia surgery. The chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair has been extensively studied; however, the management is still difficult. Around the globe, millions of groin hernia repairs are conducted annuallyand 8%–16% of these patients experience chronic pain to a degree that impairs their daily lives 6 months postoperatively. A few percent of these patients experience disabling pain, and due to the large number of groin hernia repairs, the number of patients with disabling pain and discomfort is an important clinical problem. Depending on the degree of pain and the impact on daily activities, an evidence-based treatment option should be offered. A problem with some of the current evidence, based on research in chronic pain after groin hernia repair, is the use of different assessment methods and different lengths of follow-up. Surgeons, scientists, and pain specialists use different assessment methods, ie, researchers use different questionnaires in order to assess chronic pain in research projects, and this limits comparability.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair based on best practice guidelines and clinical routines.

### Groin hernia repair: postherniorrhaphy pain [^116yBXXy]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Persistent pain after hernia repair is common, although it is usually mild. In 3% of patients it is severe, however, and has significant effects on work and social activities. The purpose of this review was to examine factors that affect pain after hernia repair. Although the type of anaesthetic used, local or general, and the operation type, open or laparoscopic, seems to affect acute pain, chronic persistent pain is influenced by the age of the patient and whether the hernia was painful preoperatively. Preliminary evidence indicating that use of a lightweight mesh may reduce chronic pain requires further research before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

### Are nerves left in situ associated with less chronic pain than manipulation during inguinal hernia repair? [^116L9UyS]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nerve damage has been implicated in chronic groin pain, particularly iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genital branches of genitofemoral nerves. We investigated whether three nerve identification (3N) and preservation is associated with decreased pain 6 mo after hernia repair compared to two common strategies of nerve management: ilioinguinal nerve identification (1N) and two nerve identification (2N).

Methods

We identified adult inguinal hernia patients within the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative national database. Six-month postoperative pain was defined using the EuraHS Quality of Life tool. A proportional odds model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and expected mean differences in 6-month pain for nerve management while adjusting for confounders identified a priori.

Results

Four thousand four hundred fifty one participants were analyzed; 358 (3N), 1731 (1N), and 2362 (2N) consisting mostly of White males (84%) over the age of 60 y old. Academic centers identified all three nerves more often than ilioinguinal or two nerve identification methods. Median 6-month postoperative pain scores were 0 [interquartile range 0–2] for all nerve management groups (P = 0.51 3N versus 1N and 3N versus 2N). There was no evidence of a difference in the odds of higher 6-month pain score in nerve management methods after adjustment (3N versus 1N OR: 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.36–1.95, 3N versus 2N OR: 1.00; 95% confidence interval 0.50–1.85).

Conclusions

Although guidelines emphasize three nerve preservation, the management strategies evaluated were not associated with statistically significant differences in pain 6 mo after operation. These findings suggest that nerve manipulation may not contribute as a significant role in chronic groin pain after open inguinal hernia repair.

This article provides an evidence-based review of open hernia repair. Technical considerations in general, including perioperative management of the patient, and the most currently used open repairs are addressed. Outcomes after repair are reviewed using the latest available literature. Current recommendations from this review include the routine use of mesh in primary repair of inguinal hernia and the need to counsel patients preoperatively about the risk of chronic postoperative groin pain.

### Chronic pain after groin hernia surgery in women: a patient-reported outcome study based on data from the Swedish hernia register [^117SsQZ3]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate chronic pain 1 year after surgery, and risk factors for chronic pain after groin hernia repair in women.

Background

Groin hernia surgery in women is less frequently studied than in men. Chronic pain is common after groin hernia surgery and remains an important area with room for improvement. Previous studies are small or inconclusive. Guidelines recommend timely repair of all female groin hernias.

Methods

From the Swedish Hernia Register 4021 female and 37,542 male patients operated between September 1, 2012 and August 30, 2017 responded to a patient-reported outcome questionnaire (response rate 70.0%) 1 year after primary groin hernia surgery. Multivariable analysis was performed to compare chronic postoperative pain in women with men as a control group, and to evaluate risk factors for chronic pain in women.

Results

Among women operated for groin hernia, 18% suffered chronic postoperative pain. The risk for chronic pain was significantly higher for women [odds ratio 1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.16–1.46). Three risk factors for chronic pain in women were found: high body mass index, high American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and femoral hernia. No differences in chronic pain in women were seen when comparing surgical methods or emergency versus elective surgery.

Conclusions

Almost one-fifth of women suffered of chronic pain affecting daily activity after groin hernia repair. Chronic pain was more common for women than men. In view of the high-rate chronic postoperative pain, further research on management strategies in female groin hernia is warranted.

### Consensus on international guidelines for management of groin hernias [^113r9uRr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Groin hernia management has a significant worldwide diversity with multiple surgical techniques and variable outcomes. The International guidelines for groin hernia management serve to help in groin hernia management, but the acceptance among general surgeons remains unknown. The aim of our study was to gauge the degree of agreement with the guidelines among health care professionals worldwide.

Methods

Forty-six key statements and recommendations of the International guidelines for groin hernia management were selected and presented at plenary consensus conferences at four international congresses in Europe, the America's and Asia. Participants could cast their votes through live voting. Additionally, a web survey was sent out to all society members allowing online voting after each congress. Consensus was defined as > 70% agreement among all participants.

Results

In total 822 surgeons cast their vote on the key statements and recommendations during the four plenary consensus meetings or via the web survey. Consensus was reached on 34 out of 39 (87%) recommendations, and on six out of seven (86%) statements. No consensus was reached on the use of light versus heavy-weight meshes (69%), superior cost-effectiveness of day-case laparo-endoscopic repair (69%), omitting prophylactic antibiotics in hernia repair, general or local versus regional anesthesia in elderly patients (55%) and re-operation in case of immediate postoperative pain (59%).

Conclusion

Globally, there is 87% consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of groin hernias. This provides a solid basis for standardizing the care path of patients with groin hernias.
