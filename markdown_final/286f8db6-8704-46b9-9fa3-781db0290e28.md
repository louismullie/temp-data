## Question

How long as a therapeutic course for appendicitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long antibiotic therapy should be continued for acute appendicitis across clinical scenarios, and what evidence supports those durations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how disease severity changes duration decisions (uncomplicated versus complicated). Then, I should separate nonoperative medical management from postoperative therapy after appendectomy. Next, I will review high‑quality trials and guidelines that set typical course lengths and triggers to stop or switch to oral therapy. After that, I should consider modifiers such as appendicolith, source control, and pediatric nuances. Finally, I will synthesize practical scenario‑based recommendations and highlight stewardship and safety caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core framework, because if I get the taxonomy wrong, the durations will be off. For appendicitis, duration depends on both severity and strategy: nonoperative antibiotics for CT‑confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis involve a therapeutic, full‑course regimen, whereas postoperative antibiotics after appendectomy for complicated disease are short and contingent on adequate source control; by contrast, postoperative antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated disease after surgery, and preoperative care is usually a single prophylactic dose before incision [^111djVad] [^115oT7cS] [^111LweVT] [^111ynMYC]. Hold on, I should verify the pediatric alignment too — WSES pediatric recommendations mirror this adult structure with early oral transition and overall shorter postoperative durations in complicated cases when source control is adequate [^111KDH5G].

> Now, for uncomplicated appendicitis managed medically without surgery, I need to check the benchmark regimen and total duration. The APPAC protocol is the clearest: 3 days of IV ertapenem followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin plus metronidazole, totaling 10 days; this was used in the RCT and its long‑term follow‑ups, establishing a commonly used standard for nonoperative therapy in adults with CT‑confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis and no appendicolith [^115zTzgQ] [^116t2rQ3] [^111djVad]. Wait, let me verify that other guidance supports this range — AAFP and WSES endorse nonoperative management in selected uncomplicated cases and allow IV‑to‑oral switches based on clinical response, which generally keeps total courses in the 7–10 day window in practice [^111h7jEq] [^1119pt5R] [^111djVad].

> Next, I should review flexibility within nonoperative care — can we shorten IV time and still finish 7–10 days total, and can some patients be managed partly outpatient. The answer appears to be yes: early transition to oral antibiotics after initial stabilization is feasible, and outpatient NOM has been reported as safe in selected adults, with APPAC II and subsequent studies supporting oral‑first or early‑oral strategies and early discharge pathways; however, total durations commonly remain in the 7–10 day range, with clinical improvement (afebrile, down‑trending WBC, improving pain) guiding the IV‑to‑oral switch rather than extending total days indiscriminately [^111abgt8] [^117Q4Mzw] [^1119pt5R]. I should double‑check that guidelines discourage overtreatment — WSES emphasizes tailoring to clinical response and avoiding unnecessary prolongation, which applies here too [^111djVad].

> For complicated appendicitis treated with appendectomy, I need to verify the modern evidence for short postoperative courses. Historically, many used 5–7 days, but the multicenter APPIC RCT showed that 2 days of IV antibiotics was noninferior to 5 days for infectious complications at 90 days, with fewer adverse events, and cost analyses confirmed societal cost savings with the 2‑day strategy; WSES likewise recommends not prolonging beyond 3–5 days when source control is adequate, and a smaller RCT suggests that in selected gangrenous (non‑perforated) cases, 24 hours may suffice when source control is complete [^115oT7cS] [^116i1KEj] [^111psqAZ] [^115oT7cS] [^1154BYhd]. Wait, I almost called postoperative therapy in complicated cases "prophylaxis" — that's imprecise; after source control it is short‑course therapeutic coverage intended to prevent postoperative infectious complications, and the emphasis is on sufficiency, not prolongation, when the abdomen is clean and drains are not routinely needed [^115oT7cS].

> I should confirm what to do after appendectomy for uncomplicated disease and before incision for any appendectomy. Postoperatively, antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated appendicitis after adequate appendectomy, while preoperatively a single dose of broad‑spectrum antibiotics at induction is standard of care to reduce surgical site infection risk without subsequent continuation unless intraoperative findings reveal complexity [^111LweVT] [^111ynMYC]. Hmm, wait a minute — if intraoperative findings unexpectedly reveal gangrene or microperforation, we pivot to the "complicated" pathway above with a short postoperative course, guided by source control completeness [^115oT7cS].

> Pediatric nuances largely mirror adults, but I need to check the specifics and intervals. In children with CT‑confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis managed nonoperatively, similar total durations around 7–10 days are used, with early switch to oral therapy after 48 hours when clinically improved; after surgery, no postoperative antibiotics are given for uncomplicated cases, while for complicated appendicitis WSES recommends limiting postoperative therapy and transitioning early to oral with a total duration under 7 days when source control is achieved [^111KDH5G] [^111LweVT] [^1159pVeF]. Hold on, I should verify that practice variation exists — the EAES guidance notes uncertainty in defining "optimal" durations, reinforcing the need to use clinical resolution milestones rather than fixed prolonged courses [^116KG9SC].

> But wait, what if there are risk modifiers that change failure risk or duration in nonoperative care. Presence of an appendicolith is a consistent predictor of nonresponse and complications with antibiotics; CODA showed higher appendectomy rates by 90 days with an appendicolith, and pooled analyses of APPAC/APPAC II identified appendiceal diameter ≥ 15 mm, fever > 38°C, and elevated early CRP/WBC as predictors of primary nonresponse — these factors should tilt management toward surgery or, at minimum, closer follow‑up and a lower threshold to operate rather than simply extending antibiotics [^113mMzh6] [^1157gwHx] [^111oL38G] [^111yvhm3]. I should confirm that guidelines recommend NOM only in carefully selected uncomplicated cases, typically without appendicolith, which aligns with WSES recommendations [^111djVad].

> I will now examine adjunct principles that affect duration decisions regardless of scenario. Adequate source control is paramount; persistent fever, leukocytosis, or localized symptoms after a fixed short course should prompt evaluation for missed source control or resistant organisms rather than automatic extension of antibiotics; additionally, route can often be oral after initial stabilization, with evidence suggesting enteral therapy can be noninferior to IV in early postoperative periods for complicated appendicitis, and stewardship gains from shorter courses include fewer adverse effects and lower costs as shown in APPIC and its cost analyses [^112FbBET] [^117TX6UR] [^1177hEAT] [^11196M5G] [^111psqAZ]. Hold on, I should verify preoperative coverage again — yes, a single preincision dose is indicated for all appendectomies, independent of subsequent duration decisions [^111ynMYC].

> Let me reconsider the comparative context so I do not overstate antibiotics‑only as "equivalent" to surgery. Multiple RCT meta‑analyses show that while antibiotics are a safe alternative for many with uncomplicated disease, they have lower treatment efficacy by one year and higher recurrence or later appendectomy, even as overall complications are similar or lower; this supports offering antibiotics to selected patients with shared decision‑making but does not change the duration bands described above for those who do receive antibiotics [^1156TaFe] [^113kWArN] [^112CtTPv]. I should confirm that quality‑of‑life outcomes at 30 days and long‑term satisfaction remain acceptable with antibiotics, which CODA and APPAC follow‑ups support, again without altering the typical 7–10 day therapeutic course in NOM [^113mMzh6] [^115zTzgQ].

> Putting this together into practical scenario‑based durations, I need to be precise and evidence‑anchored. For uncomplicated appendicitis treated nonoperatively, use a total of 7–10 days, commonly 3 days IV then 7 days oral per APPAC, with earlier oral transition reasonable once clinically improved; do not truncate below 7 days without strong trial support in your local pathways, and avoid extending beyond 10 days if clinically resolved [^115zTzgQ] [^1119pt5R] [^111abgt8]. For complicated appendicitis after adequate source‑control appendectomy, aim for a short course: 2 days IV is supported as noninferior to 5 days and reduces adverse events and costs, with WSES recommending not exceeding 3–5 days when source control is adequate; in selected gangrenous (non‑perforated) cases, 24 hours may be sufficient when intraoperative clearance is complete [^1177hEAT] [^115oT7cS] [^1154BYhd] [^111psqAZ]. For postoperative uncomplicated appendicitis, no antibiotics are needed beyond the single preincision dose; for pediatric complicated cases with good source control, keep total postoperative therapy under 7 days with early oral switch when improving [^111LweVT] [^111ynMYC] [^111KDH5G].

> Critical caveats to avoid missteps: I should confirm that "longer is not better" after source control — if infection persists, reassess for missed collections or alternative diagnoses rather than automatically extending therapy; use clinical milestones (afebrile, normalizing WBC/CRP, improving pain) to stop, consistent with WSES' stewardship focus; and remember that appendicolith or high‑risk features at presentation should lower the threshold for surgery rather than simply prolonging antibiotics in NOM [^115oT7cS] [^112FbBET] [^113mMzh6] [^1157gwHx]. Finally, I need to ensure every plan incorporates preoperative single‑dose prophylaxis when operating, and that postoperative antibiotics are reserved for truly complicated disease with careful attention to the shortest effective duration supported by APPIC and guidelines [^111ynMYC] [^1177hEAT] [^115oT7cS].

A therapeutic course for appendicitis depends on disease severity and management strategy. For **uncomplicated appendicitis** [^111djVad], antibiotics alone are given for **7–10 days** [^113mMzh6] (typically 1–3 days IV [^115zTzgQ], then oral). For **complicated appendicitis** (perforation, abscess, or gangrene), postoperative antibiotics are recommended for **3–5 days** [^115oT7cS] after adequate source control [^1177hEAT], with early switch to oral therapy when stable [^111KDH5G]. Prolonged antibiotics beyond 5 days are **not supported** [^115oT7cS] and do not reduce complications. Clinical response should be reassessed [^111h7jEq] at 24–48 hours [^114S5HeT], and therapy individualized based on patient factors and response [^111KDH5G].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated appendicitis

- **Antibiotics alone**: 7–10 days [^113mMzh6] (1–3 days IV, then oral).
- **Clinical response**: reassess at 24–48 hours [^114S5HeT]; most respond within 1–2 days.
- **Recurrence**: about 23% at 1 year [^116t2rQ3]; appendectomy remains standard [^112GmDcf].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy for complicated appendicitis

- **Postoperative antibiotics**: 3–5 days after adequate source control [^115oT7cS].
- **Early oral switch**: after 48 hours when stable [^111KDH5G], total therapy < 7 days.
- **Prolonged therapy**: beyond 5 days [^115oT7cS] is not recommended.

---

## Factors influencing duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Severity**: uncomplicated vs complicated disease [^111h7jEq].
- **Patient factors**: age, comorbidities [^111h7jEq], immune status [^1119pt5R].
- **Clinical response**: fever, leukocytosis [^114S5HeT], CRP trends.
- **Source control**: adequacy of surgical or percutaneous drainage [^116i1KEj] [^115oT7cS].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

After adequate source control [^115oT7cS], **shorter antibiotic courses** [^1177hEAT] provide outcomes comparable to longer regimens. Extending therapy does not reduce **intra-abdominal abscess or wound infection rates** [^1154BYhd]. Recurrence is **higher with antibiotics alone** [^112CtTPv] than with surgery [^112GmDcf].

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated appendicitis (antibiotics alone) | 7–10 days [^113mMzh6] [^111djVad] | - IV 1–3 days <br/> - Then oral [^1119pt5R] |
| Complicated appendicitis (postoperative) | 3–5 days [^115oT7cS] | - IV <br/> - Early oral switch [^111KDH5G] |
| Pediatric complicated appendicitis | < 7 days [^111KDH5G] | Early oral switch after 48 hours [^111KDH5G] |

---

A therapeutic course for appendicitis is tailored to severity and response, with **7–10 days** [^113mMzh6] for uncomplicated cases and **3–5 days** [^115oT7cS] postoperatively for complicated cases, avoiding unnecessary prolongation [^1177hEAT].

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^111o8Fvp]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

There is no single evidence-based antibiotic treatment strategy for uncomplicated or perforated appendicitis, particularly because there is no indisputable evidence for any optimal antimicrobial therapy after surgery for appendicitis in children. Despite a marked decline in associated mortality during the past 50 years, perforation and complication rates remain unchanged, because they are influenced strongly by factors untouched by the intervening therapeutic advances. Scant data exist about the optimal duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment, though it is important to treat patients with adequate antimicrobial therapy and to avoid overtreatment.

Some authors advocate a predefined duration of antimicrobial treatment, whereas others discontinue antibiotics depending on the patient's clinical signs regardless of the length of therapy. Unfortunately, studies that have investigated antibiotic regimens and included the duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment as a point of interest often included children with perforated as well as gangrenous appendicitis, thereby assembling a different population with a lower rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses. The recently published guidelines from the Therapeutic Agents Committee of the Surgical Infection Society for antimicrobial therapy in children recommend that, with respect to perforated appendicitis, treatment duration should be based on the patient's response to treatment. Intravenous therapy should be continued until the patient is afebrile and has normal white blood cell counts — in brief, has no symptoms.

### Quality of life and patient satisfaction at 7-year follow-up of antibiotic therapy vs appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115zTzgQ]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Long-term results support antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis as an alternative to appendectomy. To our knowledge, treatment-related long-term patient satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) are not known.

- **Objective**: To determine patient satisfaction and QOL after antibiotic therapy and appendectomy for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Interventions**: Open appendectomy vs antibiotics with intravenous ertapenem, 1 g once daily for 3 days, followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, and metronidazole, 500 mg three times per day.

- **Design, Setting, and Participants**: This observational follow-up of the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial compared appendectomy with antibiotics. It included 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with computed tomography-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis who were randomized to undergo appendectomy (273 [52%]) or receive antibiotics (257 [49%]). The trial was conducted from November 2009 to June 2012; the last follow-up was May 9, 2018. The data were analyzed in February 2019.

- **Main Outcomes and Measures**: Post hoc secondary endpoints of postintervention QOL (EQ-5D-5L), patient satisfaction, and treatment preference were evaluated.

Results showed that of the 530 patients enrolled in the trial (appendectomy group: 273 [174 men (64%)] with a median age of 35 years; antibiotic group: 257 [155 men (60%)] with a median age of 33 years), 423 patients (80%) were available for phone interview at a median follow-up of 7 years. Of these, 206 patients (80%) took antibiotics while 217 (79%) were from the appendectomy group.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: A non-inferiority study [^111abgt8]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The management of acute appendicitis is a highly debated topic with increasing global interest. Since Andersson's description, a conservative approach with antibiotic therapy has been reconsidered for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Several randomized trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that conservative treatment is a safe alternative to appendectomy in uncomplicated acute appendicitis, yielding similar short-term outcomes. In particular, antibiotics have proven non-inferior to appendectomy, with a similar success rate at a 30-day follow-up and a lower morbidity rate.

Existing trials have proposed conservative management as an in-hospital treatment, combining medical observation with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Non-response to non-operative management (NOM) has been reported to be 8.5%, and hospitalization ensures patient safety through continuous re-evaluation, allowing for a prompt urgent appendectomy in case of failure of conservative treatment.

The APPAC II study demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral in-hospital antibiotics compared with the intravenous route, introducing the possibility of outpatient treatment. The first experience of outpatient treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis was described in a recent subgroup analysis of patients randomized and included in the CODA Trial. Patients received a first dose of intravenous antibiotics in the emergency department and were discharged home within 24 hours from the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. To the best of our knowledge, no other data are available in the literature.

### Role of preoperative antibiotic treatment while awaiting appendectomy: The PERFECT-Antibiotics randomized clinical trial [^116WqZhm]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics are thought to decelerate inflammation progression and reduce complications in acute uncomplicated appendicitis. However, the evidence of their effectiveness is insufficient, and treatment practices vary widely. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of preoperatively started antibiotic treatment on the rate of appendiceal perforation.

This multicenter, noninferiority, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted in two hospitals in Finland and one hospital in Norway between May 18, 2020, and January 22, 2023. Data analysis was performed from March 2023 to March 2024. Eligible patients were adults (aged > 18 years) diagnosed with presumed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients with allergies or other contraindications to study antibiotics, previously started antibiotic treatment, pregnancy, a suspicion of perforated appendicitis, or other reasons to perform prompt surgery were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 with a web-based service simultaneously as the laparoscopic appendectomy was scheduled.

- **Interventions**: Antibiotic treatment started while waiting for surgery (cefuroxime, 1500 mg, and metronidazole, 500 mg, every 8 hours until the surgery) or waiting without antibiotic treatment. Patients in both groups received a single prophylactic dose of antibiotics in the induction of anesthesia.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was perforated appendicitis diagnosed during surgery. The absolute difference in perforation rates was compared between the groups by an intention-to-treat analysis.

### Appendectomy or not? An update on the evidence for antibiotics only versus surgery for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children [^113S9FnC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is a common diagnosis in children being evaluated in the emergency department. Traditionally, surgical appendectomy has been the standard treatment. However, in recent years, there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the possibility of nonoperative management in both children and adults. This review presents the state of pediatric literature that suggests patients may be successfully treated with antibiotics alone (i.e. without surgery), but a proportion of these patients may experience recurrent appendicitis. Given that the literature regarding the option of antibiotic-only management compared with surgery is not yet definitive, there are many factors for providers to discuss with families and patients when considering treatment for acute appendicitis.

### Enteral antibiotics are non-inferior to intravenous antibiotics after complicated appendicitis in adults: A retrospective multicentre non-inferiority study [^117TX6UR]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Prolonging post-operative antibiotic treatment beyond three days does not seem to reduce the incidence of post-operative abscess formation or wound infection after surgery for complicated appendicitis. The route of administration seems to be based on empirical decisions. Using enteral antibiotics could reduce the length of stay and overall costs. This study aimed to examine whether treatment with enteral antibiotics during the first three post-operative days is non-inferior to intravenous antibiotics regarding intra-abdominal abscess formation or wound infection after surgery for complicated appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on adult patients undergoing surgery for complicated appendicitis over a period of 32 months in the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome was the incidence of post-operative abscess formation, and the secondary outcome was wound infections, both assessed within 30 days of surgery. The route of antibiotic administration for the first three post-operative days was recorded for all patients.

- **Results**: A total of 1141 patients were included in the study. The overall risk of developing an intra-abdominal abscess was 6.7% (95% CI 5.2%; 8.1%), and the risk of wound infection was 1.2% (95% CI 0.6%; 1.8%). In a multivariate intention-to-treat analysis, patients treated post-operatively with enteral antibiotics had an odds ratio of 0.78 (95% CI 0.41; 1.45, p = 0.429) for developing an intra-abdominal abscess and an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI 0.17; 4.29, p = 0.851) for developing a wound infection compared to patients treated post-operatively with intravenous antibiotics.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^113VQkPJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

- **Results**: During the period studied, 620 children underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in one of the two participating centers; 149 (24%) of these children underwent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis: 68 in hospital A (group A) and 81 in hospital B (group B). The median age was 11 (range, 1–17) years in group A versus 9 (range, 0–17) years in group B. This difference was significant (p < 0.001). The patient, treatment, and outcome characteristics of both groups are listed below.

	- **Table 1: Characteristics of group A and group B**

		(data are numbers with percentages in parentheses unless otherwise indicated)

- **Follow-up**: Three children were lost to follow-up after successful discharge from the hospital. One of these patients was admitted to hospital A during a trip abroad and returned home after being discharged. One patient (hospital A) had postoperative outpatient appointments at another hospital and was lost to follow-up, and one patient (hospital B) never kept her appointment at the outpatient clinic and did not respond to calls. These children were not excluded from the analysis. Patient follow-up was complete for 146 children (98%). No other data were missing.

- **Surgical procedure**: Seventy-two (48%) children underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Open appendectomy was performed in 77 (52%) children. Both participating centers are university hospitals, so surgical procedures were performed by multiple surgeons and residents under supervision. Surgical protocols revealed no specific differences.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^111yvhm3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Appendicitis can be divided by severity into two disease entities: uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. This distinction enables different treatments. The long-standing belief that all instances of appendicitis inevitably lead to perforation unless patients undergo surgery appears applicable only to complicated acute appendicitis. The majority of appendicitis cases are uncomplicated. Contemporary studies indicate that uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be managed safely and efficiently with antibiotics, even in an outpatient setting. However, established and consistent criteria for distinguishing between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis remain lacking. Consequently, objective findings that minimize non-responsiveness to initial antibiotics and facilitate safe outpatient management for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis have yet to be clearly defined.

The presence of an appendicolith has been shown to correlate with an increased risk of primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics, often marking complicated appendicitis. Furthermore, in a secondary analysis of the APPAC II trial, which assessed potential pre-intervention findings associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics, an appendiceal diameter ≥ 15 mm and a body temperature > 38°C were associated with non-responsiveness to antibiotics. These were added as further exclusion criteria in the ongoing APPAC IV double-blind RCT, comparing oral moxifloxacin and placebo for uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^1157gwHx]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics are safe and efficient for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Identifying predictive factors of primary non-responsiveness or recurrence would further improve antibiotic treatment success and safety.

- **Methods**: All patients treated with antibiotics in two large RCTs (APPAC and APPAC II) were included. The primary non-responsiveness analysis compared patients operated on within 30 days after randomization for complicated appendicitis with either patients presenting with uncomplicated appendicitis at surgery within 30 days or patients with successful antibiotic treatment during a 3-year follow-up. Prognostic factors for appendicitis recurrence were assessed by comparing patients with successful antibiotic treatment with patients with acute appendicitis operated on after 30 days of initial antibiotics.

- **Results**: Of 856 patients randomized to antibiotics (mean(s.d.) age of 36(12) years; 365 (42.6%) were women), 832 were eligible for non-responsiveness analysis and 732 for appendicitis recurrence analysis. Findings associated with primary non-responsiveness on admission included an appendiceal diameter ≥ 15mm (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 4.00 (95% c.i. 2.00 to 7.92)) and body temperature > 38°C (adjusted RR 2.76 (95% c.i. 1.27 to 6.03)). During the first 6–30 hours after admission, C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 100mg/l (negative predictive value of 99%) and leucocyte count ≥ 9 × 10⁹/l were associated with primary non-responsiveness (adjusted RR 8.29 (95% c.i. 3.69 to 18.63)) and adjusted RR 4.44 (95% c.i. 1.79 to 11.05).

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials [^113kWArN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing conservative and surgical treatment in a population of adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. We have exclusively incorporated randomized controlled trials. Studies involving participants with complicated appendicitis or children were excluded. The variables considered are as follows: treatment complications, complication-free treatment success at index admission and at 1-year follow-up, length of hospital stay (LOS), quality of life (QoL), and costs.

- **Results**: Eight RCTs involving 3,213 participants (1,615 antibiotics/1,598 appendectomy) were included. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of complication rates (RR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.61–1.04, P = 0.07, I² = 69%). Antibiotics had reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendectomy (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90, p < 0.00001, I² = 87%), and at 1-year, it was successful in 540 out of 837 (64.6%, RR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, p < 0.00001, I² = 81%) participants. There was no difference in LOS (mean difference -0.58 days, 95% confidence interval -1.59 to 0.43, p = 0.26, I² = 99%). The trial sequential analysis has revealed that, concerning the three primary outcomes, it is improbable that forthcoming RCTs will significantly alter the existing body of evidence.

### Should ambulatory appendectomy become the standard treatment for acute appendicitis [^115cGD8T]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency surgery worldwide, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% for men and 6.7% for women. Despite the promotion of antibiotic therapy as a non-invasive alternative, laparoscopic appendectomy remains the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. It is a common surgery, performed mostly in young healthy patients, with standardized management, operating time under 1 hour, low morbidity, and low average length of hospital stay, all of which render it safe to perform in ambulatory settings. Over the past decades, appendectomy has been increasingly performed as a 'short stay' (< 24-hour hospital stay) or 'ambulatory' (no overnight hospital stay) procedure, with satisfactory outcomes and low complication rates. Yet, conventional hospitalization (with overnight stay) remains the routine procedure for acute appendicitis.

There is no present consensus on the selection of patients with acute appendicitis for ambulatory surgery (AS). Recently, Lefrançois et al. proposed a new score, which classifies patients into six risk levels, to select patients for ambulatory appendectomy without compromising outcomes. In their series, only 20% were discharged on the same day of surgery. The percentage of appendectomy procedures performed in ambulatory settings reported in the literature varies greatly (20–88%), likely due to inconsistent definitions of AS and to different criteria for the enrollment of ambulatory patients.

For over five years, the authors have been performing ambulatory surgery for increasingly complex procedures, including c.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^111oL38G]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics are safe and efficient for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Identifying predictive factors of primary non-responsiveness or recurrence would further improve antibiotic treatment success and safety.

- **Methods**: All patients treated with antibiotics in two large RCTs (APPAC and APPAC II) were included. The primary non-responsiveness analysis compared patients who required surgery within 30 days after randomization for complicated appendicitis with patients presenting uncomplicated appendicitis during surgery within 30 days or with those who had successful antibiotic treatment during a 3-year follow-up. Prognostic factors for appendicitis recurrence were assessed by comparing patients with successful antibiotic treatment to those with acute appendicitis who required surgery more than 30 days after initial antibiotic therapy.

- **Results**: Of the 856 patients randomized to antibiotics (mean(s.d.) age of 36(12) years; 365 (42.6%) were women), 832 were eligible for the non-responsiveness analysis and 732 for appendicitis recurrence analysis. Findings associated with primary non-responsiveness on admission included an appendiceal diameter of ≥ 15 mm (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (c.i.) 2.00 to 7.92, P < 0.001) and body temperature > 38°C (adjusted RR 2.76, 95% c.i. 1.27 to 6.03, P = 0.011). During the first 6–30 hours after admission, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≥ 100 mg/l (negative predictive value of 99%) and leucocyte count of ≥ 9 × 10⁹/l were both associated with primary non-responsiveness (adjusted RR 8.29, 95% c.i. 3.69 to 18.63, P < 0.001; and adjusted RR 4.44, 95% c.i. 1.79, respectively).

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^115TMznS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer eight key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or non-operative management, and specific technical and post-operative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were then presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

- **Results**: Conditional recommendations were made in favor of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), either suction and lavage or suction alone, no routine drain placement, treatment with short-term antibiotics postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated non-operatively undergoing interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms, although it also indicates uncertainty.

- **Conclusions**: These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

### Antibiotics as first-line alternative to appendicectomy in adult appendicitis: 90-day follow-up from a prospective, multicentre cohort study [^111pHwoo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Admission variables were recorded for all patients, including demographic data, frailty, co-morbidities, patient observations, duration of symptoms, and blood inflammatory markers. Sites were asked to calculate an Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) for each patient using an online calculator.

Patients in both cohorts were followed up for 90 days from presentation for total length of hospital stay (LOS), death, rate of hospital reattendance, operations, interventional radiology (IR) drain placement, admission to critical care (level 2 [high dependency unit] or level 3 [intensive care unit]), 30-day complication rate, and total costs. Operative details were recorded, including surgical approach, duration of operation, procedure, surgical findings, and histology.

Patient demographics and outcomes were analyzed by intention to treat, based on initial operative or non-operative management. Failure of non-operative management was recorded as the management changing from antibiotics to surgery at least two days after initial assessment. Patients requiring IR drainage on initial presentation were excluded from the main analysis, as initial management was neither non-operative nor operative.

- **Data validation**: Random number generation was used to select 15 percent of patients entered into the database for data validation. Sites were asked to nominate an independent team member to collect data for a predetermined 25 percent of data points for these randomly selected patients. These data were analyzed centrally against the database, generating an overall data validation percentage of 98.

### Antibiotic administration can be an independent risk factor for therapeutic delay of pediatric acute appendicitis [^112CP1Pm]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Little is known about the relationship between prior treatment with antibiotics and the delay in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acute appendicitis (AA). We define a situation requiring more than 48 hours from the onset of symptoms to surgery in pediatric AA as "therapeutic delay". The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors contributing to therapeutic delay in pediatric AA.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children operated on for AA between 2003 and 2008 at tertiary-care pediatric and perinatal hospitals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were analyzed to determine independent risk factors for therapeutic delay in pediatric AA.

- **Results**: The duration between the onset of symptoms and surgery exceeded 48 hours (therapeutic delay) in 50 patients (25%, group A) and was 48 hours or less in 151 patients (75%, group B). Patients in group A had a significantly higher frequency of diarrhea (48% vs. 12%; P < 0.0001). A higher percentage of children in group A had previously received antibiotics (46% vs. 8%; P < 0.0001). The median C-reactive protein levels (72 vs. 7 mg/L; P < 0.0001) and frequency of perforation (60% vs. 13%; P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in group A. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent risk factors for therapeutic delay included a history of receiving antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.3–15.5), diarrhea (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.1–13.1), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.9–10.8).

### Two days versus five days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: Cost analysis of a randomized, noninferiority trial [^11196M5G]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

- **Procedures**: Diagnostic work-up, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgical approach were conducted according to local hospital standards. Postoperative laboratory tests, imaging studies, and blood cultures were performed upon clinical indication and per local protocol. The final discharge and the type and timing of follow-up were left to the discretion of the treating physician. Patients received a Productivity Cost Questionnaire (PCQ) by mail four weeks after an appendectomy, with a second questionnaire sent if unanswered. Follow-up continued until 90 days after appendectomy, culminating in a telephone follow-up by the central trial coordinator. Data from electronic patient files, questionnaires, and telephone follow-ups were registered in a secure, pseudonymized online database.

- **Outcomes**: The trial's primary endpoint was a composite of infectious complications and mortality within 90 days after appendectomy. Infectious complications were defined as intra-abdominal abscess and surgical site infections. Secondary outcomes included postoperative antibiotic use, overall postoperative complications, reinterventions, hospital readmission, length of hospital stay, and visits to the emergency room, outpatient clinic, or general practitioner — all within 90 days after surgery.

The primary outcome presented in this study is the estimate of overall societal costs for both treatment allocations. Overall societal costs are the sum of direct healthcare costs and estimated costs due to loss of productivity.

### Nonoperative vs operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YDNoP]. JAMA Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Appendectomy remains the standard of care for uncomplicated acute appendicitis despite several randomized clinical trials pointing to the safety and efficacy of nonoperative management. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials may contribute to the body of evidence and help surgeons select which patients may benefit from surgical and nonsurgical treatment.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy and safety of nonoperative management vs appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Data sources**: A systematic review was conducted using indexed sources (Embase and PubMed) to search for published randomized clinical trials in English comparing nonoperative management with appendectomy in adult patients presenting with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. To increase sensitivity, no limits were set for outcomes reported, sex, or year of publication. All nonrandomized or quasi-randomized trials were excluded, and validated primers were used.

- **Study selection**: Among 1504 studies imported for screening, 805 were duplicates, and 595 were excluded for irrelevancy. A further 96 were excluded after full-text review, mainly owing to wrong study design or inclusion of pediatric populations. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the meta-analysis.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Meta-extraction was conducted with independent extraction by multiple reviewers using the Covidence platform for systematic reviews and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Data were pooled by a random-effects model.

### Diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CvXeo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

The optimal diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis remain controversial. This systematic review details the evidence and best practices for the evaluation and management of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis in adults and children.

- **Methods**: Eight questions regarding the diagnosis and management of appendicitis were formulated. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov/NLM were queried for articles published from 2010 to 2022 with keywords related to at least one question. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included. Two reviewers screened each publication for eligibility and then extracted data from eligible studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed on all quantitative data. The quality of randomized and non-randomized studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 or Newcastle Ottawa Scale, respectively.

- **Results**: A total of 2792 studies were screened, and 261 were included. Most had a high risk of bias. Computed tomography scans yielded the highest sensitivity (> 80%) and specificity (> 93%) in the adult population, although high variability existed. In adults with uncomplicated appendicitis, non-operative management resulted in higher odds of readmission (OR 6.10) and need for operation (OR 20.09), but less time to return to work/school (SMD -1.78). In pediatric patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, non-operative management also resulted in higher odds of need for operation (OR 38.31). In adult patients with complicated appendicitis, there were higher odds of need for operation following antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: What do meta-analyses say [^1153evpy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of inflammatory acute abdomen. The incidence varies from 250,000 to 280,000 cases per year in the United States, accounting for more than 1 million hospital days per year and costing over 3 billion dollars. For more than a century, acute appendicitis has been treated surgically through appendectomy, achieving mortality rates as low as 0.07 to 0.7%. However, surgical intervention is associated with increased pain, adherence and hernia development, ileus, venous thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary complications, and higher costs.

During the 1950s, an initial non-operative approach for acute appendicitis was attempted but was not generally accepted at the time. Appendicitis complicated by appendicular abscess/phlegmon may be managed with antibiotics and non-operative strategies, leading to reduced complication rates compared to surgery, similar to other acute inflammatory intestinal conditions such as diverticulitis and enterocolitis. In this context, antibiotic therapy may be associated with reduced treatment costs, avoiding operations and their consequent complications. However, the use of antibiotics alone as a primary therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis remains under assessment, as studies have shown conflicting results.

The aim of this study is to review available meta-analyses comparing antibiotics alone versus appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^111K72VE]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess possible pre-interventional on-admission findings and post-treatment findings during the first day that could be associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics. This research builds on the previously reported secondary analysis of the APPAC II trial by combining patients from the APPAC trial and the APPAC II trial to achieve a larger sample size. The second novel aim was to evaluate possible baseline prognostic factors for appendicitis recurrence after initial successful antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The primary objective was to further optimize patient selection and consequently increase the safety and efficacy of non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

### Predictors of appendicectomy one year after antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis: Insights from a prospective, multicentre, observational study [^115w51r8]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Surgeons are sometimes reluctant to manage uncomplicated appendicitis non-operatively due to the risk of re-appendicitis and the risk of missed appendiceal malignancy. The aim of this study was to address these uncertainties and determine the long-term efficacy of antibiotic versus operative management of appendicitis.

- **Method**: One-year follow-up of patients enrolled in the multicentre COVID:HAREM cohort study during March-June 2020 was performed. Initial operative or non-operative management was determined on a case-by-case basis by the responsible surgeon. Outcomes were appendicectomy rate at 1-year, histology of removed appendix, and predictors of unsuccessful antibiotic treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 625 patients who had non-operative management were included. Emergency appendicectomy had been performed by 1-year in 24% (149/625), with a median time to appendicectomy of 12 days [IQR 1–77] from presentation. Thirty-one patients had elective appendicectomy. Normal histology was reported in 6% of emergency procedures and 58% of elective ones. There were 7 malignancies and 3 neuroendocrine tumors identified at histology. All patients with malignant histology had ≥ 1 risk factors for malignancy at initial presentation. Faecolithiasis (hazard ratios (HR) 2.3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.51–3.49) and a high Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS > 16; HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.52–3.92) were independent risk factors for unsuccessful non-operative management.

- **Conclusion**: At 1 year, 71% of patients managed non-operatively did not undergo an appendicectomy.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: What do meta-analyses say [^111M8U8b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Primary appendectomy is the standard of care for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis; however, interest in conservative treatment with antibiotics alone has been increasing in recent years. Clinical trials to date have shown controversial results.

- **Methods**: A series of meta-analyses were reviewed. Studies comparing surgery versus antibiotics alone for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults were included. Descriptive statistics and data on treatment effects were retrieved and summarized.

- **Results**: The conservative approach has a success rate of approximately 60% and is associated with shorter pain duration, reduced analgesic medication, faster resolution of the inflammation process, lower expenses, and quicker return to work. Conversely, medical treatment leads to high (up to 20%) readmission rates and more frequent necessity for surgery. An operative approach is associated with higher treatment success rates (> 90%) and a very low mortality rate.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the body of evidence, the use of antibiotics for primary treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis cannot be routinely recommended. Appendectomy remains the gold-standard treatment.

### Long-term results following antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis in adults [^111xSZtB]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis as an alternative to surgical appendectomy is a well-recognized possibility, with favorable response rates of 0.77–0.91 according to randomized and consecutively evaluated patients. However, controversy remains regarding the extent to which antibiotic treatment should be systematically offered as a first-line therapy. There is skepticism about whether antibiotics offer significant resolution of inflamed appendices. This uncertainty is partly due to a lack of long-term results in the literature, although satisfying acute and long-term outcomes are reported in both adults and children with uncomplicated appendicitis.

The resolution of pain and clinical signs of inflammation was observed in approximately 75–90% of treated patients, depending on the clinical stage and selection criteria of patients. The choice of antibiotics is also important and may vary between countries and over time in different geographic areas. In the present study, we present long-term results on outcomes that should encourage physicians to consider antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis as a safe and evidence-based alternative to acute surgical operations.

### 2 days versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: A pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial [^1177hEAT]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

The study APPIC was published by Elisabeth M. L. de Wijkerslooth and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the disease of acute appendicitis. In the APPIC study, the trial question was whether a short 2-day course of postoperative antibiotics is noninferior to a standard 5-day course in patients with complex appendicitis. The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 1005 patients.

The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 8 years with complex appendicitis. The key exclusion criteria were the absence of informed consent, interval appendectomy, clinical suspicion of severe sepsis, conservative treatment of acute appendicitis, immunocompromised state, and pregnancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- 502 patients received a short 2-day course of intravenous cefuroxime/metronidazole (1,500/500 mg TID) or ceftriaxone/metronidazole (once daily 2,000 mg / TID 500 mg) for 48 hours, according to local antibiotic policy.
	- 503 patients received a standard 5-day course of the same antibiotics for 5 days.

- **Primary outcome**: The trial evaluated the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in the rate of infectious complications and death within 90 days (10% vs. 8%; AD 2%, 95% CI -1.6 to 5.6).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in hospital readmission (12% vs. 6%; OR 2.135, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.4) and a significant decrease in adverse effects of antibiotics (9% vs. 22%; OR 0.344, 95% CI).

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials [^114zgLvK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). High credibility.

- **Outcome measures**:

- **Primary outcome measures**: Complication-free treatment success was evaluated based on an uncomplicated course, with no occurrence of postoperative complications. For nonoperative management (NOM), this included complications or recurrences; for operative management, it involved postoperative complications. Treatment efficacy based on a 1-year follow-up was defined differently for the two groups. For NOM, efficacy was achieving a definitive improvement without the need for surgery within a median follow-up of 1 year. Lack of efficacy in the NOM group included two scenarios: the persistence of acute appendicitis during hospitalization (referred to as index admission NOM failure, characterized by non-resolving appendicitis with persistent or worsening symptoms during the primary hospital stay) and recurrence of acute appendicitis. For operative management, efficacy was defined as the resolution of symptoms following surgical treatment. Postoperative complications involved evaluating the number and rates of various complications.

- **Secondary outcome measures**: The study analyzed the number and rates of patients treated with a laparoscopic approach in both groups. Total costs encompassed the overall medical and surgical costs associated with the primary hospital stay. The length of the primary hospital stay refers to the number of days of inpatient admission during the initial hospitalization. Quality of life following antibiotic therapy (AT) and surgical therapy (ST) was assessed.

### 2 days versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: A pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial [^116i1KEj]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

The appropriate duration of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis is unclear. The increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance warrants restrictive antibiotic use, which could also reduce side effects, length of hospital stay, and costs.

- **Methods**: In this pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority trial conducted in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, patients with complex appendicitis (aged ≥ 8 years) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2 days or 5 days of intravenous antibiotics after appendicectomy. Randomisation was stratified by center, and treating physicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of infectious complications and mortality within 90 days. The main outcome was the absolute risk difference (95% CI) in the primary endpoint, adjusted for age and severity of appendicitis, with a non-inferiority margin of 7.5%. Outcome assessment was based on electronic patient records and a telephone consultation 90 days after appendicectomy. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Safety outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NL5946.

- **Findings**: Between April 12, 2017, and June 3, 2021, 13,267 patients were screened, and 1,066 were randomly assigned, 533 to each group. Thirty-one were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2-day group, and 30 from the 5-day group due to errors in recruitment or consent. Appendicectomy was performed laparoscopically in 955 (95%) of 1,005 patients.

### Twenty-four hour versus extended antibiotic administration after surgery in complicated appendicitis: A randomized controlled trial [^1154BYhd]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recent investigations noted the noninferiority of short-course antimicrobial treatments following source control in abdominal infections. We set out to investigate the noninferiority of a short and fixed (24 hours) antibiotic administration compared to extended treatment after source control in complicated appendicitis in a prospective single-center open-label randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, all consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with complicated appendicitis, including gangrenous appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and appendicitis with periappendicular abscess between May 2016 and February 2018, were randomly allocated to antibacterial therapy limited to 24 hours (short) vs. > 24 hours (extended) administration after appendectomy. Primary outcomes included composite postoperative complications and Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). The secondary outcome was hospital length of stay (HLOS). Follow-up analysis at 1 month was conducted per intention and per protocol.

- **Results**: A total of 80 patients were enrolled, with 39 and 41 cases allocated to the short and the extended therapy group, respectively. The demographic profile and disease severity were similar between the study groups. The overall rate of complications was 17.9% and 29.3% in the short and extended group, respectively (p = 0.23). Mean CCI did not differ between the study groups (p = 0.29). Hospital length of stay was significantly reduced in the short therapy group (61 ± 34 hours vs. 81 ± 40 hours, p = 0.005).

- **Conclusion**: In the prospective randomized controlled trial, short-course antibiotic administration demonstrated a trend toward equivalence in clinical outcomes compared to extended administration while significantly reducing hospital length of stay.

### The current management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: Should there be a change in paradigm? A systematic review of the literatures and analysis of treatment performance [^113aZZDY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Appendectomy has long been the mainstay of intervention for acute appendicitis, aiming at preventing perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation, and recurrence. With a better understanding of the disease process, non-operative management (NOM) with antibiotics alone has been proved a feasible treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis. This article aimed at systematically reviewing the available literature and discussing the question of whether NOM should replace appendectomy as the standard first-line treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Method**: A search of Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library was performed using the keywords 'acute appendicitis' and 'antibiotic therapy'. A meta-analysis with an inverse variance model for continuous variables and the Mantel-Haenszel model for dichotomous variables was performed to evaluate the one-year treatment efficacy, morbidities rate, sick leave duration, and length of hospital stay associated with emergency appendectomy and NOM.

- **Results**: Six randomized control trials were identified out of 1,943 publications. NOM had a significantly lower treatment efficacy rate at one year, 0.10 (95% CI 0.03–0.36, p < 0.01) when compared to appendectomy. The morbidities rate was comparable between the two interventions. The length of hospital stay was longer, with a mean difference of 1.08 days (95% CI 0.09–2.07, p = 0.03), and the sick leave duration was shorter, with a mean difference of 3.37 days (95% CI -5.90 to −0.85 days, p < 0.01) for NOM.

- **Conclusion**: The paradigm remains unchanged; appendectomy is the gold standard of treatment for uncom.

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated appendicitis [^113hRF63]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated appendicitis may resolve spontaneously or require treatment with antibiotics or appendicectomy. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the outcome of a non-antibiotic management strategy with that of antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting to a university teaching hospital with CT-verified uncomplicated simple appendicitis (appendiceal diameter no larger than 11 mm and without any signs of perforation) were randomized to management with a no-antibiotic regimen with supportive care (intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antipyretics as necessary) or a 4-day course of antibiotics with supportive care. The primary endpoint was the rate of total treatment failure, defined as initial treatment failure within 1 month and recurrence of appendicitis during the follow-up period.

- **Results**: Some 245 patients were randomized within the trial and followed up for a median of 19 months. The duration of hospital stay was shorter (mean 3.1 versus 3.7 days; P < 0.001) and the medical costs lower (€1181 versus €1348; P < 0.001) among those randomized to therapy without antibiotics. There was no difference in total treatment failure rate between the groups: 29 of 124 (23.4 percent) in the no-antibiotic group and 25 of 121 (20.7 percent) in the antibiotic group (P = 0.609). Eighteen patients (9 in each group) had initial treatment failure, 15 of whom underwent appendicectomy and three received additional antibiotics. Thirty-six patients (20 in the no-antibiotic group, 16 in the antibiotic group) experienced recurrence, of whom 30 underwent appendicectomy.

A recent open-label, non-inferiority trial of patients with complicated appendicitis (aged ≥ 8 years) showed that 2 days of postoperative intravenous antibiotics was non-inferior to 5 days of therapy in terms of infectious complications and 90-day mortality. However, a majority of enrolled patients had gangrenous (non-perforated) appendicitis that requires only 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy. Given the paucity of data regarding the optimal duration of therapy for critically ill patients with cIAI, there may be considerable practice variation. Critically ill surgical patients often receive antibiotics longer than necessary. Antibiotic therapy may be truncated in these patients also, as demonstrated by the DURAPOP RCT of critically ill patients with postoperative IAIs.

Patients who have ongoing signs of infection following a source control procedure and appropriate fixed-duration antibiotic treatment need investigation to assess for an ongoing source of infection, such as failed source control versus untreated resistant pathogen(s), to determine whether re-operation is necessary rather than prolongation or modification of the antibiotic treatment regimen. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful for individualizing antibiotic use. Clinical PCT-based algorithms are used as part of antibiotic stewardship programs in various settings. Serum PCT concentration in healthy unoperated individuals is typically < 0.05 mcg/L but may be higher postoperatively due to a PCT response to tissue injury.

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials [^115rkji1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a common abdominal emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. For over a century, open appendectomy was the standard treatment for appendicitis. However, recent studies have challenged the necessity of surgery in uncomplicated cases of appendicitis. Nonoperative management (NOM) with antibiotics alone has emerged as a promising alternative. Although appendectomy has long been considered the gold standard operative management (OM) for acute appendicitis, there is growing interest in NOM with antibiotics in both adults and children.

Nonoperative management may offer certain advantages over appendectomy, such as decreased morbidity and shorter recovery time. However, there are concerns regarding the efficacy and safety of this approach. For instance, nonoperative management may be associated with a higher rate of recurrent appendicitis and an increase in the duration of hospital stay. Thus, it is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nonoperative management compared to appendectomy in uncomplicated cases of appendicitis.

Despite years of experience performing surgery to treat uncomplicated appendicitis, there is still a shortage of data that can be used to compare NOM and OM, making the choice between the two more challenging. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to compare NOM and OM in terms of efficacy, costs, length of hospital stay, quality of life, and complications in a population of adults.

### The current management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: Should there be a change in paradigm? A systematic review of the literatures and analysis of treatment performance [^113xhN6Y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Appendectomy has long been the mainstay of intervention for acute appendicitis, aiming to prevent perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation, and recurrence. With a better understanding of the disease process, non-operative management (NOM) with antibiotics alone has proven to be a feasible treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis. This article aimed to systematically review the available literature and discuss whether NOM should replace appendectomy as the standard first-line treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Method**: A search of the Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library was performed using the keywords 'acute appendicitis' and 'antibiotic therapy'. Meta-analysis with an inverse variance model for continuous variables and a Mantel-Haenszel model for dichotomous variables was performed to evaluate the one-year treatment efficacy, morbidity rate, sick leave duration, and length of hospital stay associated with emergency appendectomy and NOM.

- **Results**: Six randomized control trials were identified out of 1943 publications. NOM had a significantly lower treatment efficacy rate at one year, 0.10 (95% CI 0.03–0.36, p < 0.01), compared to appendectomy. The morbidity rate was comparable between the two interventions. The length of hospital stay was longer, with a mean difference of 1.08 days (95% CI 0.09–2.07, p = 0.03), and the sick leave duration was shorter, with a mean difference of 3.37 days (95% CI -5.90 to -0.85 days, p < 0.01) for NOM.

- **Conclusion**: The paradigm remains unchanged, in that appendectomy is the gold standard of treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Is it safe to delay appendectomy in adults with acute appendicitis [^117VCgUZ]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To examine whether delayed surgical intervention in adult patients with acute appendicitis is safe, researchers correlated the interval from the onset of symptoms to the operation (total interval) with the degree of pathology and incidence of postoperative complications.

Prompt appendectomy has long been the standard of care for acute appendicitis because of the risk of progression to advanced pathology. This time-honored practice has recently been challenged by studies in pediatric patients, which suggested that acute appendicitis can be managed electively once antibiotic therapy is initiated. However, no such data are available for adult patients with acute appendicitis.

A retrospective review of 1,081 patients who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis between 1998 and 2004 was conducted. The following parameters were monitored and correlated: demographics, time from onset of symptoms to arrival at the emergency room (patient interval), and from arrival at the emergency room to the operating room (hospital interval), physical findings, computed tomography (CT) scans, pathologic findings, complications, length of stay, and length of antibiotic treatment. The pathological state was graded as follows: Grade 1 (G1) for acute appendicitis, Grade 2 (G2) for gangrenous acute appendicitis, Grade 3 (G3) for perforation or phlegmon, and Grade 4 (G4) for a periappendicular abscess.

The risk of advanced pathology, defined as a higher pathology grade, increased with the total interval. When this interval was less than 12 hours, the risk of developing G1, G2, G3, and G4 was 94%, 0%, 3%, and 3%, respectively.

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: A focus on randomized controlled trials [^113ofTDZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Therefore, given these circumstances, an informed patient choice is crucial, in our opinion. In a study published by Hanson et al. in 2018, 9.4% of the surveyed population responded that they would opt for nonoperative management (NOM) in the case of appendicitis. This number increased to 14.5% when asked about choosing for their children. The study focused on discussing the failure rates of NOM, and indeed, the authors themselves speculate that different numbers would have been obtained if the success rates were presented to patients. A more recent study, published in 2021 by Bom et al. presents very different results. Approximately half of the participants in the average population sample expressed a preference for antibiotics as a treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis, even if it entailed a higher risk of recurrence, in order to avoid surgery initially. Additional rigorous qualitative research will be necessary to investigate the factors behind the strikingly different outcomes observed in these two studies and to gain a deeper understanding of patient preferences in various situations.

We are faced with two therapies that are equivalent in terms of safety, with one being less expensive, less effective, and non-invasive, while the other is more expensive, more effective, and invasive. Beyond the decision of which therapy should be considered first-line, the outcome that could matter the most is the patient's quality of life. Regarding this latter outcome, the diversity of presented results highlights the need for more literature to establish more reliable analyses.

### Antibiotics as first-line alternative to appendicectomy in adult appendicitis: 90-day follow-up from a prospective, multicentre cohort study [^111DQTh9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotics as the first-line treatment for adult acute appendicitis is an accepted but often overlooked strategy. Recent trial evidence has reported that antibiotics can be successful and avoid surgery in the majority of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, both in the short and long term. In addition, international guidelines state that antibiotics are a safe and effective alternative to surgery in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis where imaging has not shown the presence of a faecolith. Despite this, implementation of antibiotics as first-line treatment has not occurred, and laparoscopic appendicectomy remains the first-line treatment for acute appendicitis in Europe and the United States.

The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic raised significant concerns around the choice of surgical intervention: potentially increased morbidity and mortality in those infected with COVID-19 having an operation, and viral transmission via aerosolization during laparoscopy. These concerns led professional surgical societies to recommend non-operative management with antibiotics over surgery as first-line treatment of acute appendicitis. Anticipating a significant shift in practice, the authors designed and implemented a pragmatic, observational, unselected cohort study of management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

The collaborative's previous publication on the first 500 adult patients confirmed a significant shift in practice towards non-operative management of acute appendicitis and a higher number of CT scans (71 percent) performed to aid diagnosis.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: what do meta-analyses say [^112iu4zV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Open appendectomy, albeit largely performed worldwide, is associated with longer pain duration and analgesic consumption, longer time to return to work and sick leave, and higher rates of wound infection compared to laparoscopic appendectomy. Patients were subjected to open appendectomy in the majority of studies included. This may have contributed to the significant differences in pain and analgesic consumption, time to return to work, and wound infection rates observed between antibiotics and surgery groups.

All the studies suffered from several methodological limitations, and the majority of the outcomes studied in individual meta-analyses presented some degree of heterogeneity, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. The study by Hansson et al. showed a very high crossover rate (47.5%) mainly from antibiotics to the appendectomy group, which might have introduced bias to meta-analyses that include this study. Due to the reduced number of enrolled patients, no subgroup analyses were performed to account for possible confounders such as sex, age, diagnostic assessment, surgical procedure (open versus laparoscopic), and use of prophylactic antibiotics, to cite a few. Additionally, unblinded outcome assessment may overestimate the effects of treatment, and lack of allocation concealment may have introduced selection bias to the analysis.

The recently published APPAC randomized clinical trial was a well-designed, adequately powered non-inferiority study comparing antibiotics (ertapenem for 3 days plus levofloxacin and metronidazole for 7 days) to appendectomy. It includes both open and laparoscopic procedures, ensuring comprehensive evaluation of treatment efficacy.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^115HUxd9]. Surgical endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Unequivocal international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with acute appendicitis are lacking. The aim of the consensus meeting 2015 of the EAES was to generate a European guideline based on the best available evidence and expert opinions of a panel of EAES members. After a systematic review of the literature by an international group of surgical research fellows, an expert panel with extensive clinical experience in the management of appendicitis discussed statements and recommendations.

Statements and recommendations with more than 70% agreement by the experts were selected for a web survey and the consensus meeting of the EAES in Bucharest in June 2015. EAES members and attendees at the EAES meeting in Bucharest could vote on these statements and recommendations. In the case of more than 70% agreement, the statement or recommendation was defined as supported by the scientific community. Results from both the web survey and the consensus meeting in Bucharest are presented as percentages.

In total, 46 statements and recommendations were selected for the web survey and consensus meeting. More than 232 members and attendees voted on them. In 41 of 46 statements and recommendations, more than 70% agreement was reached. All 46 statements and recommendations are presented in this paper. They comprise topics regarding the diagnostic work-up, treatment indications, procedural aspects, and post-operative care.

The consensus meeting produced 46 statements and recommendations on the diagnostic work-up and management of appendicitis. The majority of the EAES…

### Variation in classification and postoperative management of complex appendicitis: A European survey [^113bRSEx]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The most common duration of prolonged prophylaxis for complex appendicitis was almost evenly distributed among less than 3 days, 3, 5, and 7 days. About half of the respondents reported that prophylaxis was most often extended beyond 3 postoperative days. A large prospective cohort study demonstrated that 3 and 5 days of postoperative antibiotics result in similar rates of infectious complications, suggesting substantial overtreatment may exist. Another sign of potential overuse of antibiotics is the considerable difference between minimum durations in hospital protocols and the most commonly practiced durations. Randomized studies are needed to confirm whether a reduced course is indeed safe and effective.

Responses from Denmark in this survey were unambiguous: all but one indicated that 3 days of postoperative antibiotics was the minimum as well as the most common duration, which has become the standard there. Responses on duration varied greatly within and between geographical regions, implying considerable variation in care. For an individual patient, this may affect their length of hospital stay and their risk of an infectious complication. On a national or international level, a reduced or prolonged antibiotic course may significantly impact antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance, and hospital costs.

A recent survey among Dutch surgeons and residents demonstrated similar ambiguity concerning appendicitis with localized pus and gangrenous appendicitis: 61% and 38% of 80 respondents indicate…

### Two days versus five days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: Cost analysis of a randomized, noninferiority trial [^111psqAZ]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

This trial demonstrated that two days of postoperative IV antibiotics for complex appendicitis offer statistically significant savings in overall societal costs compared to five days. These savings derive mainly from reduced hospital admissions. Developing strategies to further restrict postoperative antibiotic use and minimize the length of hospital stay may deliver a substantial reduction in health care costs in the future.

### Operation versus antibiotics — The "appendicitis conundrum" continues: A meta-analysis [^114xSNgF]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis continues to constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nonoperative versus surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement (end-of-search date: January 29, 2017). Data on the study design, interventions, participants, and outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers. The random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used to calculate pooled effect estimates when substantial heterogeneity was encountered; otherwise, the fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) model was implemented. Quality assessment of included RCTs was performed using the modified Jadad scale.

- **Results**: Five RCTs were included in this review. Overall, 1,430 adult patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis underwent either nonoperative (n = 727) or operative management (n = 703). Treatment efficacy at the 1-year follow-up was significantly lower (63.8%) for antibiotics compared with the surgery group (93%) [risk ratio (RR), 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60–0.77; p < 0.001]. Overall complications were significantly higher in the surgery group (166/703 [23.6%]) compared with the antibiotics group (56/727 [7.7%]) (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24–0.43; p < 0.001). No difference was found between the two treatment modalities in terms of perforation rates.

### Five-year follow-up of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in the APPAC randomized clinical trial [^116t2rQ3]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The short-term results support antibiotics as an alternative to surgery for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis; however, the long-term outcomes remain unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the late recurrence rate of appendicitis after antibiotic therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study involved a five-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial. The trial compared appendectomy with antibiotic therapy, including 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with computed tomography-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Participants were randomized to undergo an appendectomy (n = 273) or receive antibiotic therapy (n = 257). The initial trial took place from November 2009 to June 2012 in Finland, with the last follow-up on September 6, 2017. This analysis focused on assessing the five-year outcomes for patients treated with antibiotics alone.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included an open appendectomy versus antibiotic therapy with intravenous ertapenem for three days, followed by seven days of oral levofloxacin and metronidazole.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: This analysis reported prespecified secondary end points at the five-year follow-up, which included late appendicitis recurrence (after one year) after antibiotic treatment, complications, length of hospital stay, and sick leave.

- **Results**: Of the 530 patients (201 women; 329 men) enrolled in the trial, 273 patients (median age, 35 years [IQR, 27–46]) were randomized to undergo appendectomy, and 257 (median age, 33 years [IQR, 26–47]) were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy.

### Antibiotics versus placebo in adults with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis (APPAC III): randomized double-blind superiority trial [^114P8Mpw]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been considerable discussion and accumulating robust evidence in both adults and children regarding the efficacy and safety of antibiotics as a feasible treatment alternative for imaging-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, antibiotics were acknowledged as a safe alternative to surgery for uncomplicated acute appendicitis by the American College of Surgeons, as non-operative treatment would allow for limiting inpatient bed use and reallocation of healthcare resources.

The dogma of appendicitis inevitably progressing to perforation without surgery applies to complicated cases, such as obstruction with a faecolith, for which an appendicectomy is indicated unless an abscess is present. However, the majority of patients present with imaging-confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis, where non-operative management with antibiotics is possible.

- **The APPAC III trial**: The APPAC III (APPendicitis ACuta III) trial of antibiotics versus placebo in adults with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis continues research from an initial trial comparing antibiotics with appendicectomy and a recent one comparing oral antibiotics with intravenous followed by oral antibiotics. The trial design was based on the notion that acute appendicitis is similar to diverticulitis, for which uncomplicated disease does require antibiotics. With the increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistance, studies on the rational use of antibiotics are warranted. A Korean single-blind randomized trial reported no difference in treatment failure rates.

### Antibiotics versus appendicectomy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: An updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112CtTPv]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Uncomplicated acute appendicitis has been managed traditionally by early appendicectomy; however, recently, there has been increasing interest in the potential for primary treatment with antibiotics, with studies finding this to be associated with fewer complications than appendicectomy. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of antibiotic therapy with appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Method**: This meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials included adult patients presenting with uncomplicated acute appendicitis treated with antibiotics or appendicectomy. The primary outcome measure was complications. Secondary outcomes included treatment efficacy, hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission rate, and incidence of complicated appendicitis.

- **Results**: Five randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,430 participants (727 undergoing antibiotic therapy and 703 undergoing appendicectomy) were included. There was a 39% risk reduction in overall complication rates in those treated with antibiotics compared with those undergoing appendicectomy (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44–0.83, p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (mean difference 0.25 days, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.56, p = 0.10). In the antibiotic cohort, 123 of 587 patients initially treated successfully with antibiotics were readmitted with symptoms suspicious of re-appendicitis. The incidence of complicated appendicitis was not increased in patients who underwent appendicectomy after "failed" antibiotic treatment (10.8%).

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials [^1156TaFe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing conservative and surgical treatment in a population of adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. We exclusively incorporated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies involving participants with complicated appendicitis or children were excluded. The variables considered are as follows: treatment complications, complication-free treatment success at index admission and at 1-year follow-up, length of hospital stay (LOS), quality of life (QoL), and costs.

- **Results**: Eight RCTs involving 3,213 participants (1,615 antibiotics/1,598 appendectomy) were included. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of complication rates (RR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.61 — 1.04, P = 0.07, I² = 69%). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendectomy (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90, p < 0.00001, I² = 87%) and at 1 year was successful in 540 out of 837 (64.6%, RR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, p < 0.00001, I² = 81%) participants. There was no difference in LOS (mean difference −0.58 days, 95% confidence interval −1.59 to 0.43, p = 0.26, I² = 99%). The trial sequential analysis revealed that, concerning the three primary outcomes, it is improbable that forthcoming RCTs will significantly alter these findings.

The study concludes that while antibiotics can be an alternative to surgery, appendectomy remains more effective and reliable in terms of treatment success without increasing complications.

### Antibiotics-first versus surgery for appendicitis: A US pilot randomized controlled trial allowing outpatient antibiotic management [^117Q4Mzw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The study aimed to assess the feasibility of a multicenter US study comparing antibiotics-first, including outpatient management, with appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. Randomized trials suggest that nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics-first is safe. However, no trial has evaluated outpatient treatment, and no US randomized trial has been conducted to our knowledge.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 5 years or older with uncomplicated appendicitis at one US hospital were randomized to either appendectomy or an antibiotics-first strategy using intravenous ertapenem for greater than or equal to 48 hours, followed by oral cefdinir and metronidazole. Stable antibiotics-first-treated participants older than 13 years could be discharged after greater than or equal to 6-hour emergency department (ED) observation, with next-day follow-up. Outcomes evaluated included the primary outcome of 1-month major complication rate, as well as hospital duration, pain, disability, quality of life, hospital charges, and the appendectomy rate in the antibiotics-first group.

- **Results**: Of 48 eligible patients, 30 (62.5%) consented, with 16 (53.3%) randomized to antibiotics-first and 14 (46.7%) to appendectomy. The median age was 33 years (range 9 to 73 years), with a median white blood cell count of 15,000/μL (range 6,200 to 23,100/μL), and a median computed tomography appendiceal diameter of 10 mm (range 7 to 18 mm). Out of 15 antibiotic-treated adults, 14 (93.3%) were discharged from the ED, and all achieved symptom resolution. At 1 month, major complications occurred in 2 appendectomy participants (14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8% to 42.8%) and 1 antibiotics-first participant (6.3%; 95% CI 0.2% to 30.2%).

The pilot study provides preliminary data supporting the potential feasibility and safety of outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics-first in the US setting.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^112GmDcf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Other limitations included insufficient follow-up in all of the included studies. The rate of re-appendicitis was approximately 23 percent during the first year; it is unknown how much this rate might rise with longer follow-up. Similarly, introducing broad-spectrum antibiotics to a large patient population carries the risk of worsening antibiotic resistance. It could be argued that antibiotics should be reserved for patients with a definitive diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis.

Despite the limitations of the available studies, they provide valuable evidence regarding the outcomes of antibiotic-first versus immediate surgery for acute non-perforated appendicitis. The trade-off between the antibiotic-first approach — potentially 3 percent fewer major complications, 7 percent fewer minor complications, 4 days' shorter sick leave, and 92 percent fewer appendicectomies in the first month — must be balanced against the disadvantages: a 23 percent recurrence rate within 1 year and a slightly longer hospital stay (half a day). Patients averse to surgery are likely to choose an initial trial of antibiotics; those averse to the possibility of recurrence may prefer immediate appendicectomy. Ensuring that the decision is consistent with patients' values and preferences requires shared decision-making.

### A randomized trial comparing antibiotics with appendectomy for appendicitis [^113mMzh6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Antibiotic therapy has been proposed as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of appendicitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial comparing antibiotic therapy (10-day course) with appendectomy in patients with appendicitis at 25 U.S. centers. The primary outcome was 30-day health status, as assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health status; noninferiority margin, 0.05 points). Secondary outcomes included appendectomy in the antibiotics group and complications through 90 days. Analyses were prespecified in subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of an appendicolith.

- **Results**: In total, 1552 adults (414 with an appendicolith) underwent randomization. Of these, 776 were assigned to receive antibiotics (47% of whom were not hospitalized for the index treatment) and 776 to undergo appendectomy (96% of whom underwent a laparoscopic procedure). Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of 30-day EQ-5D scores (mean difference, 0.01 points; 95% confidence interval, -0.001 to 0.03). In the antibiotics group, 29% had undergone appendectomy by 90 days, including 41% of those with an appendicolith and 25% of those without an appendicolith. Complications were more common in the antibiotics group than in the appendectomy group (8.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.98), with the higher rate in the antibiotics group attributed to those with an appendicolith.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^114S5HeT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

While diet approaches varied and included restricting intake to nothing by mouth for 8 to 48 hours, early introduction of oral fluids and a diet as tolerated was used in about one third of trials in which this was specified. This approach appears safe and may promote comfort and facilitate the earliest discharge.

The optimal time to allow for an antibiotic response is unknown. However, of 21 trials that specified a response time threshold, 38% allowed more than 24 to 48 hours and 24% more than 48 to 72 hours, with no related deaths or cases of progression to severe sepsis. Compared with patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, those with complicated appendicitis appear to take longer to respond to antibiotics. For example, in one series of 88 patients with perforated appendicitis complicated by abscess who were treated non-operatively, the mean time to resolution of fever and leukocytosis was approximately 3 days, and the success rate was greater than 95%. In the few trials that described the time to response to conservative antibiotic treatment for patients with clinically and imaging-diagnosed uncomplicated appendicitis, most participants responded within 1 to 2 days.

Since both providers and patients need to know what to expect with conservative care, including atypical responses, additional initial response data from future trials would be helpful. Patients with perforation, which is not identified on CT and may occur in about 20% of cases, likely take longer to respond to antibiotics than those without perforation.
