## Question

Should patient continue Tamiflu if tested and negative for flu

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient should continue Tamiflu (oseltamivir) if they test negative for influenza. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, including timing of symptom onset and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the test characteristics and the likelihood of a false-negative result. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for empiric treatment versus stopping therapy. After that, I need to weigh benefits and harms of continuing or discontinuing oseltamivir. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and state a clear recommendation with caveats for special populations and scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because timing and risk status drive everything here. If the patient is within 48 hours of symptom onset and has a compatible influenza-like illness, empiric treatment is recommended even without confirmation, whereas beyond 48 hours the benefit wanes and decisions hinge on severity and risk factors. I should also confirm whether the patient is high risk for complications, hospitalized, or has severe or progressive disease, as that changes the threshold to treat regardless of test results [^ff426717] [^533ee975] [^e43a63ab].

> Wait, let me verify the test characteristics before jumping to conclusions. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) have high specificity but only moderate sensitivity, so false negatives are common, especially when influenza prevalence is high. Molecular testing improves sensitivity, but even PCR can miss early or late presentations or sampling issues, so a negative test does not reliably exclude influenza in the right clinical context [^e0150a9b] [^cb8209e8].

> I should confirm guideline direction on empiric therapy when influenza is suspected. Multiple high-credibility sources advise not to delay antiviral treatment while awaiting test results, and to treat based on clinical suspicion, particularly for high-risk patients, hospitalized patients, or those with severe or progressive illness. This applies even if the initial test is negative, given the limitations of RIDTs and the time-sensitive benefit of early therapy [^ff426717] [^533ee975] [^e43a63ab] [^ef6f5516].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping therapy just because a test is negative. I need to check the balance of benefits and harms. Benefits of oseltamivir in confirmed influenza include modest shortening of illness and reduced risk of lower respiratory complications and hospitalization, with the clearest benefit when started within 48 hours. Harms are generally mild gastrointestinal effects, with nausea and vomiting being the most common, and rare neuropsychiatric or hypersensitivity events, so the risk-benefit is favorable in suspected influenza even with imperfect tests [^ca349273] [^80b3e287] [^b7909daa] [^98cf6760].

> Let me consider special scenarios where I should continue despite a negative test. If the patient is hospitalized, has severe or progressive disease, is immunocompromised, is pregnant, or is a young child at high risk, guidelines support continuing or initiating treatment irrespective of test results or timing, because the potential benefit outweighs risks and false negatives are not rare in these settings. Conversely, in low-risk, nonsevere outpatients beyond 48 hours with a negative test and low pretest probability, stopping may be reasonable after shared decision-making [^ff426717] [^533ee975] [^e43a63ab] [^ef6f5516] [^f21dc8c6].

> I should double-check the practical decision framework. If the patient is within 48 hours of symptom onset with compatible illness, I would continue oseltamivir regardless of a negative RIDT, and if beyond 48 hours, I would continue if there is severe disease, high-risk status, or strong clinical suspicion, and consider stopping if low risk, mild disease, and pretest probability is low. If the negative result is from a molecular assay and the patient is low risk with an alternative diagnosis likely, stopping is more defensible, but if clinical suspicion remains high, I should treat and, if needed, repeat testing or pursue alternative diagnoses [^ff426717] [^e0150a9b] [^e43a63ab].

> But wait, what if the original indication was prophylaxis rather than treatment. I need to ensure I don't conflate these. For post-exposure prophylaxis, oseltamivir is indicated when started within 48 hours of exposure, and a negative test in the exposed person does not negate the indication, so the prophylaxis course should generally be completed as prescribed if the exposure risk was real and timing criteria were met [^0165d4e3] [^59c05e21].

> In summary, I should confirm that most patients with suspected influenza who test negative should still continue oseltamivir if they are within 48 hours of symptom onset, have severe or progressive disease, are high risk, or have a high pretest probability, because false negatives are common and early therapy confers benefit. Stopping is reasonable mainly for low-risk, nonsevere patients beyond 48 hours with low suspicion and a negative molecular test, after discussing uncertainties and trade-offs with the patient [^ff426717] [^533ee975] [^e43a63ab] [^e0150a9b].

---

Stop Tamiflu if the flu test is negative and the patient is **low risk**, **not severely ill**, and **outside the 48-hour window** from symptom onset, because Tamiflu is ineffective for non-influenza illnesses and offers no benefit in this scenario [^8e9e0df2] [^ca349273]. If the patient is **high risk**, **severely ill**, or **within 48 hours**, continue Tamiflu despite a negative test, as false negatives are common and early treatment can reduce complications [^ff426717] [^e0150a9b]. Always reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative causes if influenza is unlikely [^98cf6760].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the CDC, IDSA, and WHO provide clear guidance on **when to continue or discontinue Tamiflu** based on clinical context:

- **High-risk patients**: Continue Tamiflu regardless of test results if the patient is high risk (e.g. elderly, immunocompromised, chronic lung/heart disease, pregnant) or has severe/complicated/progressive illness, as false negatives are common and early treatment reduces complications [^ff426717] [^533ee975].

- **Low-risk patients**: Consider stopping Tamiflu if the patient is low risk, not severely ill, and outside the 48-hour window from symptom onset, as benefits are minimal and the likelihood of influenza is low [^ff426717] [^533ee975].

- **Within 48 hours**: Even if the test is negative, continue Tamiflu if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, as early treatment provides the greatest benefit [^ff426717] [^533ee975].

---

## Accuracy and limitations of influenza testing

Influenza tests have limitations that must be considered when interpreting negative results:

- **False negatives**: Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) have moderate sensitivity (50–70%), and false negatives are more likely when influenza prevalence is high or sampling is suboptimal [^e0150a9b] [^cb8209e8].

- **Molecular tests**: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is more sensitive but may still yield false negatives due to timing, sampling, or low viral load.

- **Clinical correlation**: Test results must be interpreted in the context of clinical presentation, exposure history, and local influenza activity [^e0150a9b].

---

## Risks and benefits of continuing Tamiflu despite negative test results

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced complications** — early Tamiflu may lower the risk of lower respiratory complications, hospitalization, and death in high-risk or severely ill patients [^ca349273] [^72c19092] — and **symptom relief**, with modest reductions in symptom duration even when started after 48 hours in some cases [^ff426717] [^533ee975].

---

### Potential risks

Potential risks include **adverse effects** such as nausea, vomiting, and rare neuropsychiatric events [^ca349273] [^98cf6760], and **unnecessary treatment** — use without confirmed influenza contributes to drug resistance and unnecessary costs [^8979b577].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| High-risk patient (elderly, immunocompromised, chronic disease, pregnant) | Continue Tamiflu regardless of test result |
| Severe, complicated, or progressive illness | Continue Tamiflu regardless of test result |
| Within 48 hours of symptom onset | Continue Tamiflu regardless of test result |
| Low-risk patient, mild illness, outside 48-hour window | Consider stopping Tamiflu |
| Strong clinical suspicion of influenza despite negative test | Continue Tamiflu |

---

## Alternative diagnoses and management

If influenza is unlikely, **evaluate for alternative causes** (e.g. COVID-19, RSV, bacterial infections) and manage accordingly [^88a802c5]. Consider **repeat testing** with a more sensitive method (e.g. RT-PCR) if influenza remains suspected [^e0150a9b].

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision-making

In sum, **stop Tamiflu if the flu test is negative** in low-risk patients with mild illness who are outside the 48-hour window, as benefits are unlikely. Continue Tamiflu despite a negative test for high-risk patients, those with severe illness, or when treatment began within 48 hours, given the frequency of false negatives and the potential to reduce complications. Always reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative causes if influenza is unlikely [^ff426717] [^533ee975].

Adults

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of TAMIFLU were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral TAMIFLU or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received TAMIFLU 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in men and women.

In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of TAMIFLU.

Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older)

The efficacy of TAMIFLU in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in three seasonal prophylaxis (community outbreak) clinical trials and one post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts. The efficacy endpoint for all of these trials was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza defined as meeting all the following criteria (all signs and symptoms must have been recorded within 24 hours):

oral temperature greater than or equal to 99.0ºF (37.2ºC),
at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion),
at least one constitutional symptom (aches and pain, fatigue, headache, chills/sweats), and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline.

In a pooled analysis of two seasonal prophylaxis trials in healthy unvaccinated adults (aged 18 to 65 years), TAMIFLU 75 mg once daily taken for 42 days during a community outbreak reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza from 5% (25/519) for the placebo group to 1% (6/520) for the TAMIFLU group.

In the seasonal (community outbreak) prophylaxis trial in elderly residents of skilled nursing homes, about 80%, 43%, and 14% of the subjects were vaccinated, had cardiac disorders, and had chronic airway obstructive disorders, respectively. In this trial, subjects were randomized to TAMIFLU 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally for 42 days. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 4% (12/272) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to less than 1% (1/276) in the TAMIFLU-treated subjects.

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, TAMIFLU 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive TAMIFLU treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the TAMIFLU-treated subjects.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^9abb79de]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Policies for Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza

The evidence from randomized controlled trials is clear that oseltamivir treatment decreases the duration of symptoms by up to 1 day in adolescent and adult patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza whose infections are able to be managed in the community. Oseltamivir provides no benefit to patients who have influenza-like illness not caused by influenza virus. Reviews of observational data regarding patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza A(H5N1) infections found that risk for death is cut in half if treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. Small prepandemic observational studies, although they generally have controlled less for potential biases, also support the conclusion that risk for death is decreased with oseltamivir treatment.

These 2 lines of evidence may appear inconsistent. How would an intervention that has a modest effect on symptom duration in patients whose uncomplicated influenza was treated after a visit to a general practitioner be able to cut in half the risk for death among hospitalized patients?

Oseltamivir, an antiviral medication that has been used for influenza prophylaxis and treatment since 1999 and now available as a generic drug, is being considered for over-the-counter (OTC) status to allow individuals to access treatment without a prescription. This proposal has engendered controversy. With the rising availability of at-home diagnostic tests and the ever-present threat of an influenza pandemic, it is timely to revisit issues surrounding this controversy. In this commentary, we examine the potential benefits and risks of reclassifying oseltamivir as an OTC drug to enhance access to rapid influenza treatment. Additionally, we explore alternative models to improve oseltamivir accessibility, potentially utilizing rapid influenza testing. As newer drugs to treat influenza are proven safe and effective, they would be subject to similar considerations.

5.1	Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with TAMIFLU. Stop TAMIFLU and institute appropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of TAMIFLU is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to TAMIFLU [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2	Neuropsychiatric Events

There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving TAMIFLU [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on TAMIFLU usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of TAMIFLU to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor TAMIFLU-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing TAMIFLU for each patient.

5.3	Risk of Bacterial Infections

There is no evidence for efficacy of TAMIFLU in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. TAMIFLU has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.

5.4	Fructose Intolerance in Patients with Hereditary Fructose Intolerance

Fructose can be harmful to patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. One dose of 75 mg TAMIFLU for oral suspension delivers 2 grams of sorbitol. This is above the daily maximum limit of sorbitol for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance and may cause dyspepsia and diarrhea.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^d199116f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A debate about the market-leading influenza antiviral medication, oseltamivir, which initially focused on treatment for generally mild illness, has been expanded to question the wisdom of stockpiling for use in future influenza pandemics. Although randomized controlled trial evidence confirms that oseltamivir will reduce symptom duration by 17–25 hours among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults with community-managed disease, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of oseltamivir against more serious outcomes. Observational studies, although criticized on methodologic grounds, suggest that oseltamivir given early can reduce the risk for death by half among persons hospitalized with confirmed infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. However, available randomized controlled trial data may not be able to capture the effect of oseltamivir use among hospitalized patients with severe disease. We assert that data on outpatients with relatively mild disease should not form the basis for policies on the management of more severe disease.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 28-December 6, 2014 [^ba0e5ad0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On January 21, 2011, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. This guidance remains in effect for the 2014–15 season, and recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). All influenza viruses tested for the 2014–15 season since October 1 have been susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine. Treatment with antivirals is recommended as soon as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza complications §§§. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early. When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might still have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for previously healthy, symptomatic outpatients who are not considered to be at high risk and have confirmed or suspected influenza, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Residents of long-term care facilities can experience severe and fatal illness during influenza outbreaks; residents with confirmed or suspected influenza should be treated with antivirals immediately, without waiting for laboratory confirmation of influenza. During periods where two or more residents of long-term care facilities are ill within 72 hours with confirmed or suspected influenza, antivirals should be given prophylactically to residents and should be considered for any unvaccinated staff. Additionally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be considered for all staff, regardless of vaccination status, if the outbreak is caused by a strain of influenza virus that is not well matched to the vaccine.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A virus infections in humans is available at.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^97ff2131]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^76a30baa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Way Forward

There is general agreement derived from randomized controlled trials about the modest effectiveness of oseltamivir against relatively mild illness in otherwise healthy persons, but several lines of evidence from observational studies suggest that oseltamivir decreases the risk for death. However, within the next 5–10 years, we do not expect to see clarifying new evidence from trials of patients recruited from the community who have an endpoint of severe influenza. Severe outcomes from influenza are uncommon, as shown in the meta-analyses of community trial data, and randomized controlled trials that recruit healthy persons would require extremely large patient numbers and need to be conducted over multiple seasons to account for potentially different outcomes by influenza type and sub-type.

On the other hand, a randomized controlled trial that recruited only patients with severe influenza, although feasible from a design perspective, could not ethically evaluate active treatment versus placebo treatment because oseltamivir treatment is the standard of care for patients with severe influenza virus infections. In a study that overcame the ethical issue, a randomized controlled trial of patients with severe influenza that examined single-dose versus double-dose oseltamivir found no difference in outcomes between the 2 treatment arms. We do not anticipate that this trial would be repeated.

### Clinical utility of advanced microbiology testing tools [^ec60f647]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL UTILITY AND EVIDENCE DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Clinical utility of a test is related to the added value it has for patient management. A test has utility if its results (positive or negative) provide information that is of value to the patient and the provider in making decisions about effective clinical care. It can take the form of improved efficiency in clinical decision making, streamlined clinical workflow, better patient outcomes, and/or cost offsets or avoidance. The level of clinical utility evidence required will likely depend upon a variety of factors, including the current standard of care (SOC), the setting of care, and potential cost offsets to mitigate the added cost of care, as well as the magnitude of the cost of the test itself.

Clinical utility, in the microbial space, is considered to include instances in which new approaches can inform treatment decisions by providing information to key stakeholders, such as the patient, physician, and payers, to diagnose, monitor, and/or predict disease progression. For example, rapid POC influenza testing has been shown in several studies to significantly reduce prescriptions of antimicrobials and increase prescriptions of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in outpatient care clinics. Rapid POC influenza testing can improve antibiotic stewardship and positively impacts patient management via a faster resolution of flu symptoms. Better initial treatment decision making could also influence important outcomes, like morbidity and mortality, for at-risk patient populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised.

2.3	Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post‐exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate dosing is continued.

Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

2.4	Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Table 2 displays the dosage recommendations for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in adults with various stages of renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of less than or equal to 90 mL per minute). Dosage modifications are recommended in adults with an estimated creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL per minute [see Use in Specific Population (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Adolescents and Adults with Chronic Cardiac or Respiratory Disease

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of TAMIFLU (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with TAMIFLU there was a more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.

Geriatric Subjects

Three double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5°F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza-infected; of these, 95% were infected with influenza type A and 5% with influenza type B.

In the pooled analysis, there was a 1-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received TAMIFLU 75 mg twice daily for 5 days compared to those who received placebo (p = NS) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Some seasonal variability was noted in the clinical efficacy outcomes.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors: who, when, where? [^72c19092]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Although the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir were first licensed in 1999, their clinical effectiveness is still hotly debated. Two rigorous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the data from clinical trials conducted in community settings against relatively benign influenza, both suggest that reductions in symptom duration are extremely modest, under one day. Whilst one of these reviews could find no evidence of reductions in complications, the most recent review reported clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in the likelihood of requiring antibiotics (44%) and hospitalizations (63%) in adult patients with confirmed influenza, treated with oseltamivir. A further meta-analysis of observational data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic suggested that, in hospitalised patients, NIs significantly reduced mortality in adults by 25% overall, and by 62% if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, compared with no treatment. But, the effectiveness of NIs in children is far less clear. Taken together, these data suggest that NIs should be reserved for patients with influenza who are at high-risk of complications, or when clinically assessed found to be markedly unwell, or rapidly deteriorating. In such patients, treatment should be initiated empirically, as soon as possible, preferably with follow-on virological confirmation.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) or serious skin reactions. Instruct patients and/or caregiver to stop oseltamivir phosphate capsules and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Neuropsychiatric Events

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of neuropsychiatric events in oseltamivir phosphate capsules-treated patients with influenza and instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience signs of abnormal behavior while receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Important Dosing Information

Instruct patients to begin treatment with oseltamivir phosphate capsules as soon as possible from the first appearance of flu symptoms, within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Similarly, instruct patients to start taking oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prevention as soon as possible after exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to take any missed doses as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose (within 2 hours), and then continue to take oseltamivir phosphate capsules at the usual times.

Influenza Vaccines

Instruct patients that oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not a substitute for receiving an annual flu vaccination. Patients should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate capsules to inhibit replication of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and possibly reduce efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate capsules administration, unless medically necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) [^8979b577]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies: Reduced susceptibility isolates have been obtained during treatment with oseltamivir and from sampling during community surveillance studies. Changes in the viral neuraminidase that have been associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate are summarized in Table 8. The clinical impact of this reduced susceptibility is unknown.

Hemagglutinin (HA) substitutions selected in cell culture and associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir include (influenza virus subtype-specific numbering) A11T, K173E, and R453M in H3N2; and H99Q in influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). In some cases, HA substitutions were selected in conjunction with known NA resistance substitutions and may contribute to reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir; however, the impact of HA substitutions on antiviral activity of oseltamivir in humans is unknown and likely to be strain-dependent.

Selection of influenza A viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies in children. Oseltamivir treatment-associated resistance in pediatric treatment studies has been detected at frequencies of 27 to 37% and 3 to 18% (3/11 to 7/19 and 1/34 to 9/50 post-treatment isolates, respectively) for influenza A/H1N1 virus and influenza A/H3N2 virus, respectively.

In immunocompromised adults and pediatrics (1 year of age and older), selection of influenza viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies than in the otherwise healthy population. In a treatment study of immunocompromised subjects, treatment-associated genotypic resistance was detected in 27% (8/30), 12% (6/52), and 0% (0/42) of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus infections, respectively. Treatment-emergent resistance was observed at a higher frequency in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (32%; 6/19).

The frequency of resistance selection to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such resistant virus vary seasonally and geographically.

Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance-associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US-circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus ("swine flu") was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use TAMIFLU.

Recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). The majority of influenza viruses tested for the 2013–14 season since October 1, 2013, have been susceptible to oseltamivir. The seven oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 viruses identified in late October through November were from three different states in the South and West. Sporadic oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus infections, including small geographic clusters, have occurred previously, but the public health impact has been limited. This situation is being closely monitored. All influenza viruses, including those from the oseltamivir-resistant cluster, tested since October 1, 2013, have been susceptible to zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine.

Moreover, "treatment after 48 hours of symptoms in adults and children with moderate to severe disease or with progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be offered", and "the AAP recommends treatment of children at risk for severe complications of influenza, regardless of duration of symptoms", noting that "Children younger than 2 years are at an increased risk of hospitalization and complications attributable to influenza". For initiation, "Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result because early therapy provides the best outcomes". For otherwise healthy outpatients, they "should be considered for antiviral medication, particularly if they are in contact with other children who either are younger than 6 months… or have high-risk conditions (including age < 5 years)… when influenza viruses are known to be circulating in the community". The report adds that "Algorithms for interpreting positive and negative influenza tests are available" and that "The balance between benefits and harms should be considered when making decisions about the use of NAIs for either treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza".

### Oseltamivir treatment for influenza in adults: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^ca349273]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.

Methods

We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes.

Findings

We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·74–0·85; p < 0·0001). The median times to alleviation were 97·5 h for oseltamivir and 122·7 h for placebo groups (difference -25·2 h, 95% CI -36·2 to -16·0). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0·85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17·8 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0·56, 95% CI 0·42–0·75; p = 0·0001; 4·9% oseltamivir vs 8·7% placebo, risk difference -3·8%, 95% CI -5·0 to -2·2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0·37, 95% CI 0·17–0·81; p = 0·013; 0·6% oseltamivir, 1·7% placebo, risk difference -1·1%, 95% CI -1·4 to -0·3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1·60, 95% CI 1·29–1·99; p < 0·0001; 9·9% oseltamivir vs 6·2% placebo, risk difference 3·7%, 95% CI 1·8–6·1) and vomiting (RR 2·43, 95% CI 1·83–3·23; p < 0·0001; 8·0% oseltamivir vs 3·3% placebo, risk difference 4·7%, 95% CI 2·7–7·3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.

### Rapid diagnostic testing for influenza: information for clinical… [^e0150a9b]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of Testing Results Proper interpretation of testing results, particularly negative testing results is very important. Predictive Value Depends Upon Prevalence The positive and negative predictive values vary considerably depending upon the prevalence of influenza in the patient population being tested.
- False-positive influenza test results are more likely to occur when disease prevalence is low, which is generally at the beginning and end of the influenza season.
- False-negative influenza test results are more likely to occur when disease prevalence is high, which is typically at the height of the influenza season. Clinical Considerations of Testing When Influenza Prevalence is Low When influenza prevalence is relatively high, the NPV is low and false-negative test results are more likely. When influenza prevalence is high, the PPV is high and positive results are more likely to be true.

The false negative rate is the number of false negatives/number of total positives, or 1-NPV. The interpretation of negative results should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient and the prevalence of influenza in the patient population being tested. If an important clinical decision is affected by the test result and influenza is still suspected, then the RIDT result should be confirmed by a molecular assay, such as RT-PCR. Clinical Considerations of Testing When Influenza Prevalence Is High When influenza prevalence is relatively high, the NPV is low and false-negative test results are more likely. When influenza prevalence is high, the PPV is high and positive results are more likely to be true. The false negative rate is the number of false negatives/number of total positives, or 1-NPV.

The interpretation of negative results should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient and the prevalence of influenza in the patient population being tested. If an important clinical decision is affected by the test result and influenza is still suspected, then the RIDT result should be confirmed by a molecular assay, such as RT-PCR. Changes in Recommended Procedures Can Affect Test Results Modification by the user can affect test performances and increase false-positive and/or false-negative rates. Such modifications include:

- Using specimens for which the test is not optimized
- Using swabs that did not come with the rapid influenza diagnostic test kits [unless recommended (see package insert for specific instructions
- Improper storage or prolonged storage before specimens are tested.

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 mg to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8ºC),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

14.1 Treatment of Influenza

Adults Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Oseltamivir phosphate is an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) indicated for:

- Treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. (1.1)

- Prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. (1.2)

Limitations of Use:

- Not a substitute for annual influenza vaccination. (1.3)

- Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use. (1.3)

- Not recommended for patients with end‐stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis. (1.3)

1.1	Treatment of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate is indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours.

1.2	Prophylaxis of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate is indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older.

1.3	Limitations of Use

- Oseltamivir phosphate is not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

- Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- Oseltamivir phosphate is not recommended for patients with end‐stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Table
Conclusions of study evaluating the use of oseltamivir for seasonal and pandemic influenza and wisdom of stockpiling*

*RCT, randomized controlled trial; ICU, intensive care unit.

The details of study design may be best accomplished by an experienced group of international researchers, focusing on standardized recruitment procedures and covariate and outcome definitions with a clearly defined analysis plan designed to minimize bias, as far as possible. Funding for such studies could come from the public or private sectors, with prior safeguards on perceptions of conflicts of interest. The studies should be adaptable to evaluate new antiviral medications, including intravenous forms of the NAIs, newly licensed non-NAI antiviral agents that are currently in late-phase clinical trials, or adjunctive therapies and immunomodulatory agents. Combinations of novel drugs with existing NAIs will likely be a useful approach and will require evaluation. Plans for ensuring broad availability and regulatory approval for emergency use of unlicensed antiviral agents will need to be established on very short notice. If pragmatic trials or high-quality prospective observational studies are completed and published over the next decade, an improved evidence base may help clinicians and public health planners decide on the most appropriate use of oseltamivir and potential new influenza antiviral agents for patients with severe infections caused by seasonal or pandemic influenza.

Oseltamivir Treatment of Seasonal Influenza

After partially successful efforts to retrieve unpublished data from Roche, the Cochrane group conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating uncomplicated community-acquired influenza. Their findings led the group to conclude that oseltamivir had no specific antiviral effect, even though the drug had been specifically designed to achieve exactly that. The Cochrane systematic review, which focused only on an intention-to-treat analysis, confirmed that oseltamivir reduced symptom duration in the intention-to-treat group by < 24 hours. Earlier, the Cochrane group had noted, "We are unsure of the generalizability of our conclusions from seasonal to pandemic or avian influenza".

As noted previously, a subsequent meta-analysis (funded by an unrestricted grant from Roche) also confirmed a ≈1-day reduction in symptoms among adults and adolescents who had laboratory-confirmed influenza and were treated within 48 hours of symptom onset. This analysis included outcomes of both intention-to-treat and intention-to-treat-infected groups. Benefit was found for the intention-to-treat-infected group, but no benefit was found for patients with influenza-like illness who did not have laboratory-confirmed influenza (the intention-to-treat but not infected group). Given that the benefit of oseltamivir was confined to symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, the authors concluded that the effect of oseltamivir was due to its effect on the influenza virus, rather than a nonspecific antiviral effect, as had been suggested by the Cochrane group.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosing is continued.

Selection of studies

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials testing the effects of oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Treatment was the use of oseltamivir in people showing signs of influenza-like illness that might be caused by influenza A and B viruses. Prophylaxis was the mode of use of oseltamivir when there was expectation of possible exposure to influenza in the near future. Post-exposure prophylaxis was the use of oseltamivir after probable exposure to influenza but before symptoms developed. Studies which were open label, and those not involving naturally occurring influenza were excluded.

Because of discrepancies between published and unpublished reports of the same trials, we decided to include only those trials for which we had unabridged clinical study reports. Two authors (PD and TJ) reapplied inclusion criteria for the full clinical study reports received in 2013 and resolved disagreements through discussion.

Types of participants

Randomised controlled trials had to be in children and adults who either were healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension) but excluding people whose immune system had been affected by diseases such as malignancy or HIV infection. Exposure had to be naturally occurring influenza, with or without symptoms.

We analysed the intention to treat and safety populations, as our previous review had discovered compelling evidence that the intention to treat influenza infected subpopulation deemed to be influenza infected was not balanced between treatment groups in the oseltamivir trials. In addition, estimates from the intention to treat population are generalisable to clinical practice where routine testing for influenza is not common in many countries (and even where used, remains of variable accuracy).

Types of interventions

We included trials of neuraminidase inhibitors administered by any route compared with placebo during the period in which treatment was assumed and during the follow-up ("on-treatment" and "off-treatment") periods.

Types of outcomes

We divided the outcomes of clinical interest into primary and secondary by indication:

Primary outcome measures for treatment studies — symptom relief, admission to hospital, complications, and harms.

Secondary outcome measures for treatment studies — symptom relapse after finishing treatment, drug resistance, viral excretion, and mortality.

Primary outcome measures for prophylaxis studies — influenza (symptomatic and asymptomatic, always with laboratory confirmation) and influenza-like illness, admission to hospital, complications, interruption of transmission (in its two components, reduction of viral spread from index cases and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts), and harms.

Secondary outcome measures for prophylaxis studies — drug resistance, viral excretion, and mortality.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1, 2017-February 3, 2018 [^ff426717]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to reduce illness duration and severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. Treatment with influenza antiviral medications initiated as close to the onset of illness as possible is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are not hospitalized but who are at high risk for developing serious influenza complications. Treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results of testing or even if rapid antigen-detection influenza diagnostic test results are negative. Clinical benefit of antiviral treatment is greatest when treatment begins within 48 hours after symptom onset; however, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients. A CDC health advisory released on December 27, 2017, regarding treatment with antiviral medications is available at.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online.

### Modeling influenza antiviral strategies: reducing burden and preventing resistance [^02ce6110]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Seasonal influenza remains a major cause of disease and death globally, leading to an estimated 290 000–650 000 deaths each year and causing many more people to be hospitalized. Annual vaccination campaigns help reduce that burden but are impeded by low coverage (< 50% of people receive the vaccine in a typical season) and limited vaccine effectiveness due to the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, which makes it challenging to match vaccine strains to circulating strains. Antiviral drugs are used both therapeutically to reduce illness duration and complications and, much less frequently, prophylactically to prevent illness, particularly in high-risk individuals. If taken shortly after the onset of symptoms, antivirals can reduce infectiousness and thereby reduce virus transmission to individuals who come in contact with treated case patients. In addition to mitigating the seasonal burden of influenza, antivirals are stockpiled by the United States and other nations as a first line of defense against novel influenza viruses that spill over from wild or domesticated animals, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) observed in humans in the United States in 2024.

Two classes of antivirals are currently recommended for influenza treatment in the United States: the neuraminidase inhibitors, including the most commonly prescribed antiviral oseltamivir which is approved for all ages (brand name Tamiflu), and the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, approved for adults and children aged ≥ 5 years (brand name Xofluza; referred to as baloxavir hereafter). In Europe, baloxavir is approved for treatment and prevention of influenza starting at 1 year of age. Baloxavir and oseltamivir are effective in reducing the duration of symptoms in patients treated for influenza A virus illness, but clinical trial data indicate that upper respiratory tract infectious viral titers decrease faster in baloxavir-treated than oseltamivir-treated patients. Findings from prior observational studies and a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oseltamivir treatment indicate that its timely use may reduce virus transmission to household contacts. Observational data indicate that baloxavir treatment also reduces the risk of onward virus transmission to close contacts, and a randomized placebo-controlled trial measured this effect.

### Oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir) [^139bfbe8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of oseltamivir phosphate.

Adolescents and Adults with Chronic Cardiac or Respiratory Disease

A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with oseltamivir phosphate there was a more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.

Geriatric Subjects

Three double‐blind placebo‐controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5°F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza‐infected; of these, 95% were infected with influenza type A and 5% with influenza type B.

In the pooled analysis, there was a 1‐day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza‐infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice daily for 5 days compared to those who received placebo (p = NS) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Some seasonal variability was noted in the clinical efficacy outcomes.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^a1e59af2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Treatment of Severe Influenza

Although necessary to consider oseltamivir's effect on more serious infections, no randomized controlled trials exist that can be included in a meta-analysis. The Cochrane group chooses only to conduct meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, which are generally accepted to be the highest level of evidence. Thus, the Cochrane group could not review severe outcomes of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Evidence is instead derived from observational studies on the use of oseltamivir to treat complications of influenza virus infection, as in hospitalized patients or in those who died. These studies are subject to uncontrolled bias. For instance, sicker patients may be more (or less) likely to be treated, thus attenuating (or exaggerating) the effect of the intervention. Also, a serious outcome may occur soon after the treatment was initiated in a severely ill patient, so that the treatment has not had a chance to succeed. Similarly, patients who receive early treatment are more likely to benefit from treatment than patients who receive late treatment. To minimize bias, researchers conducting observational studies have attempted to adjust for time from disease onset to treatment and time from treatment to outcome. Some observational studies have also adjusted for propensity to be treated as well as patient coexisting conditions and disease severity, which may affect treatment decisions and outcomes.

Observational studies that enrolled adults have often used death as an outcome, given its ease of definition. However, many observational studies fail to control completely for potential biases, including time biases. Among studies that have attempted to control for these biases, a decreased risk for death after oseltamivir treatment has been reported, and early treatment appears to be critical. For instance, in a retrospective cohort study from Israel of 449 patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, all patients were treated with oseltamivir, and 189 (42%) were treated within 48 hours. This observational study controlled for propensity to treat and patient coexisting conditions and demonstrated the odds of death increased by 2.2 times (95% CI 1.4–3.5 times) if treatment was started late (> 48 hours after symptom onset).

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^32e378ab]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza was one of the most clinically burdensome respiratory viruses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 29 million cases, 380 000 hospitalizations, and 28 000 deaths from influenza in the US during the 2018 to 2019 season. While COVID-19 led to a temporary reduction in infections, influenza is now expected to have a resurgence. Novel strains or a rise in a relatively less immune population could trigger an influenza pandemic resembling the crises experienced in 1968 or 2009. As such, the availability of safe and effective treatments is critical to avoid overwhelming health care systems and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a breakthrough in the COVID-19 pandemic occurred when outpatient randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in hospitalization and death. In contrast, despite the substantial threat that influenza poses, there are no evidence-based outpatient treatments proven to prevent the progression to hospitalization.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an antiviral that is commonly prescribed to outpatients with influenza to accelerate recovery and prevent complications. Detailing by key opinion leaders, guideline panels, and the manufacturer has even led to stockpiling of the medication as part of national pandemic responses. Yet, despite guideline recommendations, and millions of doses prescribed, it is unclear whether oseltamivir reduces severe complications requiring hospitalization. Three prior systematic reviews (1 independent and 2 supported by the manufacturer) have arrived at different conclusions. Since these publications, several large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been completed and have yet to be meta-analyzed. We, therefore, sought to clarify whether oseltamivir is a high-value medical treatment (achieving optimal results for patients balanced with an efficient use of resources). To do so, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of oseltamivir for the prevention of first hospitalization in adolescent and adult outpatients (efficacy) and treatment-associated adverse events (safety).

Supporting data include a randomized trial from 1991–1995 in which amantadine or rimantadine for 14 days (and for 7 days after the last confirmed influenza case) controlled outbreaks compared to 21 days, other reports using oseltamivir or zanamivir for 7–14 days, typical incubation 1–3 days (up to 4 days) with a mean serial interval of approximately 2–3 days, viral RNA detection for approximately 4–7 days after symptom onset with immunosuppressed, hospitalized and critically ill patients able to have prolonged shedding, household data showing transmission substantially reduced > 3 days after symptom onset but more than one-third with viral RNA detected at 7 days, and CDC guidance to administer chemoprophylaxis initially for 14 days and continue until 7 days after the last case has been identified if new cases continue to occur.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2024–2025: policy statement [^ef6f5516]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Influenza treatment recommendations — antiviral medications are an important adjunct in the control of influenza but are not a substitute for influenza vaccination, and clinicians should promptly identify patients suspected of having influenza for timely initiation of antiviral treatment when indicated. The AAP considers oseltamivir the preferred antiviral medication for patients with influenza A and B. Although best results are observed when the child is treated within 48 hours of symptom onset, antiviral therapy should still be considered beyond 48 hours in certain cases. Antiviral treatment should be offered as early as possible to the following individuals, regardless of influenza vaccination status and duration of symptoms: any child hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza disease; any child with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza disease; and any child with suspected or confirmed influenza disease of any severity if they are younger than 5 years or they belong to other high-risk groups for influenza complications, regardless of health care setting. Treatment may be considered in the outpatient setting for any child with suspected or confirmed influenza disease who is not at high risk for influenza complications if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset, and for any child with suspected or confirmed influenza disease whose siblings or household contacts are either younger than 6 months or at high risk for influenza complications. Initiation of antiviral therapy should be based on signs and symptoms and epidemiologic factors, and provision of antiviral therapy does not require a positive test for influenza.

Secondary analyses from the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis suggested the following: a 63% (95% CI 19%–83%) decreased risk in hospitalization for any cause, based on 9/1,591 (0.6%) oseltamivir treated vs 22/1,302 (1.7%) placebo-treated patients; and a 44% (95% CI 25%–58%) decreased risk of antibiotic prescription for lower respiratory disease in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, based on 65/1,544 (4.2%) oseltamivir-treated vs 110/1,263 (8.7%) placebo-treated patients. However, hospital admissions were all cause and not confined to those that may have been associated with influenza infection; also, no formal diagnostic criteria existed for lower respiratory tract infection. We consider these secondary analyses less convincing than the analyses of primary endpoints. The latter were largely in agreement with those of the Cochrane group. Yet, despite this agreement and the arm's length funding mechanism, the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis has been criticized as being influenced by the manufacturer.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2017–2018 [^d2a46fcc]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Influenza testing and antiviral role — immunofluorescence assays may be an alternative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, although the sensitivity is lower, and early detection, prompt antiviral treatment, and infection control interventions can lead to improved individual patient outcomes and allow for effective cohorting and disease containment. Randomized placebo-controlled studies revealed that oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir were efficacious when administered as chemoprophylaxis to household contacts after a family member had laboratory-confirmed influenza, and during the 2009 pandemic the emergence of oseltamivir resistance was noted among people receiving postexposure prophylaxis. Antiviral medications currently licensed are important adjuncts to influenza vaccination for control and prevention of influenza disease, and toxicities are associated with antiviral agents, and indiscriminate use might limit availability.

### Update: influenza activity – United States, September 28, 2014-February 21, 2015 [^533ee975]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

CDC recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after illness onset (ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset) for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is hospitalized, has severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza-associated complications, including children aged < 2 years and adults aged ≥ 65 years. However, even when started after 48 hours of illness onset, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients. Antiviral treatment decisions should not be delayed awaiting laboratory confirmation of influenza.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

What is already known on this topic?

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. The timing and severity of circulating influenza viruses can vary by geographic location and season.

What is added by this report?

Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in mid-November, remained elevated through February 21, 2015, and is expected to continue for several more weeks. This has been an especially severe season for adults aged ≥ 65 years; this group has the highest recorded influenza-associated hospitalization rate and accounts for the majority of pneumonia and influenza–associated deaths this season. During September 28, 2014–February 21, 2015, influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Characterization data indicate that most of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses have antigenically or genetically drifted and are different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The vast majority of currently circulating influenza viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although vaccine effectiveness is reduced this season, influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Antiviral medications are more important than usual as an adjunct to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for influenza complications, including adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Oseltamivir [^b7f93670]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules during a community outbreak.

 Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosing is continued.

 Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

 Table 1: Oseltamivir Phosphate Dosage Recommendations in Pediatric Patients for Treatment and Prophylaxis of Influenza

*The recommended duration for post-exposure prophylaxis is 10 days and the recommended duration for community outbreak (seasonal/pre-exposure) prophylaxis is up to 6 weeks (or up to 12 weeks in immunocompromised patients). The amount supplied (e.g., number of bottles or capsules) for seasonal prophylaxis may be greater than for post-exposure prophylaxis.

†Use an oral dosing dispensing device that measures the appropriate volume in mL with the oral suspension.

‡Oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is the preferred formulation for patients who cannot swallow capsules.

§For patients less than 1 year of age, provide an appropriate dosing device that can accurately measure and administer small volumes.

### Oseltamivir phosphate [^e502f05d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.

 Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age) The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8°C),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 30, 2012-February 9, 2013 [^445d395a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Vaccination remains the first and best way to prevent influenza and its complications. Health-care providers should continue to offer vaccine to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 6 months throughout the influenza season. Interim vaccine effectiveness estimates suggest that effectiveness against influenza A (H3N2) viruses is lower and not statistically significant in adults aged ≥ 65 years during the 2012–13 influenza season. Adults aged ≥ 65 years are at the greatest risk for hospitalization and death from influenza-associated complications; therefore, it is important for them to receive their annual influenza vaccine, take everyday preventive actions, and seek medical care quickly if they develop ILI symptoms to see if treatment with antiviral medications is needed. Antiviral medications remain an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. Recommended antiviral medications are oseltamivir and zanamivir. Early and aggressive treatment with antiviral medication is crucial, ideally within the first 48 hours of illness onset, and persons with suspected influenza infection who are at high risk, including adults aged ≥ 65 years, should be treated with antiviral medications without the need to wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza. However, as indicated by observational studies, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Recent data on influenza antiviral resistance indicate that > 99% of currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these medications.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^e912a650]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

### Management of influenza [^0355ee94]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Influenza is a contagious airborne viral illness characterized by abrupt onset of symptoms. Fever, myalgia, headache, rhinitis, sore throat, and cough are commonly reported symptoms. The diagnosis should be made clinically, and the decision to begin antiviral therapy should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of influenza. The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is expected to continue to circulate during the 2010–2011 season, but it is not certain whether it will replace or cocirculate with seasonal influenza A subtypes that have been circulating since 1977. The 2009 H1N1 virus is largely resistant to adamantanes, but it is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir. Neuraminidase inhibitors have modest effectiveness in reducing influenza-related symptoms in patients at low risk of complications. Patients at high risk of complications, including pregnant women, should be treated with antiviral agents, preferably within 48 hours of symptom onset. Family physicians should follow guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when treating patients with influenza or influenza-like symptoms.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^f5c88bb0]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Oseltamivir's effect on complications such as bronchitis and "pneumonia", which were originally considered in trial protocols to be secondary or tertiary endpoints (if they were prespecified at all), would have been clarified with better clinical definitions and investigations, as was done for serious adverse events. These benefited from a paragraph length narrative, which reported most of the salient features of the event.

In prophylactic trials, oseltamivir reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza but there is no evidence that it reduces symptomatic influenza-like illness. Oseltamivir reduces the number of participants receiving prophylaxis who tested positive (based on increases in antibody titre or culture test results, or both). However this finding is weakened by oseltamivir's interference with the viral replication on the swab and effect on antibody production. In addition, oseltamivir does not affect asymptomatic influenza and there is no evidence that it interferes with person to person spread.

Similar to the FDA, because of the problems with the design of study WV15799 we could not draw any conclusions on the ability of oseltamivir to interrupt viral transmission.

This is important, as the results of trial WV15799 formed part of the WHOrationale for use of the drug to interrupt transmission from person to person and to allow time before the arrival of vaccines in the event of a pandemic, furnishing a seemingly powerful rationale for stockpiling oseltamivir. This shows the importance of availability of full clinical study reports, something WHO did not have.

Strengths and weaknesses of this review

For the first time a Cochrane review (on neuraminidase inhibitors, of which this review is part) is based on all relevant full clinical study reports of a family of drugs, integrated by regulatory comments. Also for the first time, all clinical study reports of trials in a manufacturer's programme (regardless of their relevance to the review) are available to readers without any restriction (apart from minimal redactions to further protect against the risk of re-identification of participants). The role of the BMJ in keeping the issue in the public eye for four years until it was resolved should be recognised. Examples of benefits in accessing full clinical study reports include assessment of reliability of some outcome definitions (for example, "pneumonia"), a considerable amount of data on potential harms, and avoided reliance of conclusions on published papers, which themselves may have hitherto unseen unpublished material included.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2015–2016 [^570578c5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics influenza antiviral management — oseltamivir use and timing are outlined as follows: Treatment with oseltamivir for children with presumed serious, complicated, or progressive disease, irrespective of immunization status or whether illness began > 48 hours before admission, continues to be recommended by the AAP, CDC, and Infectious Diseases Society of America, and earlier treatment provides better clinical responses; treatment after 48 hours of symptoms in adults and children with moderate to severe disease or with progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be strongly considered. Children younger than 2 years are at an increased risk of hospitalization and complications; the FDA has licensed oseltamivir for children as young as 2 weeks of age, and AAP believes that oseltamivir can be used to treat influenza in both term and preterm infants from birth because benefits of therapy are likely to outweigh possible risks of treatment. In adverse event data, the only statistically-attributable adverse effect that was greater in 1- through 13-year-old children was vomiting (15% of treated versus 9% receiving placebo). A randomized, prospective trial with 75% of subjects younger than 15 years documented no benefit of double-dose therapy over standard-dose therapy. Clinical judgment is important, and antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result.

### Evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for suspected influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, 2009–2010 [^197aa91b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To assess adherence to real-time changes in guidelines for influenza diagnosis and use of oseltamivir during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, we reviewed medical records of patients with confirmed or suspected influenza-like illness (ILI) and those with no viral testing in a large Los Angeles (California, USA) hospital. Of 882 tested patients, 178 had results positive for influenza; 136 of the remaining patients received oseltamivir despite negative or no results. Oseltamivir use was consistent with national recommendations in > 90%. Of inpatients, children were less likely than adults to have ILI at testing and to receive oseltamivir if ILI was found. Of outpatients, children were more likely to have positive test results; 20% tested did not have ILI or other influenza signs and symptoms. Twenty-five of 96 test-positive patients and 13 of 19 with lower respiratory tract disease were, inappropriately, not treated. Variations between practice and national recommendations could inform clinical education in future influenza seasons.

### Oseltamivir (oseltamivir phosphate) [^0f8bd49c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of oseltamivir phosphate.

Adolescents and Adults with Chronic Cardiac or Respiratory Disease

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with oseltamivir phosphate there was a more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.

Geriatric Subjects

Three double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5°F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza-infected; of these, 95% were infected with influenza type A and 5% with influenza type B.

In the pooled analysis, there was a 1-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice daily for 5 days compared to those who received placebo (p = NS) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Some seasonal variability was noted in the clinical efficacy outcomes.

### Influenza in the emergency department: vaccination, diagnosis, and treatment: clinical practice paper approved by American academy of emergency medicine clinical guidelines committee [^cb8209e8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Influenza is an acute respiratory virus that results in significant worldwide morbidity and mortality each year. As emergency physicians, we are often the first to encounter patients with seasonal influenza. It is therefore critical that we draw on the most recent and relevant research when we make clinical decisions regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of this disease.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search from August 2009 to August 2015 was performed using the keywords influenza vaccination efficacy AND systematic, influenza AND rapid antigen testing, and Oseltamivir AND systematic, while limiting the search to human studies written in the English language. General review articles and case reports were omitted. Each of the selected articles then underwent a structured review.

Results

We identified 163 articles through our literature search, of which 68 were found to be relevant to our clinical questions. These studies then underwent a rigorous review from which recommendations were given.

Conclusions

Influenza vaccine efficacy continues to range between 40% and 80%. Vaccination has the potential to decrease disease severity and is recommended for individuals older than 6 months of age. If resources permit, vaccination can be offered to patients presenting to the emergency department. Rapid antigen detection for influenza is a simple bedside test with high specificity, but generally low sensitivity. If a patient presents with a syndrome consistent with influenza and has negative rapid antigen detection, they should either receive a confirmatory reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or be treated as if they have influenza. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors can decrease the duration of influenza and is recommended in hospitalized patients, or in those with high risk of complications.

### Oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir) [^30e02cba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In immunocompromised adults and pediatrics (1 year of age and older), selection of influenza viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies than in the otherwise healthy population. In a treatment study of immunocompromised subjects, treatment‐associated genotypic resistance was detected in 27% (8/30), 12% (6/52), and 0% (0/42) of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus infections, respectively. Treatment‐emergent resistance was observed at a higher frequency in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (32%; 6/19).

The frequency of resistance selection to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such resistant virus vary seasonally and geographically.

Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance‐associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance‐associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US‐circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus ("swine flu") was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate.

Regarding medical management for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to choice and duration of antiviral agent, IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider continuing antiviral treatment for longer durations in patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization for severe lower respiratory tract disease (especially pneumonia or ARDS), as influenza viral replication is often protracted.

### Influenza antiviral medications: summary for clinicians… [^88a802c5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- Clinicians should be aware that a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result does not preclude influenza virus infection. For hospitalized patients with suspected influenza who are started on empiric antiviral treatment with oseltamivir, use of influenza molecular assays or multiplex assays that detect both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can inform clinical management.
- Clinicians should be aware that a positive influenza test result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For hospitalized patients with a positive influenza test result, antiviral treatment of influenza with oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible, and clinicians should also follow guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and other respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection if clinically indicated, while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 testing results.
- If a hospitalized patient treated with oseltamivir or peramivir manifests progressive lower respiratory symptoms, resistant virus should be considered. However, clinicians should note that failure to improve or clinical deterioration during oseltamivir or peramivir treatment is more likely to be related to the natural history of acute lung injury and inflammatory damage or onset of other complications than to emergence of oseltamivir or peramivir resistance.
- A secondary analysis of a multi-center unblinded clinical trial of oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours of enrollment after hospital admission versus standard of care in adults hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection reported that oseltamivir treatment lowered the risk of clinical failure in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza; clinical failure was defined as failure to improve with 7 days, transfer to ICU care 24 hours after admission, or rehospitalization or death within 30 days.
- Several observational studies in hospitalized influenza patients have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment compared with no treatment, particularly when started within two days of illness onset, or as soon as possible after hospital admission, including reducing the duration of hospitalization, and reducing the risk of ICU transfer, invasive mechanical ventilation or risk of.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) indicated for:

Treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. (1.1)
Prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. (1.2)

Limitations of Use:

Not a substitute for annual influenza vaccination. (1.3)
Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use. (1.3)
Not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis. (1.3)

1.1 Treatment of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours.

1.2 Prophylaxis of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate capsules [see Microbiology (12.4)].
Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- Serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme: Discontinue oseltamivir phosphate capsules and initiate appropriate treatment if allergic-like reactions occur or are suspected. (5.1)

- **Neuropsychiatric events**: Patients with influenza, including those receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules, particularly pediatric patients, may be at an increased risk of confusion or abnormal behavior early in their illness. Monitor for signs of abnormal behavior. (5.2)

5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with oseltamivir phosphate capsules. Stop oseltamivir phosphate capsules and institute appropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of oseltamivir phosphate capsules is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir phosphate [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Neuropsychiatric Events

There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir phosphate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir phosphate usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir phosphate to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor oseltamivir phosphate capsules-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing oseltamivir phosphate capsules for each patient.

5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections

There is no evidence for efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate capsules in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Oseltamivir phosphate capsules has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^23860183]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — management when oseltamivir resistance is suspected states that patients previously treated with oseltamivir and suspected of developing oseltamivir resistance should be switched to inhaled zanamivir, unless contraindicated. Inhaled zanamivir is FDA approved for children aged ≥ 5 years for chemoprophylaxis and ≥ 7 years for treatment, but options for treating oseltamivir-resistant virus are limited; clinicians should evaluate reliable use in children 5–7 years old and seek expert consultation for management of antiviral-resistant influenza viruses.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in pregnancy [^f21dc8c6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pregnancy predisposes women to disproportionate morbidity and mortality from influenza infections. This is true for both seasonal epidemics as well as occasional pandemics. Inactivated yearly influenza vaccines are the best available method of disease prevention and are recommended for all pregnant women in any trimester of pregnancy and postpartum. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu(®)) is currently the first-line recommended and most commonly used pharmaceutical agent for influenza prophylaxis and treatment. Oseltamivir has been demonstrated to prevent disease among exposed individuals, as well as to shorten the duration of illness and lessen the likelihood of complications among those infected. The physiologic adaptations of pregnancy may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this important drug. Updated evidence regarding these potential alterations, current knowledge gaps, and future investigative directions is discussed.
