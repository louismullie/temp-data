## Question

What are the most common hormonal imbalances causing irregular menses?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common hormonal imbalances causing irregular menses, with a prioritized list and supporting epidemiology and mechanisms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "irregular menses" and anchor the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the most prevalent etiologies and quantify their contributions. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology for each leading cause to ensure mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should review age-specific modifiers that change the differential. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list and double-check that the cited frequencies align with contemporary guidelines and cohort data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definitions so I don't misclassify normal variants as disease. Irregular menses spans oligomenorrhea (infrequent bleeding, typically > 35 days or < 8 cycles/year), amenorrhea (absence of menses for > 3 months in previously regular cycles or > 6 months in previously irregular cycles), and polymenorrhea/menorrhagia (frequent or heavy bleeding), and these patterns often reflect ovulatory dysfunction rather than structural causes, which I need to keep in mind as I proceed [^1117ZBmJ] [^1162BSCB] [^114YBV2M]. Hold on, I should verify adolescent norms too: cycles are often anovulatory in the first 1–3 years after menarche, so I must interpret adolescent irregularity in gynecologic age context to avoid overdiagnosis [^1162BSCB] [^114dm7Pf].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework to ensure I'm attributing causes correctly. The FIGO HyPO-P classification organizes ovulatory disorders by anatomic level (Hypothalamic, Pituitary, Ovarian, and PCOS as a separate category), which helps me map etiologies and avoid premature closure; I need to check that my final list aligns with this structure and that I've excluded pregnancy and iatrogenic causes before labeling a hormonal imbalance [^114YBV2M] [^1117ZBmJ]. I should confirm that initial labs typically include pregnancy testing, TSH, prolactin, and gonadotropins, with additional testing individualized, because this shapes which hormonal imbalances surface most often in practice [^116htbJC].

> Now, let me consider the most common cause: polycystic ovary syndrome. PCOS is the leading endocrine cause of irregular menses in reproductive-age women, with a prevalence around 8–13% and a very high association with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea; I should double-check that this remains consistent across contemporary cohorts and guidelines, and yes, multiple high-quality sources corroborate this range and its dominance among anovulatory etiologies [^117DMjou] [^114NbQzh] [^114XiTQi]. Wait, let me verify the strength of association: among women with oligomenorrhea, 80–90% will meet PCOS criteria, and among those with amenorrhea, about 40% will have PCOS, which underscores why PCOS rises to the top of the list for irregular menses presentations [^112Kce19] [^1166DBVf].

> I will now examine the mechanism to ensure plausibility. PCOS reflects a triad of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and often polycystic ovarian morphology; insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia amplify ovarian androgen production, suppress SHBG, and drive LH hypersecretion, which together arrest follicular development and cause oligo/anovulation with long, irregular cycles; I should confirm that this mechanistic chain is supported by guidelines and reviews, and it is [^114NbQzh] [^114XiTQi]. Hold on, I should verify the metabolic links: hyperinsulinemia lowers SHBG and increases free androgens, reinforcing the cycle of anovulation and cycle irregularity, which also explains the elevated cardiometabolic risk seen in PCOS and in women with irregular cycles more broadly [^114HZwsc] [^117DMjou].

> Next, I should review functional hypothalamic amenorrhea as the second most common hormonal cause. FHA arises from energy deficiency due to low weight, excessive exercise, or psychosocial stress, suppressing GnRH pulsatility and causing low gonadotropins with hypoestrogenism; I need to ensure I'm not conflating FHA with other hypothalamic causes, and the Endocrine Society guidance supports FHA as a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out organic pathology [^116mUo51] [^115ZCKCU]. Let me verify prevalence signals: FHA and related hypothalamic causes account for roughly 35% of secondary amenorrhea in reproductive-age women, which places it immediately after PCOS in frequency when considering hormonal etiologies of irregular menses and amenorrhea [^1151Nf3M].

> I should confirm the clinical implications because they reinforce why FHA matters. FHA produces hypoestrogenism with adverse effects on bone, cardiovascular, and reproductive health; treatment hinges on correcting energy availability and may require transdermal estrogen with cyclic progesterone in refractory cases to protect bone, so I need to flag FHA early when cycles are prolonged or absent in the setting of low weight or high training load [^113BRBT9] [^116mUo51]. But wait, what if the patient is an athlete with subtle energy deficit? The female athlete triad framework reminds me to screen for disordered eating and bone health risks in parallel, which strengthens the case for FHA as a leading cause in certain populations [^112Lu4fe].

> Now, hyperprolactinemia deserves attention as the third most common hormonal imbalance. Elevated prolactin suppresses GnRH and thus LH/FSH, leading to oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; I should double-check that contemporary amenorrhea evaluations still prioritize prolactin in the initial panel, and they do, with pituitary imaging considered when indicated [^116htbJC]. Let me reconsider the frequency: pituitary causes, predominantly hyperprolactinemia, account for about 17% of secondary amenorrhea, which places it solidly among the top hormonal etiologies clinicians encounter [^1151Nf3M].

> Next, I should review thyroid disease, which is common and often overlooked. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism disrupt menstrual cyclicity via altered GnRH pulsatility and altered sex hormone metabolism; I need to ensure TSH is included in the first-line evaluation of irregular menses, and guidelines consistently recommend it, even though exact prevalence estimates vary across populations [^116htbJC] [^113HQush]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: thyroid disease is a frequent contributor to menstrual abnormalities even outside overt amenorrhea, so it remains a leading endocrine cause of cycle irregularity in primary care and endocrine settings [^113HQush].

> Primary ovarian insufficiency is the next hormonal cause I should verify. POI presents with irregular cycles or amenorrhea before age 40 due to follicle depletion or dysfunction, with elevated FSH confirming the diagnosis; I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds and the need to repeat FSH if uncertain, and contemporary guidelines specify FSH ≥ 25 IU/L on two occasions 4–6 weeks apart alongside disordered menses for at least 4 months [^111bzBFD] [^114boC9N]. Let me think about frequency: ovarian causes account for about 40% of secondary amenorrhea, but POI represents a subset; still, in women under 40 with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, POI is a critical diagnosis to exclude and treat promptly due to hypoestrogenic risks [^1151Nf3M] [^112Mf9JY].

> I should also consider perimenopause as a hormonal transition state causing irregular menses. During the menopausal transition, erratic ovarian function with fluctuating estradiol and rising FSH produces highly variable cycle lengths and anovulatory cycles; I need to ensure I frame this as physiologic rather than pathologic, yet it is a leading cause of irregular menses in women over 40 and can mimic or unmask other endocrine disorders [^1138Y254] [^114cK8U6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated perimenopause with disease; it is a normal life stage, but its hormonal instability is a common reason for cycle irregularity and should be recognized in the differential for women approaching menopause [^1138Y254].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized list, but I should double-check the ranking against both prevalence and clinical impact. The most common hormonal imbalances causing irregular menses are: 1) PCOS, 2) functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, 3) hyperprolactinemia, 4) thyroid disease, and 5) primary ovarian insufficiency, with perimenopause as a leading physiologic cause in women over 40; this ordering aligns with contemporary cohort data, guideline-based etiologic frequencies in amenorrhea, and the FIGO classification of ovulatory disorders [^117DMjou] [^1151Nf3M] [^114YBV2M]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating any estimate; the 35% hypothalamic and 17% pituitary figures derive from amenorrhea cohorts, so applying them to "irregular menses" broadly may overestimate FHA and hyperprolactinemia in lighter oligomenorrhea populations, but PCOS still predominates across mixed irregularity phenotypes, which supports the ranking [^1151Nf3M] [^114NbQzh].

> Finally, I need to ensure age-specific modifiers are explicit. In adolescents, anovulation is common early after menarche, so persistent oligomenorrhea beyond 2–3 years or primary amenorrhea by 15 warrants evaluation for PCOS, FHA, or other endocrine causes; in adults of reproductive age, PCOS, FHA, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, and POI dominate; and in women over 40, perimenopausal physiology becomes increasingly prevalent, though PCOS and thyroid disease remain important and should still be screened as indicated [^1162BSCB] [^1117ZBmJ] [^1138Y254]. I should double-check that this stratification matches guideline recommendations, and it does, reinforcing the need to interpret irregular menses in age-appropriate clinical context [^1162BSCB] [^1117ZBmJ].

The most common hormonal imbalances causing irregular menses are **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)** [^114NbQzh], **functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA)** [^116mUo51], **hyperprolactinemia** [^11358s5A], **thyroid disorders (hypo- and hyperthyroidism)** [^113HQush], and **premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)** [^111bzBFD]. PCOS is the **most frequent cause** [^114XiTQi], characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and chronic anovulation [^114NbQzh]. FHA results from stress, excessive exercise, or low energy availability [^113BRBT9], suppressing GnRH and causing hypoestrogenism [^113BRBT9]. Hyperprolactinemia inhibits GnRH and ovulation [^notfound]; thyroid disorders disrupt menstrual regularity via altered metabolism and feedback [^notfound]; and POI reflects early follicular depletion with elevated FSH and low estradiol [^111bzBFD]. These imbalances are identified through targeted history, examination, and selective labs (TSH, prolactin, FSH/LH, androgens) [^116htbJC], with management tailored to the underlying cause and patient goals [^117UFmGd].

## Common hormonal causes of irregular menses

Key characteristics of common hormonal causes:

| **Aspect** | **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)** | **Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA)** | **Hyperprolactinemia** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Prevalence | 8–13% of reproductive-aged women [^117DMjou] [^112CKZgE] | Common in adolescents/young women with stress, excessive exercise, or low energy availability [^113BRBT9] | 1–3% of reproductive-aged women [^notfound] |
| Pathophysiology | Hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and chronic anovulation [^114NbQzh]; elevated LH:FSH ratio and AMH [^112GpmXG] | Energy deficiency suppresses GnRH, lowering LH/FSH and estradiol [^notfound] | Elevated prolactin inhibits GnRH, causing anovulation and amenorrhea [^notfound] |
| Clinical features | Oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, obesity, infertility [^112dkrff] [^1166DBVf] [^112CKZgE] | Secondary amenorrhea, low BMI, stress/exercise history, low bone density [^113BRBT9] | Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, headaches/visual symptoms with macroadenomas [^114tejUu] |
| Diagnosis | Rotterdam criteria (2 of 3: oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries) after excluding other causes [^112CKZgE] [^114NbQzh] | Exclude other causes; low/normal LH/FSH, low estradiol, normal prolactin/TSH [^115ZCKCU] | Elevated prolactin, MRI if > 200 ng/mL or symptoms suggest mass [^116htbJC] |
| Management | Lifestyle modification, metformin, combined oral contraceptives, anti-androgens, ovulation induction [^114NbQzh] [^116Mw5X4] | Restore energy balance, weight gain, reduce exercise, psychological support, transdermal estrogen if needed [^113BRBT9] | Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine), surgery/radiation for refractory cases [^notfound] |

## Thyroid disorders

Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause irregular menses via altered metabolism and feedback. Hypothyroidism may present with **menorrhagia, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea**, whereas hyperthyroidism is associated with **oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea**. Diagnosis relies on **TSH and free T4** [^notfound], and management centers on restoring euthyroidism with **levothyroxine** or **antithyroid therapy**.

---

## Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)

- **Prevalence**: 1% of women < 40 years [^notfound].
- **Pathophysiology**: Early follicular depletion/dysfunction; elevated FSH, low estradiol [^111bzBFD].
- **Clinical features**: Amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea, hot flashes, infertility, low bone density [^111bzBFD].
- **Diagnosis**: Elevated FSH ≥ 25 IU/L on two tests ≥ 4 weeks apart, low estradiol [^111bzBFD].
- **Management**: Hormone replacement therapy, fertility options, bone health management [^1116Un3P].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach begins with a **history and examination** to assess menstrual pattern, weight change, stress, exercise, galactorrhea, and thyroid or androgen signs [^113HQush]. Initial laboratory testing includes **TSH, prolactin, FSH/LH, and androgens** [^notfound]. Imaging (pelvic ultrasound or MRI) is used selectively based on clinical and laboratory findings [^113HQush]. Management is tailored to the underlying cause, patient goals, and fertility plans [^113HQush].

---

In sum, **PCOS, FHA, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, and POI** are the principal hormonal causes of irregular menses; a focused history, exam, and targeted labs enable accurate diagnosis and management [^116htbJC].

### Menstrual cycle regularity and length across the reproductive lifespan and risk of premature mortality: prospective cohort study [^114Ztcih]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Age specific mortality in most countries has steadily improved with advances in medical and public health. However, all countries still face an appreciable burden of premature mortality, defined by the World Health Organization as death before age 70 years, accounting for 52.4% of the 56.9 million deaths globally in 2016. Non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, are the leading cause of premature death worldwide, contributing 57.0% (17.0 million) of the total premature deaths in 2016. To curb the rising global burden of non-communicable diseases, the United Nations has launched, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, a global goal of reducing the total premature mortality (deaths before age 70 years) from non-communicable diseases by one third by 2030.

Regular menstrual cycles reflect normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, a vital sign of women's general health. Irregular and long menstrual cycles, often attributed to the functional disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, are, however, common among women of reproductive age. They have been associated with greater risk of non-communicable diseases, including ovarian cancer, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and mental health problems, through mechanisms probably related to a disrupted hormonal environment (eg, hyperinsulinemia), chronic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances (eg, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome). Evidence linking irregular or long menstrual cycles with mortality is, however, limited. As deaths occurring before age 70 years result in a greater number of life years lost, we evaluated whether irregular or long menstrual cycles during adolescence and throughout premenopausal adulthood were associated with all cause and cause specific premature mortality among women participating in a large ongoing prospective cohort study. Moreover, because compelling evidence has shown that lifestyle factors (eg, overweight, smoking, diet, physical activity), mental health status, and reproductive characteristics are important determinants of mortality risk and might directly impact some of the underlying metabolic disturbances associated with long or irregular menstrual cycles, we also examined whether the relations between menstrual cycle characteristics and premature mortality were modified by lifestyle, psychological, and reproductive factors.

### Development of ovulatory menstrual cycles in adolescent girls [^112VpRXV]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Irregular menstrual cycles due to anovulation are well described in the first few years after menarche, but the normal developmental trajectory from anovulatory to mature ovulatory cycles during adolescence remains undefined. In this article we review the very limited understanding of this final stage of female reproductive axis development and discuss why additional research in this area is critical to the health of women.

### Contraception in perimenopause [^113TidVz]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Perimenopause is characterized by wide hormone fluctuations and irregular menstrual cycles for 5 or more years preceding menopause and lasts until 12 months of amenorrhea have been achieved. It represents a period of reproductive transition with a decline in fertility. However, unintended pregnancies do occur, with a high risk for poor outcomes and maternal complications. All women transitioning through perimenopause should be adequately counseled. There are many hormone and nonhormone contraceptive methods that are highly effective and suited to the personal and medical needs of the perimenopausal woman. Contraception should continue until menopause is confirmed.

### Update in hyper-and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea [^112v95R2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Amenorrhea is a relatively common condition that is present in up to 5% of adult women at any time. The clinical significance of a lack of regular menstrual cycles extends beyond reproductive concerns. Episodes of amenorrhea as short as 90 d may have implications for bone and cardiovascular health. Prolonged amenorrhea, depending upon its underlying cause, can be a harbinger of substantial cardiovascular risk.

Materials and Methods

This is an update of recent medical literature on this topic.

Results

The past few years have been marked by a greater appreciation of the early presentation of common ovulatory disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and less common disorders, such as premature ovarian insufficiency/failure. The long-term implications of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and its genetic origins have also been further elucidated. Finally, health consequences of these and other menstrual disorders are increasingly well defined, with firmer clinical endpoints rather than merely risk factor assessments.

### Menstrual cycle-related exacerbation of disease [^113KA5Er]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Exacerbation of common medical and mental health disorders at specific phases of the menstrual cycle is a prevalent phenomenon. Although the precise cause is unclear, studies implicate complex interactions between the immune and neuroendocrine systems. The menstrual cycle also is a trigger for the onset of depressive disorders, including premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a disorder specific to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and depression associated with the transition to menopause. This article discusses common mental health problems exacerbated by the menstrual cycle, with a particular focus on premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopausal depression. Throughout the reproductive lifespan, routine screening and assessment for the presence of common psychiatric disorders are critical for accurate diagnosis and provision of effective treatment. Management options include referral or consultation with a primary care provider or psychiatrist; treatment options for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopausal depression include pharmacotherapy with antidepressant agents and/or psychotherapy. Hormones may be helpful.

### Progestogens with or without oestrogen for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation [^115p6g3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone or in combination with oestrogens in the regulation of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in February 2012: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. All authors were experts in the content of this review.

Main Results

No randomised trials were identified that compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with anovulation. There is no consensus about which regimens are most effective. Further research is needed to establish the role of these hormonal treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1162BSCB]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — irregular menstrual cycles and adolescent risk: Irregular menstrual cycles are defined as 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days, 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year, 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle, and Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche (breast development). When irregular menstrual cycles are present a diagnosis of PCOS should be considered and assessed according to these PCOS Guidelines, and for adolescents with features not meeting diagnostic criteria an increased risk could be considered with reassessment advised at or before full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche; ovulatory dysfunction can still occur with regular cycles and serum progesterone levels can be measured to confirm anovulation.

### Approach to the patient with new-onset secondary amenorrhea: is this primary ovarian insufficiency? [^112Mf9JY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Menstrual cyclicity is a marker of health for reproductively mature women. Absent menses, or amenorrhea, is often the initial sign of pregnancy-an indication that the system is functioning appropriately and capable of generating the intended evolutionary outcome. Perturbations of menstrual regularity in the absence of pregnancy provide a marker for physiological or pathological disruption of this well-orchestrated process. New-onset amenorrhea with duration of 3 to 6 months should be promptly evaluated. Secondary amenorrhea can reflect structural or functional disturbances occurring from higher centers in the hypothalamus to the pituitary, the ovary, and finally, the uterus. Amenorrhea can also be a manifestation of systemic disorders resulting in compensatory inhibition of reproduction. Identifying the point of the breakdown is essential to restoring reproductive homeostasis to maintain future fertility and reestablish reproductive hormonal integrity. Among the most challenging disorders contributing to secondary amenorrhea is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). This diagnosis stems from a number of possible etiologies, including autoimmune, genetic, metabolic, toxic, iatrogenic, and idiopathic, each with associated conditions and attendant medical concerns. The dual assaults of unanticipated compromised fertility concurrently with depletion of the normal reproductive hormonal milieu yield multiple management challenges. Fertility restoration is an area of active research, while optimal management of estrogen deficiency symptoms and the anticipated preventive benefits of hormone replacement for bone, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive health remain understudied. The state of the evidence for an optimal, individualized, clinical management approach to women with POI is discussed along with priorities for additional research in this population.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^111bzBFD]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnostic investigations — HCPs should diagnose POI based on the presence of spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles and biochemical confirmation. The guideline group recommends the following diagnostic criteria: disordered menstrual cycles (spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles) for at least 4 months, and an elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration ≥ 25 IU/l. FSH assessment should be repeated after 4–6 weeks if there is diagnostic uncertainty, and FSH testing for the diagnosis of POI does not have to be timed to a specific day of the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy should be excluded in women presenting with amenorrhea. Use of hormonal therapy (including oral, injectable, or long-acting contraceptives) may conceal or cause amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles, and potentially lower FSH concentrations; some hormonal therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive) may need to be ceased before a diagnosis of POI can be confirmed. Women who have had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before age 40 have a diagnosis of POI and additional diagnostic testing is unnecessary. The guideline group does not recommend diagnosing POI based on serum estradiol concentrations; however, a low estradiol concentration indicates hypoestrogenism, and in combination with an elevated FSH concentration, provides additional confirmation of the POI diagnosis.

### Design and methods of the apple women's health study: a digital longitudinal cohort study [^117RAbLt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple factors influence the menstrual cycle length, duration of flow, and cyclicity. Common factors include stress, nutrition and body weight, physical activity, and combination lifestyle factors. Furthermore, menstrual cycle function is an indicator of health and longevity. For example, bone density is built and maintained in the presence of cyclic ovarian function. Fertility, terminal breast differentiation, and aspects of cognition and memory are also influenced by menstrual status and function. – The endocrine pathways involved in menstrual cycle physiology include the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and a healthy functioning of the thyroid and adrenal glands; the anatomic structures necessary include the uterus, endometrium, and ovaries.

Furthermore, irregular patterns or the absence of menstrual cycles can serve as indicators of underlying health problems. The presence of irregular menstrual cycles may indicate hormonal disturbances, including thyroid disorders, prolactinomas, systemic illness (including cancers), anatomic pathology such as uterine fibroids, polyps, or adenomyosis; it has also has been linked to an increase in all-cause mortality. Abnormalities in the bleeding length and amount affect up to 30% of those who menstruate. The existing data on the menstrual cycle characteristics, including the normal distributions of the cycle length and bleeding days, are based on prior and well-designed but demographically-limited cohorts. Little is known about how these conditions vary across subpopulations or how they relate to future health conditions. An understanding of population-based variation in menstrual cycle characteristics is lacking.

The objectives of this study are to (1) advance the understanding of the menstrual cycle, including how it relates to exercise, sleep, environmental, behavioral, and other physiological processes, and (2) inform screening and risk assessment for gynecologic health conditions using menstrual cycle, reproductive, health, and sensor data. We present here the design of the Apple Women's Health Study (AWHS) and the characteristics of the first 10,000 participants enrolled in the study, including their follow-up after 6 months of participation.

### The normal menstrual cycle [^11611Ehq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The normal ovulatory menstrual cycle requires the presence of a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highly coordinated hormonal feedback loops. Consisting of three phases (follicular, ovulatory, and luteal), the normal menstrual cycle results in the formation of a mature follicle and release of an oocyte during each cycle, with menses occurring in the absence of fertilization. While adolescents may initially experience anovulatory cycles following menarche, the vast majority of cycles will be fairly regular, lasting 21 to 45 days in length with an average of three to seven days of bleeding. Absence of menarche by age 15, absence of menses for three consecutive months, and menses lasting eight days or longer with or without associated heavy bleeding are among the menstrual abnormalities that warrant further evaluation. Obtaining the menstrual history in adolescents with the knowledge of expected menstrual patterns allows the pediatric practitioner to provide appropriate counseling and education to adolescents and their families, and to identify menstrual abnormalities when they arise. Treating the menstrual cycle as a "vital sign" highlights the importance of normal menses as an indicator of an individual's overall health and enables timely identification of any concerning findings.

### Neuroendocrine causes of amenorrhea – an update [^11358s5A]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Secondary amenorrhea — the absence of menses for three consecutive cycles — affects approximately 3–4% of reproductive age women, and infertility — the failure to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse — affects approximately 6–10%. Neuroendocrine causes of amenorrhea and infertility, including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia, constitute a majority of these cases.

Objective

In this review, we discuss the physiologic, pathologic, and iatrogenic causes of amenorrhea and infertility arising from perturbations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, including potential genetic causes. We focus extensively on the hormonal mechanisms involved in disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

Conclusions

A thorough understanding of the neuroendocrine causes of amenorrhea and infertility is critical for properly assessing patients presenting with these complaints. Prompt evaluation and treatment are essential to prevent loss of bone mass due to hypoestrogenemia and/or to achieve the time-sensitive treatment goal of conception.

### Menstrual cycle hormone changes associated with reproductive aging and how they may relate to symptoms [^114wkXoy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Key cycle changes occur as women transition from reproductive life to menopause, and they can be roughly linked to menopausal staging. It is important to understand the types of studies that inform the current knowledge. Patterns of symptoms within menstrual cycles (sleep, headache) generally favor worsening in association with the perimenstrual phase of the cycle, and patterns of chronic symptoms, such as hot flashes and adverse mood, appear to be worse when hormones are more variable.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^1154cEpS]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — disagreement and research needs for menstrual disturbance: Disagreement remains about the time needed before regular menstrual cycles occur in young women and the extent to which irregular menses (especially amenorrhea) are a source of psychological morbidity and/or decreased quality of life. Knowledge Gaps/Recommended Future Research include uncertainty about the extent to which severity of menstrual disturbance is associated with PCOS severity, the natural history and progression of menstrual irregularity in PCOS, whether PCOS patients have a longer reproductive life span, and how often oligomenorrheic or amenorrheic women ovulate.

### Adolescent girls, the menstrual cycle, and bone health [^113KHG1h]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

In adolescent girls, amenorrhea is sometimes viewed as a variant of normal; in fact, however, during the first gynecologic year, the 95th percentile for cycle length is 90 days. Although early menstrual cycles are frequently anovulatory and may be somewhat irregular, girls with menses coming less frequently than every 90 days may have significant pathology associated with hypoestrogenism. Hypoestrogenism is a known risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. Causes of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea include the relatively common conditions of hyperandrogenism, eating disorders, and exercise-induced amenorrhea, as well as uncommon conditions such as pituitary tumor, gonadal dysgenesis, and premature ovarian failure. Even functional hypothalamic oligomenorrhea has been linked to reduced bone density. Attention to menstrual irregularity and the earlier diagnosis of conditions causing it may lead to interventions that will benefit life-long bone health.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112kx7a3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A somewhat similar experience exists at the opposite end of the reproductive age spectrum, beyond the age of 45 years, as women enter what has been called the menopausal transition, where cycle length typically becomes more infrequent or irregular before culminating in amenorrhea as ovarian secretion of estradiol declines and ultimately ceases. However, this experience is perhaps even less orderly than that of the post‐menarcheal period, as there may be highly variable endocrine changes resulting in unpredictable impacts on menstrual function. Again, what is common, and often portrayed as "normal", can be highly disruptive, particularly when coupled with other symptoms.

Women who present with infertility may have accompanying menstrual symptoms typical of ovulatory disorders. However, women with cyclically normal onset of menstrual bleeding may not be ovulating, or at least not ovulating regularly, as the frequency of single‐cycle anovulation in the context of normal regular cycles is in the range of 3.7%–26.7%. Consequently, further evaluation beyond a detailed history will be necessary to identify those with ovulatory disorders.

The optimal way to assess for ovulation and, by extension, confirm ovulatory disorders may vary according to the clinical circumstance. The menstrual history of regular, predictable cycles between 24 and 38 days remains a helpful tool, and reflects the overall experience better than evaluation of endocrine or imaging parameters from a single cycle does. While patients and clinicians have traditionally used measurement of basal body temperature, interpretation can be difficult, so this approach should be used with caution. If available, ovulation predictor kits that measure the levels of luteinizing hormone in urine samples generally accurately reflect levels of serum luteinizing hormone and are a valuable tool for detecting ovulation in a given cycle. Simply measuring progesterone in the predicted luteal phase may provide satisfactory evidence supporting ovulatory function, particularly when the first day of the next menstrual period is known. Such an approach may be helpful in circumstances such as hirsutism, where the incidence of anovulation in women with cyclically predictable menstrual cycles is higher.

There are other, less common ovulatory disorders that may require more complex evaluation to determine if they are present in a given individual. For example, identifying LUF cycles, somewhat common in infertile women, requires both confirmation of the LH surge and the performance of serial ultrasound to demonstrate failed rupture of the dominant follicle. It should be remembered that scrutiny of a single cycle may not reflect the overall experience for a given individual.

### Irregular cycles, ovulatory disorders, and cardiometabolic conditions in a US-based digital cohort [^117DMjou]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The menstrual cycle is an important vital sign beginning in early life. Irregular cycles have been associated with adverse health outcomes. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism, is a common ovulatory disorder affecting 8% to 13% of reproductive-aged females (15–49 years), but not all individuals with irregular cycles are diagnosed with PCOS (due to underdiagnosis or other etiologies such as hypothalamic amenorrhea).,

Positive associations have been found between PCOS and cardiometabolic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Previous population-based studies reported positive associations between irregular cycles and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or premature mortality, while other studies did not find such associations. These studies generally lacked data on PCOS diagnosis or other ovulatory disorders and therefore did not ascertain whether the associations were solely attributable to underlying PCOS or other etiologies that may confer cardiometabolic risk. In addition, most of these studies were limited to menstrual patterns during adulthood. Early-life characteristics, such as time to regularity since menarche, are important but understudied variables in cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, existing studies were from Europe or of relatively homogeneous or hospital-based populations in the US, and studies on potential early interventions are also lacking. In this study, we evaluated the associations of PCOS, time to regularity (adolescence), and irregular cycles (adulthood) with the prevalence of various cardiometabolic conditions.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1117ZBmJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### Associations of menstrual cycle characteristics across the reproductive life span and lifestyle factors with risk of type 2 diabetes [^114HZwsc]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, prospective cohort, women who experienced irregular or long menstrual cycles in adolescence and throughout adulthood were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women without menstrual cycle dysfunction. The risk was greatest among women who maintained irregular cycles across the reproductive life span and those whose cycle length changed from less than 32 days to 32 days or more. In addition, we found an additive interaction of menstrual cycle dysfunction and overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and low-quality diet with risk of type 2 diabetes.

A disrupted hormonal environment is suspected to play a critical role in the association between menstrual cycle dysfunction and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Irregular and long menstrual cycles are strong indicators of hyperinsulinemia, which can synergize with pituitary gonadotropins to stimulate androgen production in ovarian theca cells, further exacerbating insulin resistance and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Hyperinsulinemia can also inhibit sex hormone–binding globulin excretion, leading to higher serum concentrations of unbound testosterone. This hormonal milieu has been hypothesized to play a critical role in the cause of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, menstrual cycle disorders are also associated with dysregulated inflammatory processes, which may also be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes. Results from a systematic review also suggested that women with polycystic ovary syndrome, a common endocrine disorder characterized by ovarian dysfunction — including long or irregular cycles — and excess androgens, had higher circulating concentrations of multiple oxidative stress markers, such as homocysteine, malondialdehyde, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and superoxide dismutase.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and irregular cycles (early-life and adulthood) with cardiometabolic conditions?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 60 789 participants from the Apple Women's Health Study, individuals with PCOS had a significantly higher prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions. Longer time to regularity since menarche (adolescence) or irregular cycles (adulthood) were associated with a higher prevalence of several cardiometabolic conditions, even among participants without PCOS, and certain associations were modified by body mass index or physical activity.

Meaning

These findings suggest that early screening of cardiometabolic risk factors and interventions may benefit individuals with longer times to regular menstrual cycles or who experience adulthood irregular cycles, regardless of PCOS diagnosis.

Reproductive features of PCOS

Ovarian dysfunction and infertility

Ovarian dysfunction usually manifests as oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea resulting from chronic oligo-ovulation/anovulation. However, prolonged anovulation can lead to dysfunctional uterine bleeding which may mimic more regular menstrual cycles. The majority of PCOS patients have ovarian dysfunction, with 70% to 80% of women with PCOS presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea. Among those with oligomenorrhoea, 80% to 90% will be diagnosed with PCOS. Among those with amenorrhoea, only 40% will be diagnosed with PCOS as hypothalamic dysfunction is a more common cause. Oligomenorrhoea occurs usually in adolescence, with onset later in life often associated with weight gain. Menstrual irregularity is then often masked by the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), until cessation, when the underlying irregular cycles recur. Menorrhagia can occur with unopposed oestrogen and endometrial hyperplasia, further exacerbated by elevated oestrogen levels in obesity. Whilst inadequate research exists, it is generally recommended that greater than four cycles per year may protect the endometrium. Women with regular menstrual cycles can also now be diagnosed with PCOS based on newer diagnostic criteria (Table 1).

PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. It accounts for 90% to 95% of women attending infertility clinics with anovulation. However 60% of women with PCOS are fertile (defined as the ability to conceive within 12 months), although time to conceive is often increased. In those with PCOS and infertility, 90% are overweight. Obesity independently exacerbates infertility, reduces efficacy of infertility treatment and induces a greater risk of miscarriage. There is currently an active debate about the appropriate limit for body mass index for assisted reproduction therapies, given the reduced success rates and the demonstrated risks of pregnancy in overweight women. Ideally, weight should be optimised prior to pregnancy. Age-related infertility also exacerbates infertility and timely planning of families may warrant discussion.

### Menstrual cycle regularity and length across the reproductive lifespan and risk of cardiovascular disease [^113McSBy]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We observed an increased rate of CVD among women reporting oral contraceptive use only at ages 14 to 17 years, which might represent confounding by indications for oral contraceptive use (such as by polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS] or endometriosis, which are also associated with future CVD risk). As oral contraceptives are more likely to be used solely for contraception during adulthood, they become weaker proxies for reproductive or gynecologic conditions, which may partly explain the null associations of oral contraceptive use at ages 18 to 22 and 29 to 46 years with CVD.

Unhealthy behaviors and obesity in childhood have been associated with menstrual irregularity and may affect cardiometabolic health across the life course through alterations in metabolism, fat storage, and body composition. PCOS, which is characterized by irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology, is the most common cause of irregular menstrual cycles. Approximately 90% of women with cycle irregularities or oligomenorrhea have clinical, laboratory, or ultrasound evidence of PCOS. A 2020 meta-analysisincluding 23 cohort studies showed that women with PCOS were at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease including CVD. Meanwhile, CVD risk factors, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and abnormal vascular and endothelial function, are well described among women with PCOS. Therefore, the associations observed between cycle irregularity and long cycle length during early and mid-adulthood with CVD and the mediating role of hypercholesteremia, chronic hypertension, and type 2 diabetes are likely attributable to underlying PCOS. Finally, cycle dysfunction can also be indicative of endometriosis, depleted ovarian reserve, or disrupted hormonal environment (eg, hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenaemia), which are also associated with adverse cardiometabolic health.

### Menstruation: choosing whether… and when [^114Cckht]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Period problems: disorders of menstruation in adolescents [^1128oZqj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Adolescence is a time of great psychological and physical change. In the UK, girls enter puberty around the age of 10 years with a median age of menarche of 12.9 years; thereafter, it may be several years before regular menstrual cycles are established. Variations in the type and the frequency of periods may create anxiety regarding ill health or serious underlying disorders. With the increase in childhood obesity and subsequent polycystic ovary syndrome, there is a greater awareness and presentation of girls with disorders of menstruation. This review focuses on normal variations of menses and common pathological causes of menstrual problems, including amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia. Further consideration is given to the variations of presentation of polycystic ovary syndrome. It provides a guide to evaluate the various symptoms, investigations and management options.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — menstrual irregularity — PCOS commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, while obesity and insulin resistance are commonly encountered but are not required for diagnosis. Amenorrhea is generally defined as intervals between periods exceeding 199 days, whereas oligomenorrhea involves intercycle intervals between 35 and 199 days; spontaneous ovulations can occur, with a placebo-arm randomized controlled trial reporting ovulation in 32% of cycles. In women with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, there is an approximately 90% chance that PCOS will also be diagnosed.

Conclusion

HA is a common cause of amenorrhoea in women of reproductive age, which can go unrecognised. Thorough clinical evaluation is crucial in order to diagnose these women, establish the causative factor and initiate treatment appropriately. Treatment options need to be personalised and tend to focus on alleviating the underlying nutritional or psychosocial stress by lifestyle and behavioural interventions. Emerging hormonal therapies may prove useful in the future, especially in those women who do not respond to first-line behavioural treatment.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^112hv8Dn]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — menstrual irregularity and associated features: Women with PCOS may ovulate spontaneously, but the frequency is unknown; ovulations have been reported in up to 32% of "cycles". Women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea have about a 90% chance of being diagnosed with PCOS, and up to 95% of affected adults have oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Amenorrheic women with PCOS usually have the most severe hyperandrogenism and higher antral follicle counts compared with those with oligomenorrhea or regular cycles, and menstrual cycles in women with PCOS become more regular as they approach menopause. In aging women with PCOS, obesity rather than menstrual cycle pattern or follicular cohort size determines hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Conclusions (Agreement) state that both amenorrheic and oligomenorrheic women may occasionally ovulate (level B), menstrual cycles in women with PCOS may become more regular later in life (level B), irregular menses are associated with increased metabolic risk (level B), and the greater the menstrual irregularity, the more severe the PCOS phenotype (level B).

Incidence of menstrual cycle irregularities in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — In adolescents with PCOS, about 43% presented with oligomenorrhea, and 28% had either primary (7%) or secondary (21%) amenorrhea; approximately 21% reported regular cycles, and 7% reported frequent cycles with a cycle interval of less than 21 days. In adults with PCOS, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea occurs in up to 95% of cases, with reports ranging from 45% up to 95% depending on diagnostic definitions. By definition, if the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria are used, 100% of women with PCOS have irregular menstrual cycles, whereas under the Rotterdam consensus definition up to 30% have regular cycles.

Summary demographics for UK survey participants

Risk for "abnormal" menstrual characteristics

To investigate the independent effects of long COVID on abnormal menstrual parameters as defined by the FIGO criteria for abnormal uterine bleeding, we compared menstrual cycle parameters across 3 groups (Table 1): No COVID, previous acute COVID andlong COVID. The relationships between cycle parameters and the history of COVID-19 disease were adjusted for relevant menstrual cycle parameters before the pandemic, age, BMI, exogenous hormone use, and presence of diagnosed reproductive condition at baseline.

Menstrual Frequency (n = 9843, including 817 Long COVID, 1382 Acute COVID and 7644 controls). Data for menstrual frequency were missing for 1455 participants, and these were excluded from this specific analysis. We also excluded participants who reported "Too irregular to say" for the outcome variable "Cycle length during the pandemic" (n = 889), as we were interested in ascribing frequency. Another 1445 individuals were excluded due to missing data for baseline menstrual frequency before the pandemic. Across all groups of remaining participants, the most probable outcome was to report normal cycles (between 24 and 38 days, 71%), followed by frequent (< 24 days, 26%) and infrequent cycles (> 38 days, 3%) (Fig. 1A). The relative risk or risk ratio (RR) of reporting abnormal (frequent vs. normal cycles or infrequent vs. normal cycles) does not vary across groups, Table S1).

Menstrual regularity (n = 12,187). Across all groups of participants, the most probable outcome is to report regular cycles at the time of survey (less than 10 days difference between shortest and longest cycles, 79.7%), followed by very irregular (over 20 days difference, 9.8%), and somewhat irregular (between 10–20 days difference, 10.5%, Fig. 1B). The risk of reporting somewhat irregular vs. regular cycles increased by 39% for those with Long COVID, although the difference is not significant at the false discovery rate (RRR = 1.39, 95% CI = [1.03 to 1.87], p value = 0.04, FDR p value = 0.09; Table S2). The relative risks of reporting irregular vs. regular cycles are associated with obesity and the use of exogenous hormones (increased with progestin-based therapies and decreased with combined contraceptives).

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

5.1.3 Female Pattern Hair‐Loss (FPHL)

Scalp hair‐loss in women is relatively common, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting ~50% of women over the age of 80 years. Depending on whether it occurs before or after the menopause, it may be considered as either early‐ or late‐onset. The term FPHL is now more widely adopted than 'androgenic alopecia' in recognition of the fact that factors other than androgens may contribute to its pathophysiology. Nevertheless, androgen excess remains an important cause of FPHL, and may cause distinct patterns of alopecia, including hair‐loss with frontal accentuation or central expansion of hair‐loss with frontal hairline preservation.

5.1.4 Menstrual History

Although PCOS is the most common cause of androgen excess, other primary causes of hyperandrogenism can also result in menstrual irregularity via PCOS‐independent mechanisms, either because of the underlying disease process (e.g. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to Cushing's disease) or due to disruption of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis by elevated androgens of any cause. The menstrual cycle history should include age of menarche, frequency of menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhoea, typically defined as average menstrual cycle length > 35 days or fewer than eight cycles per year) and, where relevant, age of menopause and last menstrual bleed.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^114aMfGL]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menstrual cycle irregularities and fertility/fecundity in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Women with self-reported oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and/or hirsutism had similar pregnancy and abortion rates as the general population, but symptomatic women more often experienced infertility, and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea as well as obesity were more often associated with decreased fecundability. In anovulatory infertility, the degree of menstrual cycle irregularity predicted ovulation, and age along with amenorrhea predicted live-birth rates. During second-line treatment, the menstrual cycle pattern is one of the most significant predictors of live birth; significantly fewer women with amenorrhea ovulated on clomiphene citrate than those with oligomenorrhea, and during second-line treatment women with oligomenorrhea had a reduced chance of conceiving and reduced live-birth rates compared with women with amenorrhea.

### Menses requires energy: a review of how disordered eating, excessive exercise, and high stress lead to menstrual irregularities [^113BRBT9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea secondary to low weight, excessive exercise, and/or high levels of stress is common among young women. Adolescence is a time in development that a positive energy balance is crucial for puberty, menarche, and regular menstruation. Disordered eating and eating disorders are the third most common chronic illness and tend to start during puberty. High-level athletes, specifically young girls participating in ballet, running, gymnastics, and figure skating, are at risk of developing hypothalamic amenorrhea from excessive exercise and inability to meet the energy needs of the body. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis leads to a hypoestrogenic state. Low levels of estrogen have a negative effect on bone health, sexual maturation, sexual function, and fertility. Puberty has the highest rate of bone accrual in a female's life. Adequate nutrition, physical activity, and estrogen are crucial for bone development and prevention of osteoporosis. Recognition and early intervention are necessary to limit the irreversibility of some of these effects.

Methods

A review of literature was completed to gather epidemiologic data, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, recommended laboratory/imaging, and approaches to treatment.

Findings

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 16% to 47% of slender female athletes have disordered eating, which makes them at risk for functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Most women present with previously regular menstrual cycles until there was a change in one or multiple factors, including weight, stress, and/or exercise. Athletes have a higher incidence, stemming from the synergistic relationship that exercise and low weight have on puberty and the menstrual cycle. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, eating disorders and other etiologies of menstrual irregularity need to be ruled out first.

Implications

Hypothalamic dysfunction leads to a hypoestrogenic state within the body. Low levels of estrogen manifest in multiple ways: amenorrhea, low bone mineral density, vaginal and breast atrophy, infertility, and dyspareunia. The goal of treatment of FHA and these downstream symptoms is weight gain with spontaneous resumption of menses, as this is the best indicator that the hypothalamic dysfunction and hypoestrogenic state have been resolved. In refractory cases of FHA, it may be necessary to replace hormones with physiologic dosing of transdermal estrogen and cyclic progesterone for the benefit of the young woman's bone health (Clin Ther. 2020;42:XXX-XXX) © 2020 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

### Acupuncture treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding in an adolescent [^1152Mg7W]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Menstrual disorders are common complaints among adolescent girls. The most common cause is DUB from an ovulatory cycle resulting in irregular bleeding. After menarche, 50% of cycles are anovulatory in the first year. By the third year, 95% of cycles are regular in duration and not excessive in volume.

There are many causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. DUB is a diagnosis of exclusion. The workup should rule out pregnancy, von Willebrand disease, thyroid dysfunction, uterine structural abnormalities, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and other systemic, hormonal and coagulation dysfunctions.

After other diagnoses have been excluded, the treatment method for DUB depends on its severity. Observation with a menstrual calendar is appropriate for mild cases, while hospitalisation with blood transfusion may be necessary for severe cases. For the vast majority of cases of moderate DUB, conventional treatment typically involves hormonal therapy and iron supplementation.

Different medical treatment regimens studied appeared to be equally effective. Conventional regimens consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, progestins, combined CPs, levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device (IUDs), danazol, tranexamic acid or analogues of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

Two acupuncture treatments studies for delayed menstrual cycles have shown promising results as treatment for DUB. One study showed improvement of menstrual irregularities after 14 electroacupuncture treatments in PCOS patients, another study demonstrated a greater improvement (no treatment failures) by using 'mind tranquillising and menstruation regulating' needling technique, instead of traditional needling placement, every other day for three cycles.

Acupuncture with or without medicinal herbs has been widely used for women's menstrual disorders in China and Taiwan for at least centuries. Modern research on its mechanism and efficacy remains scarce. For selected patients, acupuncture can be an effective alternative treatment for women who suffer from DUB and/or dysmenorrhoea. Research of carefully controlled trials and randomised controlled trials on irregular bleeding to assess alternative and complementary medicine treatment effectiveness on menstrual heaviness and intervals are recommended.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114V2e71]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — counseling and management of bleeding irregularities emphasize that bleeding changes generally decrease with continued CHC use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition and, if found, treat the condition or refer for care. If the patient wants treatment, advise the patient to discontinue CHC use (i.e., a hormone-free interval) for 3–4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended CHC method, and a hormone-free interval is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome and usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method, and counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing and, for users of contraceptive pills, consistent pill use.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^116htbJC]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — conclusions and diagnostic approach emphasize that estrogen plus progestin may be a better strategy to differentiate hypoestrogenemia-related amenorrhea from endometrial scarring, noting that both false positive and negative progestin withdrawal tests (PWT) can occur and that other approaches may yield a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. Most cases of primary and secondary amenorrhea are similar, and most causes are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. Initial assessment highlights that history, physical examination, and estimation of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol will identify the most common causes; most patients presenting with amenorrhea should undergo measurements of serum prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and pregnancy should be excluded. For primary amenorrhea, physical examination and measurement of gonadotropins are key, and the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone may be less for secondary compared with primary amenorrhea.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: diagnosis and treatment [^112dkrff]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 6%-7% of reproductive-aged women, making it the most common endocrine disorder in this population. It is characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Affected women may present with reproductive manifestations such as irregular menses or infertility, or cutaneous manifestations, including hirsutism, acne, or male-pattern hair loss. Over the past decade, several serious metabolic complications also have been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome including type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, and possibly cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition to treating symptoms by regulating menstrual cycles and improving hyperandrogenism, it is imperative that clinicians recognize and treat metabolic complications. Lifestyle therapies are first-line treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, particularly if they are overweight. Pharmacological therapies are also available and should be tailored on an individual basis.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome underdiagnosis patterns by individual-level and spatial social vulnerability measures [^112KXmNj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinology among reproductive-aged women, contributes a significant economic and health burden through its effects on reproductive, metabolic, and psychosocial health. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated to be between 6% and 12% in the United States. In 2020 alone, PCOS was associated with healthcare costs of ∼$8 billion in the United States. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in reproductive-aged women, and women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its associated comorbidities, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, throughout their life course.

Despite potential serious implications, many women who meet diagnostic criteria for PCOS remain undiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis. The Rotterdam Criteria for diagnosis, established in 2003, requires 2 out of the 3 cardinal features of PCOS: irregular menstruation, symptoms of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism) or lab tests for biochemical androgen excess, and the presence of ovarian cysts on transvaginal ultrasound. According to current guidelines, if a provider suspects a patient has PCOS, they will inquire about relevant symptoms including menstrual cycle irregularity, hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss, and weight gain. If PCOS is suspected but not confirmed symptomatically, after ruling out other endocrinopathies that present with similar symptoms, a provider may order a test for biochemical hyperandrogenemia or a pelvic ultrasound to check for polycystic ovarian morphology to confirm diagnosis. After receiving a PCOS diagnosis, a patient ideally receives access to counseling around menstrual and uterine health, information about potential comorbidities and prevention strategies, and tailored fertility care during periods of attempted conception.

### Clinical management of pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: an expert opinion [^117BQnfB]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

OPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 8%–13% of reproductive‐aged women. According to the Rotterdam criteria, PCOS in adults is diagnosed based on a minimum of two of the following: oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology on ultrasound, after ruling out differential diagnoses. These criteria result in four phenotypes of PCOS including phenotype A with oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology; phenotype B with oligo/anovulation and hyperandrogenism; phenotype C with hyperandrogenism and PCO morphology; and phenotype D with oligo/anovulation and PCO morphology. PCOS is associated with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features. Aetiology is complex including genetic, in‐utero, potential epigenetic factors, exacerbated by adverse lifestyle and excess adiposity. Hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and resulting hyperinsulinemia are common underpinnings in PCOS.

PCOS and excess adiposity have a bidirectional relationship with excess weight exacerbating the underpinning hormonal imbalance and PCOS itself appearing to predispose to excess weight and weight gain. The prevalence of PCOS in women with obesity is up to 37%. Women with PCOS may also be more likely to gain weight longitudinallyand at a greater pace. This may be attributable to impairments in appetite‐regulating hormones and hyperinsulinemia.and a more sedentary lifestyle.and may be inter‐related to the psychological features of PCOS such as anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life. Obesity further exacerbates hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia and plays a key independent role in increasing cardiometabolic risks in women with PCOS.

Women with PCOS commonly have oligo/anovulation, with or without irregular menstrual cycles, with PCOS the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. Infertility and a longer time to pregnancy may confer a higher risk for pregnancy and birth complications. Additionally, the type and intensity of treatment used to manage infertility, may further complicate pregnancy and birth independent of multiple pregnancies. Infertility is exacerbated by obesity.

### Atypical estradiol secretion and ovulation patterns caused by luteal out-of-phase (LOOP) events underlying irregular ovulatory menstrual cycles in the menopausal transition [^117Le6P8]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The menopausal transition is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and unpredictable hormone levels, including dramatic swings in estradiol (E2). An increasing number of studies have found variable high E2 and low luteal phase progesterone occur with progression of Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW)stage, but the cause remains unclear. To explore the causes of the erratic changes in E2, individual within-cycle secretion patterns of E2, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, inhibin A, and inhibin B were explored in detail.

Design

Blood samples taken three times per week over 1 1/3 menstrual cycles from 77 women aged 21 to 55 classified as mid-reproductive age (STRAW stages 5 and 4; n = 21), late-reproductive age (STRAW stages 4 and 3; n = 16), early menopausal transition (STRAW stage 2; n = 17), and late menopausal transition (STRAW stage 1; n = 23) were analyzed.

Results

Eleven of the 29 (37%) early and late menstrual transition ovulatory cycles exhibited a specific pattern of E2 secretion that was characterized by a second increase in E2 during the mid- and late luteal phases and that continued to a peak during the subsequent menstrual phase. This second rise and fall in E2 was typical in appearance of a normal follicular phase, except that it was superimposed on an existing ovulatory cycle(specifically during the luteal and menstrual phases). The pattern was therefore referred to as a luteal out-of-phase(LOOP) follicular event. In four of these LOOP cycles, a luteinizing hormone peak and ovulatory episode followed the second E2 peak early in the subsequent cycle. Compared with the typical ovulatory cycles, the cycles with LOOP events exhibited lower luteal phase progesterone, higher early cycle follicle-stimulating hormone, and lower early cycle inhibin B. They were also associated with abnormally short (< 21 d) or long (> 40 d) cycle length.

Conclusions

Many of the marked increases in ovulatory cycle E2 and cycle irregularities during the menopausal transition may be due to LOOP events and appear to be triggered by prolonged high follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone levels.

### Evaluation and management of amenorrhea [^114u1MGk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstrual periods in women.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of amenorrhea is complex and multifactorial. It can be caused by hormonal disorders such as pituitary dysfunction and absent ovarian function. It can also be caused due to chromosomal abnormalities and impairment of GnRH pulsatile secretion.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence rates of primary and secondary amenorrhea in the general population are estimated at 0.3% and 3–4%, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, amenorrhea presents as the absence of menstrual periods. In primary amenorrhea, there is also an absence of secondary sexual characteristics in phenotypic women aged ≥ 14 years. In secondary amenorrhea, there may be other associated symptoms depending on the underlying cause. For example, patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may present with severe bradycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, and/or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is reversible, and normal menstrual function can be restored with appropriate treatment. Amenorrhea due to chromosomal abnormalities or primary ovarian insufficiency may not be reversible.

### Discussing menstrual health in family medicine [^1134rVGZ]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Conversation starters

Asking a patient when their last menstrual period was is fairly common practice to gauge regularity and risk of pregnancy. It should not be assumed that because a patient does not bring up their menstrual cycle it is not negatively affecting their life. For example, premenstrual dysphoric symptoms affect 75%–90% of womenand are often seen as normal and something that people who menstruate just cope with. However, many of the symptoms can be treated with hormonal contraceptive options, anti-inflammatory medications or even just general counselling from a clinician. Despite this, menstrual history-taking varies among primary care clinicians and is often incomplete. Detailed history-taking can help assess how a patient's menstrual cycle is affecting their life. Here are several such questions that you can ask any menstruating patient to assess whether they have any symptoms that you can help treat (table 2).

Table 2
Menstrual health conversation starters during clinical encounters

With these simple conversation starters, it is possible to identify patients with menstrual concerns that may not have otherwise been reported. Each of these prompts could segue into an opportunity for counselling and/or medical treatment that can easily be provided and improve the patient's quality of life. These questions can be incorporated as part of wellness visits and as needed for related problem visits. Use the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics table to guide normal and abnormal menstrual symptoms to guide clinical decision-making(figure 1).

Consider having patients complete a questionnaire regarding their menstrual health as it may assist provide privacy and avoid embarrassment around this sensitive topic. Family medicine clinicians should continue to emphasise the normalcy of these issues with patients, reassure them that these conversations are appropriate and necessary and that their clinician is a readily available resource for questions surrounding all these issues.

### Menstrual-cycle-related symptoms: a review of the rationale for continuous use of oral contraceptives [^111RGhC6]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

As many as 80% of reproductive-aged women experience physical changes associated with menstruation, and 20% to 40% experience menstrual-cycle-related symptoms. Decades of research in women with menstrual disorders, such as dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, have shown that continuous use of oral contraceptives (OCs), without the hormone-free interval, is a safe and effective method to relieve these symptoms and ultimately induce amenorrhea in many women. If given the opportunity, a majority of women would opt for extended-cycle or continuous regimens, and numerous clinical trials have shown that continuous OC regimens induce amenorrhea in 80% to 100% of women by 10 to 12 months of use. For women who do not wish to become pregnant, a continuous OC regimen should be an available option.

### The potential bidirectional relationship between long COVID and menstruation [^116v4Zye]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As well as long COVID affecting menstrual symptoms, the ovarian hormone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle have the potential to impact the symptoms of long COVID. A cross-sectional study of long COVID patients found that over one-third of menstruating patients reported an exacerbation of their symptoms the week before or during menses. The menstrual cycle and ovarian sex hormones may also modulate COVID disease susceptibility and severity, with oestradiol known to boost the host immune response. Women under 50 years old were reported to have an increased risk of developing long COVID, consistent with ovarian sex hormones increasing the likelihood of developing long COVID. However, the effects of the menstrual cycle on longer-term symptoms of COVID-19 remain under-researched.

Defining the mechanisms that underpin any AUB associated with long COVID will inform clinical management. The underlying cause(s) of AUB may be classified as structural or non-structural, as outlined in the FIGO AUB System 2. Structural causes are those that can usually be detected during routine examination or investigations (e.g. imaging, histopathology) and include Polyps, Adenomyosis, Leiomyomas (fibroids) or Malignancy (PALM). Non-structural causes are not detected on imaging and include Coagulopathies, Ovulatory disorders, primary Endometrial disorders, Iatrogenic causes and those that are Not otherwise classified (COEIN). The rapid onset of menstrual disturbance described with SARS-CoV-2 infection favours a non-structural cause such as an ovulatory or endometrial disorder. Development and shedding of the endometrium at menstruation is controlled by the ovarian hormones. Perturbations of the cyclical ovarian sex hormone production (e.g. ovulatory disorders) can lead to changes in menstrual regularity and volume. Those with AUB due to endometrial disorders have previously been shown to have excessive endometrial inflammation at the time of menstruation. Whether similar aberrations are present in those with long COVID remains to be determined. Defining the underlying mechanisms of AUB associated with long COVID will facilitate the precise treatment of menstrual disturbance. Similarly, uncovering the mechanisms that result in increased severity or number of long COVID symptoms across the menstrual cycle may reveal new treatment options for females suffering from long COVID.

Determining menstrual cycle phase

Various methods exist for reporting menstrual cycle phases, each with its strengths and weaknesses. These include relying solely on self-reported information, utilising published ranges for ovarian hormone levels (with direct assays available in saliva, blood serum, blood plasma, and urine), combining self-report with hormonal levels or basal body temperature, and examining within-person changes in ovarian hormone levels collected multiple times over the cycle. While self-reporting alone is very common, it is the weakest method in isolation. However, if the calculation of the menstrual cycle phase is transparent and standardised, using it as a proxy for hormonal action could be acceptable since it is the most cost-effective and minimally burdensome for participants. Since it lacks the precision to identify specific cycle subphases, such as early, mid, or late phases, when used in isolation, the identification of ovulation exhibits the lowest accuracy and should not be considered. Finally, it is recommended that cycle tracking by the participants be initiated a couple of months before answering self-report questionnaires and that ovarian hormonal levels are used in conjunction with self-reporting.

Determining menopausal status

Spontaneous menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, established retrospectively after a woman has undergone 12 consecutive months of amenorrhoea without any apparent alternative cause. Determining menopausal status is a more straightforward process, often defined by questionnaire. Longitudinal studies would be particularly valuable for understanding the impact of perimenopause through menopause within individuals, extending beyond chronological age. Caution is advised when including participants in perimenopause as controls since this period has irregular cycle lengths and anovulatory cycles. In the case of potential perimenopausal participants, the staging system 'Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW + 10)' for participants aged 40 and above helps in calculating their menopausal status. Finally, in studies exploring pre- and post-menopausal changes, maintaining consistency in the menstrual cycle phase of the pre-menopausal group is crucial for obtaining reliable and comparable results.

Contraception

In the investigation of the natural menstrual cycle or menopause, it is recommended that cycling participants have experienced a minimum of two natural cycles after discontinuing hormonal contraceptives. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the physiological changes associated with the cycle. Furthermore, consistent exclusion of all types of hormonal contraception and not only oral contraceptives, including hormonal intra-uterine devices, implants, or injections, is essential to minimise confounding variables and enhance the internal validity of the research findings.

### Amenorrhea: a systematic approach to diagnosis and management [^113HQush]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Menstrual patterns can be an indicator of overall health and self-perception of well-being. Primary amenorrhea, defined as the lifelong absence of menses, requires evaluation if menarche has not occurred by 15 years of age or three years post-thelarche. Secondary amenorrhea is characterized by cessation of previously regular menses for three months or previously irregular menses for six months and warrants evaluation. Clinicians may consider etiologies of amenorrhea categorically as outflow tract abnormalities, primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, other endocrine gland disorders, sequelae of chronic disease, physiologic, or induced. The history should include menstrual onset and patterns, eating and exercise habits, presence of psychosocial stressors, body weight changes, medication use, galactorrhea, and chronic illness. Additional questions may target neurologic, vasomotor, hyperandrogenic, or thyroid-related symptoms. The physical examination should identify anthropometric and pubertal development trends. All patients should be offered a pregnancy test and assessment of serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Additional testing, including karyotyping, serum androgen evaluation, and pelvic or brain imaging, should be individualized. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovary function and may require hormone replacement therapy, contraception, or infertility services. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may indicate disordered eating and low bone density. Treatment should address the underlying cause. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should undergo screening and intervention to attenuate metabolic disease and endometrial cancer risk. Amenorrhea can be associated with clinically challenging pathology and may require lifelong treatment. Patients will benefit from ample time with the clinician, sensitivity, and emotional support.

### The impact of the menstrual cycle on orthopaedic sports injuries in female athletes [^116kFCJh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

There is a disparity in sport-related injuries between sexes, with females sustaining non-contact musculoskeletal injuries at a higher rate. Anterior cruciate ligament ruptures are between two and eight times more common than in males, and females also have a higher incidence of ankle sprains, patellofemoral pain, and bone stress injuries. The sequelae of such injuries can be devastating to an athlete, resulting in time out of sport, surgery, and the early onset of osteoarthritis. It is important to identify the causes of this disparity and introduce prevention programmes to reduce the incidence of these injuries. A natural difference reflects the effect of reproductive hormones in females, which have receptors in certain musculoskeletal tissues. Relaxin increases ligamentous laxity. Oestrogen decreases the synthesis of collagen and progesterone does the opposite. Insufficient diet and intensive training can lead to menstrual irregularities, which are common in female athletes and result in injury, whereas oral contraception may have a protective effect against certain injuries. It is important for coaches, physiotherapists, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes to be aware of these issues and to implement preventive measures. This annotation explores the relationship between the menstrual cycle and orthopaedic sports injuries in pre-menopausal females, and proposes recommendations to mitigate the risk of sustaining these injuries.

### Genitourinary symptoms in the menopausal transition [^111DFX9a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Irregular uterine bleeding is a common symptom among women in the menopausal transition. Women commonly transition from having regular cycles to having irregular cycles before the final menstrual period. In late perimenopause, anovulation becomes more common, leading to skipped menstrual cycles. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills are effective in decreasing the amount of menstrual blood loss and improving menstrual cycle regularity. It is unclear whether menorrhagia is associated with normal perimenopausal hormonal changes. Studies to date have failed to correlate menorrhagia with hormonal levels and pathology within the uterus. Because of the common association between uterine pathology and menorrhagia, this is an important area for future studies. Vaginal dryness is a common symptom, particularly in late perimenopause. The association between vaginal dryness and low estrogen levels is clear. Estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy is effective in treating this symptom. Locally released estrogen therapy may be preferred over systemic therapy because of lower systemic estradiol levels, reduced side effects, and high efficacy. The long-term safety of these products, particularly in women with a history of breast cancer, requires more study. The prevalence of incontinence increases as women age, but it is unclear whether the menopausal transition is an independent risk factor. Incontinence is a frequent complaint among women in the menopausal transition. In postmenopausal women, hormone therapy (HT) appears to be ineffective in preventing or improving the symptoms of incontinence. Further study of HT, including locally applied estrogens for the common symptom of incontinence, are needed in women in the menopausal transition.

Bleeding irregularities with extended or continuous use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — before initiation of CHCs, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous CHC use. Extended contraceptive use has been defined as a planned hormone-free interval after more than 28 days of active hormones, and continuous contraceptive use has been defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval. Spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use.

### The association between menstrual cycle characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes in later life: a retrospective matched cohort study of 704, 743 women from the UK [^115sxWrN]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biological plausibility

Several mechanisms yet to be fully elucidated are suspected to play a role in the association between menstrual cycle characteristics and elevated risk of cardiometabolic outcomes. First, PCOS which a common cause of amenorrhea, irregular menstrual cycles, and oligomenorrhea is characterized by cardiovascular risk factors including metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The present study found that the association between menstrual complications and cardiometabolic outcomes was independent of PCOS. That PCOS is associated with an increased risk of CVD is debatable. Some studies report an increased risk of CVD among women with PCOS, while other studies argue that any observed association is minimal or restricted to severe phenotypes of PCOS. Second, other reproductive factors (endometriosis, fibroids) associated with changes in menstrual characteristics and linked to adverse cardiometabolic health may partly account for the observed association. However, exclusion of women with a record for endometriosis or fibroids in sensitivity analyses did not alter the observed effect estimates. Attenuation of the effect size on exclusion of women on current prescription for combined oral contraceptive (COC) suggests that increased CVD risk may be partly mediated by COC use. Third, changes in menstrual cycle characteristics are strongly linked to hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia suppresses the production of sex hormone-binding globulin resulting in elevated level of free testosterone. This hormonal environment is associated with higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes. Fourth, estrogen modulates vascular inflammation. Abnormal menstrual patterns may favor pro-inflammatory process which may result in atherosclerotic CVD. Fifth, differences in mechanistic pathways between menstrual cycle characteristics may partly account for the differences in findings. A longer cycle length may be indicative of fewer ovulations and, consequently, lower mean estrogen levels. Higher levels of endogenous estradiol before menopause have been associated with a decreased risk of subclinical atherosclerosis after menopause. Short menstrual cycle length may be an indicator of ovarian aging. Markers of diminished ovarian reserve including anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) have been associated with CVD risk factors. In addition, low AMH levels may act independently to promote atherogenesis.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: something other than a prolactinoma? [^114tejUu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize. As our case will demonstrate, however, there are a number of other causes that should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperprolactinemia.

### Menstrual cycle regularity and length across the reproductive lifespan and risk of premature mortality: prospective cohort study [^116EYBFc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this large prospective study, we found that women who experienced irregular or long menstrual cycles in adolescence and throughout adulthood were more likely to die before age 70 years than women reporting regular or short cycles. These associations were stronger for irregular and long cycles continuously present in adolescence and adulthood. Moreover, although irregular and long cycles during adulthood were associated with a higher risk of death due to cancer and cardiovascular disease, these relations were stronger for cardiovascular disease mortality. Our findings also suggest that the increased risk of premature mortality associated with long cycle length was slightly stronger among women who currently smoked.

Comparison with other studies

Irregular and long menstrual cycles have been associated with a greater risk of coronary heart disease, cancer, mental health problems, and multiple other common chronic conditions.PCOS, a common endocrinologic disorder characterized by androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction, has also been associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, coagulation disorders, and possibly cardiovascular disease. Although these data collectively indicate that menstrual cycle dysfunction might accelerate the risk of premature mortality, few population based studies have explored the association between menstrual cycle characteristics and mortality. In support of our findings, a prospective US cohort of 15 005 mothers followed over 40 yearsreported a higher risk of death due to cardiovascular disease among women with an irregular menstrual cycle. In the same cohort, another study found that women with irregular menstrual cycles had a greater risk of death due to ovarian cancer. The association between PCOS and all cause mortality is less consistent, which could in part be related to differences in study design, sample size, and diverging definitions of PCOS across studies. In our present study, the association of irregular and long menstrual cycles with higher risk of premature mortality persisted when we excluded women with hirsutism, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids, indicating that these relations were not solely driven by PCOS or other common gynaecologic conditions.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescence [^1128871m]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome of variable combinations of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism or acne, and obesity. It can be diagnosed in adolescence and has early childhood antecedents. PCOS is the single most common endocrine cause of an ovulatory infertility and a major risk factor for the metabolic syndrome and, in turn, development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women. Thus, it appears that PCOS increases a woman's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Therefore, identifying girls at risk for PCOS and implementing treatment early in the development of PCOS may be an effective means of preventing some of the long-term complications associated with this syndrome. This article reviews the definition, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of PCOS.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1147rL4E]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

3.1 Ovulatory dysfunction

Women with PCOS commonly present with irregular menstrual cycles and anovulation, although neither of the criteria are mandatory for the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam consensus. As follicle development is slowed down by low action of follicle‐stimulating hormone partly due to high anti‐Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, menstrual cycles tend to be longer in women with PCOS, thus resulting in oligomenorrhea. In cases with a more severe PCOS phenotype, women may also experience amenorrhoea. Indeed, a previous study showed that women with anovulation present more often with amenorrhoea (23.6%) compared to women with oligoovulation (10.3%). The cycle length on average is 60 days for women with anovulation and 43 days for women with oligoovulation. The women with anovulation and amenorrhoea also have higher androgen levels and waist circumference. In line with this, another study reported cycle length reflects the severity of the syndrome, with the women with amenorrhoea representing a more severe phenotype. Even though longer cycle length seems to predict anovulation, normal cycles may also present with anovulation. Interestingly, a study with over 3700 spontaneously menstruating women, aged 20–49.9 years and regular cycles, showed that as high as 26%–37% of cycles were anovulatory when validated against serum progesterone < 3 ng/ml during the luteal phase. In clinical practice, measuring luteinizing hormone surge that occurs one to one and a half days before expected ovulation (ovulation occurring 14 days before expected menses) or luteal phase serum progesterone (≥ 3 ng/ml 7 days prior expected menses and ± 3 days) can assist in cases where ovulation is uncertain despite normal cycle length. Moreover, a previously published clinical review suggests cycle length > 35 days being indicative for chronic anovulation, whereas in cases of cycle length that is slightly longer than normal (32–35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days), assessment for OD should be evaluated if only one other signs of the syndrome is present. It has to be noted though, that when establishing the diagnosis, ovulation assessments are quite rarely needed as usually other characteristics (PCOM and HA) are present (Phenotype C). There are also some challenges in diagnosing anovulation and irregular menses especially in adolescents and young women as OD may persist long after menarche. The international guideline, therefore, calls for caution in diagnosing PCOS in young women less than 8 years from menarche. It has to be noted also that affected women gain regular cycles with ageing. Whether this results in more frequent ovulation or increased likelihood of spontaneous pregnancies is unclear and needs to be determined in future studies. The international PCOS EBG supports retrospective diagnosis if the woman has a history of irregular cycles in the presence of other diagnostic PCOS features (e.g. clinical/biochemical HA, PCOM). Considering this, regular cycles in an older woman may not prevent establishing the diagnosis.

### Irregular cycles, ovulatory disorders, and cardiometabolic conditions in a US-based digital cohort [^114hAnoG]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study also has several limitations. First, in this cross-sectional evaluation, all data were self-reported at baseline, so potential misclassification and reverse causation may be present. The cross-sectional design also limited our ability to account for lifetime hormone use in a more refined way that takes into account temporality. Future longitudinal evaluations with incident cases are needed to better understand causal effects and differentiate between increased lifetime risk vs earlier onset so that appropriate interventions over the life course can be explored. Second, the group without PCOS may include unreported and undiagnosed individuals given the complexity of a clinical PCOS diagnosis, which may lead to biased estimates. However, some of the associations remained after excluding individuals with possible PCOS based on reported irregular cycles and hirsutism. Third, the survey response of troubled by unpredictable periods to define irregular menstrual cycles is a subjective measure of irregular cycles, but this proxy measure may lead to early self-identification and screening among the general population regardless of health literacy level or access to health care or menstrual tracking technologies. Fourth, unmeasured confounding may exist. Fifth, we were unable to generate commonly used composite CVD end points because we did not have data on cardiovascular death or hospitalization, and our definition for metabolic syndrome was modified based on data availability. Additionally, multiple comparisons might increase the type I error rate. However, there is no uniform agreement on whether or when multiple testing adjustments are warranted. Our analysis of PCOS showed large effect sizes and statistical significance, and our analysis on irregular cycles among participants without PCOS are novel and hypothesis generating by nature. Finally, given the criteria and self-selection for enrollment, our findings may not be generalizable to all US individuals or to other populations.

Adolescents with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) frequently present with arrested pubertal development or amenorrhea. Early evaluation of menstrual irregularities can avoid a delayed diagnosis. There are various genetic, autoimmune, and iatrogenic causes of POI, although most of the cases will not have an identified cause. Prompt initiation of hormone replacement therapy will restore developmentally appropriate pubertal progression, establishment of menses, and optimization of bone and cardiovascular health. The diagnosis of POI is often unexpected and life-altering for an adolescent and has broad health and psychosocial implications that are best approached with empathy, educational resources, and engagement of multidisciplinary specialists.

### Cycle and hormone changes during perimenopause: the key role of ovarian function [^114cK8U6]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

The menopausal transition is the stage in reproductive life commonly defined as commencing with the onset of menstrual irregularity. Classic studies of the endocrinology of the transition postulated the existence of inhibin in women to explain the observed increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels without a significant decrease in estradiol (E2). Descriptions were provided of cycle characteristics during the transition, emphasizing the unpredictability of the endocrine changes rather than the occurrence of an orderly and progressive decline in ovarian function. Women older than the age of 45 exhibited menstrual irregularity when the average number of primordial follicles per ovary decreased to approximately 100. Inhibin B is a major regulator of FSH secretion and a product of small antral follicles. Its levels respond to the early follicular phase increase and decrease in FSH. The age-related decrease in ovarian primordial follicle numbers, which is reflected in a decrease in the numbers of small antral follicles, leads to a decrease in inhibin B, which in turn leads to an increase in FSH, hypothesized to act as a stimulus to the maintenance of circulating E2 in the follicular phase until late in the transition. Concurrently, the concentrations of testosterone do not change significantly. Early follicular phase FSH levels in women reporting menstrual irregularity fluctuate markedly, with a more uniform increase in levels when no menses have occurred for at least 3 months. Anovulatory cycles occur at increased frequency in the last 30 months before final menses or menopause. In ovulatory cycles, FSH shows little, if any, increase, but anovulatory cycles are usually characterized by low levels of inhibin B, markedly increased levels of FSH, and low levels of E2. Thus, the heterogeneity of follicular phase FSH represents a mixture of ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. Longitudinal data indicate that both ovulatory and anovulatory cycles occur after entry into both the early and late menopausal transition and that ovulatory cycles occur even after final menses. There is no endocrine marker of menopause, which may be primarily an endometrial event. Using the hormonal concentrations in ovulatory cycles observed in women in mid-reproductive age as controls and comparing such concentrations in late reproductive age women older than 45 either continuing to cycle regularly or having entered the early or late menopausal transition, a gradual increase in follicular phase FSH and E2 and a decrease in inhibin B were observed in ovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles showed markedly increased FSH with low E2 and inhibin B. No specific endocrine change was characteristic of either the early or late menopausal transition, confirming the observations of previous studies regarding the unpredictability of cycle characteristics and hormone changes with the approach of menopause. Antimüllerian hormone correlates with follicle numbers and shows a large age-related decrease to reach undetectable levels at menopause. Thus, the marked decrease in follicle numbers during late reproductive age appears to predispose to erratic and unpredictable cycle characteristics, with normal ovulatory cycles continuing to occur episodically. There is no specific endocrine marker of the early or late transition, making measurements of FSH or E2 unreliable in attempting to stage an individual with regard to approaching menopause.

### Irregular cycles, ovulatory disorders, and cardiometabolic conditions in a US-based digital cohort [^114rwcst]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. First, a sample size of 60 789 participants allowed for sufficient statistical power to detect even modest associations, including with some less common cardiometabolic conditions. Second, we collected time-to-regularity data as an early-life marker of menstrual health, which could prompt interventions to reduce future cardiometabolic risk. Third, our study was among the first to account for PCOS status when evaluating associations between irregular cycles and cardiometabolic conditions, which could better distinguish the potential pathophysiology of the observed associations. Fourth, we explored preliminary differences in age at diagnosis of cardiometabolic conditions by PCOS status and time to regularity, which may inform future research on early intervention and quality of life over the life course. Finally, the AWHS includes a diverse population by demographics; thus, our findings may be more generalizable than previous studies that evaluated PCOS, irregular cycles, and cardiometabolic conditions.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length > 35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women < 17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — diagnosis thresholds and patient education — We suggest that clinicians only make the diagnosis of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) after excluding the anatomic or organic pathology of amenorrhea, and we suggest diagnostic evaluation for FHA in adolescents and women whose menstrual cycle interval persistently exceeds 45 days and/or those who present with amenorrhea for 3 months or more; we suggest screening patients with FHA for psychological stressors, and once clinicians establish the diagnosis of FHA, we suggest they provide patient education about various menstrual patterns occurring during the recovery phase and inform patients that irregular menses do not require immediate evaluation and that menstrual irregularity does not preclude conception.

### Endocrine regulation of menstruation [^113YYyFc]. Endocrine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

In women, endometrial morphology and function undergo characteristic changes every menstrual cycle. These changes are crucial for perpetuation of the species and are orchestrated to prepare the endometrium for implantation of a conceptus. In the absence of pregnancy, the human endometrium is sloughed off at menstruation over a period of a few days. Tissue repair, growth, angiogenesis, differentiation, and receptivity ensue to prepare the endometrium for implantation in the next cycle. Ovarian sex steroids through interaction with different cognate nuclear receptors regulate the expression of a cascade of local factors within the endometrium that act in an autocrine/paracrine and even intracrine manner. Such interactions initiate complex events within the endometrium that are crucial for implantation and, in the absence thereof, normal menstruation. A clearer understanding of regulation of normal endometrial function will provide an insight into causes of menstrual dysfunction such as menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and dysmenorrhea (painful periods). The molecular pathways that precipitate these pathologies remain largely undefined. Future research efforts to provide greater insight into these pathways will lead to the development of novel drugs that would target identified aberrations in expression and/or of local uterine factors that are crucial for normal endometrial function.

### Causes, patterns, and severity of androgen excess in 1205 consecutively recruited women [^112SPqR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

In premenopausal women, irregular or absent menstrual periods and clinical signs of androgen excess were the most common causes for assessment of androgens (47.0% and 48.0%, respectively), followed by difficulties to conceive (5.5%). In postmenopausal women, clinical hyperandrogenism was the most frequent cause leading to measurement of serum androgens (57.0%). Rare causes included overt virilization (0.5% in premenopausal and 7.0% in postmenopausal) and adrenal incidentaloma (0.5% in premenopausal and 12.0% of postmenopausal).

Although the majority of the 378 women with at least one increased serum androgen had an underlying diagnosis of PCOS (77.2%), rare and very rare causes of androgen excess were also identified, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH; 4.8%), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC; 4.0%), ovarian hyperthecosis (OHT; 1.9%), Cushing disease (CD; 1.6%), adrenocortical adenoma (ACA; 1.3%), and ovarian tumors (0.5%). In 36 patients (9.5%), no explanation for the increased serum androgen concentrations was identified. PCOS was the most common diagnosis in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women; however, the number of PCOS diagnoses was much lower in the postmenopausal group (29.3% vs 89.0%). Among all women with PCOS (n = 292), 266 (91.1%) were not taking antiandrogenic medication or metformin at the time of biochemical assessment, 7 (2.4%) were on a contraceptive pill, 3 (1.1%) took spironolactone, and 16 (5.4%) metformin.

### Menstrual disorders in the college age female [^115Vkosn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

College-age young women frequently experience a variety of menstrual-related complaints, including dysmenorrheal, menorrhagia, irregular menses, and menstrual-related mood changes. These problems deserve careful evaluation; they may reflect normal ovulatory menstrual symptoms or be suggestive of significant pathology that can have a major impact on future reproductive and general health. The menstrual cycle is a vital sign whose normalcy suggests an overall good health and whose abnormality requires evaluation. Eating disorders and the female athlete triad increase the risk of osteoporosis; polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with future cardiovascular risks. Diagnosis and management of these problems will not only improve a young woman's current health, sense of well-being, and overall quality of life but may also lower her risks for future disease and ill-health. This article addresses normal menstrual function, excessive bleeding, infrequent or absent menses, pain with menses, menstrual-related mood disorders, and recommendations about routine gynecologic examinations and evaluation.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112CKZgE]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinological disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 8–13%. According to the Rotterdam criteria, PCOS is diagnosed based on the presence of two out of three characteristics: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities (oligo or anovulation), and the detection of polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound, after the exclusion of other causes. The Androgen Excess-PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) state that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction, and the exclusion of other related disorders. While the AE-PCOS and NIH largely agree with the diagnostic criteria outlined in Rotterdam, hyperandrogenism is considered to be a fundamental component in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Reproductive (irregular menses, infertility and pregnancy complications), metabolic (increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and psychological (depression, disordered eating, body image distress, and reduced quality of life) characteristics are associated with PCOS.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112ibjBM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

2.1 Defining ovulatory disorders

In the reproductive years — and in the absence of pregnancy, the process of lactation, or the use of pharmacological agents such as contraceptive steroids — the normal woman releases a mature oocyte from a Graafian follicle in a relatively predictable and cyclical fashion. However, a consensus definition of ovulatory disorders, sometimes called ovulatory dysfunction, has been lacking. The notion of anovulation or absent ovulation is but one manifestation, but there exists a spectrum of chronic or episodic conditions or circumstances that also disrupt the predictable and cyclical ovulatory process. Previously, infrequent ovulation has been termed "oligo‐ovulation", which typically, but not always, manifests with some combination of infrequent and irregular onset of menstruation as defined in FIGO AUB System 1 (FIGO discontinued the term oligomenorrhea). However, and recognizing that many women with ovulatory disorders may have normal‐length menstrual cycles, no clear definition of infrequent ovulation has been adopted, and this was not addressed in the joint "Committee Opinion" on Infertility Workup for the Women's Health Specialist produced by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Fertility Society.

Furthermore, while an occasional failure to ovulate is expected and may not contribute to infertility, it may well cause an episode of delayed onset of menses and even HMB. This circumstance begs the inclusion of intermittent anovulation in a broad‐based, all‐encompassing definition of ovarian dysfunction. An additional consideration is other aberrations in ovulatory function, such as the luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF), and the luteal out of phase (LOOP) events 9 that represent, respectively, mechanical failure to release the mature oocyte and the premature recruitment of follicles in the luteal phase, each of which could be candidates for inclusion in the definition of ovulatory dysfunction.

As a result of these considerations, it is apparent that there is an unmet need for both a revised definition of ovulatory disorders and a consensus classification system designed to guide research, education, and clinical care across disciplines.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^112GpmXG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Ovulatory Dysfunction

Clinically, ovulatory dysfunction is marked by significant and chronic menstrual dysfunction, including polymenorrhea (ie, episodes of menstrual-like vaginal bleeding occurring at < 21-day intervals) or oligo-amenorrhea (ie, episodes of vaginal bleeding occurring at > 35-day intervals or < 8 times yearly). However, apparent regularity of menstrual cycles (ie, self-reported eumenorrhea) in the presence of hyperandrogenism is associated with ovulatory dysfunction in up to 40% of presenting patients. Women with PCOS often experience longer menstrual cycle intervals because follicle development is partially arrested by lower sensitivity to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), contributed to in part by elevated levels of AMH. Moreover, increased gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse amplitude and frequency results in the pituitary secreting high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and relatively low levels of FSH. High LH serum levels further contribute to increased androgen production in the ovary, thereby causing follicular arrest. This results in ovulatory dysfunction, which is characterized by infrequent or prolonged menstrual cycles. Women with a more severe phenotype may experience amenorrhea. The average cycle length for women with anovulation is 60 days, while it is 43 days for women with oligo-ovulation.

Defining oligomenorrhoea in adolescents is complex, as irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction are a normal component of pubertal transition, with physiological maturation of the hypothalamic, pituitary ovarian axis occurring over several years. The International PCOS Guideline recommends that in adolescents, irregular menstrual cycles are defined according to gynecological age:

Irregular cycles are normal in the first year post menarche as part of pubertal transition
> 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days
> 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year
> 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle

Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche

Adolescent menstrual cycle maturation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — In adolescents, anovulation is frequent, with 85% of menstrual cycles are anovulatory during the first year after menarche, and up to 59% of cycles are still anovulatory during the third year after menarche. With aging in PCOS, women with PCOS appear to gain more regular cycles as they approach menopause; cycle irregularity improves with increasing age, and it has been hypothesized that women with PCOS may have a longer reproductive life span.

### Genetic and epigenetic characteristics in ovarian tissues from polycystic ovary syndrome patients with irregular menstruation resemble those of ovarian cancer [^1156NU12]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated the similarities in the genetic and epigenetic landscapes between patients with irregular menstrual cycles and ovarian cancer, providing further evidence to distinguish an irregular menstrual cycle as an independent risk for ovarian cancer. We showed that the DNA from ovarian tissues of patients with irregular menstrual cycles display global DNA hypomethylation, a hallmark characteristic of nearly all types of cancers. We next showed that patients with irregular menstruation share miRNA and mRNA expression profiles similar to those observed in ovarian cancer, and that many oncogenic genes are upregulated in patients with ovarian cancer. Finally, we identified multiple point mutations in two genes that confer a significant increased risk for ovarian cancer, BRCA1 and MLH1, in patients with irregular menstruation.

While these results begin to show a genetic relationship between ovarian cancer and irregular menses, they still do not illustrate whether these genetic changes directly lead to the phenotype of irregular menstruation, or if they are a product of abnormal hormone exposure as a result of irregular menstruation. Several studies have shown that aberrant hormone levels result in elevated risks for cancer, particularly sex hormones and the development and progression of gynecological cancers. Furthermore, it is highly likely that a patient with irregular menstruation would have an atypical sex hormone profile. This warrants further investigation into the relationship of hormonal regulation and the genetic changes observed in patients with irregular menstruation.

Ovulatory dysfunction

Ovulatory disorders exist on a spectrum (Figure 4) that encompasses occasional delayed or failed ovulation to a chronic process that can cause amenorrhea or manifest with bleeding that varies in volume, duration, and frequency.

FIGURE 4
Typically, but not always, these disorders manifest abnormalities in FIGO System 1 parameters that describe menstrual bleeding pattern: frequency, regularity, duration and volume of bleeding.

Whereas the diagnosis of AUB‐O is generally suggested by a history of irregular bleeding obtained via FIGO's AUB System 1, the specific cause of the ovulatory disorder requires a structured evaluation. While ovulatory status can usually be suggested from FIGO System 1, when there is a lack of clarity other measures may be employed, including daily measurement of basal body temperature or obtaining serum progesterone in the suspected luteal phase of the cycle.

Recently, a classification system for ovulatory disorders was developed under the aegis of FIGO by the Committees for Menstrual Disorders and Related Health Impacts (formerly the Menstrual Disorders Committee) and Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. The development involved journal editors, recognized experts, and national, subspecialty, and lay societies from around the world to achieve international consensus for replacing a system developed over 50 years ago by the WHO. The new system comprises three anatomic categories, as well as a separate category for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which are recognized in the acronym "HyPO‐P": Type 1 (Hypothalamic); Type 2 (Pituitary); Type 3 (Ovarian); and Type 4 (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) (Figure 5). Each of the three anatomic categories includes a list of subtypes that follow the acronym GAIN‐FIT‐PIE (Genetic, Autoimmune, Iatrogenic, Neoplasm, Functional, Infectious and Inflammatory, Trauma, and Vascular; Physiological, Idiopathic, Endocrine) reflecting the various possible mechanisms within a given anatomical location. The investigational pathway for an individual with an ovulatory disorder is dependent upon a number of factors, including age, reproductive goals, and the suspected causes based on the initial evaluation.

FIGURE 5
The proposed FIGO classification system for ovulatory disorders. This system allows for an initial allocation of presumed primary source of ovulatory dysfunction (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or ovary). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined separately and the WHO classification system for the same should be adopted. After anatomical allocation, known or presumed mechanism is classified according to the GAIN‐FIT‐PIE acronym, as appropriate and applicable.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^115NsxNA]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Female athletes — menstrual cycle and hormonal factors in testing include hormone-related performance variability and the influence of contraceptives, with a preference for standardized cycle timing and documentation. Cycle changes across the menstrual cycle can influence performance and recovery, variability and dysfunction may occur (particularly in heavy exercisers), and some athletes use synthetic hormones. Testing should ideally occur at a standardized menstrual or hormonal-contraceptive phase — many studies have chosen the first 5 d of the follicular phase — or at least be interpreted for cycle-specific alterations, and the tested phase should be documented according to available resources.

### Reasons for hormonal contraceptive use in a cohort of African-American women living in the Detroit area [^111gW6Fs]. Contraception (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize reasons for hormonal contraceptive (HC) use in 1,455 African-American women, aged 23–35 years.

Study Design

The community-based cohort members were recruited from the Detroit, Michigan area in 2010–2012. HC history was collected via telephone interview.

Results

Seven percent reported HC use exclusively for non-contraceptive purposes, and 49% reported non-contraceptive reasons in addition to contraception. Non-contraceptive reasons were reported for all HC types, but were most common for combined oral contraceptives. Primary reasons were for irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, and pain.

Conclusions

In this large cohort of Black women, HC use to treat menstrual problems was common.

Implications

HCs were commonly used for both pregnancy prevention and management of menstrual symptoms, but some women used HCs exclusively for menstrual symptom relief. The importance for women of non-contraceptive reasons for HC use may not be adequately recognized, and published data on Black women's reasons for HC use remain limited.

1.1 Values and preferences

In the absence of evidence-based diagnostic criteria, we have relied on the recommendations of the NIH Panel as noted above. The presence of specific phenotypic features may result in different risk and comorbidity profiles. For example, hyperandrogenism may be more highly associated with metabolic abnormalities, whereas irregular menses and PCO morphology may be more highly associated with infertility. When interpreting published research, clinicians should note that criteria different from their own may be used when performing research. The committee notes that the diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in women who are perimenarchal or perimenopausal because amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are natural stages in reproductive maturation and senescence, as are changes in circulating androgens and ovarian morphology. Therefore, we discuss the diagnosis of PCOS separately in these groups. Finally, because there is evidence of a genetic component to PCOS and familial clustering of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in male and female relatives, a careful family history should be taken, and further screening of first-degree relatives is a consideration.

Diagnosis in adolescents

1.2 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent girl be made based on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (after exclusion of other pathologies) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. Anovulatory symptoms and PCO morphology are not sufficient to make a diagnosis in adolescents because they may be evident in normal stages in reproductive maturation (2|⊕⊕○○).

1.2 Evidence

All PCOS diagnostic criteria were derived for adults (Table 1), not adolescents. Furthermore, normal adolescent physiology may mimic symptoms of PCOS. Oligomenorrhea is common after menarche during normal puberty and is therefore not specific to adolescents with PCOS. Anovulatory cycles comprise 85% of menstrual cycles in the first year after menarche, 59% in the third year, and 25% by the sixth year. Anovulatory cycles are associated with higher serum androgen and LH levels. Approximately two-thirds of adolescents with PCOS will have menstrual symptoms, and for one-third it will be the presenting symptom, with the spectrum from primary amenorrhea to frequent dysfunctional bleeding. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate persistent oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea as an early clinical sign of PCOS, especially when it persists 2 years beyond menarche.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL DOSING REGIMENS

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescence — chronic anovulation and menstrual irregularities: Chronic anovulation and menstrual irregularities are very common in adolescence, with approximately 40% to 50% of adolescent girls having anovulatory cycles; the prevalence of ovulatory cycles increases from 23% to 35% during the first year after menarche to 63% to 65% in the fifth year after menarche. In a cohort assessed at ages 15 and 18 years, persistent oligomenorrhea was not predicted by increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH), increased androgens, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, yet it was present in 43% of girls with normal androgen levels, 40% with normal LH levels, and 44% with normal-appearing ovaries on ultrasound; increased body mass index (BMI) was the major risk factor for persistence of anovulation, and elevated testosterone and polycystic ovaries — but not increased LH — were predictive of persistence at age 18.

### Amenorrhea: an approach to diagnosis and management [^117UFmGd]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although amenorrhea may result from a number of different conditions, a systematic evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment of selected serum hormone levels can usually identify the underlying cause. Primary amenorrhea, which by definition is failure to reach menarche, is often the result of chromosomal irregularities leading to primary ovarian insufficiency (e.g. Turner syndrome) or anatomic abnormalities (e.g. Müllerian agenesis). Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of regular menses for three months or the cessation of irregular menses for six months. Most cases of secondary amenorrhea can be attributed to polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, or primary ovarian insufficiency. Pregnancy should be excluded in all cases. Initial workup of primary and secondary amenorrhea includes a pregnancy test and serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovarian function and should not be presumed infertile. Patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea should be evaluated for eating disorders and are at risk for decreased bone density. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are at risk for glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and other aspects of metabolic syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome (or variant) should be treated by a physician familiar with the appropriate screening and treatment measures. Treatment goals for patients with amenorrhea may vary considerably, and depend on the patient and the specific diagnosis.

PCOS, possibly extending to men's health, imposes a considerable health and economic burden worldwide. Diagnosis in adults follows the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, requiring two out of three criteria - clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and/or specific ovarian morphological characteristics or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone. However, diagnosing adolescents omits ovarian morphology and anti-Müllerian hormone considerations. PCOS, marked by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, strongly contributes to early-onset type 2 diabetes, with increased odds for cardiovascular diseases. Reproduction-related implications include irregular menstrual cycles, anovulatory infertility, heightened risks of pregnancy complications and endometrial cancer. Beyond physiological manifestations, PCOS is associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosexual dysfunction and negative body image, collectively contributing to diminished health-related quality of life in patients. Despite its high prevalence persisting into menopause, diagnosing PCOS often involves extended timelines and multiple health-care visits. Treatment remains ad hoc owing to limited understanding of underlying mechanisms, highlighting the need for research delineating the aetiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome. Identifying factors contributing to PCOS will pave the way for personalized medicine approaches. Additionally, exploring novel biomarkers, refining diagnostic criteria and advancing treatment modalities will be crucial in enhancing the precision and efficacy of interventions that will positively impact the lives of patients.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Adolescence — diagnostic context and natural history in PCOS are outlined: As many as 85% of menstrual cycles are anovulatory during the first year after menarche, and up to 59% are still anovulatory during the third year after menarche; in one study, persisting oligomenorrhea was not predicted by increased androgens, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, or increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, whereas increased body mass index (BMI) was the major risk factor for persistent anovulation; only approximately 40% of adolescent women with menstrual irregularity have polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and investigators suggest that oligoamenorrhea or amenorrhea should be present for at least 2 years after menarche (or primary amenorrhea at age 16 yrs), that ultrasound criteria should include increased ovarian size (> 10 cm³), and that hyperandrogenemia rather than just signs of androgen excess should be documented.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex syndrome that affects menstrual regularity, causes hyperandrogenism, increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction and infertility, and is associated with higher rates of mental health disorders. The symptoms of PCOS are unique to each individual and will evolve throughout their reproductive lifespan and beyond. Thus, care should be personalized and provided by an appropriate team of multidisciplinary physicians and clinicians, such as dieticians and psychologists.

1 Smart phone apps are useful for determining patterns. 9 Etiologies of amenorrhea can be categorized as: outflow tract abnormalities, primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, other endocrine gland disorders, sequelae of chronic disease, physiologic, or induced. Most cases are idiopathic; however, irradiation, chemotherapy, infections, tumors, autoimmune processes, and chromosomal irregularities can also cause primary ovarian insufficiency. 10 A karyotype is abnormal in approximately one-third of patients with primary amenorrhea, and it should be offered to all patients with a diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency to identify Turner syndrome. 10, 21. HYPOTHALAMIC AND PITUITARY CAUSES Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a disorder of chronic anovulation caused by suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis from body weight loss, excessive exercise, or stress and may result in infertility or bone density loss. 2, 44–46 The pathology is similar to the female athlete triad; both are characterized by menstrual dysfunction, low energy availability, and decreased bone mineral density. OTHER ENDOCRINE CAUSES Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. PCOS is a multifactorial endocrine disorder characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, biochemical or clinical androgen access, and polycystic ovaries. 6, 8, 12, 49 The Rotterdam Consensus Criteria require two of the aforementioned features for diagnosis; the Androgen Excess Society requires hyperandrogenism and another feature. Thyroid and Adrenal Disease. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism may cause amenorrhea. 2, 6, 12 Late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a common cause of hyperandrogenic amenorrhea; an elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level should be followed by confirmatory adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. Chronic Disease, Physiologic, and Induced Causes Patients with chronic disease may experience amenorrhea; however, these conditions are often recognized by individual signs and symptoms. Menopause should be considered in patients older than 40 years. 15, 16, 54 Pregnancy, lactation, hormonal contraceptives, and exogenous androgens may also cause amenorrhea. 2, 3, 6.

### Amenorrhea: an approach to diagnosis and management… [^111zHsuS]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Primary amenorrhea is often, but not exclusively, the result of chromosomal irregularities that lead to primary ovarian insufficiency or anatomic abnormalities. Most pathologic cases of secondary amenorrhea can be attributed to polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, or primary ovarian insufficiency. Differential Diagnosis and Treatment ANATOMIC ABNORMALITIES Müllerian agenesis, a condition characterized by a congenital malformation of the genital tract, may present with normal breast development without menarche, and may be associated with urinary tract defects and fused vertebrae. 18 Other congenital abnormalities that may cause amenorrhea include imperforate hymen and transverse vaginal septum. In these conditions, products of menstruation accumulate behind the defect and can lead to cyclic or acute pelvic pain.

Physical examination, as well as ultrasonography or MRI, is key to diagnosis, and surgical correction is usually warranted.
18. PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY Primary ovarian insufficiency, a condition characterized by follicle depletion or dysfunction leading to a continuum of impaired ovarian function, is suggested by a concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone in the menopausal range, confirmed on two occasions separated by one month, and diagnosed in patients younger than 40 years with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. HYPOTHALAMIC AND PITUITARY CAUSES The ovaries require physiologic stimulation by pituitary gonadotropins for appropriate follicular development and estrogen production. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea occurs when the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is suppressed due to an energy deficit stemming from stress, weight loss, excessive exercise, or disordered eating.

Other Causes of Amenorrhea POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME PCOS is a multifactorial endocrine disorder, usually involving peripheral insulin resistance. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism found on clinical or laboratory examination, polycystic ovaries as suggested by ultrasonography, and ovulatory dysfunction. The Rotterdam Consensus Criteria published in 2003 require the presence of two of the three above conditions for diagnosis, whereas the Androgen Excess Society's 2006 guidelines require hyperandrogenism and either of the remaining two conditions.
