## Question

the 5 w of fever?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about applying the "5 Ws" (Who, What, When, Where, Why) to fever evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define fever across populations and contexts. Then, I should verify the key elements of history and physical examination that anchor the differential. Next, I will review initial diagnostic testing and when to escalate to imaging or advanced studies. After that, I need to consider special populations and environments. Finally, I will appraise the role of antipyretic therapy and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the "What" of fever, because definitions vary by setting and population, and I need to ensure I'm using the right thresholds. In adult ICU patients, SCCM/IDSA define fever as a single temperature ≥ 38.3°C, whereas for hospital-acquired infections, CDC uses > 38.0°C, and in long-term care residents ≥ 65 years, IDSA uses ≥ 37.8°C orally or a rise > 1.1°C from baseline; for febrile neutropenia, fever is ≥ 38.3°C once or ≥ 38.0°C sustained ≥ 1 hour, and in infants 8–60 days, fever is ≥ 38.0°C, so I should explicitly match the definition to the clinical context before proceeding.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fever patterns implying specific diagnoses; I should double-check the role of fever periodicity. Classic tertian and quartan patterns historically mapped to Plasmodium species, but I need to remember that fever patterns alone are insufficiently specific for modern diagnosis and must be integrated with exposure, travel, and diagnostics, so I will treat them as supportive clues rather than diagnostic anchors [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the "Who" to frame pretest probabilities and tailor testing. Age, immunocompromise, pregnancy, and comorbidities shift the differential; for example, well-appearing infants 8–60 days require standardized risk stratification and often lumbar puncture, whereas immunocompromised hosts may have infection without fever and warrant broader empiric coverage, and older adults in LTC have lower fever thresholds and higher risks of occult infection, so I need to ensure my evaluation matches the host [^114aTYCM] [^1116SG8x].

> I will now examine the "When" to anchor the timeline and urgency. Acute fevers under 3 weeks prompt evaluation for common infections and noninfectious causes, whereas fever persisting beyond 3 weeks with an unrevealing initial workup meets criteria for fever of unknown origin and justifies a more structured, clue-directed approach; postoperative fevers have time-based differentials, with atelectasis and early wound issues versus later infectious complications, and in neutropenia, fever mandates urgent evaluation within 60 minutes, so I should align actions with the fever's chronology and the patient's risk [^117Nng2s] [^1126TSo2].

> Let me consider the "Where" to localize the source and guide testing. I should confirm whether the fever is community-acquired, nosocomial, or device-associated, because this changes the likely pathogens and the need for cultures of indwelling lines; in ICU patients with central venous catheters, I should obtain paired central and peripheral blood cultures and consider differential time to positivity, and in postoperative patients, site-directed CT of the operative field is reasonable if the source remains unclear, while in children with fever without source, chest radiography has low yield unless respiratory signs or high leukocytosis are present [^116VCFKP] [^1119ZEQw] [^113NWVeq].

> Now, I need to check the "Why" to distinguish infectious from noninfectious etiologies and avoid premature closure. Infections dominate but noninfectious causes include drug fever, transfusion reactions, malignancy, autoimmune disease, and hyperthermia syndromes; importantly, temperatures > 41°C that are unresponsive to antipyretics suggest hyperthermia rather than fever, and the absence of fever does not exclude infection in immunocompromised hosts, so I should verify the pathophysiology before labeling the process [^115QHJSc] [^1116SG8x].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation, and I need to ensure I don't overtest reflexively. A meticulous history and physical examination are foundational, with attention to exposures, travel, animals, medications, and devices; initial labs commonly include CBC with differential, metabolic panel, urinalysis, and cultures guided by suspected sources, and in ICU patients with new fever, a chest radiograph is reasonable unless another source is obvious, with escalation to CT or ultrasound based on clinical clues and surgical history [^1125TVQh] [^115uQJ1e].

> Wait, let me verify the role of biomarkers because I don't want to overinterpret them. CRP rises within 12–24 hours and peaks around 48 hours, while PCT rises earlier and is more specific for bacterial infection; however, guidelines suggest against routine biomarker use in high-probability infection and allow consideration in low-to-intermediate probability scenarios to support de-escalation, so I should use them judiciously and in clinical context [^112YoH1B] [^112HqvGw].

> I should confirm when to escalate to advanced diagnostics. If initial evaluation is unrevealing and the patient remains febrile, FDG-PET/CT can help localize occult infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease, and in surgical patients with persistent fever, cross-sectional imaging of the operative field is recommended; conversely, routine abdominal ultrasound or POCUS is not advised without abdominal signs or recent surgery, and WBC scans lack sufficient evidence for routine use in undifferentiated ICU fever [^114sybdQ] [^1119ZEQw] [^114mYPXE] [^1153Jpio].

> But wait, what if the patient is a well-appearing infant or a postoperative patient; I should tailor the approach. In infants 8–60 days, standardized algorithms with blood, urine, and selective CSF testing and risk scores guide management, whereas in postoperative fever, timing and surgical site direct imaging and cultures; in suspected CVC infection, paired cultures and consideration of catheter removal are key, and in immunocompromised hosts, empiric antibacterial therapy is indicated while diagnostics proceed [^114aTYCM] [^1119ZEQw] [^116VCFKP].

> I will now examine the role of fever therapy, and I need to be careful not to conflate comfort with outcome benefit. High-quality evidence shows fever therapy does not reduce mortality or serious adverse events in febrile adults, and SCCM/IDSA suggest avoiding routine antipyretics solely to lower temperature in critically ill patients, though antipyretics may be used for comfort if valued by the patient, so I should individualize treatment and avoid reflexive antipyresis [^112ih2xU] [^112TuYSd] [^117ADJMW].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical synthesis so it's actionable. Define fever using the correct threshold for the setting, characterize the patient and timeline, localize the source with history, exam, and targeted tests, and escalate imaging or advanced diagnostics only when indicated; avoid treating fever itself unless for comfort, and remember that infection can be present without fever, especially in immunocompromised hosts, so I should maintain diagnostic vigilance and adapt to special populations and environments [^1116SG8x] [^117ADJMW].

The 5 Ws of fever are **Who** (patient demographics and risk factors), **What** (temperature threshold and pattern), **When** (duration and onset), **Where** (clinical setting and exposure), and **Why** (underlying cause and management implications) [^1116SG8x]. These elements guide **targeted evaluation and management** by aligning the history, examination, and diagnostics with the patient's context and likely etiologies [^115ChBjx].

---

## Who: patient demographics and risk factors

- **Age**: Neonates and infants have higher risks of serious bacterial infection (SBI) and require distinct pathways [^114aTYCM]; older adults may have blunted fever responses and atypical presentations [^1116SG8x].
- **Immunocompromise**: HIV, malignancy, transplant, and immunosuppressive therapy increase risk of opportunistic infections and atypical presentations [^111N4GXd].
- **Comorbidities**: Chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, CKD, COPD) and pregnancy alter fever patterns and management.
- **Vaccination status**: Influences likelihood of certain infections (e.g. measles, pertussis, COVID-19) [^notfound].

---

## What: temperature threshold and pattern

- **Definition**: Fever is generally ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) orally; thresholds vary by context (e.g. ≥ 38.3°C in ICU, ≥ 38.0°C in infants) [^1116SG8x] [^114aTYCM].
- **Pattern**: Continuous, intermittent, remittent, or relapsing patterns can suggest specific etiologies (e.g. malaria, typhoid, brucellosis) [^114r4xpx].
- **Height**: Very high fevers (> 40°C) may indicate severe infection or hyperthermia syndromes [^1135pHz5].

---

## When: duration and onset

- **Acute**: ≤ 7 days; suggests infectious etiologies (viral, bacterial) or acute inflammatory processes.
- **Subacute**: 1–3 weeks; consider infectious, autoimmune, or malignancy.
- **Chronic**: > 3 weeks; defines fever of unknown origin (FUO) and requires structured evaluation [^115QePFm].
- **Onset**: Sudden vs gradual onset informs urgency and differential (e.g. sepsis vs autoimmune disease).

---

## Where: clinical setting and exposure

- **Community vs hospital**: Community-acquired infections differ from nosocomial (e.g. MRSA, VRE, Candida) [^1175MSLX].
- **Geography**: Travel and residence inform exposure risks (e.g. malaria, TB, dengue, COVID-19) [^113RjAiM].
- **Exposure**: Animals, water, food, chemicals, and occupational hazards guide the differential (e.g. leptospirosis, brucellosis, Q fever) [^notfound].

---

## Why: underlying cause and management implications

- **Infectious**: Most common cause; includes bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic etiologies [^notfound].
- **Non-infectious**: Autoimmune, malignancy, drug fever, thromboembolic disease, and hyperthermia syndromes [^notfound].
- **Management**: Antipyretics may not improve outcomes; treat underlying cause and use antipyretics for comfort [^117ADJMW] [^112ih2xU].

---

The 5 Ws of fever provide a **structured approach** to evaluation, ensuring appropriate diagnostics and management tailored to the patient's context and likely etiologies [^notfound].

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) criteria influences diagnostic outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112fHDkq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Criteria classifying fever of unknown origin (FUO) patients remains subject to discrepancies. A minimal standardized set of investigative tests serves as the foundation for the qualitative criteria, whereas quantitative incorporates the length of evaluation (7 or 3 days). A systematic review of studies would help physicians anticipate the frequency of illness types that could influence management.

Methods

Prospective studies published in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from January 1, 1997 to July 31, 2022, were included. A meta-analysis estimated associated pooled proportions between these criteria and diagnostic outcomes adjusted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) definitions.

Results

Five qualitative studies corresponded to an increase of 15.3% (95% CI: 2.3%-28.3%, P = 0.021) in undiagnosed FUO proportions compared to eleven quantitative studies. Quantitative studies had 19.7% (95% CI: 6.0%-33.4%, P = 0.005) more in adjusted infectious disease proportions than qualitative studies. No significant differences in proportions between FUO defining criteria were noted for adjusted noninfectious inflammatory disorders (P = 0.318), oncology (P = 0.901), non-inflammatory miscellaneous disorders (P = 0.321), diagnostic evaluation process, gross national income (GNI), or World Health Organization (WHO) geographic region.

Conclusions

Use of either qualitative or quantitative FUO criteria was associated with a statistically significant risk of over- or under-estimating infectious diseases and undiagnosed illnesses when using an ICD-10 adjusted FUO five-category system. Clinicians should anticipate differences depending on which criteria are used. While further research is warranted, qualitative criteria provide the best framework for study comparisons.

Guideline methodology — consensus and best-practice statements: Best-practice statements were made only when suggested GRADE criteria for best-practice statements were met. Best practice statements had to be clear, answer an important actionable question where the benefit would be unequivocally large, and evidence would be difficult to collect or summarize, and an explicit rationale for the benefit was provided. After finalizing a preliminary recommendation, members of the taskforce received electronic links to indicate their agreement or disagreement, and consensus required 80% agreement by at least 75% of the voting panel.

### Fever after immunization: current concepts and improved future scientific understanding [^11413Fx5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Fever is a common clinical complaint in adults and children with a variety of infectious illnesses, as well as a frequently reported adverse event following immunization. Although the level of measured temperature indicative of a "fever" was first defined in 1868, it remains unclear what role fever has as a physiologic reaction to invading substances, how best to measure body temperature and compare measurements from different body sites, and, consequently, how to interpret fever data derived from vaccine safety trials or immunization safety surveillance. However, even with many aspects of the societal, medical, economic, and epidemiologic meanings of fever as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) still elusive, it is a generally benign — albeit common — clinical sign. By standardizing the definition and means of assessment of fever in vaccine safety studies, thereby permitting comparability of data, we hope to arrive at an improved understanding of its importance as an AEFI.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### Febrile illness mapping-much of the world without data and without evidence-based treatments [^111hzb4e]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating the vital importance of infectious diseases to policy makers and the populations they represent and gives us the opportunity and the obligation to re-think how we do things and learn from collective failure. The SARS-Cov-2 virus is almost certainly here to stay as an endemic pathogen and will need to be integrated into prevention and treatment algorithms. These mapped data suggest that we should plan now for consensus guidelines on the design and reporting of fever studies, improving data sharing and identifying areas of the world with sparse epidemiological information, for the population size, to prioritise for investigation, and diverging from the 'usual places', and optimising use of these data to inform empirical treatment algorithms.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline abstract — evaluation of new fever in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients states that fever occurs in 26–88% of adult ICU patients and that etiologies include both infectious and noninfectious causes; noninfectious causes of fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis, but initial evaluation of patients with new-onset fever is usually directed at potential microbial causes and this is the primary focus of the guideline. The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version, the guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts, and there was no industry input or funding. Methods included a systematic review that statistically summarized the evidence, assessment of evidence quality using the GRADE approach, and use of an evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^1135pHz5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A mild elevation in core temperature is of benefit in sepsis. Non-pyrogenic hyperthermia is associated with short-term, medium-term, and long-term effects in a variety of organs. The damage occurs via a number of local and systemic mechanisms. Additionally, there appears to be emerging evidence of an overlap in the mechanisms of heat generation in different conditions. The evidence is that in sepsis the beneficial effects of pyrexia may balance these deleterious factors. However, in non-sepsis, the accumulation of the deleterious consequences of hyperthermia occurs early, at even mild degrees of fever. Hyperthermia above 40 °C appears to carry a high mortality by whatever cause. Early recognition, immediate cooling, and organ support are the mainstays of treatment, and to this end an improved understanding of the pathophysiology will continue to develop.

### Fever of unknown origin: historical and physical clues to making the diagnosis [^1131XZYQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has fascinated and perplexed clinicians for over a century. No published guidelines exist on the approach to FUO, and studies have demonstrated that a diagnosis is never established in up to 30% of cases. A comprehensive history and physical examination are the keys to establishing a diagnosis in patient with FUO. This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of FUO by delineating the most important elements of a comprehensive history and physical examination.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for fever in the ICU, more specifically with respect to temperature measurement, IDSA/SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to prefer central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors, if they are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical to diagnosis and management.

### Fever of unknown origin: clinical overview of classic and current concepts [^111237hy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

The phenomenon of spontaneous regression and remission from cancer has been observed by many physicians and was described in hundreds of publications. However, suggestive clues on cause or trigger are sparse and not substantiated by much experimental evidence. In this review, literature is surveyed and summarised and possible causes are discussed. At least in a larger fraction of cases a hefty feverish infection is linked with spontaneous regression in time and is investigated as putative trigger. Epidemiological and immunological evidence is put into perspective. An online forum to discuss the possible application of fever therapy in the future can be accessed at.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^116rdmtX]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of study

Antipyretics are routinely administered in care both in and out of hospital, and physical cooling is applied in severe fever not responding to antipyretic drugs. Our results suggest little to no difference in effect between fever therapy and no fever therapy; realistic, while still clinically relevant, intervention effects of fever therapy have so far not been properly studied, however. Fever therapy may be investigated in further adequately powered high quality randomised trials also including a health economics perspective, to define implications for patients and society.

Conclusion

Fever therapy does not seem to affect the risk of death or serious adverse events in febrile adults. We found insufficient evidence to confirm or reject the hypothesis that fever therapy influences quality of life or the risk of non-serious adverse events.

### Fever therapy revisited [^112VKV7Z]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Since there is much evidence that fever alone can have beneficial effects, experiments using pyrogenic cytokines for treatment of cancer (e.g. interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), interferon-(IFN)-alpha) should discuss cytokine and fever effects separately.

Clinically controlled induction of fever as part of therapy regimen should be re-considered, now carefully addressing fever height, fever duration, fever schedule and distance in time between fever and chemotherapy, before or after.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^117Ji8mj]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Whether the benefits of fever therapy outweigh the risks is unknown, and previous randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses have not included sufficient information to confirm or reject the effect of fever therapies. In 2019 Young and colleagues did a meta-analysis comparing more active fever management with less active fever management in critically ill patients. This study showed no statistically significant difference between the compared groups. In 2015 Zhang and colleagues did a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis comparing fever therapy with control in critically ill patients with sepsis. This study failed to identify any beneficial effect of antipyretic therapy. In 2021 Sakkat and colleagues did a meta-analysis comparing antipyretics with placebo in critically ill patients. This study concluded that antipyretic therapy does not reduce mortality.

To overcome the limitations of these previous studies and to increase statistical power, we aimed to include both a wide population base and multiple fever therapies. We aimed to answer the question of whether the evidence supports the use of fever therapy compared with no fever therapy in adult patients in relation to outcomes important to patients, such as mortality, adverse events, and quality of life.

### Febrile illness mapping-much of the world without data and without evidence-based treatments [^116djrzd]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There are no up-to-date inventories of what pathogens are present in our world or per country. One of the last attempts at a global synthesis was the three volumes of Simmons et al. but the Americas were not apparently included, presumably because they escaped continental land warfare in World War II. The GIDEON system collates global data but is a commercial system, unaffordable by most in LMICs. Armed forces include medical intelligence organisations, and WHO is leading the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) system. Has not the time come for an accessible global system linking nations for sharing, curating and mapping infectious disease data, surveillance, academic and lay, both endemic and epidemic, to inform national, regional and global policy and implementation? National registers and data on when, where and how pathogens are diagnosed in countries can be used for discovery curve analysis to predict how many pathogens may be found within a country based on past accrual (in press).

Serious adverse events

Sixteen trials (19 comparisons) with a total of 2415 participants reported on serious adverse events. The included trials assessed the effects of five different fever therapy interventions: ibuprofen versus placebo (three trials), paracetamol versus placebo (six trials), physical cooling versus no intervention (three trials), antipyretics plus physical cooling versus no intervention (two trials), and physical cooling plus antipyretics versus antipyretics (two trials). All 2415 participants were admitted to hospital; 2050 were critically ill, and 251 were non-critically ill (supplementary table S1). One trial included both critically ill and non-critically ill patients (120/2415). Of the 2415 participants, 1658 had infectious fever and 477 had non-infectious fever (supplementary table S1). For 286/2415 participants the origin of fever was unknown (supplementary table S1). A total of 307 (24.0%) of 1281 trial participants had a serious adverse event in the fever therapy group compared with 276 (24.2%) of 1140 in the control group.

Meta-analysis of serious adverse events did not show evidence of a difference (risk ratio 1.02, 0.89 to 1.17; I² = 0%; P = 0.78; 16 trials; high certainty evidence) (fig 4; supplementary table S3). Quantitative measures of heterogeneity (I² = 0%) combined with visual inspection of the forest plot did not show signs of significant heterogeneity (fig 4). Trial sequential analysis showed that we could reject the hypothesis that fever therapy reduces the relative risk of serious adverse events by 23% (fig 5). We assessed this outcome result as being at high risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence as being high (supplementary table S3). None of the subgroup analyses showed evidence of a difference (supplementary figures S12-S19). The assessment time points varied between trials, ranging from one day after randomisation to 90 days after randomisation.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^111voXvf]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results

The search strategy defined in the protocol found 3273 publications that were evaluated to identify trials matching our inclusion criteria. We included a total of 42 trials randomising 5140 participants (supplementary figure S1). Twenty three trials assessed 11 different antipyretic drugs, 11 trials assessed physical cooling, and eight trials assessed a combination of antipyretic drugs and physical cooling. Of the participants, 3007 were critically ill, 1892 were non-critically ill, 3277 had infectious fever, and 1139 had non-infectious fever; 3062 participants were admitted to hospital, and 2078 were outpatients. We assessed 21 trials as being of some concern and 21 trials as being at high risk of bias (fig 1). The 42 included trials provided a total of 75 comparisons (supplementary table S1). Seventeen trials were included in meta-analyses. Missing data constituted ≤ 5% of the overall data, and we deemed the impact of missing data to be low; therefore, we did not do sensitivity analyses

All cause mortality

Sixteen trials (19 comparisons) with a total of 2415 participants reported on all cause mortality. The included trials assessed the effects of five different fever therapy interventions: ibuprofen versus placebo (three trials), paracetamol versus placebo (six trials), physical cooling versus no intervention (three trials), antipyretics plus physical cooling versus no intervention (two trials), and physical cooling plus antipyretics versus antipyretics (two trials). All 2415 participants were admitted to hospital; 2050 were critically ill, and 251 were non-critically ill (supplementary table S1). One trial included both critically ill and non-critically ill patients (120/2415) (supplementary table S1). Of the 2415 participants, 1658 had infectious fever and 477 had non-infectious fever (supplementary table S1). For 286/2415 participants, the origin of fever was unknown (supplementary table S1). A total of 294 (23.0%) of 1281 fever therapy participants died compared with 258 (22.6%) of 1140 control participants.

SCCM/IDSA guidelines for adult ICU new-onset fever describe an update using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and apply to adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise; the document addresses microbiologic studies, imaging procedures, and the use of biomarkers for fever with initial onset after ICU admission, focusing on detection of potential infectious etiologies. It states that not all febrile episodes dictate a need for investigation when a noninfectious etiology is obvious such as postoperative fever, and that for fevers requiring investigation a good history and physical examination will often reveal potential sources of infection. It directs that diagnostic studies should then be sent with those potential sources in focus rather than reflexively sending cultures for all possible sources, notes that any recommendation from the 2008 guideline not specifically addressed in this update remains in place, and clarifies that although recommendations may be applicable to severely immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant recipients and those with severe neutropenia, these populations are not directly addressed here.

Diagnosing the disease and implementing treatment early can decrease mortality. Early treatment includes empirical antibiotics and resuscitation. The diverse physiology present in sepsis can make the resuscitation complex; many different types of hemodynamic monitoring may be necessary. Even with this complexity, an organized approach can improve patient outcomes.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults: 40 years on… [^1175MSLX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A revision of the criteria of fever of unknown origin (FUO), established in 1961, is desirable because of important evolutions in medical practice and the emergence of new patient populations. The development of rapid laboratory tests and powerful diagnostic tools, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging often makes hospitalization unnecessary and new categories of patients such as those with HIV infection, neutropenia, immunosuppression and nosocomial illness require an approach different from classical FUO. The more then 200 reported causes of FUO can be classified into four diagnostic categories; infections, tumours, noninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIID) and miscellaneous. A uniform classification system is highly wanted to allow comparison between different series. The reports of the 1990s show slight changes in the distribution of causes, namely less infections, less tumours, more NIID and more undiagnosed cases. A uniform diagnostic strategy cannot be determined. The initial investigation should be directed by potentially diagnostic clues revealed by extensive history, meticulous physical examination and a standard set of laboratory tests. 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron-emitted-tomography is a new valuable total body scintigraphy in the search for the site of origin of the fever. In view of the rather good long-term prognosis, a wait-and-see strategy may be more appropriate than a systematic staged approach. Elderly patients and patients with episodic fever represent two specific groups of classical FUO that require a distinct approach. HIV-associated, nosocomial and neutropenic FUO should be considered as separate clinical entities.

### Investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin in adults [^117Nng2s]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Few clinical problems generate such a wide differential diagnosis as pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin. The initial definition proposed by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961,¹ later revised, is "a fever of 38.3°C (101°F) or more lasting for at least three weeks for which no cause can be identified after three days of investigation in hospital or after three or more outpatient visits". ²⁻⁴Essentially the term refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an obvious cause despite reasonable evaluation and diagnostic testing. A fever that is not self limiting for which no cause can be found can become a source of frustration for both patient and doctor. There is little consensus on how such patients should be investigated, although recent prospective studies have evaluated diagnostic protocols to suggest approaches to investigation. ³⁵⁶ We discuss evidence from epidemiological and diagnostic studies and suggest an approach to investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin. Immunocompromised individuals, those with HIV infection, and patients admitted to hospital for other reasons with persistent or unexplained fever represent distinct subgroups in which the likely causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pyrexia usually differ from those in patients who are not immunocompromised. We do not discuss these subgroups in this review other than to provide definitions of pyrexia of unknown origin in different groups of patients (see box 1).

Discussion

In this systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses, we showed that fever therapy does not seem to affect the risk of death or serious adverse events in febrile adults. We found almost no signs of statistical heterogeneity, and none of the predefined subgroup analyses showed evidence of a difference in all cause mortality or serious adverse events, which supports the validity of our meta-analysis results. We found insufficient evidence to confirm or reject the hypothesis that fever therapy influences quality of life or non-serious adverse events.

The causes of fevers of unknown origin (FUOs) are diverse and may be the result of infectious rheumatic or inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. This article reviews the focused diagnostic approach to FUOs, emphasizing relevant history, physical examination, and selected laboratory tests using a clinical syndrome approach. Laboratory tests should be guided by the most likely diagnoses based on the presenting clinical syndrome. Considered in concert, nonspecific laboratory tests may provide important diagnostic clues. Using a sequential diagnostic approach, a focused evaluation diagnoses all but the rarest or most obscure causes of FUO.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^1116SG8x]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Fever definition — adult ICU and related settings: Normal body temperature varies by age, gender, diurnal variation, and sampling site, and evidence indicates a decrease of 0.03°C per birth decade over the last 157 years. For hospital-acquired infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines fever as a measured temperature of greater than 38°C. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) defines fever in individuals greater than 65 years old residing in long-term care facilities as a single oral temperature greater than 37.8°C, repeated temperature measurements greater than 37.2°C (oral) or greater than 37.5°C (rectal), or an increase from baseline greater than 1.1°C. In neutropenia due to chemotherapy, both IDSA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network define fever as a single oral temperature measurement greater than or equal to 38.3°C or greater than 38.0°C sustained over at least 1 hour. For ICU patients, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and IDSA have previously defined fever as the presence of a single temperature measurement greater than or equal to 38.3°C, which this guideline uses. Not all patients with infection manifest fever and, in fact, the absence of fever in patients with infection is associated with worse outcomes. Consequently, the recommendations in this guideline may generally apply to ICU patients with suspected infection regardless of the presence of temperature elevation.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an additional extensive and ongoing review of the literature, and supplemental data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived. For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

Society of Critical Care Medicine/Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever evaluation — computed tomography (CT) in postoperative surgical patients: For patients who have recently undergone thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery, we recommend performing CT (in collaboration with the surgical service) as part of a fever workup if an etiology is not readily identified by the initial workup (best-practice statement). There is insufficient evidence to allow for a recommendation to inform the diagnostic value of CT for the diagnosis of underlying causes of fever in ICU patients, yet there was consensus among the panel that it is reasonable for surgical patients to undergo CT imaging of the operative area when fever first occurs several days after surgery and an alternative cause is not readily identified; timing in the immediate postoperative setting has currently insufficient data and should be made in collaboration with the surgical services, with stability of the patient and risk of adverse events during transportation taken into consideration, indications that may include immunocompromised state and specific follow-up of abnormalities on plain radiography, and a benefit that CT can identify sources of fever for which direct diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention is possible (e.g., percutaneous drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess).

### Randomised controlled trial of an intervention to improve parental knowledge and management practices of fever [^116BscUi]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We know that parents require resources which can assist them to improve fever knowledge and management practices, and this is supported in the literature. Fever is one of the most common childhood symptoms and is defined as a temperature of greater than 38 °C. Fever is usually a self-limiting symptom with very low rates of associated serious illness.

Despite the benign nature of fever, parents often become alarmed and very concerned. Previous literature has demonstrated that this often leads to; aggressive treatment strategies; unnecessary and incorrect use of antipyretics; and parents seeking medical advice. Consequently, fever is one of the most common reasons for consultations with healthcare professionals (HCPs). Many of these consultation could be avoided if there was clarity on fever definition and fever management practices.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^112EGN9f]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations in relation to other studies

Previous studies have primarily focused on specific patient groups, such as critically ill patients and those with sepsis, or specific fever control interventions. Our review differs from previous research in that we have included a wider variety of both participants and fever therapies, allowing us, unlike previous studies, to obtain sufficient power by reaching required information sizes. The implications of including a variety of different interventions and a diverse patient group may entail results that are difficult to interpret if significant statistical heterogeneity is present. We therefore stated in the protocol that meta-analyses would be done only if the trials showed low levels of heterogeneity. With our analyses indicating low levels of heterogeneity and our subgroup analyses showing no subgroup differences, we deemed meta-analyses to be valid and did them including all identified trials. The relative effect, regardless of intervention type and patient group, being similar confirms and verifies our decision to pool these trials. We do, however, acknowledge that tests of heterogeneity most likely are underpowered.

The scope of this systematic review was wider in the population studied compared with previous research because our ambition was to assess the effects of fever therapy with regard to the outcomes most important to patients — that is, mortality and serious adverse events. Trials designed to investigate and report on these outcomes will inevitably focus on sicker patient populations; the participants included in the important analyses were all admitted to hospital, and most were critically ill. Our results therefore say little about fever therapy for milder disease states in the wider non-admitted population.

### Guidelines for evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients: 2008 update from the American college of critical care medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117SJxHc]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the practice parameters for the evaluation of adult patients who develop a new fever in the intensive care unit, for the purpose of guiding clinical practice.

Participants

A task force of 11 experts in the disciplines related to critical care medicine and infectious diseases was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Specialties represented included critical care medicine, surgery, internal medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, and laboratory medicine/microbiology.

Evidence

The task force members provided personal experience and determined the published literature (MEDLINE articles, textbooks, etc.) from which consensus was obtained. Published literature was reviewed and classified into one of four categories, according to study design and scientific value.

Consensus Process

The task force met twice in person, several times by teleconference, and held multiple e-mail discussions during a 2-yr period to identify the pertinent literature and arrive at consensus recommendations. Consideration was given to the relationship between the weight of scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Draft documents were composed and debated by the task force until consensus was reached by nominal group process.

Conclusions

The panel concluded that, because fever can have many infectious and noninfectious etiologies, a new fever in a patient in the intensive care unit should trigger a careful clinical assessment rather than automatic orders for laboratory and radiologic tests. A cost-conscious approach to obtaining cultures and imaging studies should be undertaken if indicated after a clinical evaluation. The goal of such an approach is to determine, in a directed manner, whether infection is present so that additional testing can be avoided and therapeutic decisions can be made.

### Fever of unknown origin: what is remarkable in the elderly in a developing country? [^113CDVAs]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate fever of unknown origin (FUO) in 97 patients and compare geriatric and adult population.

Methods

We investigated 97 (22 elderly) patients with FUO using the criteria of Petersdorf and Beeson [Medicine 40 (1961) 1] hospitalized between January 1990 and May 2005 at Hacettepe University Hospital.

Results

Infectious diseases were the most common cause in the adult (33.3%) and the elderly (45.5%) patients both. Neoplasms were seen in 18.7; 4.5% and collagen vascular diseases were diagnosed in 9.3; 4.5% of the adults and the elderly respectively. Tuberculosis accounted for 60% of all the infectious causes and empirical anti-tuberculous treatment served as a diagnostic method in 43% of the cases with tuberculosis. Lymphadenopathy was more common among the adults with FUO. A diagnosis could be reached in all the elderly patients with a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR > 100mm/h). At the end of the hospitalization, 14.7% (11/75) of the adult patients and 13.6% (3/22) of the elderly patients died.

Conclusion

Geriatric patients with FUO usually have characteristics similar to the adult patients with respect to the hospitalization time, diagnosis, and inpatient mortality. Lymphoid organ hyperplasia might be expected less frequently and very high ESR might be a more reliable indicator of systemic disease in the elderly. Empirical anti-tuberculous treatment plays an important diagnostic role in the developing countries with a higher prevalence of tuberculosis.

### Fever education: does it reduce parent fever anxiety? [^114Xownq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of the study were to determine the following: 1) if a fever education program (interactive or written) reduces parent fever anxiety; 2) if an interactive fever program was more effective as a teaching style than standard written material alone; and 3) if a fever program increases parent fever home management and reduces return emergency department (ED) visits.

Method

A quasiexperimental, pretest and post-test pilot study examining parental fever anxiety was conducted at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Eligible participants consisted of 87 parents and their children, aged 3 months to 5 years presenting with fever > 38.4 degrees C, and without coexisting serious illness.

Results

Both the interactive fever education program and the standard written fever pamphlet were equally effective as teaching methods. Data revealed a 30% reduction in fever anxiety rated as moderate-severe on arrival to none-low post-fever education, increased parent fever home management skills with correct use of thermometer and antipyretics, and reduced unnecessary return ED visits.

Conclusion

Parents in the acute and nonacute care setting may benefit from an interactive fever education program that includes the definition and benefit of fever, the correct use of a thermometer, fever home management skills, and appropriate fever telephone follow-up.

When asked about the definition of fever, 9.8% caregivers (10.2 vs. 9.5%) considered 37 °C as the threshold of fever, 39.8% considered 37.5 °C, and a large number of caregivers considered 38 °C. Except one in the ward group who did not know, the rest defined the temperature below 38 °C as fever. Moreover, the most common high fever threshold was 39 °C, respectively reported by 55.4% and 57.3% caregivers, then, followed by 38.5 °C (26.6 vs. 27.8%) and 40 °C (6.2 vs. 8.9%). While the two groups did not differ statistically on the definition of fever and high fever, and data was specifically illustrated in Table 2.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RjAiM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

A question remains: can there be an optimal diagnostic protocol to improve diagnostic yield, and for whom or where would it be most applicable? If this search is based on the diagnostic protocol with the least percentage of undiagnosed cases (eg, highest correlation), only 2 studies, used structured protocols reporting rates less than 10.0% despite differing protocols. However, these 2 studies enrolled patients with FUO according to criteria by de Kleijn et al. Therefore, further exploration into the most valuable elements of these 2 protocols might inform an optimal protocol. The positive practical implications of our research results appear to be clear, suggesting physicians worldwide should initially consider geographic disease prevalence when evaluating these patients.

Although this meta-analysis did not support using a structured FUO protocol, that does not exclude additional, more extensive studies exploring optimal diagnostic methods. The goal of FUO research should be to improve the accurate diagnosis and facilitate efficiency with as few tests as required. Possible concepts for future studies include (1) use of a standard contemporary criterion to classify adults with FUOthat would enhance research by allowing better comparison of studies; (2) use of geographic disease epidemiologyand potential diagnostic clues in formulating disease hypotheses, because cases without these clues are particularly challenging to diagnose; (3) design of initial agnostic panel-based diagnostic testing strategies to meet geographic variations in disease, particularly in patients without potential diagnostic clues; and (4) earlier incorporation of advanced diagnostic methods (eg, 18 F-fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography with or without computed tomography or unbiased next-generation sequencing methods). The most definitive approach would be developing a multicenter FUO network that could prospectively evaluate structured vs nonstructured diagnostic investigations incorporating these elements with geographic disease epidemiology.

Finally, undiagnosed disorders are challenging for patients, families, and clinicians. Therefore, forging an FUO network to evaluate patients with undiagnosed diseases that fosters the breadth of expert collaborations and builds on the principles of the precision diagnostic model implemented by the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Networkmight reduce undiagnosed FUO cases. By improving testing efficiency and patient outcomes, such a network would leverage findings to facilitate better patient care, including added information about existing diseases as well as the discovery of novel prolonged febrile conditions among the many remaining without diagnoses.

A temperature that exceeds 41.0 °C and is not responsive to pharmacologic anti-pyretic therapy is more commonly observed in patients with hyperthermia. Therefore, patients with milder elevations in body temperature and/or those whose temperature decreases when administered pharmacologic anti-pyretic drugs are unlikely to be suffering from a hyperthermia syndrome. On the contrary, the absolute temperature is not as helpful in differentiating between infectious and noninfectious pyrexia. Rather, this requires careful examination and investigation for a broad number of infectious and noninfectious diagnoses (Fig. 1). The following sections will provide an overview of several common aetiologies of hyperthermia and pyrexia, followed by presentation of data supporting their incidence in medical, surgical, and neurologically impaired patients.

### Pediatric fever [^1124saku]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fever is a common complaint in children. The most common cause is self-limited viral infection. However, neonates and young infants are evaluated and treated differently than older, vaccinated, and clinically evaluable children. Neonates should be admitted to the hospital, young infants in the second month of life may be risk stratified, and those deemed low risk on testing may be sent home with close follow-up. Children older than 2 months may be evaluated clinically for signs of bacterial infection that require intervention. Urinary tract infections cause more than 90% of serious bacterial illness in children, and younger children have a higher incidence of infection.

### ACR appropriateness criteria fever without source or unknown origin-child [^113NWVeq]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The cause of fever in a child can often be determined from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests; infections account for the majority of cases. Yet in 20%, no apparent cause can be found, designated as fever without source (FWS). The yield of chest radiography in children with FWS is low, and it is usually not appropriate. However, in children with respiratory signs, high fever (> 39°C), or marked leukocytosis (≥ 20,000/mm³), chest radiography is usually appropriate, as it has a higher yield in detecting clinically occult pneumonia. In newborns with FWS, there is higher risk for serious bacterial infection, and the routine use of chest radiography is controversial. In children with neutropenia, fever is a major concern. In some clinical circumstances, such as after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chest CT scan may be appropriate even if the results of chest radiography are negative or nonspecific, as it has higher sensitivity and can demonstrate specific findings (such as lung nodule and "halo sign") that can guide management. In a child with prolonged fever of unknown origin despite extensive medical workup (fever of unknown origin), diagnosis is usually dependent on clinical and laboratory studies, and imaging tests have low yield. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Predictors of disease severity in children presenting from the community with febrile illnesses: a systematic review of prognostic studies [^1162WjGj]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings emphasise the limitations of individual prognostic factors. Performance varies widely across settings and clinicians must be cognisant not to over interpret individual predictors. While prediction models can support clinical decision making, they must be derived and validated using appropriate methodology, and populations and outcomes relevant to the clinical problem. For the identification of children at risk of severe febrile illness, this will require multiple, large, collaborative, research initiatives across different settings, which collect harmonised data on predictors and outcomes, and include unselected children presenting from the community.

Recurrent fever of unknown origin is mostly caused by rather rare diseases and many cases remain unexplained. The very limited literature data do not allow one to construct a diagnostic algorithm. A number of general principles should be kept in mind before starting the investigation for this rare subtype of fever of unknown origin.

Imaging evaluation in ICU fever: in the absence of an obvious non-thoracic source of infection, all patients should undergo chest radiography; site-specific computed tomography should be performed in patients who have recently undergone thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery and may be considered in others with clinical findings pointing to these sites; and in patients with persisting fever when initial investigations fail to reveal a source, either usual care or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography may be considered.

### Revised definition of' fever of unknown origin': limitations and opportunities [^115oNtFP]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The limitations and opportunities of revised definition of fevers of unknown origin (FUO) in comparison to conventional definition were investigated, and prehospital characteristics of the patients were detailed.

Method

The patients were grouped according to both revised and classic definitions of FUO.

Results

Fifty-nine of the 80 patients (74%) met the conventional definition of FUO. Before their admissions, all patients had at least one course of antibiotic therapy. The aetiology was infectious in 52%, autoimmune in 19%, and neoplastic in 17%. In 12% of the cases, the reason for high fever could not be explained. The most common infectious aetiologies were various forms of tuberculosis (12%), brucellosis (12%), salmonella (7%) and malaria (5%). The revised definition inflated the rate of infectious aetiology.

Conclusion

A standardized set of diagnostic tools used in this study was suggested. The subjects of FUO series have to be screened for endemic infections.

Diagnostic lung ultrasound (LUS) has advantages over other imaging modalities, including its lack of radiation, safety, low cost, and accessibility, has been studied systematically in the evaluation of critically ill patients with fever and respiratory symptoms, and has been evaluated for acute respiratory failure or suspected pneumonia in emergency departments. There have been some studies in critically ill patients, but none solely for the evaluation of fever. LUS can detect parenchymal or interstitial lung pathology with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, and sonographic consolidation is highly specific.

### Fever of unknown origin: is there a role for empiric therapy? [^115UwYEq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy has little or no role to play in cases of classic fever of unknown origin with three important exceptions: cases that meet criteria for culture-negative endocarditis; cases in which findings or the clinical setting suggests cryptic disseminated tuberculosis (or, occasionally, other granulomatous infections); and cases in which temporal arteritis with vision loss is suspected. Several studies indicate that patients with prolonged, undiagnosed fever of unknown origin generally have a favorable prognosis. A small and largely anecdotal literature suggests a small role for symptomatic use of corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in highly selected cases.

### Akhawayni and the first fever curve [^114r4xpx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

By the time of Hippocrates the typical paroxysmal fever patterns of tertian (every 48 hours) and quartan (every 72 hours) fevers caused by malaria were known. Through the ensuing centuries, ancient Greek, Roman, and Persian physicians made additional contributions to the understanding of fevers. By the end of that era, there was a working definition of what constitutes a fever, the distinction between fever as a symptom and fever as a disease, an elaborate classification scheme for multiple types of fever, hypotheses as to the causes of fever, and methods for diagnosing and treating fevers. Based on the definition of fever at that time, the 10th century ce Persian physician Akhawaynī created fever curves hundreds of years before they were routinely used in the clinical setting. In Hidāyat al-Muta'allimīn fī al-Tibb, Akhawaynī describes a system for fever curves and draws fever curves for tertian and quartan Fevers, as well as the double tertian, double quartan, and triple quartan fevers. In this work we examine the history of fevers in the ancient world and the first description of the fever curve.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America adult ICU new fever biomarkers guidance states that in critically ill patients with a new fever and no clear focus of infection, when the probability of bacterial infection is low to intermediate, we suggest measuring procalcitonin (PCT) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When the probability is high, we suggest not measuring PCT to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest not measuring CRP to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For low to intermediate probability, we suggest measuring either serum PCT or CRP to rule out bacterial infection (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Biomarkers such as PCT and CRP deployed with rapid turnaround times, have been used as adjuncts in the early diagnosis of sepsis while awaiting microbiologic culture results, major guidelines recommend against routine use of biomarkers in the setting of sepsis and septic shock, out of respect for uncertain benefit and cost and availability issues, and in the setting of fever and lower likelihood of infection, however, there may be a role in obtaining a baseline value to assist in the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nCFXT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of recent prospective study data demonstrated insufficient evidence to support a positive association between using a structured diagnostic protocol and diagnostic yield in cases of FUO syndrome. However, analysis by geographic region did show clear differences in rates and types of diagnoses. This supports the argument that physicians worldwide should incorporate geographic disease prevalence when evaluating these patients. Given the considerable variation across regions and studies, larger-scale research is needed to sufficiently understand the sources and magnitudes of variation in FUO cases. Whether a universal FUO protocol can be developed or enhanced and tailored to geography and widely available resources has yet to be discerned. Clinicians evaluating these patients should remain vigilant for clues based on individual presentations and consequently acknowledge that a nonstructured evaluation protocol might be an appropriate choice for some or most patients.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^116W9oDD]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials was conducted in accordance with a pre-specified protocol registered on the international prospective registry of systematic reviews (PROSPERO CRD42019134006).

We searched all relevant databases from their inception to 2 July 2021 and included randomised clinical trials including adults diagnosed as having fever of any origin. Trials had to compare fever therapy with no fever therapy (with or without placebo/sham). Primary outcomes were all cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and non-serious adverse events. In accordance with the instructions in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, two authors independently reviewed each trial, using the second version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB2) to assess the risks of bias. We calculated risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals by using meta-analyses for dichotomous outcomes. We handled missing data by following the eight step procedure suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues. We did meta-analyses by following the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Keus and colleagues, and Jakobsen and colleagues. We used Stata version 16 to analyse the data. We combined a visual inspection of forest plots with a statistical analysis to identify potential heterogeneity. We did subgroup analyses to further investigate heterogeneity and to inspire hypotheses for future studies. Aiming to reduce the risk of type I and II errors, we used a multiplicity adjusted P value and did trial sequential analyses. We used the approach proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group for rating the certainty of the evidence. A comprehensive description of the methods is provided in the supplementary methods.

Differences between protocol and review

We revised our planned methods of assessing the risk of bias of the included trials and used the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool 2 (RoB2 tool)instead of the first version of the tool as stated in the protocol. Research in the field has progressed, and RoB2 reflects current understanding of how the causes of bias may influence trial results and is the most appropriate way to assess the risk of bias. Furthermore, we revised our planned methods for confirming or rejecting a fixed intervention effect of 25% to instead use trial sequential analyses to define the lowest intervention effects threshold we could confirm or reject.

### Persistent fever in the ICU [^115cNCud]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Disorders of elevated body temperature may be classified as either fever or hyperthermia. Fever is caused by a pyrogen-mediated upward adjustment of the hypothalamic thermostat; hyperthermia results from a loss of physiologic control of temperature regulation. Fever in the ICU can be due to infectious or noninfectious causes. The initial approach to a febrile, critically ill patient should involve a thoughtful review of the clinical data to elicit the likely source of fever prior to the ordering of cultures, imaging studies, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both high fever and prolonged fever have been associated with increased mortality; however, a causal role for fever as a mediator of adverse outcomes during non-neurologic critical illness has not been established. Outside the realm of acute brain injury, the practice of treating fever remains controversial. To generate high-quality, evidence-based guidelines for the management of fever, large, prospective, multicenter trials are needed.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, CELEBREX should be discontinued.

In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving CELEBREX compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.

5.15 Inflammation

The pharmacological activity of CELEBREX in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use

The concomitant use of CELEBREX with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.
