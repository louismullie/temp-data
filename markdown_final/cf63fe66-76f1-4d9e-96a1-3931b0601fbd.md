## Question

Work up for prolonged lymph node enlargement in neck. Would you do ct or ultrasound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CT or ultrasound should be used first for prolonged neck lymph node enlargement, and how to structure the workup accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification for malignancy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for first-line imaging in adults with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy. Next, I will consider ultrasound's strengths and limitations and when it might be reasonable as an initial test. After that, I should review when to escalate to MRI or PET/CT. Finally, I will integrate tissue diagnosis and follow-up thresholds to ensure the pathway is actionable and safe.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and risk assessment, because that drives imaging choice. Prolonged neck lymph node enlargement in adults is concerning when it persists beyond about two weeks without a clear infectious source, and risk increases with features such as firmness, fixation, size greater than 1.5 cm, supraclavicular location, or systemic B symptoms; importantly, a neck mass in adults should be considered malignant until proven otherwise, so I need to keep a low threshold for definitive evaluation and avoid unnecessary delays [^112yqkYs] [^114UJbTb] [^113hHaki].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on first-line imaging. The 2025 AAFP guidance recommends CT or MRI of the neck with contrast as first-line imaging for unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy, particularly in patients at higher risk of malignancy, and the AAO-HNSF guideline makes a strong recommendation for contrast-enhanced neck CT or MRI in adults with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy; ASCO similarly recommends contrast-enhanced neck CT as the initial test when metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy is suspected, which aligns with the principle of using cross-sectional imaging to survey deep nodal stations and mucosal primaries [^114UKtom] [^117LTixN] [^112cX4qG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ultrasound as a first test. Ultrasound is excellent for characterizing superficial nodes, assessing nodal morphology, and enabling ultrasound-guided FNA, but it can miss deep nodal disease and is operator dependent; guidelines position ultrasound as an adjunct or as first-line in select lower-risk scenarios or when CT/MRI are delayed or contraindicated, rather than the default initial study for persistent adult lymphadenopathy where malignancy risk is nontrivial [^116u567J] [^113XakQL].

> I should double-check the role of MRI and PET/CT before I commit to CT. MRI is preferred when soft tissue detail is paramount or when iodinated contrast is contraindicated, and PET/CT is generally reserved for staging after malignancy is diagnosed or for equivocal post-treatment scenarios; early PET/CT after definitive therapy can be falsely positive, so timing matters, and routine PET/CT is not recommended as an initial test for undiagnosed neck masses in general practice [^113aRKNf] [^115dt1dD] [^114nGk3a].

> Let me consider tissue diagnosis next, because imaging alone is insufficient when malignancy is suspected. Fine-needle aspiration is the preferred initial tissue sampling method for suspicious cervical nodes, with ultrasound guidance improving accuracy; core needle biopsy may be preferred if lymphoma is suspected or if FNA is nondiagnostic, and open biopsy should be avoided as an initial step due to potential morbidity and contamination of planes if malignancy is present [^1133TEGJ] [^113XakQL] [^116jkEhY].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or the node is clearly reactive and small. In children, ultrasound is the recommended first-line imaging for cervical lymphadenopathy because it avoids radiation and effectively characterizes reactive nodes; in carefully selected low-risk adults with very small, mobile, likely reactive nodes, a short interval of observation with clear return precautions may be reasonable, but persistent nodes beyond about four weeks warrant imaging and tissue diagnosis rather than continued watchful waiting [^111TzYE4] [^116EJVzK].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is that for an adult with prolonged neck lymph node enlargement without a clear benign etiology, contrast-enhanced CT of the neck from the skull base to the clavicles is the most appropriate first-line imaging test because it surveys deep nodal stations, evaluates potential aerodigestive primaries, and guides subsequent FNA or management; ultrasound can be used adjunctively for superficial node characterization and to facilitate FNA, and MRI or PET/CT should be reserved for specific indications or post-diagnosis staging needs [^114UKtom] [^117LTixN] [^113aRKNf].

---

For persistent neck lymphadenopathy, **contrast-enhanced CT of the neck is the first-line imaging** [^114uFw34] because it rapidly delineates nodal size, location, necrosis, calcification, extracapsular spread, and deep or occult disease, and it guides biopsy and staging [^112ZPxxG] [^115wDhpF]. Ultrasound is best reserved for **superficial nodes** or when CT is contraindicated, and is the preferred modality in children to avoid radiation [^111TzYE4] [^116u567J]. MRI is an alternative when CT is contraindicated or when soft-tissue detail is needed [^113aRKNf]. Choose CT first in adults; use ultrasound for superficial nodes, pediatrics, or when CT is not possible [^114uFw34].

---

## Clinical indications for imaging

Imaging is indicated for persistent lymphadenopathy — typically > 2–4 weeks without resolution — particularly when malignancy is suspected based on clinical features such as firmness, fixation, size > 1.5 cm, or systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^112yqkYs] [^113hHaki]. Imaging is also warranted when deep nodes are suspected or when initial ultrasound findings are inconclusive or suggest malignancy [^116u567J] [^117LTixN].

---

## Computed tomography (CT)

### Advantages

- **Comprehensive evaluation**: CT provides detailed cross-sectional imaging of cervical lymph nodes, including deep and non-palpable nodes [^115wDhpF].

- **Characterization**: CT can identify necrosis, calcification, extracapsular spread, and involvement of adjacent structures, which are critical for malignancy assessment and staging [^112ZPxxG].

- **Guidance for biopsy**: CT aids in planning and guiding biopsies, particularly for deep or difficult-to-access nodes [^112ZPxxG].

- **Efficiency**: CT is rapid, widely available, and less operator-dependent than ultrasound [^112ZPxxG].

---

### Limitations

CT exposes patients to **ionizing radiation**, which is a particular concern in children and young adults [^112ZPxxG]. It may also miss **small metastatic foci** or micrometastases, especially in early-stage disease [^111HVVax].

---

## Ultrasound (US)

### Advantages

- **Non-invasive and radiation-free**: Ultrasound is safe, particularly suitable for pediatric patients and repeated follow-ups [^114NRAhP].

- **Detailed nodal characterization**: Ultrasound can assess nodal size, shape, echogenicity, vascularity, and presence of a fatty hilum, aiding in differentiation between benign and malignant nodes [^115hmhnh].

- **Guidance for biopsy**: Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is highly effective for tissue diagnosis of suspicious nodes [^112RKVd4].

- **Cost-effective**: Ultrasound is generally less expensive and more accessible than CT or MRI [^114wPGyV].

---

### Limitations

Ultrasound is **operator-dependent**, with accuracy varying based on operator experience [^116u567J]. It has **limited penetration**, making it less effective for deep or retropharyngeal nodes and in patients with extensive soft tissue or obesity [^114L7e9y].

---

## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI provides **excellent soft-tissue contrast** and avoids ionizing radiation, making it useful when CT is contraindicated or when detailed soft-tissue assessment is required [^113aRKNf]. However, it is more expensive, less available, and longer in duration than CT, and may be limited by artifacts from dental implants or patient motion [^112ZPxxG].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of CT, ultrasound, and MRI

| **Attribute** | **Ct** | **Ultrasound** | **Mri** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Radiation exposure | Yes | No | No |
| Operator dependency | Low | High | Moderate |
| Soft tissue contrast | Moderate | High | Excellent |
| Deep node evaluation | Excellent | Limited | Excellent |
| Cost | Moderate | Low | High |
| Availability | High | High | Moderate |
| Speed | Fast | Moderate | Slow |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Adults**: CT or MRI of the neck with contrast is recommended as the first-line imaging modality for persistent lymphadenopathy, particularly in patients at high risk of malignancy [^114UKtom] [^117LTixN].

- **Pediatrics**: Ultrasound is preferred as the initial imaging modality due to the absence of radiation exposure and its effectiveness in characterizing superficial nodes [^111TzYE4] [^1127tgDt].

- **Special considerations**: MRI is recommended when CT is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, pregnancy) or when detailed soft-tissue assessment is required [^113aRKNf].

---

## Clinical scenarios and imaging modality selection

- **Adult with persistent neck lymphadenopathy**: CT neck with contrast is the preferred initial imaging modality [^114uFw34].

- **Pediatric patient with persistent lymphadenopathy**: Ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality [^111TzYE4].

- **Patient with contraindications to CT**: MRI neck with contrast is recommended [^117LTixN].

- **Superficial, palpable nodes**: Ultrasound-guided FNA is highly effective for tissue diagnosis [^112RKVd4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CT neck with contrast is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for persistent neck lymphadenopathy in adults, providing comprehensive evaluation, accurate staging, and guidance for biopsy [^114uFw34]. Ultrasound is preferred in pediatric patients and for superficial nodes, while MRI is reserved for specific clinical scenarios. The choice of imaging modality should be individualized based on patient age, clinical presentation, and availability of imaging resources.

### Head and neck lymph nodes in children: the spectrum from normal to abnormal [^1127tgDt]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy of the head and neck region is a common finding in children and a very common reason to image the craniocervical region. Enlarged lymph nodes are commonly palpated by the pediatrician in the office and commonly imaged by the pediatric radiologist. The difficult task of the clinician is to determine whether the adenopathy is acute (< 3 weeks) or chronic (> 6 weeks) and when imaging is indicated. In children, radiation is always a consideration when choosing an imaging modality; thus, US is usually the first imaging study at our institution, and CT the second option, usually reserved for the very ill child or for when there is a high index of suspicion for malignancy. We present the normal anatomy of head and neck lymph nodes and the US, CT, and MRI appearances in normal and pathologic states to help clinicians generate a reasonable differential diagnosis and prevent unnecessary procedures.

Surveillance strategy — post-treatment imaging for asymptomatic patients notes that there may be little proven benefit in further imaging if the initial 3-month FDG-PET/CT scan was negative, with Ho et al reporting no significant difference in 3-year disease-free survival in patients undergoing imaging surveillance versus those only receiving clinical surveillance (41% vs. 46%, P = 0.91) in this setting. If an FDG-PET/CT at 3 months post-treatment is negative, there are no data to support substantial benefit for further routine imaging in an asymptomatic patient with negative exam, and in the absence of multi-institutional prospective data, a tailored approach to surveillance with attention to tumor type, stage, prognostic factors, symptomatology, and physical exam changes or restrictions is appropriate. US of the neck is a well-established tool for nodal surveillance, and US is generally widely available, safe, fast, inexpensive, and an accurate modality for examination of the neck for any suspicious nodal disease. Additional post-treatment imaging is indicated for worrisome or equivocal signs/symptoms, and routine annual imaging (repeat use of pretreatment imaging modality) may be indicated to visualize areas inaccessible to routine clinical examination (deep-seated anatomic locations or areas obscured by extensive treatment change).

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^117FfBhS]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative neck imaging surveillance after primary resection states that ultrasound to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments is the preferred method of imaging surveillance for most DTC (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty evidence). If the serum Tg level after surgery is above the excellent response range (see Table 9), and/or there are Tg Ab, cervical ultrasound and/or cross-sectional imaging should be performed prior to administering RAI (Good Practice Statement). Six to 12 months following completion of initial therapy, cervical ultrasound to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments should be performed, with timing and frequency thereafter informed by the patient's risk for residual or recurrent disease and response to therapy (Good Practice Statement). Suspicious lymph nodes or lesions < 8–10 mm in shortest dimension may be followed without FNA unless they grow or threaten vital structures such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, esophagus, or great vessels (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). If cytological diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic DTC would influence treatment decisions or change management, ultrasonographically suspicious lymph nodes or lesions ≥ 8–10 mm in the shortest dimension should be assessed with FNA for cytology and measurement of Tg in the needle washout fluid (Good Practice Statement).

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^113XakQL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

AIUM practice guideline — lymph nodes ultrasound specifies that indications for an ultrasound examination of enlarged cervical lymph nodes include determination of likely inflammation from metastatic malignant lymph nodes; determination of a lymph node from another mass lesion such as a cyst, schwannoma, paraganglioma, lipoma, or parathyroid adenoma; determination of possible lymphomatous node(s); determination of the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy at specific levels to determine the required type of neck dissection; determination of the specific level of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma within lymph node(s) to assist in defining the primary source; fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology; and core sampling for lymphoma. A mass identified on physical examination is well suited to subsequent sonographic evaluation, lymph nodes are examined initially with grayscale ultrasound imaging, and if a focused examination is performed, a regional or comprehensive ultrasound inspection of other lymph node levels is usually required. If a primary malignant lesion in the aerodigestive tract or thyroid gland is identified on physical examination, ultrasound may be the first-line imaging modality used, allowing identification of other nodes that may not be palpable and access to cytology with ultrasound-guided FNA.

### Imaging of lymphadenopathy in the neck [^111HVVax]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging is playing a major role in the assessment of cervical lymphadenopathy. In infectious disease, the assessment of abscess formation and the relation of the abscess to surrounding vital structures is crucial for its management. In head and neck malignancies, imaging can be helpful for staging. Imaging of the neck for the assessment of nodal metastases can be used to detect occult metastases or to assess operability of palpable metastases. The detection of small occult metastases has limitations, as micrometastases cannot be depicted; however, imaging can fulfill a role in diminishing the risk of occult metastases, and thus influence management. For this purpose a very sensitive technique is necessary. The currently used radiological criteria are not sensitive enough to accomplish enough reduction of the risk of occult metastases; therefore, more sensitive CT and MRI criteria, but especially ultrasound-guided aspiration, should be employed to assess the clinically negative neck.

Ultrasound for neck mass evaluation — Ultrasound can be used to characterize a neck mass, to guide percutaneous tissue sampling, and to search for additional masses, and it is both noninvasive and inexpensive, although it is best suited for superficial tissue and will not adequately visualize most portions of the upper aerodigestive tract. Ultrasound is operator dependent with quality varying by ultrasonographer experience, and it may be considered as a first option for thyroid or salivary masses, when there will be a delay in obtaining CT or MRI, if contrast medium is contraindicated, or as an adjunct to expedite FNA biopsy.

### Neck computed tomography in pediatric neck mass as initial evaluation in ED: is it malpractice? [^115KoXiW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although ultrasound is regarded as the first choice imaging modality for evaluating a pediatric neck mass, neck computed tomography (CT) is necessary for urgent surgical conditions such as deep neck infections. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of and proper patient selection for neck CT as a method for the initial evaluation of pediatric neck masses in the emergency department.

Methods

We analyzed the medical records of 105 pediatric patients who visited the emergency department with neck mass whose initial imaging work-up was a neck CT and who visited the emergency department with a neck mass. The parameters investigated included the patient's age, sex, symptom duration, clinical impression, CT interpretation, final diagnosis, and treatment. The positive predictive value (PPV) for CT was calculated, and the parameters that correlated with an urgent surgical condition post-CT were evaluated.

Results

The median age was 6.5 years (1 month to 12 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 2:1. The most common initial impression was acute cervical lymphadenopathy. A comparison of the final diagnosis and CT scan demonstrated that the overall PPV was 96.2%. If the initial impression was a deep neck infection, a salivary gland infection, or tonsillitis, the PPV for CT was 100%. Fever (> 38.0°C) and severe tenderness were significant between patients with and without urgent surgical conditions on CT.

Conclusions

Computed tomography could be considered as the first diagnostic modality when an urgent surgical condition such as a deep neck infection is highly suspected.

### Imaging of head and neck lymph nodes [^114L7e9y]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The cervical lymph nodes can be affected by a variety of infectious, inflammatory, benign, and malignant pathologic conditions. Clinical history and physical examination with the complementary use of imaging is essential to accurately make a diagnosis or appropriate differential. Knowledge of cervical lymph node anatomy, drainage pathways, morphologic variations, and common nodal pathology is key to correct interpretation of cervical lymph nodes on imaging. Computed tomography (CT), MR, ultrasound, and PET/CT are complementary imaging modalities that can be used in the evaluation of cervical lymph node pathology.

### Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with concordant sonography as sufficient early detection tools for recurrent and persistent cervical metastases after (chemo) radiotherapy (CRT) [^114wPGyV]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Outside conventional and metabolic imaging modalities, sonography was explored for its efficacy. Yom et al.'s analysis supports delaying or even omitting prophylactic ND in cases of unremarkable lymph node findings. Conventional imaging techniques often face diagnostic challenges within the first 3 months post‐therapy, with sonography potentially offering valuable complementary insights. It is noteworthy to mention that, in comparison to all cross‐sectional imaging techniques, ultrasonography is more accessible and significantly more cost‐efficient.

Based on our examination of 143 neck sides, we identified a sensitivity of about 90% and nearly 67% specificity. Although these are no peak values, this imaging technique primarily serves as a supplementary tool, providing significant insights when combined with CT imaging. It is crucial to acknowledge institutional differences in terms of resource availability and expertise.

Our retrospective study remains inconclusive in advocating against prophylactic ND. Radiomics represents a promising avenue for future research in the diagnosis of regional lymph node metastases. Previous studies have demonstrated that radiomics models, when combined with clinical examination, can outperform conventional methods in diagnosing lymph node metastases in oral cavity carcinomas. However, no significant improvement in sensitivity compared to traditional imaging techniques has been observed to date. However, this study has demonstrated that in clinical practice, over the past several years, promising and satisfactory results have already been achieved using the combination of CT and ultrasound. Therefore, in addition to PET‐CT, more cost‐effective and readily available methods have shown good outcomes as well.

The diminished specificity observed in our study, which has been documented in numerous international investigations, necessitates rigorous deliberation regarding the etiology of such findings and potential preventive strategies. Multiple factors might contribute to false‐positive outcomes. Notably, the timing of the imaging is pivotal. It has been established that imaging conducted 4 weeks post primary therapy does not provide reliable insights regarding the long‐term success of the locoregional condition, associated with postoperative hypermetabolic activity. Additionally, post‐radiative inflammatory reactions and potential residual disease manifestations, which may resolve over time due to radiation aftereffects, should be considered. Haerle et al. showed that the absence of contrast agents following tumor‐associated necroses results in increased perilymphatic degradation reactions linked to inflammation, which led to a surge in false‐positive findings.

Imaging modality notes in adults with a neck mass — The performance of chest x-ray in the setting of a neck mass has not been established, although if the patient is deemed at risk for a primary lung cancer the results of a chest x-ray can guide further testing and management. PET/CT is ideally reserved for those patients in whom malignancy was already diagnosed and is generally utilized as part of the staging process.

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^114yYVZL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Infection and trauma — indications for ultrasound assessment of inflammatory and traumatic conditions of the neck include but are not limited to the following: identification of multiple enlarged lymph nodes with benign characteristics; differentiating cellulitis from abscess formation; differentiating an abscess from confluent lymphadenopathy; detection of subcutaneous emphysema in blunt neck trauma; identification of fractures of the laryngeal framework; identification of tracheal transection; and detection of the size and location of hematoma. Ultrasound is particularly useful in infectious states for both initial identification and sequential determination of treatment success. It is also particularly relevant as an intraoperative means of locating abscess formation amid confluent adenopathy. In trauma, it is noninvasive and generally directs the clinician to additional imaging tools.

### Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with concordant sonography as sufficient early detection tools for recurrent and persistent cervical metastases after (chemo) radiotherapy (CRT) [^1152fAoQ]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Within the cross‐sectional imaging diagnostics, initially conducted 3 months post‐therapeutically to establish a post‐treatment reference point and subsequently performed annually, radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists face a challenging situation. This challenge is compounded in patients who have undergone RT (radiotherapy), due to the thickening of the skin, platysma, pharyngeal walls, and laryngeal structures. Furthermore, in addition to the atrophy of the lymphatic tissue, including the Waldeyer's pharyngeal ring and cervical lymph nodes, edema in the retropharyngeal space can also be observed. Moreover, one‐year post‐radiation, 58% of patients exhibited fibrosis in the irradiated area. This fibrosis also contributes to the difficulty in evaluating lymph node metastases, especially early post‐CRT.

Irrespective of the previously described scenarios where patients are subjected to any form of post‐therapeutic persistent or recurrent tumor diseases, imaging diagnostics of these patients play a crucial role in offering the best possible therapy. It has been demonstrated that PET‐CT imaging can prevent overtreatment, in terms of elective post‐therapeutic NDs. The current focus is to determine how more accessible, cost‐effective, and simpler imaging techniques can support these findings even in patients who exhibit indications of tumor recurrence many years post‐therapy.

Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to retrospectively demonstrate how computed tomography (CT) and sonography (yNx), utilized during guideline‐restaging after prior (C)RT of the lymph nodes, were able to accurately represent the pathological actual lymph node status (pNx). Our research question investigates patients who underwent only (C)RT as their primary therapeutic intervention.

### Management of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^113PxDR1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation 6.2 — PET/CT response–guided neck management states that if PET/CT at 12 weeks or later shows mild FDG uptake in a node 1 cm or less or a persistently enlarged node 1 cm or greater without either mild or intense FDG uptake, the patient may be observed closely with serial cross-sectional imaging or PET/CT, and neck dissection is reserved for clinical or radiographic concern for progressive disease (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate, benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Supporting data report that at a median follow-up of 36 months, overall survival rates were 84.9% in the surveillance group and 81.5% in the planned neck dissection group, with locoregional control at 2 years of 91.9% versus 91.4%, respectively; surgical complications occurred in 42% of 54 patients who had neck dissection from the surveillance group versus 38% among 221 in the surgery group; the surveillance strategy produced a cost savings of $2,190 per patient and an incremental net health benefit of 0.21 quality-adjusted life years. Clinical interpretation notes that in the PET-NECK study, a residual mass without FDG uptake or mild FDG uptake in a normal-sized node was considered an incomplete or equivocal response and underwent neck dissection, but patients with residual lymph nodes that show no FDG uptake achieve high rates of long-term locoregional control, and mild FDG uptake — for example, SUV less than 3 — may reflect post-treatment inflammatory effects that can resolve with continued surveillance.

### Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with concordant sonography as sufficient early detection tools for recurrent and persistent cervical metastases after (chemo) radiotherapy (CRT) [^111LrrHJ]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

One of the most crucial factors that significantly influences survival is the involvement of local lymph nodes. When these are affected, the survival prognosis can decrease by 50%.

Except for early‐stage oral cavity cancers, managed with surgery alone, and larynx cancers, which can be addressed through surgery or radiation alone, the treatment of most head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cases necessitates multimodal approaches. Consequently, a multidisciplinary care approach is essential: Locoregionally advanced HNSCC is managed through either a combination of surgery followed by risk‐adapted adjuvant ((chemo‐)radiotherapy) ((C)RT) or definitive CRT. Owing to the significant influence on overall survival and locoregional control, the treatment of local lymph nodes necessitates a well‐established and robust therapeutic approach.

Recurrent or persistent tumor or metastatic states following completed (C)RT represent one of the most complex clinical scenarios for HNSCC patients. Post‐primary therapy, there are various clinical scenarios that elucidate this status. Fundamentally, the recurrence rate of the tumor itself depends on the location and stage of the disease. Over a period of 5 years, less than 50% of patients remain progression‐free. Subsequent therapy typically involves surgical salvage procedures, as they significantly improve survival in comparison to non‐surgical therapy. However, irrespective of the primary tumor, the presence of occult lymph node metastases in cN0 cases should not be overlooked. The incidence of these metastases varies depending on the primary tumor site, ranging from 12.9% for oral cavity tumors to 27.3% for hypopharyngeal tumors. The average rate of occult metastases for patients with advanced HNSCC lies at approximately 15.4%.

On the other hand, the group led by Mehanna et al. demonstrated that, fundamentally, in the cohort of patients immediately following CRT, there was no significant difference in survival outcomes among patients with advanced lymph node stages (N2, N3), when comparing post‐therapeutic observation using PET‐CT (positron emission tomography‐computed tomography) with planned neck dissection (ND).

In cases of newly emerging recurrence following complete remission, which may occur at any given time but is particularly frequent within the first 2 years, earlier presentation is always possible. Consequently, continuous post‐therapeutic follow‐up is conducted, consisting of clinical examinations and ultrasonography at three‐month intervals up to the 30th post‐therapeutic month, followed by six‐month intervals until the fifth post‐therapeutic year.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) lateral neck evaluation and treatment — Lateral neck lymph nodes are a significant consideration in the surgical management of patients with DTC, and metastases to these nodes must be considered for newly diagnosed disease and for surveillance of previously treated DTC. Initial evaluation of the new DTC patient with ultrasound (US), or other modalities when indicated, helps identify lateral neck nodes of concern. Positive imaging findings should be addressed using US guided FNAB to confirm lateral neck disease and a comprehensive neck dissection of levels IIa, III, IV, and Vb should be performed when indicated.

### Automated segmentation of lymph nodes on neck CT scans using deep learning [^115wDhpF]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck cancers comprise a diverse group of tumors that arise from the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx in addition to tumors arising in the thyroid gland and salivary glands, among other less common primary tumors arising from other organs in the head and neck. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are the most common mucosal malignancies in the head and neck. Identifying and accurately characterizing cervical lymph nodes is essential for the initial staging and surveillance of HNSCC. Determination of the presence and extent of nodal metastases is a requirement for the staging of HNSCC as part of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor node metastasis (TNM) classification, and this, in turn, is used to determine the optimal treatment regimen and patient prognosis.

Imaging plays an integral role in initial tumor staging as well as post-treatment tumor surveillance of HNSCC, enabling confirmation of clinically suspected lymphadenopathy as well as clinically unsuspected pathologic lymph nodes in deep nodal stations not palpable on clinical physical examination. The main anatomic imaging modalities used for the evaluation of cervical lymph nodes are computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US). These studies may be further complemented by functional metabolic imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET). The approach for imaging of the neck will vary based on the suspected primary pathology and to some extent based on institutional variations. However, CT is commonly the first-line imaging modality used for the initial evaluation of most non-thyroid-related head and neck pathologies, and at many institutions, the imaging modality is used for the initial staging of HNSCCs, particularly below the level of the hard palate.

### Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy [^114NRAhP]. Pediatrics in Review (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical lymphadenopathy affects as many as 90% of children aged 4 to 8 years. With so many children presenting to doctors' offices and emergency departments, a systematic approach to diagnosis and evaluation must be considered. In the following review, we aim to provide the pediatric clinician with a general framework for an appropriate history and physical examination, while giving guidance on initial diagnostic laboratory testing, imaging, and potential need for biopsy. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in the pediatric population is reactivity to known and unknown viral agents. The second most common cause includes bacterial infections ranging from aerobic to anaerobic to mycobacterial infections. Malignancies are the most concerning cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. The explosion in the use of ultrasonography as a nonradiating imaging modality in the pediatric population has changed the diagnostic algorithm for many clinicians. We aim to provide some clarity on the utility and shortcomings of the imaging modalities available, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

### To scan or not to scan: the dilemma of posttreatment imaging surveillance of head and neck cancer [^114qdqqH]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Locoregional recurrence remains common after treatment of head and neck cancer, warranting careful surveillance in follow-up. Although randomized data support an initial positron emission tomography/computed tomography several months after treatment, evidence supporting subsequent imaging is limited, and most recurrences ultimately manifest clinically. Cooperative group studies and consensus guidelines vary widely in their recommendations regarding surveillance imaging. Patients with indeterminate findings, new symptoms, or areas difficult to examine in clinic may avoid invasive and potentially morbid interventions with judicious use of subsequent imaging. For any patient undergoing posttreatment imaging, standardized reporting criteria provide a framework for risk-stratification that can enhance communication and potentially guide management.

### Differentiated thyroid cancer after thyroidectomy [^114dFTCV]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The widespread use of neck US and other imaging modalities has contributed to a phenomenon of increased detection of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Most of these cancers remain indolent, without requiring surgical intervention. Nonetheless, a subset of patients who require surgical treatment experience subsequent disease recurrence. This most commonly occurs in the cervical lymph nodes and thyroid bed, followed by distant metastasis to the lungs and bones. Because imaging is an integral part of postoperative surveillance, radiologists play a central role in the detection of recurrent tumors and in guiding treatment in these patients. US is the primary imaging modality used for postoperative evaluation. Other modalities such as CT, MRI, radioactive iodine imaging, and PET/CT aid in the accurate diagnosis and characterization of recurrent disease. Therefore, radiologists must have a thorough understanding of the utility of these imaging techniques and the imaging characteristics of recurrent DTC when interpreting these multimodality studies. The interpretation of imaging findings should also be correlated with the clinical status of patients and their biochemical markers to minimize interpretative errors. The authors present a broad overview of the postoperative evaluation of DTC, including its initial primary management, staging, and prognostication; clinical risk stratification for recurrent disease; postoperative surveillance with imaging and evaluation of biochemical markers; and management of recurrent DTC.

### American Thyroid Association statement on preoperative imaging for thyroid cancer surgery [^111jgXBe]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The success of surgery for thyroid cancer hinges on thorough and accurate preoperative imaging, which enables complete clearance of the primary tumor and affected lymph node compartments. This working group was charged by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association to examine the available literature and to review the most appropriate imaging studies for the planning of initial and revision surgery for thyroid cancer.

Summary

Ultrasound remains the most important imaging modality in the evaluation of thyroid cancer, and should be used routinely to assess both the primary tumor and all associated cervical lymph node basins preoperatively. Positive lymph nodes may be distinguished from normal nodes based upon size, shape, echogenicity, hypervascularity, loss of hilar architecture, and the presence of calcifications. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes may be useful in guiding the extent of surgery. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography with contrast or magnetic resonance imaging) may be considered in select circumstances to better characterize tumor invasion and bulky, inferiorly located, or posteriorly located lymph nodes, or when ultrasound expertise is not available. The above recommendations are applicable to both initial and revision surgery. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT may be helpful in cases of recurrent cancer with positive tumor markers and negative anatomic imaging.

The presence of lymph node metastasis in the neck in patients with head and neck cancer is an important prognostic determinant in staging cancers and in planning surgery and chemo- and radiotherapy for the cancer patients. Therefore, metastatic nodes should be effectively differentiated from benign lymphadenopathies and nodal lymphomas. Here, we review recent advances in the diagnostic imaging of metastatic nodes in the neck, with emphasis placed on the diagnostic performance of MR imaging, Doppler sonography, and CT.

### Initial staging of the neck in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a comparison of CT, PET / CT, and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology [^112RKVd4]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare imaging modalities for staging the neck in a prospective cohort of patients evaluated by CT, ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with the histologic evaluation of the neck dissection as the standard of reference.

Methods

In all, 76 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled.

Results

Ultrasound-guided FNAC showed the highest level of agreement with histology for exact N classification. Ultrasound-guided FNAC showed the smallest percentage of overstaged patients, 7%, versus 16% with PET/CT, 13% with CT, and 13% with ultrasound. The rate of understaged patients was comparable between the imaging modalities. With regard to the endpoint N0 versus N+ there were no statistically significant differences to be found.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided FNAC seems to correlate best with histologic staging compared with PET/CT and CT. None of the modality is reliable enough to replace elective neck treatment in cN0 necks.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^113aRKNf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Principles of imaging — initial workup and modality selection: Imaging assessment of primary site can be performed with CT of the soft tissues of the neck or MRI of the neck. CT is performed with contrast; CT imaging of the chest can be performed with or without contrast, as clinically indicated, and MRI is performed with and without contrast, unless contraindicated. CT is complementary to MRI for head and neck cancers to evaluate cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion, to evaluate cartilage invasion, and to evaluate bony erosion/destruction. MRI is preferred over CT if there is a need to evaluate the extent of bone marrow invasion or in patients with extensive dental amalgam that may obscure the anatomy on CT, to assess skull base invasion and cranial nerve involvement, to evaluate skull base or intracranial or orbital invasion and to differentiate tumor from obstructed sinuses, and if there are cranial nerve symptoms or if radiographic perineural tumor spread is a possibility. To achieve complete evaluation of the primary and any nodal disease, CT or MRI of the neck should image the anatomy from the skull base to the thoracic inlet, and for certain conditions, such as involved lymph nodes in the low neck or cancers that frequently involve the upper mediastinum (such as thyroid cancer), the imaging should extend to the carina.

### Radiation therapy for HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^116QdXqY]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Posttreatment assessment — HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) with equivocal PET-CT findings is managed with observation and short-interval reimaging rather than immediate surgery because lymph nodes frequently take > 3 months to normalize and persistent enlargement is common but often not pathologic. One retrospective study reported 51% with nodes > 1.0 cm beyond 12 weeks after chemoradiation, yet among incomplete or equivocal nodal PET-CT responders only 28% had residual disease after neck dissection. Published alternatives include repeat CT neck or PET-CT in 2 to 3 months to avoid unnecessary interventions, and repeat imaging within 2 to 3 months is considered an appropriate response; combining contrast-enhanced CT and PET can increase diagnostic accuracy after chemoradiation.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Medullary thyroid carcinoma: Do ultrasonography and F-DOPA-PET-CT influence the initial surgical strategy? [^114BT8SS]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the number of positive lymph nodes (LNs) and involved anatomical compartments are cancer-specific prognostic factors. Exact preoperative staging may help to select a stage-adapted surgical strategy.

Neck ultrasound is the first imaging modality used in MTC to assess the local extent and regional lymphatic spread. MTC as a neuroendocrine tumor is able to absorb, store, and decarboxylate dopamine. Therefore [18F]fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography with computed tomography (F-DOPA-PET-CT), combining anatomic and 'functional' imaging, may further improve initial local and distal staging of biochemically suspected MTC.

F-DOPA-PET-CT is one of the recommended imaging modalities in patients with persistent MTC and basal calcitonin (bCt) levels ≥ 150 pg/mL before reoperations;–however, no studies with a larger patient population evaluating ultrasound in addition to F-DOPA-PET-CT in locating the primary tumor, LN and distant metastasis, and possible consequences to the surgical strategy, have been performed.

This prospective observation study aims to determine the value of ultrasound and F-DOPA-PET-CT in radiomorphological detection of primary tumors, identification of possible LN metastasis, and detection of possible distant metastasis before initial surgery, and how a combination of these techniques may help to improve the standardized diagnostic and therapeutic protocol correlating preoperative biochemical and postoperative morphological results.

### Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with concordant sonography as sufficient early detection tools for recurrent and persistent cervical metastases after (chemo) radiotherapy (CRT) [^112bXJqX]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Participants

All the patients included in the study initially presented with a pathologically confirmed HNSCC and received as a primary therapy (C)RT of the cervical lymph nodes and the primary tumor. Within the national comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) guideline‐conformant restaging or any subsequent time the patients presented with either a recurrence or persisting primary tumor or recurrent or persistent local metastasis. These patients underwent either prophylactic ND due to persistent or recurring primary tumors, according to guideline‐recommended treatment based on the localization and extent of the persistent/recurrent tumor. Additionally, salvage ND was performed when imaging indicated persisting or recurring lymph node metastasis. By comparing the preoperative imaging data with the final histopathological outcomes, metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined.

The preoperative imaging was primarily conducted and discussed by board‐certified radiologists from our Hospital for CT scans. A smaller fraction (< 10%) were performed externally. The criteria used to distinguish malignant from benign lesions using contrast‐enhanced CT scans was based on standard widely known criteria of malignancy, such as size (> 10 mm), shape (round to oval) and perfusion as well as the comparison to the pre‐therapeutical imaging as reference. In the case of sonography, trained otolaryngologists carried out the procedures. The evaluation of suspicious lymph nodes included criteria such as size, shape, perfusion, as well as factors like the presence of a hilum sign. Importantly, every suspicious lymph node underwent cross‐sectional imaging to confirm suspected lesions, as these findings alone do not solely guide therapeutic decisions.

Instead, decisions for or against a ND were not solely based on imaging results. In our clinic decisions regarding treatment are made by an interdisciplinary tumor board, which includes ENT specialists, radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, pathologists, radiation therapists, and occasionally maxillofacial surgeons. Here, the imaging results are combined with the preoperative biopsy and clinical findings, the patient's overall condition, the boundaries of prior radiation therapy and their personal preferences. Treatment decisions are made based on this comprehensive assessment, ensuring a patient‐tailored approach.

All ND specimens were postoperatively diagnosed at our Institute of Pathology. Although each individual lymph node was pathologically examined, for simplicity, only the hemi necks were included in the analysis. A random sampling verification was conducted, focusing exclusively on lymph nodes within specific neck levels, to confirm that they corresponded to those described in the pathology reports.

### Tissue sampling in suspected sarcoidosis: can we avoid mediastinal procedures? [^114gWGZz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the recent American Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. We are grateful to the guideline group for producing an important evidence-based document to guide clinicians across the world.

We would like to comment on the recommendation about tissue sampling for patients with suspected sarcoidosis on the basis of mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy, which forms Question 2 of the document: Should Patients with Suspected Sarcoidosis and Mediastinal and/or Hilar Lymphadenopathy, for Whom It Has Been Determined That Tissue Sampling Is Necessary, Undergo EBUS-guided Lymph Node Sampling or Mediastinoscopy as the Initial Mediastinal and/or Hilar Lymph Node Sampling Procedure?

The committee has recommended endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node sampling — rather than mediastinoscopy — as the initial procedure of choice to use the relatively less invasive of the two procedures. However, we believe that there is scope for an even lesser invasive approach in the scenario addressed in Question 2, applicable to a significant fraction of patients.

We have recently evaluated our experience of performing ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of cervical lymph nodes in 25 patients suspected of sarcoidosis who had mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy on thoracic computed tomographic scans. It is important to note that the lymph nodes sampled following ultrasound were not generally enlarged, many with a short axis dimension < 10 mm, and that in many cases, the lymph nodes were sonographically normal. Where a neck node could be biopsied, granulomatous inflammation was nearly always confirmed.

This technique is considerably cheaper than either EBUS–transbronchial needle aspiration or mediastinoscopy and less invasive than either. We therefore would strongly recommend that neck ultrasound be considered a first-line tool when pulmonologists are confronted with a patient with lymphadenopathy and tissue sampling is considered necessary to confirm granulomatous inflammation.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^117UYRb6]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative neck ultrasound and lymph node evaluation — Recommendation 7 — states that preoperative neck ultrasound to evaluate central and lateral cervical lymph nodes and assess gross extrathyroidal extension is recommended for all patients undergoing surgery for malignant cytologic or molecular findings (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of sonographically suspicious lymph nodes at least 8–10 mm in the smallest diameter should be performed to confirm malignancy if this would change management (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence). The addition of FNA thyroglobulin (Tg) washout to the evaluation of suspicious cervical lymph nodes may be performed in select preoperative patients, but interpretation may be difficult in patients with an intact thyroid gland (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Confirmation of malignancy in suspicious lymph nodes is achieved by ultrasound-guided FNA for cytology and/or measurement of Tg in the needle washout.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^115dt1dD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Head and Neck Cancers principles of imaging for locoregionally advanced disease < 6 Months post-treatment state that following surgery in patients with locoregionally advanced cancer, short-term post-treatment imaging is recommended for those who show signs of early recurrence or who are at high risk of early recurrence prior to starting adjuvant postoperative therapy. Obtain CT and/or MRI within 3–4 months after surgical treatment for patients with locoregionally advanced disease or with altered anatomy causing challenging physical exam assessment, in order to establish a new baseline for future comparisons. In cases of concern for incomplete response, a CT or MRI scan may be obtained much earlier, such as 4–8 weeks post-treatment or even immediately based on the specific clinical situation, and US of the neck for targeted sampling of any suspicious tissues may also be helpful, but results can be variably interpreted depending on the specific clinical situation. FDG-PET/CT should be performed within 3–6 months of definitive radiation or systemic therapy/RT for assessment of treatment response and to identify any residual tumor, and early FDG-PET/CT scans before 12 weeks are associated with significant false-positive rates and should be avoided in the absence of signs of recurrence or progression. The optimal timing of PET scans after radiation treatment appears to be at the 3- to 6-month window, and a negative PET at this time point predicts improved overall survival at 2 years. In patients receiving definitive RT-based treatment of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma with AJCC 7th edition N2–N3 nodal disease, the FDG-PET/CT surveillance approach led to fewer neck dissections and considerable cost savings compared to a routine approach of planned post-treatment neck dissection, and the majority of cases studied were p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers. In the special case of patients who are treated initially with induction chemotherapy prior to the initiation of definitive therapy, either CT or MRI has typically been obtained after 2–3 cycles of induction, and chest CT and/or FDG-PET/CT may be obtained if there is concern for locoregional or distant metastatic progression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^117HJQms]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines and literature are inconsistent in terms of cut-off values for normal cervical lymph node sizes. None of them provides guidelines specifically for children. Based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), axial short-axis diameters should not exceed 10 mm, whereas the Lugano criteria state that axial long-axis diameter can be up to 15 mm without being malignant. However, these guidelines are specifically for malignant diseases and might therefore be inappropriate for distinguishing between normal and abnormal when looking at other causes (e.g. infectious disease). Other authors recommend a cut-off point of 15 mm in the long axis (all imaging planes) for Levels I–III and 10 mm for Levels IV–VI or a short axial axis cut-off of 11 mm for Levels II and III and 10 mm for all other levels. For ultrasound, a short-axis upper limit of 10 mm is generally used, as well. In our clinical practise a cut-off point of 10 mm in short-axis diameter in the axial plane is considered the upper limit for all levels except Level II, where 15 mm is used. With these size limits, four lymph nodes (all in different children) would have been classified as being enlarged at our centre (3% of the included children). Although size is an important criterion in assessing lymph nodes on all imaging modalities, other factors such as shape, borders, internal architecture and enhancement characteristics are of course important, as well. This is especially relevant because interrater variability is to some extent unavoidable when assessing measurements in radiologic images. This variability should be considered, and size alone should not be used to form clinical decisions, but rather other imaging features and the clinical presentation should be taken into account as well, especially when measurements approach the clinically used cut-off points.

Pediatric thyroid nodule evaluation and imaging — ultrasound (US) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are emphasized: Children at risk should be considered for an annual physical examination of the neck, and in these children, US is the preferred first diagnostic imaging modality for palpable neck abnormalities due to ease and avoidance of radiation. Because thyroid gland volume changes with age, nodule characteristics rather than size should drive the decision regarding FNA, and nodules with hypoechogenicity, solid composition, microcalcification, taller-than-wide morphology, irregular margins, or associated abnormal lymph nodes should be biopsied. The diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma can present with diffuse calcifications and hypervascularity throughout 1 lobe or the entire gland rather than a discrete nodule, and hyperfunctioning nodules need not be biopsied due to a low risk for malignancy. Even in young children, FNA can be achieved with local anesthesia; conscious sedation may occasionally be required, and FNA should always be performed under US guidance to reduce sampling error. US should be used for preoperative planning; for the lateral neck, US and computed tomography (CT) have similar sensitivity, but CT is superior to US for the central neck and should be considered in bulky disease; cross-sectional imaging can map occult or inferiorly extending nodal disease, and nodal classification systems and nodal mapping support multidisciplinary planning and comprehensive dissections.

### Thyroid computed tomography imaging: pictorial review of variable pathologies [^117RogAH]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The American College of Radiology (ACR) flowchart and recommendations for ITNs detected by CT or MRI offer general guidance and are not applicable to all patients. The recommendations are primarily based on the presence or absence of suspicious features, nodule size, patient's age, patient's life expectancy, and patient's comorbidities. Suspicious features that can be detected on CT scans include signs of local invasion and abnormal lymph nodes. Abnormal lymph nodes may show cystic components, calcifications, and/or increased enhancement. Mere nodal enlargement is less specific for thyroid cancer metastasis; however, further evaluation should be considered if the ITN has ipsilateral jugulo-digastric lymph nodes > 1.5 cm on the short axis or > 1 cm for other groups. Cervical Level IV and VI lymphadenopathies raise a higher suspicion of thyroid carcinoma metastasis. Almost all patients with ITNs and suspicious imaging features should be evaluated with a neck ultrasound. Patients with comorbidities or limited life expectancy without suspicious features should not undergo further evaluation. Nevertheless, further workup might be necessary for such individuals if it is clinically warranted, or specifically requested by the referring physician or the patient.

In patients with ITNs, it is important to inquire about pertinent historical factors predicting malignancy. These factors include history of childhood or adolescent head and neck or total body radiation exposure, and familial thyroid carcinoma or thyroid cancer syndrome. Syndromes associated with thyroid cancer include multiple endocrine neoplasia 2, familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Cowden's disease, and Werner syndrome/progeria. If a patient has a first-degree relative with such a syndrome, screening based on the various components of that syndrome is advised. Nevertheless, there are no guidelines specifically addressing ITNs detected on CT scans in patients at risk of thyroid cancer. Therefore, in the absence of suspicious features on the CT scan, other criteria such as nodule size on the CT scan, patient age, and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are important in guiding management in such a patient population.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^116FTxQR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Occult primary head and neck cancer — definition, frequency, and workup: Occult or unknown primary H&N cancer is defined as metastatic carcinoma in a cervical lymph node without an identifiable primary site after appropriate investigation; this uncommon disease entity accounts for approximately 5% of patients presenting to referral centers, and the most frequent histology is squamous cell carcinoma. Although some patients are initially classified as having an unknown primary, most will eventually be diagnosed by directed biopsy and tonsillectomy, and emergence of the primary site after therapy and during follow up is rare. The majority of patients > 40 years of age who present with a neck mass prove to have malignant lymph node involvement; when metastatic carcinoma is found in cervical lymph nodes, the primary site is almost always discovered in the course of a complete H&N examination and imaging evaluation, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the preferred diagnostic procedure when a malignant cervical lymph node is suspected. H&N cancer of unknown primary site is a highly curable disease, and after appropriate evaluation and treatment, most patients experience low morbidity and long-term disease control.

### Ultrasound evaluation of persistent cervical lymph nodes in young children [^115SXVf8]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To review the ultrasonographic outcomes of persistent lymph nodes, in the absence of other concerning signs or symptoms, in patients < 6 years of age.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 98 patients < 6 years old who had neck ultrasound for persistent lymph nodes at a single university hospital over a 3.5 year period between January 2016 and June 2019.

Results

There were no cases of malignant disease or serious systemic illness. Ninety-two of the 98 examinations showed normal or reactive lymph nodes. There were three sonographically indeterminate cases and two non-lymph-node structures: haemangioma and dermoid cyst. One examination reported an abnormal lymph node, which had resolved by the time of review in clinic.

Conclusion

Persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes should be investigated; however, a distinction should be made between lymph nodes that have regressed to < 1 cm but are still palpable and persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes. The findings of the present study indicate that persistence of non-enlarged lymph nodes is not a predictor for malignancy. It is advised that clear guidelines are used, which state the criteria for further investigation, to promote the best use of imaging.

### Imaging in head and neck oncology [^112ZPxxG]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Evaluation of head and neck cancer with imaging is a topic that is far more extensive than can be covered in this article. The main reason for head and neck imaging is to evaluate the true extent of disease to best determine surgical and therapeutic options. This process includes evaluation of the size, location, and extent of tumor infiltration into surrounding vascular and visceral structures. Important anatomic variants must be pointed out so the surgeon can avoid potential intraoperative complications. These variant scan be evaluated with the appropriate multiplanar and three-dimensional images to provide as much information as possible to the surgeon preoperatively. Second, nodal staging should be assessed in an effort to increase the number of abnormal nodes detected by physical examination and, more important, to precisely define their location by a standard classification system that can be understood and consistently applied by the radiologist, surgeon, radiation oncologist, and pathologist. Although secondary to the previously described tasks, imaging frequently enables a limitation of the diagnostic and histologic possibilities based on lesion location and signal-attenuation characteristics, which may lead the clinical investigation along a different path. saving the patient unnecessary risk and shortening the time to diagnosis and ultimate treatment. This article has attempted to detail the current state of the controversy between CT, MRI, and other modalities, and has emphasized the constant evolution of this controversy because of the evolving imaging technology. Although CT and MRI are both well suited to evaluation of the deep spaces and submucosal spaces of the head and neck, each has some limitations.MRI has the advantages of higher soft tissue contrast resolution, the lack of iodine-based contrast agents, and high sensitivity for perineural and intracranial disease. The disadvantages of MRI include lower patient tolerance, contraindications in pacemakers and certain other implanted metallic devices, and artifacts related to multiple causes, not the least of which is motion. CT is fast, well tolerated, and readily available but has lower contrast resolution and requires iodinated contrast and ionizing radiation. The current authors' practice is heavily centered on CT for initial evaluation, preoperative planning, biopsy targeting, and postoperative follow-up. They reserve MRI for tumors that are suspicious for perineural, cartilaginous, or bony invasion on CT, or for tumors such as adenoid cystic carcinoma that are highly likely to spread by way of these routes. For patients who have head and neck cancer, a radiologist who is educated in the treatment options, patterns of tumor growth, and important surgical landmarks, and who has a well-established pattern of communication with the head and neck clinical services, including surgery, radiation oncology, and pathology, is key in providing accurate and useful image interpretation.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^112VYase]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Squamous cell skin cancer — assessment of palpable regional lymph nodes or abnormal nodes on imaging includes re-evaluation after a negative biopsy with clinical exam, CT with contrast of the nodal basin, and repeat fine needle aspiration (FNA), core biopsy, or excisional biopsy; for positive nodes, perform CT with contrast of the nodal basin and chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast or FDG-PET/CT as clinically indicated to rule out distant disease. MRI with and without contrast of the brain may be considered to rule out subclinical cortical involvement in cases with bone invasion, and if the patient is immunosuppressed, consider modification or reduction of immunosuppression as appropriate; ultrasound-guided biopsy by a center or physician with expertise is recommended, core biopsy may be preferred over FNA when tumor histology is uncertain or a larger tissue sample is required, and an excision biopsy may be considered to confirm a negative initial FNA or core lymph node biopsy if clinical suspicion remains high; all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Consensus statement by the American association of clinical endocrinology (AACE) and the American head and neck society endocrine surgery section (AHNS) on pediatric benign and malignant Thyroid surgery [^1148JKkf]. Endocrine Practice (2021). High credibility.

Imaging for pediatric thyroid disease and bulky lymphadenopathy — CT or magnetic resonance imaging should be used in cases of bulky primary and/or nodal disease, posterior thyroid masses or vocal cord paralysis on presentation (Committee consensus: strongly agree (8.6)). Cervical US is the most common imaging modality employed while evaluating thyroid disease in both pediatric and adult patients; US is also well suited to evaluate the lateral neck for lymphadenopathy, and it is commonly used to provide visualization for fine-needle biopsies of both thyroid and extrathyroidal lesions; US alone provides sufficient imaging information in most cases, while cross-sectional imaging by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide useful information beyond what is obtained by US, such as the central neck. In the setting of bulky lymphadenopathy, CT or MRI can be useful to better delineate the extent of the disease, and advanced disease can demonstrate skull base or mediastinal involvement, invasion of the aerodigestive tract, or encasement of the carotid sheath structures; the choice of CT or MRI can be made according to factors such as whether more osseous or soft tissue detail is desired, and ultimately, imaging is left to surgeon preference.

Structural Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often employed in structural evaluation for recurrent or metastatic MTC for both staging and then for evaluation of treatment response. Liver metastasis is best assessed with dedicated MRI but clinicians should be aware of potential false positive findings. Computed tomography (CT) is preferred for imaging lymph nodes and lung metastases. Prior to the widespread use of functional imaging, recommended work-up for metastatic MTC included neck ultrasound, chest CT, liver MRI, bone scan and axial skeleton MRI. In recurrent MTC, a rising calcitonin should prompt extensive structural imaging. However, depending on availability of PET imaging and clinician judgement a combination of both modalities may be appropriate.

### Contemporary management of lymph node metastases from an unknown primary to the neck: I. A review of diagnostic approaches [^114Na96w]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

In an era of advanced diagnostics, metastasis to cervical lymph nodes from an occult primary tumor is a rare clinical entity and accounts for approximately 3% of head and neck malignancies. Histologically, two thirds of cases are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), with other tissue types less common in the neck. With modern imaging and tissue examinations, a primary tumor initially undetected on physical examination is revealed in > 50% of patients and the site of the index primary can be predicted with a high level of probability. In the present review, the range and limitations of diagnostic procedures are summarized and the optimal diagnostic workup is proposed. Initial preferred diagnostic procedures are a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and imaging. This allows directed surgical biopsy (such as tonsillectomy), based on the preliminary findings, and prevents misinterpretation of postsurgical images. When no primary lesion is suggested after imaging and panendoscopy, and for patients without a history of smoking and alcohol abuse, molecular profiling of an FNAB sample for human papillomavirus (HPV) and/or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is important.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^113a5L9t]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — principles of imaging for nodal metastases: Evaluation of lymph node metastases should be conducted with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck, using whichever imaging study is suitable for primary site evaluation. For patients with multistation or lower neck nodal involvement or high-grade tumor histology, consider CT of the chest to assess for mediastinal lymph node metastases or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT), which is associated with higher sensitivity for both nodal and distant metastases. For patients who are under consideration for a surgical primary approach, the higher sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT is warranted for tumors approaching the midline to determine the surgical approach to the contralateral neck, and patients scheduled for a definitive RT approach may benefit from the higher sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT for identifying involved lymph nodes. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Radiology of castleman disease: the pivotal role of imaging in diagnosis, staging, and response assessment of this rare entity [^112oJwfj]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Castleman Disease (CD) is a rare entity that typically presents as an enhancing nodal mass in the mediastinum or head and neck region on computed tomography (CT). It may manifest as unicentric or multicentric regions of lymph node enlargement. A key clinical issue in the context of CD is delayed diagnosis, which contributes adversely to patient outcome, given that accurate diagnosis facilitates earlier treatment of this curable disease. This article will address relevant imaging aspects, with reference to typical and atypical imaging features of CD, illustrated using examples from our specialist centre; the imaging journey for patients with CD; and will provide practical pointers to radiologists in differentiating CD from other benign and malignant causes of enhancing lymphadenopathy, including lymphoma and neoplastic adenopathy. We will also review current classification tools and staging challenges with reference to World Health Organization guidelines, International Working Group guidelines as well as the Lugano classification. Finally, we will discuss the potential role of additional imaging techniques in CD, highlighting novel imaging methods and expanded utilities from our specialist centre.

### Modern approach to the neck mass [^112yQNSk]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Neck mass is a common first sign of malignancy in adult patients. Timely diagnosis can prevent disease progression. Initial evaluation of a neck mass includes creating a plan for obtaining further diagnostic information such as through imaging and tissue diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can be done with or without ultrasound (US) guidance and is commonly done as an alternative to core biopsy and open biopsy. The accuracy of US-guided FNA has been shown to supersede that of palpation-guided FNA. Moreover, in-office US-guided FNA has become more accessible over time and can improve time to diagnosis.

3 Results

3.1 Demographics

Table 1 details the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient cohort (n = 100) in this study, revealing a mean age of 62.8 years and a median of 63.5 years, with an age range from 19 to 86 years. The cohort primarily comprised patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas, representing 38% of the total, while hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers each accounted for just over one‐fifth of cases. A majority of the patient cohort, constituting 82%, were male.

TABLE 1
Clinical characteristics of the patient cohort before salvage or prophylactic ND.

The known etiological factors contributing to the development of persistent or recurrent tumor diseases, such as tobacco abuse, accounted for 76% of patients in this study. Patients who persisted in smoking before ND had an average of 39 pack‐years, while those with a history of tobacco abuse averaged 37 pack‐years. Out of the 100 patients, 9 presented with an HPV‐positive tumor, all of which could be attributed to the oropharynx. Among these, three patients exhibited persistent tobacco abuse, and two were former smokers.

The study involved a structured analysis of various lymph node therapies, as delineated in Figure 1 and for each patient discussed prior within the tumor board. Treatment modalities included RT for 46 patients, primarily targeting local lymph nodes, and CRT for an additional 54 patients. These interventions were subject to reevaluation via imaging at different time point. In the average, the timing of imaging occurred at 332 days following the completion of primary therapy, with the earliest patient requiring ND 21 days after primary therapy completion, and the latest patient becoming treatment‐dependent nearly 7 years after completion of (C)RT.

Post‐tumor board imaging results facilitated stratification of patients into distinct therapeutic groups.
The first group, consisting of 24 patients, underwent prophylactic ND in the absence of imaging or clinical indicators of lymph node metastasis due to a salvage operation of the primary, yielding 45 histopathological specimens.
The salvage ND group encompassed patients with suspected lymph node involvement, independent of primary tumor status, comprising 60 patients with 73 ND histopathological specimens from both unilateral and bilateral treatments.
The third, combined group involved 13 patients who received on one side prophylactic ND and salvage ND on the other, resulting in 26 specimens.

### Central cervical lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid cancer: a systematic review of imaging-guided and prophylactic removal of the central compartment [^114TsaWQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a common endocrine cancer and commonly presents with lymph node (LN) metastases. The role of surgical removal of the central cervical LN compartment is poorly defined. There are no prospective randomized controlled trials addressing the relevance to the extent of the initial surgical approach.

Design and Methods

A systematic review of studies of patients with PTC undergoing either prophylactic or therapeutic lymphadenectomy of the central LNs was carried out. Studies involving imaging modalities in the detection of LNs in PTC were also analysed.

Results

Twenty-one studies contained data on 4188 patients undergoing prophylactic or imaging-guided removal of the central compartment. Imaging-guided surgery retrieved cancerous central LNs in 346 or 30% of eligible patients, whilst prophylactic central neck dissection yielded histopathological proof of cancer in 898 or 26.2% of patients. Five imaging studies revealed data on the use of ultrasound (US) and/or computerized tomography (CT). The sensitivity of US and CT was poor, ranging from 50% to 70% when accurately calculated.

Conclusion

Metastatic central LNs are found in nearly half of all patients with PTC when prophylactic central lymph node dissection (CLND) is performed. With unreliable imaging modalities, prophylactic CLND should be performed on all patients with PTC.

### Reliable EGFR mutation testing in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular lymph node fine-needle aspirates: a cohort study with diagnostic performance analysis [^1176ujn9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fifteen to 30 per cent of patients with lung cancer will have supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (SCLN) and anterior cervical lymph nodes (LNs). Ultrasound (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology (FNAC) is known to be an effective diagnostic tool in small size supraclavicular or neck LNs as well as in impalpable positron emission tomography (PET)-detected nodes. The latest algorithm of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance published in April 2011 incorporates the use of US of the neck to obtain cytology (figure 1 B). It clearly indicates that clinicians should offer US of the neck with an intention to sample any visibly abnormal LNs or non-US-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) to patients with a high probability of mediastinal malignancy (LNs > 20 mm maximum short axis on CT. It also states that US of the neck should be offered with biopsy of visible LNs to patients who have neck nodes detected by initial CT. If CT is negative, non-US-guided TBNA or endobronchial US (EBUS)-guided TBNA or endoscopic US-guided FNA is recommended.

Neck imaging — CT/MRI/PET preoperative adjuncts: Preoperative use of cross-sectional imaging studies (CT, MRI) with intravenous (IV) contrast is recommended as an adjunct to ultrasound (US) for patients with clinical suspicion for advanced disease, including invasive primary tumor, or clinically apparent multiple or bulky lymph node involvement (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence); routine preoperative 18FDG-PET scanning is not recommended (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Since US evaluation is operator dependent and cannot always adequately image deep anatomic structures and those acoustically shadowed by bone or air, alternative imaging procedures may be preferable or useful as an adjunct.

Accurate characterization of lymph nodes in patients with cancer and in patients who present with unexplained lymphadenopathy is of major importance for appropriate treatment planning and determination of prognosis. Size measurements are still the most frequently used method for discriminating malignant from non-malignant lymph nodes, but are insufficiently accurate. In order to improve evaluation of lymph nodes, there is a need for imaging modalities that go beyond anatomical lymph node assessment and that allow visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes at the cellular level. We review and discuss functional imaging techniques in the evaluation of lymph nodes.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### Value of CT added to ultrasonography for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer [^112wWuPQ]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of CT for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer is still unclear.

Methods

Three hundred fifty-one patients with thyroid cancers from 7 hospitals were prospectively enrolled in order to compare diagnostic performance between a combination of ultrasound and CT (ultrasound/CT) and ultrasound alone for prediction of lymph node metastasis and to calculate patient-based benefits of CT added to ultrasound.

Results

Of 801 pathologically proven neck levels, ultrasound/CT showed higher sensitivities in both central and lateral compartments and improved accuracy in the lateral compartment compared to ultrasound alone. In the retropharyngeal/superior mediastinal compartment, although CT could detect lymph node metastasis an ultrasound could not. Patient-based benefit was demonstrated in 13.1% of patients (46/351), and was higher in patients with cancers > 1 cm than cancers ≤ 1 cm.

Conclusion

In patients with thyroid cancer, CT improved surgical planning by enhancing the sensitivity for lymph node metastasis and by detecting lymph node metastasis that was overlooked with ultrasound alone.

Judicious use of imaging studies, namely ultrasound, can provide valuable information for accurate diagnosis. Common and uncommon infectious causes of cervical lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Surgical intervention is occasionally necessary for diagnosis and treatment of infections, and rarely indicated for the possibility of malignancy. Indications for surgery are discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^116iHrnU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 9 — ancillary tests for adult neck mass: Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is at increased risk for malignancy and/or does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging, with recommendation based on nonconsecutive studies, observational studies, case series, and panel consensus with preponderance of benefit over harm. The decision to obtain any of these tests should be based on the clinician's clinical suspicion for a particular disease, it is not recommended that these tests be obtained in patients for whom there is no clinical suspicion, and for patients who are at increased risk, ancillary testing should be performed simultaneously with the malignancy workup to avoid delayed cancer diagnosis. Quality improvement opportunity is to identify laboratory or other test that can aid in neck mass diagnosis; aggregate evidence quality is Grade C; level of confidence is Medium; benefits include diagnosing the neck mass and avoiding invasive procedures/anesthesia; risks include direct costs of ancillary tests, false-positive tests, incidental findings, and risk of failure to diagnose concurrent malignancy based on these test results; benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; and policy level is Recommendation.

### Features of sequential CT and US-guided biopsy in recurrent kikuchi disease of the neck: a case report [^114WNTiB]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old woman presented with recurrent Kikuchi disease 7 years after her initial episode. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography demonstrated enlarged lymph nodes with extensive necrosis at the same site as the initial episode. Cytologic and histologic examinations were not conclusive. CT performed 1 month later demonstrated a complete resolution of the lymphadenopathy, which confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent Kikuchi disease. Care must be taken to avoid misdiagnosis of recurrent Kikuchi disease as tuberculous lymphadenitis.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound of the thyroid and extracranial head and neck [^114Vdny4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cervical lymph node ultrasound evaluation — Sonographic examination of cervical lymph nodes may be comprehensive or focused, as appropriate for the clinical question and scenario. The size and location of abnormal lymph nodes should be documented, and suspicious nodal morphology including, but not limited to, calcification, cysts/ focal echogenic areas that are unrelated to a fatty hilum, and abnormal blood flow should be documented. Round shape and absence of echogenic hilum, although reported in malignant nodes, are findings with poor specificity in thyroid cancer. Location of abnormal lymph node(s) should be documented with annotations and/or enough visual information to describe the location according to the image-based nodal classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery, or in a fashion that allows the referring clinician to convert the location of abnormal nodes to that system. Node evaluation should be performed at centers with experienced personnel, and lymph node size varies with nodal compartment with node size often less important in malignancy assessment than nodal morphology. Enlarged cervical nodes can be seen in lymphoma and other malignancies but are often reactive and are seen in acute and chronic infections and inflammatory disease processes such as postviral syndromes and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In the pediatric population, cervical lymph node size, echotexture, vascularity, and potential nodal suppuration or abscess-formation evaluation are important in the evaluation of acute lymphadenitis.

A 58-year-old male patient with persistence PTC at thyroid bed with hypervascular nodal metastasis. a – c Transverse greyscale and colour Doppler neck ultrasound demonstrate hypoehoic soft tissue in the left thyroid bed (white arrow in a). There are a heterogeneous enlarged lymph nodes at level 2 and 3 with markedly increased vascularity (white arrow in b and c). d – f Enhanced axial CT images of the neck demonstrate a 2.7 × 1.4 cm hypodense soft tissue lesion anterior to the left carotid sheath (white arrow). There are left-sided enhancing abnormal and enlarged lymph nodes at cervical level 2 and 3 (black arrows)

In cases of elevated thyroglobulin with negative neck US and iodine whole body scintigraphy (WBS), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is the next modality of choice. Dedifferentiated thyroid carcinoma usually has avid FDG-PET uptake and a negative radioiodine scan, typically does not respond to RAI therapy, and has a poorer prognosis. There is not yet consensus in the research literature on whether cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) or an 18FDG-PET/CT scan should be performed as the first-line imaging modality for such patients. Enhanced CT scan was thought to be more sensitive for detection of lymph node metastases. Nonetheless, scans using modern PET/CT equipment are as reliable as a proper routine staging CT scan. Many lesions can be found on 18FDG-PET/CT scanning despite the lack of IV contrast injection. However, differentiation between local recurrence versus lymph node metastases and detection of direct involvement of the aerodigestive axis or vascular structures are not technically possible in the absence of IV contrast administration. For these reasons, 18FDG-PET/CT utilizing contrast administration should be considered for most patients with extensive disease.

### NCCN guidelines insights: primary cutaneous lymphomas, version 2.2020 [^116jkEhY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome — useful in certain circumstances, additional evaluations include bone marrow biopsy in patients with unexplained hematologic abnormality; biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes or suspected extracutaneous site with excisional or adequate core needle biopsy preferred and a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy alone insufficient for the initial diagnosis of lymphoma, with rebiopsy if pathological findings are nondiagnostic and/or discordant with the clinical presentation; rebiopsy skin if suspicious of LCT or FMF and not previously confirmed pathologically or with aggressive clinical behavior; imaging with C/A/P CT with contrast or integrated whole body FDG-PET/CT for T2b or LCT or FMF, or with palpable adenopathy or abnormal laboratory studies, with consideration for T2a (patch disease with ≥ 10% BSA) or otherwise clinically indicated; neck CT with contrast if whole body FDG-PET/CT not done; pregnancy testing in patients of childbearing potential if considering treatments that are contraindicated in pregnancy; and discuss fertility preservation.
