## Question

At a middle school, 20% of the students are in the band. If 168 students are in the band, how many students go to the middle school?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many students attend a middle school if 20% of the students are in the band and there are 168 band members. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about translating the word problem into a mathematical equation. Then, I should verify the arithmetic and ensure the units make sense. Finally, I will double-check the result by working backward from the answer to confirm consistency with the given percentage and count.

> Let me first confirm the setup: if 20% of the total student body equals 168 students, then 0.20 times the total number of students equals 168, so the equation is 0.20 × Total = 168, and I need to solve for Total.

> Wait, let me verify the algebra before I compute: to isolate Total, I should divide both sides by 0.20, which gives Total = 168 ÷ 0.20, and I need to ensure I'm not mixing up multiplication and division here, because mistakenly multiplying would give a much smaller number and wouldn't make sense with the context.

> I will now examine the calculation: 168 divided by 0.20 is the same as 168 multiplied by 5, which equals 840, so the total number of students is 840.

> Hold on, I should verify this by working backward: 20% of 840 is 0.20 × 840 = 168, which matches the given band enrollment, so the solution is consistent and the units align correctly.

> Final answer: 840 students attend the middle school.

---

The total number of students in the middle school is **840**. This is calculated by dividing the number of band students (168) by the percentage of students in the band (20%, or 0.20): 168 ÷ 0.20 = 840.

---

## Calculation

Let **T** be the total number of students in the middle school. Given that 20% of the students are in the band and there are 168 band students, the equation is:

0.20 × T = 168

Solving for T:

T = 168 ÷ 0.20 = 840

---

## Verification

To verify, calculate 20% of 840:

0.20 × 840 = 168

This matches the given number of band students, confirming the calculation.

---

## Conclusion

The middle school has a total of **840 students**.

### A dating violence prevention program for middle school youth: a cluster randomized trial [^64d6be49]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the a priori hypothesis that students attending an intervention middle school would be less likely to report physical adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) 1 year later compared with students attending a control school. Secondary objectives were to determine if the intervention reduced substance misuse, bullying, and fighting.

Methods

Twenty-four Texas public middle schools were matched by the size of student enrollment, number of economically disadvantaged students, and race and ethnicity of the student body and randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 12; 1237 participants) or the control (n = 12; 1531participants) group. The intervention, Fourth R, is a classroom-based curriculum delivered by existing teachers and consists of 21 lessons on injury prevention, substance use, and growth and development.

Results

Participants (50% female) self-reported ethnicity as Hispanic or Latinx (35%), Black or African American (24%), Asian American (17%), White (8%), and multiethnicity or other (16%). Among those who have dated, students in the intervention schools were less likely to report perpetrating physical ARA (intervention = 14.9% versus control = 18.3%) relative to students in the control schools (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–1.00; P = 0.05). In the overall sample, no significant differences emerged between control and intervention groups with respect to substance misuse, fighting, and bullying.

Conclusions

The middle school version of Fourth R is effective in reducing physical ARA perpetration over at least 1 year. The intervention did not have an effect on bullying perpetration, physical fighting with peers, and substance misuse. Long-term assessment, especially follow-up that covers the transition to high school, is needed to examine the program benefit on key outcomes.

### Suicidal mortality and motives among middle-school, high-school, and university students [^6d576be1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What factors are associated with the increasing number of suicides among individuals younger than 30 years in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 12 396 middle-school, high-school, and university students, from 2007 to 2022, suicide mortality rates have consistently increased since the late 2010s, with major associated factors including school-related, health-related, and family-related problems; however, the factors associated with suicide among students change according to their life stage (ie, life cycle).

Meaning

These findings suggest that designing and implementing school-based suicide prevention programs that are effective for the specific vulnerabilities in psychological and social developmental stages of middle-school, high-school, and university students can contribute to suicide prevention for students.

### Injury incidence among middle school students aged 13–15 years in 47 low-income and middle-income countries [^22734246]. Injury Prevention (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 95811 students aged 13-15years participated in nationally representative Global School-based Student Health Surveys (GSHS) in 47 low-income and middle-income countries conducted between 2003 and 2012. On average, about 40% of the participants in each country reported at least one injury in the past year that was serious enough to cause the student to miss at least one full day of usual activities (such as school, sports and a job) or to require treatment by a healthcare professional. In 40 of the 47 countries, boys reported a significantly higher injury rate than girls. Based on these numbers, injuries likely cause approximately four million days of school absence by lower secondary school students annually. Most of these injuries are preventable.

### Age-dependency of the propagation rate of coronavirus disease 2019 inside school bubble groups in catalonia, Spain [^f952faea]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

We obtained the total number of index cases for each school level (Fig. 3 A). There were no secondary cases in 75% ± 5% (78.5% primary, 71% secondary) of the index cases (Fig. 3 A). Otherwise, a total of 20% of primary school and 25.5% of middle school index cases were linked to outbreaks with 2–4 secondary infected students. Finally, there were some outbreaks with a larger number of secondary cases, only occurring in 1.5% and 3.5% of the cases, respectively. In general, we noted that while 70% of the students were infected outside of the bubble group, around 30% of the students could have been infected inside (Fig. 3 B). This percentage was associated with the age of the group, with 20% and 40% becoming infected within the bubble group for the youngest and the oldest grades, respectively. An equivalent description of such information is the comparison of the total number of cumulative cases and index cases during the period of study, shown in Figure 3 C. An average of 1000–2000 students per course level was infected by SARS-CoV-2 during this period. The reduction in the number of infected kids for older ages was associated with a decrease in the number of students attending high school, which is not mandatory (Table 1). To remove the effect of the difference in population sizes with the course levels, we calculated the percentage of children as index or secondary case (Fig. 3 D). The percentage of kids acting as index cases remained roughly constant at 1.7% for > 9 years of age. In contrast, Figure 3 D shows that the propagation inside the bubble was strongly associated with age because the percentage of secondary cases increased with age, either because children's infectiousness genuinely increases with age or because they were in higher risk situations that could trigger transmission.

### Prevalence and comorbidity of anxiety disorder in school-attending children and adolescents aged 6–16 years in China [^bec2b747]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Method

Included participants

This is a two-stage survey carried out in primary and high schools in Beijing, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Sichuan and Hunan provinces. The age range of school students is from 6 years to 17 years. Due to the consideration of the College Entrance Examination, we decided not to include students in the final year of secondary school. So, the age range of students included in this survey was 6–16 years. The five provincial administrative regions were chosen by taking the geographical partition, economic development and rural/urban factors into consideration. In the official document (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2011), China has divided the country into northeastern, eastern, middle and western regions geographically. Liaoning is chosen as the representative of northeast area, Jiangsu as the representative of eastern area, Sichuan as the representative of western area and Hunan as the representative of southern area. Beijing was picked as being the representative of a Developed Urban Area, which had a gross domestic product per capita of US$12 736 and a population larger than 10 million. Then, we randomly selected 2–4 prefecture divisions in these five areas. 15 prefecture divisions in total were selected finally. Next, in each prefectural division, simple sampling without replacement was used to select schools one by one (with a predetermined ratio of primary schools to middle schools as 1:1). Then, we randomly selected 2–5 classes in each grade of every school. The sample size was calculated using the formula. We chose the prevalence of Tourette disorder (0.30%) to estimate the sample size as it was reported to be the lowest among children and adolescents aged 6–17 years; with a confidence coefficient of 95% (Z) relative error (ɛ) of 15%, 56 742 participants would reach a statistic power of 1. We assumed 20% would be lost during the follow-up and decided to recruit 73 992 participants. Based on this, we randomly chose 1764 classes from 169 schools (81 primary schools and 88 high schools). A more detailed description of the study design was described in our previous study.

### Social capital II: determinants of economic connectedness [^dd92b399]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Owing to these competing forces, when holding friending bias fixed, an above-median-SES share of 50% (that is, achieving perfect socioeconomic integration) maximizes the total number of cross-class connections at a school. Schools that have low friending bias and near-equal representation of students with below- and above-median parental SES — such as Lane Technical in Fig. 5a — contribute the most to total EC in an accounting sense. More generally, the direction in which one must shift exposure to increase the total number of cross-SES links differs on the basis of a school's initial share of high-SES students. By contrast, reducing friending bias always increases EC for a given low-SES student as well as TCEC.

Furthermore, increasing the share of high-SES students in one school necessarily requires reducing the share of high-SES students in at least one other school, as the total number of students with above-median SES is fixed. As a result, increasing high-SES shares even at schools where high-SES shares are below 50% can have ambiguous effects on EC in society as a whole. If the high-SES students who join a given school A otherwise would have attended school B where they would have connected with more low-SES peers, overall EC in society could fall even though TCEC at school A would rise. Thus, one must be cognizant of the counterfactual distribution of SES across schools when evaluating the effects of increasing exposure. By contrast, efforts to reduce friending bias in a given school do not generally have direct implications for connectedness at other schools.

In summary, for schools that already have diverse student bodies (that is, schools that have a balanced socioeconomic representation) but high levels of friending bias, initiatives to identify and address institutional factors contributing to friending bias may be the most fruitful path to increasing their total contributions to connectedness. For schools that currently have less diverse student bodies, it may be valuable to increase diversity in a manner that takes account of which schools the new students would otherwise have attended.

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students-United States, 2011–2016 [^ebad9956]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States; nearly all tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood. Among youths, use of tobacco products in any form is unsafe. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2011–2016 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine recent patterns of current (past 30-day) use of seven tobacco product types among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high (grades 9–12) school students. In 2016, 20.2% of surveyed high school students and 7.2% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. In 2016, among current tobacco product users, 47.2% of high school students and 42.4% of middle school students used ≥ 2 tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used tobacco product among high (11.3%) and middle (4.3%) school students. Current use of any tobacco product did not change significantly during 2011–2016 among high or middle school students, although combustible tobacco product use declined. However, during 2015–2016, among high school students, decreases were observed in current use of any tobacco product, any combustible product, ≥ 2 tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and hookahs. Among middle school students, current use of e-cigarettes decreased. Comprehensive and sustained strategies can help prevent and reduce the use of all forms of tobacco products among U.S. youths.

NYTS is a cross-sectional, voluntary, school-based, self-administered, pencil-and-paper questionnaire administered to U.S. middle and high school students. A three-stage cluster sampling procedure was used to generate a nationally representative sample of U.S. students attending public and private schools in grades 6–12. This report uses data from six NYTS waves (2011–2016). Sample sizes and response rates for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 18,866 (72.7%), 24,658 (73.6%), 18,406 (67.8%), 22,007 (73.3%), 17,711 (63.4%), and 20,675 (71.6%), respectively.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^a22d100d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep hygiene practices for adolescents — Recommended practices include a regular, dark, quiet sleep environment; adequate time for 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night; consistent bedtimes and wake times on weekdays and weekends; a regular bedtime routine to cue the body that sleep is imminent; and morning light exposure, and the use of sleep-disrupting electronic devices near bedtime or during the night should be avoided because blue light emitted from electronic devices, particularly blue wavelengths, can suppress the production of melatonin and contribute to difficulty falling asleep.

### Health disparities in the middle east: representative analysis of the region [^9d67b4df]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics of Egypt, the percentage of the population living in poverty in recent years ranges 28% to 32%. Poverty is a cause of health care disparities because the poor can only get their care in free government clinics and hospitals; they have no access to physicians in private practice or hospitals. Urban versus rural living and the geographic distinction of Upper Egypt versus Lower Egypt, known as the Delta, underlie another cause of disparity. Egypt has recorded important achievements in improving child and maternal survival and health, but there remains a marked discrepancy in the under-5 mortality rate, with 42 versus 20 deaths per 1,000 live births in rural Upper Egypt vs urban areas. Neonatal mortality is at its highest level in rural Upper Egypt, at 21 compared with 10 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births in urban Lower Egypt.

Much of the origins of disparities reflect disparities in education. Egypt has one of the largest numbers of students enrolled in higher education in the Middle Eastern and North African region, with a total of around 2.4 million students. The literacy rate, although rising, is only 70% of the population. Public schools, which lack proper facilities, resources, and teachers, educate 92% of students; the remainder, who belong to the upper social classes, attend well-resourced costly private schools run by foreign countries; they may be religious or secular, but both are quite Westernized. This creates a disparity in access to graduate education, including medical schools, even though the path to medical school appears equitable because it is based on a ranking by the composite score on a national examination. There are 30 registered medical schools in Egypt enrolling 70,000 medical students (as of March 30, 2022). Despite this large number of medical schools, there is a significant physician shortage, with only 10 doctors per 10,000 citizens, compared with a global average of 32 doctors for every 10,000 citizens.

### Potential impact of national school nutritional environment policies: cross-sectional associations with US secondary student overweight / obesity, 2008–2012 [^34c03208]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The latest US Department of Agriculture school meal and competitive venue standards (USDA standards) aim to improve student nutrition and health. However, significant opposition has been raised to their implementation.

Objective

To examine (1) the percentages of US middle and high school students who currently attend schools that have specific components of the USDA standards; (2) evidence that the identified USDA standard components may be associated with student overweight/obesity; and (3) evidence of sociodemographic differences in the observed associations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We used data from annual nationally representative cross-sectional studies of students and school administrators in US public middle and high schools from the 2007–2008 through 2011–2012 school years.

Exposures

Administrator-reported school meal and competitive venue food and beverage availability.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Body mass index and overweight/obesity calculated from student self-reported height and weight.

Results

Analytical samples included 22716 eighth grade students in 313 schools and 30596 tenth and 12th grade students in 511 schools. The mean student response rate was 86.5%; mean school administrator response rate, 83.1%. During the study period, 21.1% of middle school and 30.1% of high school students attended schools without any of the identified components; all 5 identified components were in schools attended by only 1.8% and 0.3% of middle school and high school students, respectively. No significant associations between standard components and self-reported overweight/obesity were observed among middle school students overall. Among high school students, significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity were associated with having fruits or vegetables available wherever foods were sold (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.96]; P = 0.009), the absence of milk with higher fat levels (AOR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85–1.00]; P = 0.04), and having 3 or more USDA standard components (AOR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79–1.00]; P = 0.04). A significant association between the absence of sugar-sweetened beverages and lower overweight/obesity was found for Hispanic middle school students (AOR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.51–0.82]; P < .001) and nonwhite high school students (AOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70–0.91]; P = 0.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Because only 2% of middle school and less than 1% of high school students attended schools with all 5 identified USDA standard components in place, full implementation has the potential to substantially improve school nutritional environments. Some USDA standard components were associated with a lower risk for student overweight/obesity, especially for high school and nonwhite students.

### Notes from the field: E-cigarette use among middle and high school students-United States, 2022 [^68dff177]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2022, 14.1% of high school students and 3.3% of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use (Table). Among current e-cigarette users, 42.3% reported using e-cigarettes frequently, §§ including 46.0% of high school students and 20.8% of middle school students; daily use was reported among 27.6% of current e-cigarette users, including 30.1% of high school students and 11.7% of middle school students. Among current e-cigarette users, the types of devices most often used were disposables (high school = 57.2%; middle school = 45.8%), followed by prefilled or refillable pods or cartridges (high school = 25.7%; middle school = 21.6%), and tanks or mod systems (high school = 5.9%; middle school = 9.8%), with 11.2% of high school students and nearly 23% of middle school students reporting not knowing the type of e-cigarette device used.

TABLE
Prevalence of current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use, * overall and by selected characteristics and school level — National Youth Tobacco Survey, United States, 2022

* Past 30-day use of e-cigarettes was determined by the question, "During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use e-cigarettes?" Current use was defined as use on ≥ 1 day during the past 30 days.

† Estimated total number of users was rounded down to the nearest 10,000 students. Overall population totals might not directly sum to corresponding estimates by school level because of rounding or inclusion of students who did not self-report grade level.

§ Daily e-cigarette use was defined as use on all 30 of the past 30 days.

### Suicidal mortality and motives among middle-school, high-school, and university students [^84fe87bc]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The suicide mortality rate per 100 000 population (SMRP) consistently decreased before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Japan and then unexpectedly increased during the pandemic. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Objective

To identify trends in and factors associated with suicidal mortality and motives among students in Japan from 2007 to 2022.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study, data on SMRPs among Japanese middle-school, high-school, and university students were obtained from the government suicide database Suicide Statistics of the National Police Agency.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Age-dependent and temporal fluctuations in annual SMRPs, disaggregated by suicidal motive (7 categories and 52 subcategories), sex, and school, were analyzed using linear mixed-effect and joinpoint regression models, respectively.

Results

Total suicide numbers from 2007 to 2022 were as follows: 760 male middle-school students, 635 female middle-school students, 2376 male high-school students, 1566 female high-school students, 5179 male university students, and 1880 female university students. The mean (SD) student populations from 2007 to 2022 were as follows: 1 752 737(81 334) male middle-school students, 1 675 572(78 824) female middle-school students, 1 648 274(67 520) male high-school students, 1 614 828(60 032) female high-school students, 1 652 689(32 724) male university students, and 1 229 142(57 484) female university students. Among male students, the leading motives were school-related factors (underachievement and worrying about the future), followed by family-related and health-related motives. Among female students, school-related and family-related motives decreased, but health-related motives showed an age-dependent increase. The SMRPs of middle-school male students and female students were almost equal (mean [SD], 2.7[1.0] vs 2.4[1.4]), but the age-dependent increase in SMRPs among male students was pronounced (mean [SD], high-school vs university male students, 9.1[2.4] vs 19.6[3.0]; high-school vs university female students, 6.1[2.4] vs 9.6[1.8]). However, the incidence of suicide among high-school students associated with health-related motives was greater in female students. The majority of suicides associated with major impactable suicidal motives (school-related, health-related, and family-related motives) began increasing before the pandemic. Changes in SMRP associated with interpersonal relationships, such as conflict with classmates or parents, were not significant, but the rates increased greatly during the pandemic.

Conclusions and Relevance

School-related, health-related, and family-related problems were major motives, whereas the impacts of health-related and family-related motives increased and decreased with age, respectively. Notably, most SMRPs associated with major impactable motives (underachievement, conflict with a parent or classmate, and mental illnesses) had already begun increasing in the late 2010s, indicating that recent increasing SMRPs among school-aged individuals were associated with pandemic-related factors and other factors affecting this generation before the pandemic. It may be inappropriate to uniformly apply research findings based on school-aged individuals to school-based suicide prevention programs for students in middle school, high school, and university.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^fc1b020e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluation for persistent sleep problems — Parents of students who are experiencing extreme difficulty awakening to arrive at school on time, or who experience significant daytime sleepiness, should consider scheduling a consultation with the adolescent's primary care provider or a sleep medicine specialist to evaluate for a sleep disorder, regardless of the student's school start time.

### An overview on the successes, challenges and future perspective of a national school-based surveillance program: the CASPIAN study [^78a28a24]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Study population and sample size

CASPIAN I

The sample size was calculated as 900 students, aged 6–18 years, in each district of the 23 provinces, taking 150 students of each sex and in each of the 3 age groups under study. Therefore, the total sample size was calculated to be 20, 700 in the 23 provinces, which was increased to 22, 000 to allow for a 5% estimated missing data. The students were selected from elementary, middle and high school by multistage, random cluster sampling from different residence (urban/rural) and different types of schools (public/private) to avoid socioeconomic bias.

CASPIAN II

The final sample size was calculated as 9,216 students aged 11–18 years in the 28 districts under study, which was increased to 10,200 to allow with an estimated response rate of 85 percent (85 clusters of 120 people, 20 students in each sex and age group). The students were selected by multistage, random cluster sampling from last year of elementary school, middle and high school as well as different residence (urban/rural).

CASPIAN III

The total sample size in the 27 provinces was calculated to be 4,950, which was increased to 6,000 to allow with an estimated response rate of 80 percent. The survey was performed on 5,570 students, aged 10–18 years, who were selected by multistage random cluster sampling (84 clusters of 72 people, 12 students in each sex and age group). The schools were stratified according to location (urban/rural), and different types of schools (public/private) to avoid socioeconomic bias.

CASPIAN IV

The final sample size was calculated as 14,880 students aged 6–18 years in the 30 provinces in Iran (48 cluster of 10 people in each province). The sampling method was a multistage cluster sampling. The students were selected from elementary, intermediate and high school by multistage, random cluster sampling from different residence (urban/rural) and different types of schools (public/private).

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic [^163c61a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

More than 767 million coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 6.9 million deaths with COVID-19 have been recorded as of August 2023. Several public health and social measures were implemented in schools to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and prevent onward transmission. We built upon methods from a previous Cochrane review to capture current empirical evidence relating to the effectiveness of school measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Objectives

To provide an updated assessment of the evidence on the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to keep schools open safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Educational Resources Information Center, World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program COVID-19 Evidence Reviews on 18 February 2022.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies focused on measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, among students (aged 4 to 18 years) or individuals relating to the school, or both. We categorized studies that reported quantitative measures of intervention effectiveness, and studies that assessed the performance of surveillance measures as either 'main' or 'supporting' studies based on design and approach to handling key confounders. We were interested in transmission-related outcomes and intended or unintended consequences.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts. We extracted minimal data for supporting studies. For main studies, one review author extracted comprehensive data and assessed risk of bias, which a second author checked. We narratively synthesized findings for each intervention-comparator-outcome category (body of evidence). Two review authors assessed certainty of evidence.

Main Results

The 15 main studies consisted of measures to reduce contacts (4 studies), make contacts safer (7 studies), surveillance and response measures (6 studies; 1 assessed transmission outcomes, 5 assessed performance of surveillance measures), and multicomponent measures (1 study). These main studies assessed outcomes in the school population (12), general population (2), and adults living with a school-attending child (1). Settings included K-12 (kindergarten to grade 12; 9 studies), secondary (3 studies), and K-8 (kindergarten to grade 8; 1 study) schools. Two studies did not clearly report settings. Studies measured transmission-related outcomes (10), performance of surveillance measures (5), and intended and unintended consequences (4). The 15 main studies were based in the WHO Regions of the Americas (12), and the WHO European Region (3). Comparators were more versus less intense measures, single versus multicomponent measures, and measures versus no measures. We organized results into relevant bodies of evidence, or groups of studies relating to the same 'intervention-comparator-outcome' categories. Across all bodies of evidence, certainty of evidence ratings limit our confidence in findings. Where we describe an effect as 'beneficial', the direction of the point estimate of the eﬀect favours the intervention; a 'harmful' eﬀect does not favour the intervention and 'null' shows no effect either way. Measures to reduce contact (4 studies) We grouped studies into 21 bodies of evidence: moderate- (10 bodies), low- (3 bodies), or very low-certainty evidence (8 bodies). The evidence was very low to moderate certainty for beneficial effects of remote versus in-person or hybrid teaching on transmission in the general population. For students and staff, mostly harmful effects were observed when more students participated in remote teaching. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that in the general population there was probably no effect on deaths and a beneficial effect on hospitalizations for remote versus in-person teaching, but no effect for remote versus hybrid teaching. The effects of hybrid teaching, a combination of in-person and remote teaching, were mixed. Very low-certainty evidence showed that there may have been a harmful eﬀect on risk of infection among adults living with a school student for closing playgrounds and cafeterias, a null eﬀect for keeping the same teacher, and a beneficial eﬀect for cancelling extracurricular activities, keeping the same students together and restricting entry for parents and caregivers. Measures to make contact safer (7 studies) We grouped studies into eight bodies of evidence: moderate- (5 bodies), and low-certainty evidence (3 bodies). Low-certainty evidence showed that there may have been a beneficial effect of mask mandates on transmission-related outcomes. Moderate-certainty evidence showed full mandates were probably more beneficial than partial or no mandates. Evidence of a beneficial effect of physical distancing on risk of infection among staff and students was mixed. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that ventilation measures probably reduce cases among staﬀ and students. One study (very low-certainty evidence) found that there may be a beneficial eﬀect of not sharing supplies and increasing desk space on risk of infection for adults living with a school student, but showed there may be a harmful eﬀect of desk shields. Surveillance and response measures (6 studies) We grouped studies into seven bodies of evidence: moderate- (3 bodies), low- (1 body), and very low-certainty evidence (3 bodies). Daily testing strategies to replace or reduce quarantine probably helped to reduce missed school days and decrease the proportion of asymptomatic school contacts testing positive (moderate-certainty evidence). For studies that assessed the performance of surveillance measures, the proportion of cases detected by rapid antigen detection testing ranged from 28.6% to 95.8%, positive predictive value ranged from 24.0% to 100.0% (very low-certainty evidence). There was probably no onward transmission from contacts of a positive case (moderate-certainty evidence) and replacing or shortening quarantine with testing may have reduced missed school days (low-certainty evidence). Multicomponent measures (1 study) Combining multiple measures may have led to a reduction in risk of infection among adults living with a student (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

A range of measures can have a beneficial effect on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilization and school attendance. We rated the current findings at a higher level of certainty than the original review. Further high-quality research into school measures to control SARS-CoV-2 in a wider variety of contexts is needed to develop a more evidence-based understanding of how to keep schools open safely during COVID-19 or a similar public health emergency.

### Variation in obesity among American secondary school students by school and school characteristics [^5622f795]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Body mass index (BMI) is known to vary by individual characteristics, but little is known about whether BMI varies by school and by school characteristics.

Methods

Nationally representative samples of United States schools and students are used to determine the extent to which BMI and percent of students at or above the 85th percentile of BMI vary by school and by school characteristics. Data from the 1991–2004 Monitoring the Future (MTF) study were analyzed in 2006 and 2007.

Results

A relatively small proportion of variance in BMI lies between schools; intraclass correlations are on the order of 3%. Still, this is sufficient variation to provide very different environments for students attending schools that are low versus high in average BMI. There is some modest variation by school type (public, Catholic private, non-Catholic private); school size (number of students in the sampled grade); region of the country; and population density. There is more variation as a function of school socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic composition of the school. School SES in particular was negatively associated with BMI levels, even after controlling individual-level SES and racial/ethnic status.

Conclusions

The residual differences in BMI by school suggest that some characteristic of the school and/or community environment — perhaps cultural factors or peer role modeling or differences in school food, beverage, or physical education policies — facilitate obesity in schools with a high concentration of lower socioeconomic students, beyond individual-level factors.

### Do overweight students have lower academic performance than their classmates? A pilot cross sectional study in a middle school in tehran [^ec7dbd9d]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Sampling technique

This cross-sectional study was conducted on the 69 school male students between the age of 12 to 14 in 2009–2010. They were studying in one of the private school in Tehran and they were matched socioeconomically (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic characteristics of students

None of the students had experienced chronic serious diseases or medical problems influencing their school performance based on the medical records in school.

Weight measurement

The anthropometric measurements including weight and height were obtained while individuals wearing light cloths and no shoes. The students' weights were measured by a single trained physician at the beginning of the school year with the same wall-mounted stadiometer and a digital scale. The BMI was calculated as dividing body weight by squared height (kg/m²).

Afterwards, the results were compared with the BMI age-adjusted chart for males and the students with BMI values over the 85 percentile were considered as an overweight and those with BMI values over the 95 percentile as obese ones.

Laboratory assessment

Early in the morning about 10 mL of venous blood samples, after 12 hours of fasting, were obtained from each student for biochemical tests. Lipid profile including triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were centrifuged for plasma concentration and they were restored at the same laboratory.

Evaluation of the academic performance

The students' actual Grade Point Average (GPA) along with their score in math, geometry, calculus and English were obtained at the end of the academic year from the school records. Also the absenteeism rate was estimated for each student at the end of the educational year based on the school reports and it is considered as a one of the school performance indices.

Ethical approval

The project was conducted in accordance with declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education. It was approved by the Ethical Board Committee of the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute (EMRC). An informed consent was obtained from each participant and their parents before the investigation. No action was done without the informed consent of all participant and their parents.

Statistical analysis

All data were analyzed using SPSS 16. A descriptive data analysis was performed to assess the subjects' socioeconomic status, academic performance, growth indices and laboratory variables. Student's t-distribution or its nonparametric equivalent was used when necessary. Point estimation with a confidence interval of 95% was used to compare average grades of the participants and other quantitative variables between the study groups. P-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### School closures and student contact patterns [^afa96df1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Number of contacts made by students with persons in different categories and the changes associated with school closures. A) total contacts overall and with students and adults; B) contacts with persons in different categories at school and in different age groups outside school; C) absolute reductions in numbers of contacts with persons in different groups associated with school closure; D) relative reductions in numbers of contacts with persons in different groups associated with school closure. In (A) and (B), large black markers indicate the mean number of contacts; small gray markers indicate individual data points; circles indicate data for when the school was open (n = 41), crosses indicate data for when the school was closed (n = 73). In (C) and (D), error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

The greatest reductions in the numbers of contacts were for students from the same school (Figure 2), e.g. ≈80% reduction in numbers of contacts with classmates and yearmates. Absolute reductions in numbers of contacts with persons not attending the school were small; the relative reductions had wide confidence intervals and rarely showed evidence of a genuine reduction (Figure 2). Paired analysis of data for 35 students with information for contacts during both periods produced similar results as unpaired analysis. Among 40 respondents who reported illness during closure and self-assessed whether they consequently contacted fewer persons, 53% stated that their contacts were reduced, 33% stated that they were not, and 15% were unsure.

### Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in China during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020–2021) compared with the pre-pandemic period (2017–2019) [^ac5513d6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate the potential for selection bias, whereby schoolchildren may not attend school due to the COVD-19 pandemic either due to illness (although there have been very few diagnosed childhood cases of COVD-19 in the province), fear of illness, or other reasons, we collected the mean number of new student entries per school for each of the participating schools over time. Students entering either middle or high school are the population eligible for tuberculin testing through the provincial program and therefore increases or decreases over time in this number may represent possible selection bias. Students in schools with a combined middle and high school followed the same testing protocol; testing occurred at middle school entry and then at high school entry.

We also obtained weekly tuberculosis notifications from January 2017 to December 2021 among all ages in the province. Tuberculosis is a reportable disease in China, and all persons diagnosed with tuberculosis are managed in a tuberculosis registry run by the Jiangsu Provincial CDC. Because of this, patient diagnoses can be tracked at a city- and provincial level over time.

### Cardiovascular risk factors in multi-ethnic middle school students: the HEALTHY primary prevention trial [^2e16d389]. Pediatric Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an integrated, multi-component, school-based intervention programme on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among a multi-ethnic cohort of middle school students.

Methods

HEALTHY was a cluster randomized, controlled, primary prevention trial. Middle school was the unit of randomization and intervention. Half of the schools were assigned to an intervention programme consisting of changes in the total school food environment and physical education classes, enhanced by educational outreach and behaviour change activities and promoted by a social marketing campaign consisting of reinforcing messages and images. Outcome data reported (anthropometrics, blood pressure and fasting lipid levels) were collected on a cohort of students enrolled at the start of 6th grade (∼11–12 years old) and followed to end of 8th grade (∼13–14 years old).

Results

Forty-two middle schools were enrolled at seven field centres; 4363 students provided both informed consent and CVD data at baseline and end of study. The sample was 52.7% female, 54.5% Hispanic, 17.6% non-Hispanic Black, 19.4% non-Hispanic White and 8.5% other racial/ethnic combinations, and 49.6% were categorized as overweight or obese (body mass index ≥ 85th percentile) at baseline. A significant intervention effect was detected in the prevalence of hypertension in non-Hispanic Black and White males. The intervention produced no significant changes in lipid levels.

Conclusions

The prevalence of some CVD risk factors is high in minority middle school youth, particularly males. A multi-component, school-based programme achieved only modest reductions in these risk factors; however, promising findings occurred in non-Hispanic Black and White males with hypertension.

### Effect of school-based body mass index reporting in California public schools: a randomized clinical trial [^1f321fab]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Annually, US schools screen millions of students' body mass index (BMI) and report the results to parents, with little experimental evidence on potential benefits and harms.

Objective

To determine the impact of school-based BMI reporting on weight status and adverse outcomes (weight stigmatization and weight-related perceptions and behaviors) among a diverse student population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cluster randomized clinical trial. The Fit Study (2014–2017) randomized 79 California schools to BMI screening and reporting (group 1), BMI screening only (group 2), or control (no BMI screening or reporting [group 3]) in grades 3 to 8. The setting was California elementary and middle schools. Students in grades 3 to 7 at baseline participated for up to 3 years. A modified intent-to-treat protocol was used. Data analysis was conducted from April 13, 2017, to March 26, 2020.

Interventions

School staff assessed BMI each spring among students in groups 1 and 2. Parents of students in group 1 were sent a BMI report each fall for up to 2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in BMI z score and in adverse outcomes (based on surveys conducted each fall among students in grades 4 to 8) from baseline to 1 and 2 years of follow-up.

Results

A total of 28 641 students (14 645 [51.1%] male) in grades 3 to 7 at baseline participated in the study for up to 3 years. Among 6534 of 16 622 students with a baseline BMI in the 85th percentile or higher (39.3%), BMI reporting had no effect on BMI z score change (-0.003; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.01 at 1 year and 0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03 at 2 years). Weight dissatisfaction increased more among students having BMI screened at school (8694 students in groups 1 and 2) than among control participants (5674 students in group 3). Results of the effect of BMI reporting on other adverse outcomes were mixed: compared with the control (group 3), among students weighed at school (groups 1 and 2), weight satisfaction declined more after 2 years (-0.11; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.05), and peer weight talk increased more after 1 year (0.05; 95% CI, 0.01–0.09); however, concerning weight control behaviors declined more after 1 year (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

Body mass index reports alone do not improve children's weight status and may decrease weight satisfaction. To improve student health, schools should consider investing resources in evidence-based interventions.

### High COVID-19 transmission potential associated with re-opening universities can be mitigated with layered interventions [^800d55c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

First-year students drive the early part of the outbreak and experience the highest burden of infection, followed by second and third years and taught postgraduate students (Fig. 3b). Students in year 4 and above and research postgraduates have the lowest infection rates.

By the end of the first term, under the baseline model 4200 (98% PI: 1800–9800) students, or 15% (98% PI: 6–35%), have been infected. On the last day of term 54 (98% PI: 15–140) symptomatic cases and 640 (98% PI: 200–1600) asymptomatic cases are still infectious. On average, there are between 13 and 15 asymptomatic cases for every one symptomatic case. The number of cases doubles every 7–22 days. Without additional control measures, 68% (98% PI: 44–83%) of students would be infected by the end of the academic year. The low rate of symptoms and low morbidity rate results in a median of zero deaths in the student population.

The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases is central for determining the scale of a university-based outbreak. In our framework, asymptomatic cases are either less or as infectious as symptomatic cases; however, because asymptomatic cases do not self-isolate without a test, for higher values of relative infectiousness, asymptomatic cases produce on average more secondary cases than symptomatic cases (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). For lower values of, university-focussed outbreaks are largely driven by the forcing from outside the university. For intermediate values, outbreaks peak after the first term. For high values, outbreaks peak before the end of the first term (see Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5).

As a comparison to the baseline case, if asymptomatic cases are 30% as infectious as symptomatic cases then we expect an early growth rate of 0.06 (98% PI: 0.04–0.09) and a doubling time of 12 days (98% PI: 8–17 days). Without additional control measures, 36% (98% PI: 12–57%) of students would be infected by the end of the academic year. The epidemic profiles for the full 98% PI of potential scenarios for asymptomatic infectiousness, which corresponds to reproduction numbers from 1.7 to 3.4, are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5.

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students… [^3194e608]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2016, one in five high school students and one in 14 middle school students reported current use of a tobacco product on ≥ 1 of the past 30 days. Moreover, 47. 2% of high school students and
42. 4% of middle school students who used a tobacco product in the past 30 days used ≥ 2 tobacco products. In 2016, 20. 2% of surveyed high school students and
7. 2% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. In 2016, among current tobacco product users, 47. 2% of high school students and
42. 4% of middle school students used ≥ 2 tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product among high and middle school students. In 2016, 20. 2% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product, including
9. 6% who reported current use of ≥ 2 tobacco products. Among middle school students, 7.

2% reported current use of any tobacco product, and
3. 1% reported current use of ≥ 2 tobacco products. Among middle school students, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product, followed by cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and bidis. In 2016, an estimated 3. 9 million U. S. middle and high school students currently used any tobacco product, with 1. 8 million reporting current use of ≥ 2 tobacco products. Among youths, symptoms of nicotine dependence are increased in multiple tobacco product–users compared with single product–users.

### School-level self-reported versus objective measurements of body mass index in public high school students [^8e523b1a]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Population-level surveillance of student weight status (particularly monitoring students with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile) remains of public health interest. However, there is mounting concern about objectively measuring student BMI in schools. Using data from the nation's largest school district, we determined how closely students' self-reported BMI approximates objectively-measured BMI, aggregated at the school level, to inform decision-making related to school BMI measurement practices. Using non-matched data from n = 82,543 students with objective height/weight data and n = 7676 with self-reported height/weight from 84 New York City high schools (88% non-white and 75% free or reduced-price meal-eligible enrollment), we compared school-level mean differences in height, weight, BMI, and proportion of students by weight status, between objective and self-reported measures. At the school-level, the self-reported measurement significantly underestimated weight (-1.38 kg; 95% CI: -1.999, -0.758) and BMI (-0.38 kg/m²; 95% CI: -0.574, -0.183) compared to the objective measurement. Based on the objective measurement, 12.1% of students were classified as having obesity and 6.3% as having severe obesity (per CDC definition); the self-report data yielded 2.5 (95% CI: -1.964, -0.174) and 1.4 (95% CI: -2.176, -0.595) percentage point underestimates in students with obesity and severe obesity, respectively. This translates to 13% of students with obesity and 21% of students with severe obesity being misclassified if using self-reported BMI. School-level high school students' self-reported data underestimate the prevalence of students with obesity and severe obesity and is particularly poor at identifying highest-risk students based on BMI percentile.

### Trends of representation of women in professional medical societal leadership in the United States and Europe [^b4f50ea5]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical student, trainee, and faculty trends

The number of female medical students over the last 50 years enrolled in both DO and MD medical schools in the United States has increased to more than 50% of the total in the last 5 years, per data published by the AAMC and American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine. In the 1970 s, < 20% of DO students and < 25% of MD students were female. These numbers steadily increased until 2005, at which time percent of female medical students (both MD and DO) declined. Starting in 2014 for MD students and 2017 for DO students, the percentage of female medical students has again been consistently uptrending. Women at MD schools surpassed 50% of total students in 2018 and DO students did in 2020. Less data were publicly available for third-year internal medicine residents and first-year cardiology fellows; data from 2013 to 2022 was available and has been included. The percentage of female internal medicine residents over these years remained between 42% and 45% without any significant upward or downward trends. The percentage of female cardiology fellows was 22% in 2013 and 29% in 2022; the lowest percentage of female cardiology fellows over this time period was 20% in 2016. In 2016, 16% of cardiology attendings were women. Available data for gender-related trends among medical students, internal medicine residents, and cardiology fellows over the past 50 years are plotted in Figure 4.

### Suicidal mortality and motives among middle-school, high-school, and university students [^20702d43]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This cross-sectional study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. The medical ethics review committee of Mie University waived requirements for informed consent and ethical approval because these are publicly available governmental data.

Annual suicide numbers disaggregated by motive, sex, and school in Japan from 2007 to 2022 were obtained from the SSNPA. SSNPA provides annual suicide numbers in Japan disaggregated by various factors, including sex (male and female), school (middle school, high school, and university), and suicidal motives (7 categories: family, health, economic, employment, romance, school related, and other motives, with 52 subcategories) (eTables 1, 2, and 3 in Supplement 1). The detailed methods of the investigation of suicidal motives are explained in the eAppendix in Supplement 1. Annual student populations in middle school, high school, and university from 2007 to 2022 (denominator for SMRP derivation) were obtained from the School Basic Survey, a government database of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.SMRP was calculated by dividing the annual suicide numbers of the target group by the annual populations of the same target group in the same year (eg, the annual suicide number among male university students in 2020 was divided by the total number of male university students in 2020). SSNPA released annual suicide numbers for which motives were determined.

Statistical Analysis

In this study, the trends, discontinuity, and their effect size of SMRPs of male and female middle-school, high-school, and university students from 2007 to 2022 were analyzed by joinpoint regression analysis (JPRA) using the Joinpoint Regression Program version 5.0.2 (National Cancer Institute). The differences in SMRPs among sexes (male and female students) and schools (middle school, high school, and university) from 2007 to 2022 were compared using linear mixed-effect models with the Scheffe post hoc test using SPSS statistical software for Windows version 27 (IBM). The detailed statistical methods are described in the eAppendix in Supplement 1. Two-tailed P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### A vaccine chatbot intervention for parents to improve HPV vaccination uptake among middle school girls: a cluster randomized trial [^21aac797]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sample size

The sample size was calculated based on detecting a meaningful difference in the primary outcome of HPV vaccination among female middle school students, comparing its differences before and after the intervention. According to national estimates of the China CDC, first-dose HPV vaccine coverage among female adolescents aged 9–14 years in China is around 5% (refs.). We hypothesized that an effective intervention could increase this rate by five percentage points, reaching 10%. According to the literature on school-based cluster randomized trials, the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was assumed to be 0.05.

In China, the average class size includes approximately 20 female students. Considering students who had either already received the vaccination or had scheduled it, as well as parents who might decline survey participation, we anticipated that around 10–15 parents (m) per class would be eligible participants. The design effect was calculated by 1 + (m − 1) × ICC, which yielded a range of 1.45 to 1.70. For this trial, we adopted a cluster design effect of 1.5 (m = 11). Assuming a power of 80%, a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and incorporating this cluster design effect, we determined that a sample size of 648 participants per arm would be sufficient to detect a change of this magnitude.

To account for potential loss to follow-up (estimated at 20–30%), the sample size per arm was then expanded to 900, for a total of 1,800 participants. Consequently, a total of 162 classes were required for the study. These classes were randomized to intervention and control groups in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by city, school and grade levels. The stratification resulted in approximately 81 classes in each group. The study aimed to recruit approximately 1,800 parents, with 900 in the intervention group and 900 in the control group, ensuring that the sample size requirements were met.where sample size (m₁ and m₂) represents the number of participants before or after considering the dropout rate (d). P₁ and P₂ denote the vaccination rates among female middle school students in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Δ signifies the clinically important difference in treatment proportions, and DE represents the cluster design effect.

### Comfort and utility of school-based weight screening: the student perspective [^05e39a72]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 986 students who were eligible for the study, 23 opted out of the study, 111 were absent on the day of their class was scheduled for weight screening, 54 were missing one or more variables required to determine their BMI classification and 12 underweight subjects were excluded from the study analyses because our interest was in the comparison between healthy weight and overweight and there were too few students in this category to consider it separately. Thus, our analytic sample comprises 786 students.

Description of Study Population

The mean (SD) age of the 786 students with measured height and weight, and survey data was 12.0 (+ 1.2) years. Overall, 15.6% (95% CI 11.2, 17.8) of males and 18.3% (95% CI 14.4, 22.2) of females were at-risk for overweight, and 20.8% (95% CI 15.5, 22.9) of males and 16.4% (95% CI 12.0, 19.0) of females were overweight. The highest prevalence of overweight was observed among Hispanic males (35.0%) and non-Hispanic black females (24.6%) (Table 1).

### Structure and inference in annotated networks [^637b83b8]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In our tests the desired division was one that places two of the underlying four groups in one community and the remaining two in the other. Two-valued metadata were generated that agree with this division 65% of the time, a relatively weak level of correlation, not far above the 50% of completely uncorrelated data. Nonetheless, as shown in Fig. 1b, this is enough for the algorithm to reliably find the correct division of the network in almost every case — 98% of the time in our tests. Without the metadata, by contrast, we succeed only 6% of the time. Some practical applications of this ability to select among competing divisions are given in the next section.

Real-world networks

In this section we describe applications of our method to a range of real-world networks, drawn from social, biological and technological domains.

For our first application we analyse a network of school students, drawn from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The network represents patterns of friendship, established by survey, among the 795 students in a medium-sized American high school (US grades 9–12, ages 14–18 years) and its feeder middle school (grades 7 and 8, ages 12–14 years).

Given that this network combines middle and high schools, it comes as no surprise that there is a clear division (previously documented) into two network communities corresponding roughly to the two schools. Previous work, however, has also shown the presence of divisions by ethnicity. Our method allows us to select between divisions by using metadata that correlate with the one we are interested in.

Figure 2 shows the results of applying our algorithm to the network three times. Each time, we asked the algorithm to divide the network into two communities. In Fig. 2a, we used the six school grades as metadata and the algorithm readily identifies a division into grades 7 and 8 on the one hand and grades 9–12 on the other — that is, the division into middle school and high school. In Fig. 2b, by contrast, we used the students' self-identified ethnicity as metadata, which in this data set takes one of four values: white, black, hispanic, or other (plus a small number of nodes with missing data). Now the algorithm finds a completely different division into two groups, one group consisting principally of black students and one of white. (The small number of remaining students are distributed roughly evenly between the groups.)

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students-United States, 2000–2009… [^64e82ce7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

1). More than 80% of established adult smokers begin smoking before age 18 years. To monitor trends in tobacco use among middle and high school students, CDC analyzed 2000–2009 data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey, a school-based survey that collects information on tobacco use and related behaviors and attitudes from middle school and high school students. This analysis indicated that in 2009, 8. 2% of middle school students and
23. 9% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product; 5. 2% of middle school students and
17. 2% of high school students reported current use of cigarettes. Overall prevalence did not decrease from 2006 to 2009 for use of any tobacco product among either group. During 2000–2009, the prevalence of current tobacco use among middle school students declined, as did current cigarette use and cigarette smoking experimentation.

Similar trends were observed for high school students. 6). The 2009 NYTS used a three-stage cluster sampling procedure to generate a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of students in grades 6–12 from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of 222 randomly selected schools, 205 participated; of 24, 666 students randomly selected at the participating schools, 22, 679 participated, yielding an overall response rate of 84. 8%. In 2009, 8. 2% of middle school students and
23. 9% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product, and 5. 2% of middle school students and
17. 2% of high school students reported current use of cigarettes. Among middle school students, the most commonly used forms of tobacco other than cigarettes were cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipes, bidis, and kreteks.

### Frequency of use among middle and high school student tobacco product users-United States, 2015–2017 [^8ce9d15c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

During 2015–2017, among high school students who were current users of each product, the prevalence of frequent use (≥ 20 of the past 30 days) was as follows: 28.4% of cigarette smokers (330,000), 17.4% of e-cigarette users (330,000), 14.0% of cigar smokers (160,000), 38.7% of smokeless tobacco users (260,000), and 16.7% of hookah smokers (60,000) (Table). Among middle school students, the prevalence of frequent use was 17.5% of cigarette smokers (40,000), 13.1% of e-cigarette users (60,000), 13.2% of cigar smokers (20,000), 21.5% of smokeless tobacco users (30,000), and 24.5% of hookah smokers (20,000). High school student current users who used the product 1–5 of the past 30 days accounted for 50.3% of cigarette smokers, 61.4% of e-cigarette users, 70.8% of cigar smokers, 45.2% of smokeless tobacco users, and 66.3% of hookah smokers. The proportion of middle school current users who used the product 1–5 of the past 30 days was 67.4% of cigarette smokers, 68.4% of e-cigarette users, 71.2% of cigar smokers, 56.0% of smokeless tobacco users, and 61.8% of hookah users.

### Percentage of body weight carried by students in their school backpacks [^c28c4ea3]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the percentage of body weight represented by backpacks and the types of backpacks carried by elementary school students.

Design

A cross-sectional study was conducted in three elementary schools in central Texas. All students in kindergarten through fifth grade were invited to participate. A letter, with no direct mention of backpack weighing, was sent to each parent for written consent. Student weights and heights and their backpack weights were measured by trained research assistants.

Results

The mean backpack weights, which increased significantly with increasing grade level, varied significantly by school, backpack type, day of week, body mass index, and race/ethnicity. The backpack loads represented an average of 8.2% (95% confidence interval, 7.8–8.5) of student body weights but increased significantly with increasing grade level, from 6.2% among kindergarteners to 12.0% among fifth graders. Twenty-six percent of students carried backpacks that weighed at least 10% of their body weights. A total of 25 students (3.5%) had backpacks with wheels. Wheeled backpack users were significantly older and more likely to be girls or from school B. Concern about weight was the most popular reason cited for using a wheeled backpack.

Conclusions

Backpack loads represent a significant percentage of body weight of this sample of students aged 5–12 yr. Some students are already using wheeled backpacks, which may have their own hazards.

### Tobacco product use among middle and high school students-United States, 2020 [^aad6d291]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States; nearly all tobacco product use begins during youth and young adulthood (1,2). CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2019 and 2020 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine changes in the current (past 30-day) use of seven tobacco products among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high (grades 9–12) school students. In 2020, current use of any tobacco product was reported by 16.2% (4.47 million) of all students, including 23.6% (3.65 million) of high school and 6.7% (800,000) of middle school students. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used tobacco product among high school (19.6%; 3.02 million) and middle school (4.7%; 550,000) students. From 2019 to 2020, decreases in current use of any tobacco product, any combustible tobacco product, multiple tobacco products, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco occurred among high school and middle school students; these declines resulted in an estimated 1.73 million fewer current youth tobacco product users in 2020 than in 2019 (6.20 million) (3). From 2019 to 2020, no significant change occurred in the use of cigarettes, hookahs, pipe tobacco, or heated tobacco products. The comprehensive and sustained implementation of evidence-based tobacco control strategies at the national, state, and local levels, combined with tobacco product regulation by FDA, is warranted to help sustain this progress and to prevent and reduce all forms of tobacco product use among U.S. youths (1,2).

### Characteristics of e-cigarette use behaviors among US youth, 2020 [^3205b5d2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the characteristics of current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use among US high school and middle school students in 2020?

Findings

This survey study of 14 531 students found that among the 19.6% of high school students and 4.7% of middle school students who currently used e-cigarettes in 2020, 38.9% of high school users and 20.0% of middle school users self-reported use on 20 to 30 days during the past 30 days, and most reported flavored e-cigarette use.

Meaning

These results suggest that although current e-cigarette use among youth significantly decreased during 2019 to 2020, use prevalence, frequent use, and flavored e-cigarette use remained high.

### Use of electronic cigarettes and secondhand exposure to their aerosols are associated with asthma symptoms among adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^9ab62a1d]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study setting, design, and participants

Geographically, Kuwait is divided into six governorates, and the school districts follow a similar geographic distribution. Education in Kuwait is mainly provided by free public schools funded by the state and, to a lesser extent, by private schools. The education system can be divided into four stages, namely, kindergarten, elementary school (1st–5th grade), middle school (6th–9th grade), and high school (10th–12th grade), and in the latter three stages, the students are segregated by sex. Schooling is compulsory for all children aged 6 to 14 years.

This cross-sectional study enrolled schoolchildren (n = 1565) attending public high schools (11th and 12th grade) throughout the State of Kuwait, which included children aged between 16 and 19 years. The schoolchildren were enrolled in the study during the second semester of the 2018–2019 school year (January to May 2019). A stratified two-stage cluster sampling method was used to select a representative study sample of schoolchildren from a random sample of schools. At the time the study was initiated, there were 139 public high schools in Kuwait enrolling approximately 60,663 students (26,692 males and 33,971 females). From a list obtained from the Ministry of Education, Kuwait, of all public high schools stratified by school district and sex, schools were randomly selected using randomly generated numbers. Proportional allocation was used to determine the number of participants needed from each school district by estimating sex-stratified weights relative to the student body size in each given school district. In total, 14 schools served as the recruitment venues for enrolling the required sample size. The study was approved by the Health Sciences Center Ethics Committee for Student Research at Kuwait University (No. 750). Written informed assent was obtained from each participating student. As per the waiver obtained from the Ethics Committee, no consents were sought from the parents.

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students – United States, 2013 [^02b92179]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Combustible tobacco products were the most commonly used form of tobacco among both current and ever tobacco users (Figure). Among high school students, 20.7% currently used combustible products (13.5% combustible only; 3.4% combustible and noncombustible only; 2.7% combustible and e-cigarettes only; and 1.1% combustible, noncombustible, and e-cigarettes). Of all middle school students, 5.4% currently used combustible products (4.0% combustible only; 0.8% combustible and noncombustible only; 0.4% combustible and e-cigarettes only; and 0.2% combustible, noncombustible, and e-cigarettes). Current use of only e-cigarettes was 0.6% among high school students and 0.4% among middle school students.

### HEALTHY study rationale, design and methods: moderating risk of type 2 diabetes in multi-ethnic middle school students [^1835665e]. International Journal of Obesity (2009). Low credibility.

The HEALTHY primary prevention trial was designed and implemented in response to the growing numbers of children and adolescents being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The objective was to moderate risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Modifiable risk factors measured were indicators of adiposity and glycemic dysregulation: body mass index ≥ 85th percentile, fasting glucose ≥ 5.55 mmol l(-1) (100 mg per 100 ml) and fasting insulin ≥ 180 pmol l(-1) (30 microU ml(-1)). A series of pilot studies established the feasibility of performing data collection procedures and tested the development of an intervention consisting of four integrated components: (1) changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food and beverage offerings throughout the total school food environment; (2) physical education class lesson plans and accompanying equipment to increase both participation and number of minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; (3) brief classroom activities and family outreach vehicles to increase knowledge, enhance decision-making skills and support and reinforce youth in accomplishing goals; and (4) communications and social marketing strategies to enhance and promote changes through messages, images, events and activities. Expert study staff provided training, assistance, materials and guidance for school faculty and staff to implement the intervention components. A cohort of students were enrolled in sixth grade and followed to end of eighth grade. They attended a health screening data collection at baseline and end of study that involved measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and a fasting blood draw. Height and weight were also collected at the end of the seventh grade. The study was conducted in 42 middle schools, six at each of seven locations across the country, with 21 schools randomized to receive the intervention and 21 to act as controls (data collection activities only). Middle school was the unit of sample size and power computation, randomization, intervention and primary analysis.

### Assessment of college students' awareness and knowledge about conditions relevant to metabolic syndrome [^10830655]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Participants' characteristics

A sample of 243 students (72% females and 28% males), with a mean age of 20.6 years, participated in this study. The average weight and height of the participating students were 69.8 ± 16.7 kg and 166.8 ± 9.1 cm, respectively. The mean BMI and percentage body fat for males were 26.1 ± 4.9 kg/m 2 and 16.6 ± 8.1, respectively, whereas for females values were 23.4 ± 3.9 kg/m 2 and 26.8 ± 6.9, respectively. The mean values of visceral fat scores for males and females were 1.9 ± 1.8 and 3.7 ± 3.4, respectively (Table 1). Of the participating students, 89% were Caucasian, 10% African American, and 1% other ethnicity, reflecting the composition of the ethnic groups at CMU. More than half of the students were Health-Science major (51%) and most of them were in their second and third year of academic study. More women reported a science major (58%) than men (36%). Smoking was not common among students, as 89% of students reported being non-smokers, 6% were current smokers, and 5% were former smokers. Family history of chronic diseases among students was distributed as follows: 13% heart disease, 23% diabetes, 41% hypertension, and 26% cancer. This demographic profile is consistent with national averages in regard to students' age, gender, and year in school, but different in regard to less ethnic diversity, lower percentage of smokers, and less obesity.

### Notes from the field: E-cigarette use among middle and high school students-national youth tobacco survey, United States, 2021 [^e1b197b2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2021, 11.3% of high school students (1.72 million) and 2.8% (320,000) of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use (Table). Among current e-cigarette users, 43.6% of high school students and 17.2% of middle school students reported using e-cigarettes on ≥ 20 of the past 30 days; daily use was 27.6% among current high school e-cigarette users and 8.3% among current middle school e-cigarette users. Among both middle and high school current e-cigarette users, the most commonly used device type was disposables, followed by prefilled or refillable pods or cartridges and tanks or mod systems. Among high school current e-cigarette users, 26.1% reported that their usual brand was Puff Bar, followed by Vuse (10.8%), SMOK (9.6%), JUUL (5.7%), and Suorin (2.3%). Among middle school current users, 30.3% reported that their usual brand was Puff Bar, and 12.5% reported JUUL. Notably, 15.6% of high school users and 19.3% of middle school users reported not knowing the e-cigarette brand they usually used.

### 'Physical activity 4 everyone' school-based intervention to prevent decline in adolescent physical activity levels: 12 month (mid-intervention) report on a cluster randomised trial [^22a1977d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Outcome measures: physical activity levels

Physical activity was measured using accelerometers (Actigraph GT3X+ and GT3X models). Mean minutes of MVPA per day was the primary outcome. Additional outcome measures included: (1) percentage of time spent in MVPA per day (calculated to adjust for individual wear time), (2) mean minutes per day and percentage wear time for moderate physical activity, (3) mean minutes per day and percentage of wear time in vigorous physical activity, (4) accelerometer counts per minute (CPM). Counts were collected in 15 s epochs and CPM calculated by dividing the total counts per day by the minutes of wear time. The proportion of students meeting physical activity guidelines of 60 min of MVPA/day has also been reported.

Accelerometers and instructions for use were distributed to students within class time when students also completed an online survey and had anthropometric measures taken. Students were requested to wear the accelerometer over the right hip during waking hours for seven consecutive days. Student and parent mobile numbers were collected via the consent form, and these were used to text daily reminders to wear the accelerometer. Student data were included in the analysis if the accelerometer was worn for ≥ 600 min on ≥ 3 days. Non-wear time was defined as 30 min of consecutive zeros. The Everson cut-points were used to categorise different intensities of physical activity.

Anthropometric data

Student anthropometric data, including height, weight (used to calculate body mass index (BMI)) and waist circumference was collected in duplicate using the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) procedures. Weight was measured in light clothing without shoes using a portable digital scale (Model no. UC-321PC, A&D Company Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer (Model no. PE087, Mentone Educational Centre, Australia). Weight status (BMI) was determined using International Obesity Taskforce definitions. Waist measurement was taken at the narrowest point between the inferior rib border and the iliac crest, using a flexible but inelastic tape measure. Waist circumference was recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.

Student characteristics

Students completed an online survey that assessed student sociodemographic characteristics, including age, sex, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status, and postcode of residence. The online survey also included other measures that were not included in the current paper (eg, physical activity mediators).

### The whole-of-school approach to physical activity: findings from a national sample of U.S. secondary students [^d0b47026]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The IOM recommends schools adopt a Whole-of-School (WOS) approach — one that is comprehensive, coordinated, and provides opportunities for students to be active before, during, and after school. This study examined, in a nationally representative sample of secondary students in the conterminous U.S., (1) the degree of implementation of a WOS approach and (2) the association between WOS implementation and student physical activity.

Methods

A WOS index — based on six school practices — was calculated using self-reported school administrator data gathered in 2010 and 2011 (N = 1,031). Student-level data were obtained from nationally representative samples of eighth-, tenth-, and 12th-grade students during the same years (eighth grade, nschools = 96, nstudents = 3,689; tenth/12th grades, nschools = 178, nstudents = 4,670). Multilevel Poisson models were estimated in 2013–2014 to examine the relationship between the WOS index and self-reported physical activity.

Results

Few students attended schools with high WOS index scores. Middle school students attending schools with higher WOS index scores were physically active for at least 60 minutes on more days than students attending schools with lower WOS index scores (exp[β] = 1.031, 95% CI = 1.008, 1.054). The WOS index score was not associated with physical activity among high school students.

Conclusions

This study finds that many schools are not offering the full array of practices comprising a WOS approach to physical activity, especially at the high school level. Yet, middle school students could have increased physical activity levels if schools were to implement a WOS approach to physical activity.

### Obesity status of middle school students in xiangtan and its relationship with internet addiction [^09e79ab1]. Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the state of middle school students' obesity in Xiangtan, China and to study the influence of Internet addiction on obesity.

Subjects

1,150 junior and senior middle school students in Xiangtan, China.

Design and Methods

The research subjects were select randomly for the study. The height and body weight of human body were measured and the obesity state was judged according to BMI value and the Working Group on Obesity in China (WGOC) standard. The questionnaire for the survey of middle school students' basic situation was designed and a survey of the respondents' personal information and the contributory factors to obesity was conducted. The Middle School Students' Internet Addiction Diagnosis Scale was adopted for measuring and judging the Internet addiction of the research subjects.

Results

(1) The total detection rate of obesity was 23.57%. (2) The overall detection rate of Internet addiction was 21.23%. (3) The detection rate of obesity in middle school students with Internet addiction (32.92%) was significantly higher than that without Internet addiction (21.06%). Logistic regression showed that Internet addiction was an independent risk factor of obesity.

Conclusion

Internet addiction is related to obesity of middle school students.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^8970da98]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School health education — required instruction hours and grade requirements indicate that required instruction on nutrition was 3.4 hours for elementary schools, 4.2 hours for middle schools, and 5.9 for high schools, and the median number of hours of required instruction on physical activity was 2.4 hours for elementary schools, 3.1 hours for middle schools, and 4.5 for high schools; schools also require less health education as students progress through school, with almost two thirds (61%) of all schools requiring health instruction at least one specific grade but only 34% in 9th grade, 25% in 10th grade, 12% in 11th grade, and 9% in 12th grade among schools with 9th-grade students.

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students-United States, 2011–2016 [^90d7563d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States; nearly all tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood (1,2). Among youths, use of tobacco products in any form is unsafe (1,3). CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2011–2016 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine recent patterns of current (past 30-day) use of seven tobacco product types among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high (grades 9–12) school students. In 2016, 20.2% of surveyed high school students and 7.2% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. In 2016, among current tobacco product users, 47.2% of high school students and 42.4% of middle school students used ≥ 2 tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used tobacco product among high (11.3%) and middle (4.3%) school students. Current use of any tobacco product did not change significantly during 2011–2016 among high or middle school students, although combustible tobacco product use declined. However, during 2015–2016, among high school students, decreases were observed in current use of any tobacco product, any combustible product, ≥ 2 tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and hookahs. Among middle school students, current use of e-cigarettes decreased. Comprehensive and sustained strategies can help prevent and reduce the use of all forms of tobacco products among U.S. youths (1–3).

### Tobacco product use among U.S. middle and high school students-national youth tobacco survey, 2023 [^49ae53a1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current use of any tobacco product by high school students declined by an estimated 540,000 students, from 2.51 million in 2022 to 1.97 million in 2023. In 2023, 22.2% of middle and high school students (representing 6.21 million) reported ever using any tobacco product, and 10.0% of students (representing 2.80 million) reported current use of any tobacco product. Similar to 2022, ever use of any tobacco product was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian students and did not differ significantly across most racial and ethnic groups.

E-cigarettes have been the most commonly used tobacco product among U.S. youths since 2014. Youth e-cigarette use is a critical public health concern, because approximately one half of students ever using e-cigarettes reported using them currently, indicating that many young persons who try e-cigarettes remain e-cigarette users. In 2023, 10.0% of high school students and 4.6% of middle school students used e-cigarettes during the past 30 days. From 2022 to 2023, a significant decline in current e-cigarette use occurred among high school students (from 14.1% to 10.0%), while no statistically significant change occurred among middle school students (from 3.3% in 2022 to 4.6% in 2023). The decline since 2022 in high school student e-cigarette use is likely attributable to multiple factors, such as ongoing efforts at the national, state, and local levels to implement tobacco control strategies, including Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory actions. Continued surveillance is needed to determine the trajectory of middle school e-cigarette use. Despite the decline in e-cigarette use among high school students, close to 40% of high school students using e-cigarettes reported frequent use, and 29.9% reported daily use. Furthermore, 550,000 middle school students currently used e-cigarettes, including 20.7% reporting frequent use. Similar patterns were observed in 2022 for both middle school and high school students. These findings are concerning, because adolescents have reported symptoms of nicotine dependence when using tobacco products only 1–3 days per month. Efforts aimed at reducing nicotine dependence among adolescents by preventing initiation of tobacco products is important.

### Age-dependency of the propagation rate of coronavirus disease 2019 inside school bubble groups in catalonia, Spain [^392a8bdd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 2 compares the daily new cases for the 2 data sources for the 4 different educational cycles. Despite the different data sources, a satisfactory overlay of both data is observed. As may be seen, correspondence of primary level data is extremely high. Preschool and high school surveillance curves are below those given by the health system, which agrees with the fact that these educational cycles are not compulsory. Therefore, it would be expected that the number of cases reported by the school surveillance system was lower than the number captured by the health system. Surprisingly, the number of cases in middle school reported by the educational surveillance system was higher than that reported by the health system. This could be explained by the existence of a certain percentage (estimated at 17%) of students ≥ 16 years old still enrolled in middle school, as they repeated one or more courses. Such students thus still appear in the middle school statistics in spite of being classified in the 16–17 age group by the health surveillance system.

FIGURE 2.
Evolution of daily new cases distributed by age. Daily new cases for preschool (A), primary (B), middle (C), and high (D) school, and 7-day averages obtained from the data in the schools by school years and from the official data by age ranges.

The 2 data sources reported an important increase in incidence associated with age. Figure 3 shows the total number of students with a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis for each school level. The age-dependency was clear except for high school where the reduced number of students at such levels could be a differentiating factor.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^d4246ee6]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Delayed school start times — Implementation of later school start times for adolescents is associated with longer total sleep time, reduced daytime sleepiness, increased engagement in classroom activities, and reduced first-hour tardiness and absences; delayed school start times also are associated with reduced depressive symptoms and irritability, and reaction time improves, with crash rates declining by 16.5% following a school start time delay of 60 minutes. Extension of sleep time also facilitates behavioral weight loss interventions in adolescents.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^3b849c55]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School physical education requirements and scheduling — policies on exemptions and instructional time are specified as follows: All students should take all required physical education courses and no substitutions, waivers, or exemptions should be permitted, and schools and school districts should not allow students to be exempted from required physical education for the following reasons: enrollment in other courses, participation in school sports, participation in other school activities, participation in community sport activities, high physical fitness competency test scores, participation in vocational training, or participation in community service activities. Among the 84% of middle schools and 95% of high schools that required physical education in 2006, 12% of middle schools and 25% of high schools allowed exemptions for participation in school sports, and 20% of these high schools allowed exemptions for other school activities such as band or chorus. Achieving the recommended 225 minutes per week for physical education can be difficult in schools with block schedules; therefore, secondary schools with block schedules are recommended to provide 450 minutes of physical education every 10 days, and schools lacking resources can increase physical education from 1 or 2 days per week to at least 3 days per week.

### Commercialism in US elementary and secondary school nutrition environments: trends from 2007 to 2012 [^ffc64d89]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Schools present highly desirable marketing environments for food and beverage companies. However, most marketed items are nutritionally poor.

Objective

To examine national trends in student exposure to selected school-based commercialism measures from 2007 through 2012.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Annual nationally representative cross-sectional studies were evaluated in US public elementary, middle, and high schools with use of a survey of school administrators.

Exposures

School-based commercialism, including exclusive beverage contracts and associated incentives, profits, and advertising; corporate food vending and associated incentives and profits; posters/advertisements for soft drinks, fast food, or candy; use of food coupons as incentives; event sponsorships; and fast food available to students.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes over time in school-based commercialism as well as differences by student body racial/ethnic distribution and socioeconomic status.

Results

Although some commercialism measures-especially those related to beverage vending-have shown significant decreases over time, most students at all academic levels continued to attend schools with one or more types of school-based commercialism in 2012. Overall, exposure to school-based commercialism increased significantly with grade level. For 63.7% of elementary school students, the most frequent type of commercialism was food coupons used as incentives. For secondary students, the type of commercialism most prevalent in schools was exclusive beverage contracts, which were in place in schools attended by 49.5% of middle school students and 69.8% of high school students. Exposure to elementary school coupons, as well as middle and high school exclusive beverage contracts, was significantly more likely for students attending schools with mid or low (vs high) student body socioeconomic status.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most US elementary, middle, and high school students attend schools where they are exposed to commercial efforts aimed at obtaining food or beverage sales or developing brand recognition and loyalty for future sales. Although there have been significant decreases over time in many of the measures examined, the continuing high prevalence of school-based commercialism calls for, at minimum, clear and enforceable standards on the nutritional content of all foods and beverages marketed to youth in school settings.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^370e7083]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School competitive foods and beverages — availability trends and caloric impact — show declines in access across states and quantify daily intake differences. During 2006–2008 across 35 states, the median percentage of schools allowing student purchases from vending machines or similar venues decreased for chocolate candy (from 39% to 21%), other kinds of candy (from 43% to 24%), salty snacks not low in fat (47% to 34%), soda pop (from 62% to 38%), and sports drinks (from 72% to 57%). Offering competitive foods in vending machines at schools is associated with significantly higher body mass index (BMI) among middle-school students. In the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, sugar-sweetened beverages obtained at school contributed an additional 29 kcal per school day for middle school students and 46 kcal per school day for high school students, while low-nutrient, energy-dense foods obtained and consumed at school contributed 86 kcal per school day for middle school students and 111 kcal per school day for high school students; attending schools without stores or snack bars that sell foods or beverages is estimated to be associated with reduced sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 22 kcal per school day for middle school students and 28 kcal per school day for high school students, and restricting access to snack foods is associated with more frequent fruit and vegetable consumption.

### Vital signs: tobacco product use among middle and high school students-United States, 2011–2018 [^e6e552d5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States; nearly all tobacco product use begins during youth and young adulthood.

Methods

CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from the 2011–2018 National Youth Tobacco Surveys to estimate tobacco product use among U.S. middle and high school students. Prevalence estimates of current (past 30-day) use of seven tobacco products were assessed; differences over time were analyzed using multivariable regression (2011–2018) or t-test (2017–2018).

Results

In 2018, current use of any tobacco product was reported by 27.1% of high school students (4.04 million) and 7.2% of middle school students (840,000); electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used product among high school (20.8%; 3.05 million) and middle school (4.9%; 570,000) students. Use of any tobacco product overall did not change significantly during 2011–2018 among either school level. During 2017–2018, current use of any tobacco product increased 38.3% (from 19.6% to 27.1%) among high school students and 28.6% (from 5.6% to 7.2%) among middle school students; e-cigarette use increased 77.8% (from 11.7% to 20.8%) among high school students and 48.5% (from 3.3% to 4.9%) among middle school students.

Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice

A considerable increase in e-cigarette use among U.S. youths, coupled with no change in use of other tobacco products during 2017–2018, has erased recent progress in reducing overall tobacco product use among youths. The sustained implementation of comprehensive tobacco control strategies, in coordination with Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco products, can prevent and reduce the use of all forms of tobacco products among U.S. youths.

### Factors affecting thyroid volume in adolescent students attending a rural middle school in east hangzhou, China [^615dbc16]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the thyroid volume (Tvol) and to explore factors that affects it among 12 to 15-year-olds attending a rural middle school in east Hangzhou, China.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey of middle school students attending a rural middle school in east Hangzhou, China was conducted. Height, weight and other physical development related indicators in middle school students were measured. The thyroid size was measured using ultrasound, and the thyroid volume calculated.

Results

The median (P 25, P 75) of the thyroid volume in 596 middle school students from a rural middle school in east Hangzhou, China was 6.69 (5.66, 7.98) mL. Our study enrolled 305 male students (51.2%) and 291 female students (48.8%). The height, weight and thyroid volume of middle school students increased with age. Univariate analysis revealed that height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) were positive correlated with thyroid volume (p < 0.01). The correlation between BSA and thyroid volume was significant (Spearman's rho = 0.473, p < 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that BSA was positive and significantly correlated with the thyroid volume (p < 0.05). Regression equation was Y = -2.532 + 6.186×BSA.

Conclusion

The thyroid volume is not only affected by age, but it is also affected by growth and development. Goiter cannot only be assessed based on age, gender and thyroid volume. However, this study established that BSA not only presented the strongest correlation with thyroid volume (Spearman's rho = 0.473), but also had a strong correlation with physical development, taking into account the growth and development of middle school students, and showed greater stability. Therefore, we recommend inclusion of BSA as a reference standard in the measurement of the thyroid volume.

### To the editor: early school start times in middle and high schools have profound implications for children and teens [^092a8f41]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This letter to the editor aims to prompt medical students, residents, and sleep medicine fellows to actively support the implementation of delayed school start times in middle and high schools, considering the significant impact it holds for children and adolescents. During puberty, research has demonstrated that circadian changes result in a sleep-phase delay among adolescents, leading them to sleep and wake up later compared to other age groups. This, coupled with early school start times, contributes to sleep deprivation within this patient population, increasing the likelihood of drowsy driving accidents, mental health problems, academic underperformance, and a predisposition to chronic illnesses like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. As medical students, residents, and fellows in the field of sleep, we must prioritize advocating for healthy sleep and addressing the issue of early school start times. By doing so, we can safeguard the future of medicine and society, ensuring the well-being and success of our middle and high school students.

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic [^6c995027]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have implemented a variety of measures to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.

Selection Criteria

We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings.

Main Results

We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention. We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects. As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^56345d23]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School health guidelines — early and middle childhood (EMC) objectives focus on strengthening school health education by increasing the proportion of elementary, middle, and senior high schools that require school health education, requiring newly hired staff who teach required health education to have undergraduate or graduate training in health education, requiring newly hired staff who teach required health instruction to be certified, licensed, or endorsed by the state in health education, and increasing the proportion of required health education classes or courses with a teacher who has had professional development related to teaching personal and social skills for behavior change within the past 2 years.

### Suicidal mortality and motives among middle-school, high-school, and university students [^391b3102]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Fluctuations in SMRPs Associated With School-Related Motives

Among school-related factors, underachievement was consistently the leading motive for suicide among male students, followed by worrying about the future and conflict with classmates (eFigure 1B in Supplement 1). Among female students, the rank-order of impacts of school-related motives transformed with age, shifting from conflict with classmates (77 students [26%]), underachievement (58 students [20%]), and worrying about the future (46 students [16%]) among middle-school students; to worrying about the future (126 students [25%]), conflict with classmates (103 students [21%]), and underachievement (92 students [19%]) among high-school students; and finally to worrying about the future (207 students [38%]), underachievement (174 students [32%]), and conflict with classmates (68 students [13%]) among university students (eFigure 1B in Supplement 1).

SMRPs associated with school-related motives among female middle-school and university students began increasing in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Those of male students changed from decreasing to increasing in 2020 (Figure 2 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Those of male and female high-school students increased in 2016 and 2019, respectively.

Figure 2.
Fluctuations of Suicide Mortality Rate per 100 000 Population (SMRP) Associated With School-Related Factors Among Japanese Students, 2007–2022

Graphs show fluctuations of SMRPs associated with school-related factors (A), underachievement (B), worrying about the future (C), and conflict with classmates (D). Statistical significance was set at P < .05 for trends of SMRPs detected by joinpoint regression analysis.

Of note, SMRPs associated with conflict with classmate of female middle-school and high-school students were greater compared with male student in the late 2010s. Suicides among male and female university students associated with conflict with classmates increased greatly in 2022 (Figure 2).

### Weight management among school-aged children and adolescents: a quantitative assessment in a Ghanaian municipality [^e7708130]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design/site

This was a cross-sectional study conducted among school-aged children and adolescents in 6 randomly selected schools within Ashanti-Bekwai Municipality. The Bekwai Municipal is one of the 30 administrative and political districts in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, located in the southern part of the region. It stretches over an area of 1937 km 2 and lies within latitude 6° 00′N and 6° 30′ N and longitudes 1° 00 W and 1° 35 W. According the annual composite progress report of the Bekwai municipality, the estimated number of public and private school enrolment from primary up to senior high school in the year 2014 was 30,355 and 5540, respectively, featuring 191 schools. The school attendance data for the population of Bekwai municipality is such that those attending basic and high school represent 76.7 and 23.3%, respectively, from an estimated population of 36,322 active schooling population out of the total enrolled students.

Study population and selection of students

Using a multi-stage random sampling technique, students selected were within the age range of 5–17 years. To obtain a random distribution of the selected students from all classes, a proportionate random sample method was employed that included more students from larger classes.

Sample size

To obtain a representative sample size for the entire student's population (basic school and high school), at a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 0.036, the formula below was used:

Where N = total basic and high school student population, n = estimated sample size, e = margin of error.

Also, to ensure a relative proportion of the students by level, the total student population was stratified according to basic and high school using the formula:

Where ni = sample size drawn from either primary or secondary schools, Ni = total population for either basic or high school, N = total student population, n = total estimated sample size. The sample size collected from both basic and high school were 702 and 302, respectively.

### The WHO health promoting school framework for improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement [^2ac7b4bf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization's (WHO's) Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework is an holistic, settings-based approach to promoting health and educational attainment in school. The effectiveness of this approach has not been previously rigorously reviewed.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of the Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework in improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases in January 2011 and again in March and April 2013: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Campbell Library, ASSIA, BiblioMap, CAB Abstracts, IBSS, Social Science Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, TRoPHI, Global Health Database, SIGLE, Australian Education Index, British Education Index, Education Resources Information Centre, Database of Education Research, Dissertation Express, Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current controlled trials, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched relevant websites, handsearched reference lists, and used citation tracking to identify other relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included cluster-randomised controlled trials where randomisation took place at the level of school, district or other geographical area. Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years, attending schools or colleges. In this review, we define HPS interventions as comprising the following three elements: input to the curriculum; changes to the school's ethos or environment or both; and engagement with families or communities, or both. We compared this intervention against schools that implemented either no intervention or continued with their usual practice, or any programme that included just one or two of the above mentioned HPS elements.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors identified relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in the trials. We grouped different types of interventions according to the health topic targeted or the approach used, or both. Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to provide a summary of results across studies.

Main Results

We included 67 eligible cluster trials, randomising 1443 schools or districts. This is made up of 1345 schools and 98 districts. The studies tackled a range of health issues: physical activity (4), nutrition (12), physical activity and nutrition combined (18), bullying (7), tobacco (5), alcohol (2), sexual health (2), violence (2), mental health (2), hand-washing (2), multiple risk behaviours (7), cycle-helmet use (1), eating disorders (1), sun protection (1), and oral health (1). The quality of evidence overall was low to moderate as determined by the GRADE approach. 'Risk of bias' assessments identified methodological limitations, including heavy reliance on self-reported data and high attrition rates for some studies. In addition, there was a lack of long-term follow-up data for most studies. We found positive effects for some interventions for: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, and being bullied. Intervention effects were generally small but have the potential to produce public health benefits at the population level. We found little evidence of effectiveness for standardised body mass index (zBMI) and no evidence of effectiveness for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others; however, only a small number of studies focused on these latter outcomes. It was not possible to meta-analyse data on other health outcomes due to lack of data. Few studies provided details on adverse events or outcomes related to the interventions. In addition, few studies included any academic, attendance or school-related outcomes. We therefore cannot draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of this approach for improving academic achievement.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of some interventions based on the HPS framework for improving certain health outcomes but not others. More well-designed research is required to establish the effectiveness of this approach for other health topics and academic achievement.

### Screening in high schools to identify, evaluate, and lower depression among adolescents: a randomized clinical trial [^5e594d41]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

Participants

Among 13 171 eligible students, 262 (2.0%) opted out; thus, 12 909 students were included in the analysis (Figure). A total of 5946 students (46.1%) were female and 6963 (53.9%) were male; 2687 (20.8%) were Hispanic, 2891 (22.4%) were non-Hispanic Black, 5842 (45.3%) were non-Hispanic White, and 1489 (11.5%) were multiracial or of other race or ethnicity (includes American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, and other, as some schools simply reported "other"). Median age was 16 years (range, 13–21 years). In total, 6436 students (49.9%) were randomized to targeted screening and 6473 (50.1%) to universal screening, with demographic details comparable between study groups (Table 1). Statistical analysis was based on students from 14 schools, 7 of which were classified as urban, with a median size of 370 students (range, 67–3496 students) (Table 2). Eight schools required multiple days to complete universal screening, ranging from 2 to 10 days, primarily owing to their larger student body size. Schools that required multiple days screened a median of 112 students in a given day (IQR, 91–148 students). Students completed the PHQ-9 in a median of 71 seconds (IQR, 54–95 seconds).

### Applying the PROSPER prevention delivery system with middle schools: emerging adulthood effects on substance misuse and conduct problem behaviors through 14 years past baseline [^7899f075]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

From the 6th through the 12th grades, data were collected via machine‐scored written questionnaires administered in students' classrooms. Pretest assessments were conducted in the fall of 2002 (for Cohort 1) and 2003 (for Cohort 2). Beginning in the spring of 6th grade, follow‐up assessments were conducted annually through the 12th grade (from 0.5 to 6.5 years past baseline). On average, 88% of all eligible students completed questionnaires across the eight in‐school survey waves, with slightly higher rates of participation in earlier waves.

Because of the high cost of following the entire sample into adulthood, a randomly selected and stratified subsample was recruited for continued follow‐up beyond 12th grade, with the intention of recruiting approximately 2000 participants. Students who were still enrolled in the same school district in the ninth grade were eligible for participation in the emerging adult follow‐up assessments. Selection for the emerging adult follow‐up was stratified by school district, gender, and risk status. Risk status was based on five dichotomous factors reported by participants at baseline: lifetime gateway substance use (use of alcohol, cigarettes, or marijuana); conduct problem behaviors (at least 2 of 12 possible behaviors during the past year); eligibility for the free and reduced cost school lunch program; lower family cohesion (dichotomized); and living with one or no biological parents (vs. two biological parents). Students were classified as being at higher risk if they reported (a) any three or more of the five risk factors or (b) two risk factors, if gateway substance use or conduct problems were among the two. To enhance statistical power to investigate risk‐related moderation effects in multilevel models (see Montgomery,), higher‐risk participants were oversampled and comprised 37.4% of the participating subsample, versus 29.2% of the eligible sample. At age 23, 1628 (82.0%) of this emerging adult subsample participated in the study, and at age 25, 1595 (80.4%) participated. Details of sample participation at different points in the study are provided in Figure 1. Randomly selected, stratified subsamples were selected in the two participating states and prospective participants were sent an invitation to continue with the study, until 1985 of those who agreed completed the survey. At age 19, participants were 90.6% White and 54.1% female. At ages 23 and 25, as was the case at age 19, participants completed assessments through a computer‐assisted telephone interview or a web‐based survey (9% and 91%, respectively, at age 23, and 6% and 94% at age 25).

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^60d09bd9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Factors influencing physical activity in children and adolescents — participation is related to demographic, personal, social, and environmental factors. Racial/ethnic differences are evident: in 2009, 20% of non-Hispanic white high school students, 16% of Hispanic students, and 17% of non-Hispanic black students had been physically active for 60 minutes every day in the previous week. Sex differences are also present, with the 2009 national YRBS indicating that 25% of males and 11% of females had been physically active for at least 60 minutes per day in the previous week. School environment metrics show limited daily physical education and recess opportunities: in 2006, 4% of elementary schools, 8% of middle schools, and 2% of high schools provided daily physical education for the entire school year for students in all grades, and in 2006, 26% of elementary schools did not provide regularly scheduled recess for students in all grades.

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students-United States, 2011–2014 [^37f94b95]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

From 2011 to 2014, substantial increases were observed in current e-cigarette and hookah use among middle and high school students, resulting in an overall estimated total of 2.4 million e-cigarette youth users and an estimated 1.6 million hookah youth users in 2014. Statistically significant decreases occurred in the use of cigarettes, cigars, tobacco pipes, bidis, and snus. The increases in current use of e-cigarettes and hookahs offset the decreases in current use of other tobacco products, resulting in no change in overall current tobacco use among middle and high school students. In 2014, one in four high school students and one in 13 middle school students used one or more tobacco products in the last 30 days. In 2014, for the first time in NYTS, current e-cigarette use surpassed current use of every other tobacco product, including cigarettes.

These findings are subject to at least three limitations. First, data were collected only from youths who attended either public or private schools and might not be generalizable to all middle and high school-aged youth. Second, current tobacco use was estimated by including students who reported using at least one of the nine tobacco products asked in the survey but might have had missing responses to any of the other eight tobacco products; missing responses were considered as nonuse, which might have resulted in underestimated results. Finally, changes between 2013 and 2014 in the wording and placement of questions about the use of e-cigarettes, hookahs, and tobacco pipes might have had an impact on reported use of these products. Despite these limitations, overall prevalence estimates are similar to the findings of other nationally representative youth surveys.

### Frequency of use among middle and high school student tobacco product users-United States, 2015–2017 [^ea2166d2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Tobacco product use during adolescence increases the risk for lifelong nicotine addiction and immediate adverse health effects (1,2). During 2011–2017, current use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco decreased significantly among middle and high school students, but current use of e-cigarettes increased significantly from 1.5% to 11.7% (3). In 2017, an estimated 19.6% of high school students (2.95 million) and 5.6% of middle school students (0.67 million) were current users of any tobacco product; e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product for both middle (3.3%) and high (11.7%) school students (3). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC analyzed combined data from the 2015–2017 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine past 30-day (current) frequency of use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and hookahs among U.S. high school and middle school students. During 2015–2017, the proportion of students currently using tobacco products who used a product for ≥ 20 of the past 30 days ranged from 14.0% of cigar smokers to 38.7% of smokeless tobacco users among high school students and from 13.1% of e-cigarette users to 24.5% of hookah smokers among middle school students. Among current users, use of two or more tobacco products ranged from 76.7% (e-cigarettes) to 90.9% (hookahs) among those using the product ≥ 20 of the preceding 30 days, from 68.0% (e-cigarettes) to 84.2% (hookahs) among those using the product for 6 to 19 of the preceding 30 days, and from 48.8% (e-cigarettes) to 77.2% (cigarettes) among those using the product for 1 to 5 of the preceding 30 days. Sustained implementation of proven tobacco control strategies focusing on all types of tobacco products, in coordination with the regulation of tobacco products by FDA, are needed to reduce tobacco product initiation and use among U.S. youths.

### E-cigarette use among middle and high school students-United States, 2020 [^95b90e07]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of any tobacco product by youths is unsafe, including electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) (1). Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, can harm the developing adolescent brain, and can increase risk for future addiction to other drugs (1). E-cigarette use has increased considerably among U.S. youths since 2011. Multiple factors have contributed to this increase, including youth-appealing flavors and product innovations. Amid the widespread use of e-cigarettes and popularity of certain products among youths, on February 6, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a policy prioritizing enforcement against the manufacture, distribution, and sale of certain unauthorized flavored prefilled pod or cartridge-based e-cigarettes (excluding tobacco or menthol).*

CDC and FDA analyzed nationally representative data from the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), † a cross-sectional, school-based, self-administered survey of U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students conducted during January 16–March 16, 2020. § The NYTS study protocol was approved by the CDC institutional review board. Current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use was assessed, overall and by device and flavor type. Weighted prevalence estimates and population totals †† were calculated. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International).

In 2020, 19.6% of high school students (3.02 million) and 4.7% of middle school students (550,000) reported current e-cigarette use. Among current e-cigarette users, 38.9% of high school students and 20.0% of middle school students reported using e-cigarettes on 20 or more of the past 30 days; 22.5% of high school users and 9.4% of middle school users reported daily use. Among all current e-cigarette users, 82.9% used flavored e-cigarettes, including 84.7% of high school users (2.53 million) and 73.9% of middle school users (400,000).

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^05f2e56e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Exercise interventions and definitions — time spent in daily vigorous exercise in excess of 60 min per day provides additional reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, and improvement in cardiovascular fitness in young adults was associated with improved cardiovascular disease risk factors over a 7-yr period. School-based programs such as the Cardiovascular Health in Children (CHIC-II) study decreased body fat and cholesterol concentrations and reduced body fat and blood pressure in middle school youth, with success linked to increased time spent in actual moderate to vigorous physical activity in school (20 min in elementary schools and 30 min in middle schools). A Task Force meta-analysis found a moderate treatment effect when body composition was the outcome (P = 0.00001) and no effect when BMI was the outcome; the difference was highly significant (P = 0.002), although there was no significant difference in responses in the six trials reporting both measures. In exercise physiology terms, the energy expended for moderate to vigorous exercise is at least 3 (METS) metabolic equivalents, and when exercise shifts body composition the net weight loss under such circumstances may be nil.

### Tobacco product use among middle and high school students-national youth tobacco survey, United States, 2024 [^ad8c87dc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During 2023–2024, among all middle school and high school students, current use of any tobacco product declined by an estimated 550,000 students, largely driven by the decline in high school e-cigarette use (from 1.56 million to 1.21 million), and reaching the lowest level ever measured by NYTS. Despite these declines, approximately one in 12 middle and high school students reported current use of any tobacco product during 2024, including approximately one in 10 high school students and approximately 1 in 20 middle school students. Approximately two in five students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.

Since 2014, e-cigarettes have been the most used tobacco product among U.S. youths. From 2023 to 2024, current use of e-cigarettes declined significantly among high school students. The decline in high school student e-cigarette use is likely attributable to multiple factors, including ongoing activities at the national, state, and local levels to implement tobacco control strategies. A similar decline in e-cigarette use among high school students occurred from 2022 to 2023. E-cigarette use did not change among middle school students from 2023 to 2024, similar to use from 2022 to 2023.

In 2024, 1.7% of high school students and 1.1% of middle school students reported current cigarette smoking, the lowest prevalence ever recorded by NYTS. However, youths continue to use other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. As the tobacco product market continues to evolve, vigilant monitoring of emerging tobacco product trends among youths is important. Nicotine pouch sales have substantially increased nationwide since 2016 §§§; although sales data do not indicate which age groups are using the products, NYTS data indicate use of nicotine pouches among youths remains relatively low. However, for the first time, nicotine pouches were the second most common currently used tobacco product (1.8%); nearly one million (890,000) students reported ever using nicotine pouches in 2024. CDC and FDA will continue monitoring tobacco product use among youths, especially e-cigarette and nicotine pouches, and address any potential increase in use of these products.

### Tobacco product use among youths with and without lifetime asthma-Florida, 2016 [^b1c58f2b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Data were statistically weighted to yield representative estimates of Florida middle and high school students attending public schools. Prevalence estimates and corresponding population counts were calculated for current tobacco product use overall and by school level (middle or high) among students with or without asthma. Rao-Scott modified chi-square tests were performed to assess statistically significant differences between students with or without asthma; p values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

In 2016, 19.5% of middle and 20.6% of high school students in Florida reported lifetime asthma (Table 1). Approximately 190,000 middle and high school students in Florida (8.5% and 24.9%, respectively) reported current use of any tobacco product in 2016, with approximately 86,000 (3.1% and 9.0%, respectively) reporting multiple tobacco product use.

### Frequency of use among middle and high school student tobacco product users-United States, 2015–2017 [^34d2df56]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Tobacco product use during adolescence increases the risk for lifelong nicotine addiction and immediate adverse health effects. During 2011–2017, current use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco decreased significantly among middle and high school students, but current use of e-cigarettes increased significantly from 1.5% to 11.7%. In 2017, an estimated 19.6% of high school students (2.95 million) and 5.6% of middle school students (0.67 million) were current users of any tobacco product; e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product for both middle (3.3%) and high (11.7%) school students. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC analyzed combined data from the 2015–2017 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine past 30-day (current) frequency of use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and hookahs among U.S. high school and middle school students. During 2015–2017, the proportion of students currently using tobacco products who used a product for ≥ 20 of the past 30 days ranged from 14.0% of cigar smokers to 38.7% of smokeless tobacco users among high school students and from 13.1% of e-cigarette users to 24.5% of hookah smokers among middle school students. Among current users, use of two or more tobacco products ranged from 76.7% (e-cigarettes) to 90.9% (hookahs) among those using the product ≥ 20 of the preceding 30 days, from 68.0% (e-cigarettes) to 84.2% (hookahs) among those using the product for 6 to 19 of the preceding 30 days, and from 48.8% (e-cigarettes) to 77.2% (cigarettes) among those using the product for 1 to 5 of the preceding 30 days. Sustained implementation of proven tobacco control strategies focusing on all types of tobacco products, in coordination with the regulation of tobacco products by FDA, are needed to reduce tobacco product initiation and use among U.S. youths.

### Model-based evaluation of school-and non-school-related measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic [^09c27d05]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Interventions for different school ages

Next we investigated the impact of targeting interventions at different age groups, starting from the situation in November 2020 with the effective reproduction number being about 1 (Supplementary Fig. 4 d). Figure 7 a–c shows R e as a function of the reduction of school contacts in age groups of [0, 5), [5, 10), and [10, 20) y.o. respectively. In each panel, we varied the number of school contacts in one age group while keeping the number of school contacts in the other two age groups constant. Zero percent reduction corresponds to the situation in November 2020, and 100% reduction represents a scenario with schools for students in a given age group closed. The model predicts a maximum impact on R e from reducing contacts of 10–20-year-old children (Fig. 7 c). Closing schools for this age group only could decrease R e by about 8% (compare Fig. 7 c and Fig. 6 b where we expect the reduction of 16% after closing schools for all ages). School closure for children aged 5–10 years would reduce R e by about 5% (Fig. 7 b). Contact reductions among 0–5-year-old children would have a negligible impact on R e as shown in Fig. 7 a.

Fig. 7
Impact of reduction of school contacts in different age groups on the effective reproduction number in November 2020.

Percentage reduction in school contacts among (a) [0, 5) years old, (b) [5, 10) years old, and (c) [10, 20) years old. In each panel, we varied the number of school contacts in one age group while keeping the number of school contacts in the other two age groups constant. The scenario with 0% reduction describes the situation in November 2020 with R e of about 1 (partial lockdown intended to prevent the second wave), where all schools are open without substantial additional measures. The reduction of 100% in school contacts represents a scenario with the structure of non-school contacts in society in general as in November 2020 and schools for students in a given age group closed. The solid black line describes the median and the shaded region represents the 95% credible intervals obtained from 2000 parameter samples from the posterior distribution. The red line is the starting value of R e = 1 (situation November 2020). The green line indicates the value of R e achieved when schools for a given age group close.

### Sources of dietary fat in middle schools [^18409f16]. Preventive Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The current study uses an ecological approach to describe the food environment at 24 middle schools and multiple food sources' dietary fat contribution.

Methods

Five consecutive days were sampled for collection of school meals, a la carte, and student store data. Bag lunch contents were observed on 3 days. Measurement included grams of saturated and total fat plus sales or participation data.

Results

Average total fat grams per meal were 21 g (SD = 2) for bag lunches, 14 g (SD = 5) for Type A breakfast, and 31 g (SD = 8) for Type A lunches. Average fat grams per item were 13 g (SD = 3) for a la carte and 6 g (SD = 2) for student stores. Students purchased or brought to school a mean of 26 g (SD = 3) of total and 8 g (SD = 1) of saturated fat. Contributions to total fat grams were 42% by Type A lunches, 27% by a la carte foods, 25% by bag lunches, 3% by Type A breakfast, and 2% by student stores. Findings for saturated fat were similar.

Conclusions

Middle school students eat excessive amounts of fat at school, and multiple sources of food must be considered to understand the school food environment.

### A school-based health education program can improve cholesterol values for middle school students [^f43ffb0c]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This prospective study aimed to measure the impact of a school-based multidisciplinary education program on risk factors for atherosclerosis in sixth-grade students.

Methods

A prospective study was performed in which patients served as their own controls. Healthy sixth-grade students from three middle schools in a city of approximately 100,000 were exposed to an educational program promoting healthful habits through behavioral and environmental change. Risk factors including body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), cholesterol panel, and random blood glucose were measured before program initiation, then 5 months afterward.

Results

Of 711 sixth-graders at three middle schools, 287 (47% boys; mean age, 11.5 ± 0.37 years) consented to participate in the study. The mean total cholesterol value decreased from 169 ± 26 to 154 ± 26 mg/dl (p < 0.0001). The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol value decreased from 86 ± 25 to 84 ± 23 mg/dl (p = 0.01), and the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol value decreased from 56 ± 13 to 50 ± 13 mg/dl (p < 0.0001). The random glucose value decreased from 96 ± 13 to 93 ± 15 mm/dl (p = 0.01). The mean SBP did not change, showing 109 ± 12.5 mmHg before the program and 108 ± 11.5 mmHg afterward. The DBP decreased from 63.6 ± 8.6 to 62.3 ± 7.8 mmHg (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

The Project Healthy Schools program is feasible and appears to be effective. The results showed significant improvement in risk factors for early atherosclerosis among sixth-grade students including total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, random glucose levels, and diastolic blood pressure. Further study with a larger group and a longer follow-up period would be valuable.

### High COVID-19 transmission potential associated with re-opening universities can be mitigated with layered interventions [^d7e372fd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For the main results reported in the paper, we ran the model with baseline parameters for 100 realisations, drawing from distributions indicated in Table 1 and report the 98% PI calculated directly from the 1st and 100th order statistic. To understand the variability further, we run 100 further realisations of the model varying all baseline parameters independently by ± 10%, and report those results in the Supplementary information.

Table 1
Baseline model parameter values, meaning and sources.

The impact of the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases was explored for values ofbetween 0 (asymptomatic cases not infectious) and 1 (asymptomatic cases as infectious as symptomatic cases), which corresponds to reproduction numbers ranging from 1.7 to 3.4 (see Supplementary Note 2).

We assumed that symptomatic cases would be tested and self-isolate within 48 h, which is consistent with the median time between symptom onset and test of 2 days in the UK. Contact tracing is difficult to implement explicitly in the compartmental model framework, but the mechanism of action can be captured by a lower within-group transmission rate. We focussed on interventions that could be implemented on top of wider control measures and were guided on feasibility by the UoB Scientific Advisory Group. We considered the following pragmatic interventions, limited by feasibility (see Table 2 for a summary):
Baseline conditions are 'business as usual' behaviour within universities with PHE guidelines. Symptomatic cases are tested are moved into self-isolation after an average of 48 h if test positive. No additional testing for people with no symptoms. Students are assumed to be in living circles that comprise of a maximum of 24 individuals to reflect existing UoB arrangements.
COVID security represents the reduction in transmission associated with social distancing and the use of face coverings. We modelled COVID security by reducing the transmission probability associated with non-household contacts by 25 and 50% to capture the impact of face covering use and social distancing outside of residences.
Reduced face-to-face teaching is captured by reducing the number of face-to-face teaching contacts by 25 and 75% from 20 students to 15 and then 5 students.
Reduced living circles reflects reducing the number of students sharing facilities within accommodation. In the baseline scenario, we assumed that students were in contact with other students living in the same accommodation, forming household groups up to a maximum of 24 individuals. For accommodation with more than 24 residents, we divided the accommodation population up into subunit 'living circles' of 24 students. To explore the impact of living circle size, we reduced the maximum living circle size from 24 to 20 and then 14 persons.
Reactive mass testing: we simulate scenarios in which all students are tested for the presence of current infection if the number of test-positive cases in a given week is greater than the previous week. If mass testing is triggered in the model, all students are tested within a given number of days, which is varied between 2 and 7 days. Additional testing is continued until the number of test-positive cases in a given week is less than the previous week.
Multiple, layered interventions: we investigated the impact of each of the above interventions in isolation and then applied sequentially: 25% reduction in transmission due to COVID security, followed by a reduction in face-to-face teaching to ten study contacts, followed by a reduction in living circles to 24 individuals, and reactive mass testing every 2 days if the infection rate on campus should rise, and finally a reduction in importation rates from outside the university population.

### Foods and beverages offered in US public secondary schools through the national school lunch program from 2011–2013: early evidence of improved nutrition and reduced disparities [^fb15aa15]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To present data on trends in foods and beverages offered through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) in public middle and high schools in the years immediately preceding and following implementation of new NSLP standards.

Method

From 2011 to 2013, primary data collection through the annual Youth, Education, and Society study involved use of mailed questionnaires to obtain data on NSLP meals from schools attended by nationally representative samples of US 8(th), 10(th), and 12(th) grade students (N = 792 middle schools and 751 high schools). Each school was weighted to represent the percentage of target grade students enrolled, thus allowing analyses examining changes over time in the percentage of students enrolled in (attending) schools with specified NSLP measure outcomes, as well as disparities in NSLP measures based on school characteristics.

Results

Significantly more US secondary students attended schools with specified NSLP measures in 2013 than in 2011; increases were observed at both middle and high school levels. Increase rates for some NSLP measures were moderated by school characteristics; where this was the case, moderating associations decreased prior NSLP nutrition environment disparities that were especially evident in smaller schools and schools with higher percentages of minority students.

Conclusion

Meaningful improvements have been made in the nutritional content of NSLP meals offered to US secondary students; these improvements have reduced prior NSLP meal disparities associated with school characteristics. Schools will need continued help with implementation and compliance monitoring in order to have the best opportunity to improve the nutrition environments for US students.

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^50ad8f76]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Notations

We used the example in table 1 to develop our notation. However, our results apply to both continuous and categorical outcomes. Let Yᵢ denote the score of a randomly selected student from school i, and pᵢ denote the proportion of girls in school i, i = 1, 2. We define the following quantities: a₁₀ = average score of girls in school 1, a₁₁ = average score of boys in school 1, a₂₀ = average score of girls in school 2, a₂₁ = average score of boys in school 2.

Then the overall average scores of these two schools are a₁ = p₁ a₁₀ + (1 − p₁) a₁₁, and a₂ = p₂ a₂₀ + (1 − p₂) a₂₁, respectively. They are the weighted averages of the subgroup averages.

We also define some differences in the score:

(1) The differences between girls and boys within each school: d₁ = a₁₀ − a₁₁, d₂ = a₂₀ − a₂₁.

(2) The difference in girls (boys) between the two schools (subgroup differences):

Δ₀ = a₁₀ − a₂₀,

Δ₁ = a₁₁ − a₂₁.

(3) The overall difference between the two schools:

Δ = a₁ − a₂.

It is easy to prove that

Δ₀ − Δ₁ = d₁ − d₂.

The number of students with overweight and obesity increased from 24.9 to 37.1% (p < 0.05). However, this increase was only statistically significant among men, the group in which mean weight gain after 6 years was about 6 kg.

### Prevalence and correlates of habitual snoring in high school students [^ec1226fb]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To examine the prevalence and correlates of habitual snoring in senior high school students in Korea.

Design

A cross-sectional survey.

Setting

Ten high schools in the southern part of Seoul, Korea.

Participants

A total of 3,871 high school students (2,703 male students and 1,168 female students; age range, 15 to 18 years; mean age: male students, 16.8 years; female students, 16.9 years) who were attending the 11th grade.

Measurements and Results

Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, school performance, and patterns of sleep and sleep-related disturbances. The overall prevalence of habitual snoring was 11.2% (boys, 12.4%; girls, 8.5%). The mean total sleep time was similar in habitual snorers vs nonsnorers (6.4 and 6.3 h per day, respectively). Frequency of snoring increased significantly with body mass index (BMI) [p < 0.001], cigarette smoking (p < 0.01), prevalence of witnessed apnea (p < 0.001), and Epworth sleepiness scale score (p < 0.001). The frequency of snoring increased with a decline in school performance (p < 0.001). For those whose school performance was low, there was a 35% excess in the odds of habitual snoring vs those whose school performance was high (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.78).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that chronic habitual snoring is associated with multiple factors in adolescents. Whether interventions to modify BMI and smoking can alter snoring habits and related clinical problems warrants further study, particularly as it also may improve academic performance in high school students.

### Frequency of tobacco use among middle and high school students – United States, 2014 [^b59793dc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

The use of tobacco products during adolescence increases the risk for adverse health effects and lifelong nicotine addiction. In 2014, an estimated 4.6 million middle and high school students were current users of any tobacco product, of whom an estimated 2.2 million were current users of two or more types of tobacco products. Symptoms of nicotine dependence are increased for multiple tobacco product users compared with single-product users. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) to determine how frequently (the number of days in the preceding 30 days) U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students used cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco products. Among current users (≥ 1 day during the preceding 30 days) in high school, frequent use (≥ 20 days during the preceding 30 days) was most prevalent among smokeless tobacco users (42.0%), followed by cigarette smokers (31.6%), e-cigarette users (15.5%), and cigar smokers (13.1%); a similar pattern was observed for those who used during all 30 days. Among current users in middle school, frequent use was greatest among smokeless tobacco users (29.2%), followed by cigarette smokers (20.0%), cigar smokers (13.2%) and e-cigarette users (11.8%). Current use of two or more types of tobacco products was common, even among students who used tobacco products 1–5 days during the preceding 30 days: 77.3% for cigar smokers, 76.9% for cigarette smokers, 63.4% for smokeless tobacco users, and 54.8% for e-cigarettes users. Preventing youths from initiating the use of any tobacco product is important to tobacco use prevention and control strategies in the United States. Monitoring the frequency and patterns of tobacco use among youths, including the use of two or more tobacco products, is important to inform evidence-based interventions to prevent and reduce all forms of tobacco use among youths.

### Characteristics of school campuses and physical activity among youth [^951a1140]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research suggests that school characteristics may influence physical activity. However, few studies have examined associations between school building and campus characteristics and objective measures of physical activity among middle school students.

Methods

Students from ten middle schools (n = 248, 42% female, mean age 13.7 years) wore TriTrac-R3D accelerometers in 1997 recording measures of minute-by-minute physical movements during the school day that were then averaged over 15-minute intervals (n = 16,619) and log-transformed. School characteristics, including school campus area, play area, and building area (per student) were assessed retrospectively in 2004–2005 using land-use parcel data, site visits, ortho-photos, architectural plans, and site maps. In 2006, linear mixed models using SAS PROC MIXED were fit to examine associations between school environmental variables and physical activity, controlling for potentially confounding variables.

Results

Area per enrolled student ranged from 8.8 to 143.7 m2 for school campuses, from 12.1 to 24.7 m2 for buildings, and from 0.4 to 58.9 m2 for play areas. Play area comprised from 3% to 62% of total campus area across schools. In separate regression models, school campus area per student (beta = 0.2244, p < 0.0001); building area per student (beta = 2.1302, p < 0.02); and play area per student (beta = 0.347, p < 0.0001) were each directly associated with log-TriTrac-R3D vector magnitude. Given the range of area density measures in this sample of schools, this translates into an approximate 20% to 30% increase in average vector magnitude, or walking 2 extra miles over the course of a week.

Conclusions

Larger school campuses, school buildings, and play areas (per enrolled student) are associated with higher levels of physical activity in middle school students.

### 'Physical activity 4 everyone' school-based intervention to prevent decline in adolescent physical activity levels: 12 month (mid-intervention) report on a cluster randomised trial [^fd2213dd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Participation in adequate physical activity has numerous physical and psychological health benefits. Despite this, the proportion of adolescents who are adequately active is consistently low, with as few as 20% meeting physical activity guidelines of 60 min MVPA per day. International data indicate a significant inverse association between physical activity and socioeconomic status (SES), with adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds experiencing a steeper decline in physical activity. As physical inactivity tends to track into adulthood, reducing this decline is a public health priority.

Schools provide access to almost all adolescents over extended periods of time. Schools have qualified staff such as physical education (PE) teachers, resources including sporting equipment and facilities, and a mandate to implement curriculum that promotes physical activity. Based on a number of systematic reviews, there is evidence that school-based interventions are effective in increasing the proportion of students who are physically active, the length of time spent being active, and student fitness levels. However, such evidence is primarily focused on children of elementary school age (5–12 years), with very few studies focusing on adolescents.

Systematic reviews of physical activity interventions for children and adolescentsconclude that interventions were more likely to be successful if they were multicomponent, longer in duration and based on theory. Such reviews recommended that future trials include the use of an objective measure of physical activity, measurement of total daily physical activity, use clear intervention implementation strategies, focus on low-socioeconomic groups, focus on interventions targeting adolescents, have an intervention duration spanning greater than 12 months, and employ longer follow-up.

Of the fourteen interventions targeting school-based physical activity in adolescents, only five studies have specifically targeted disadvantaged secondary school students. Of these, three have tested single sex interventions, and the studies did not demonstrate a positive intervention effect on physical activity. The two remaining intervention trials both used an objective measure of physical activity and were able to demonstrate an intervention effect. However, both interventions were of short duration, 17 weeksand 6 months, respectively.

Given the limited number of effective interventions targeting greater physical activity among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds, the primary aim of this study was to report on the 12-month, mid-intervention impact of a 2-year multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools, which aimed to reduce the decline in physical activity associated with adolescence. Subgroup analyses for sex, baseline weight status and baseline activity level are also reported.

### Using health data to highlight milestones: a cookbook for non-profit program managers [^a7bd6081]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Secondhand smoke and cigarette smoking prevalence in Georgia — Tobacco smoke is both a cause and a trigger for asthma, and nationally only 32% of households with smokers have adopted smoke-free policies in the home. In Georgia, approximately 63% of middle school students with asthma and 68% of high school students with asthma are exposed to secondhand smoke. Cigarette smoking prevalence in Georgia by age group shows middle school students 19,000 (5%), high school students 72,000 (17%), and adults 1.4 million (20%). The legal age to purchase tobacco products in Georgia is 18 years old.

### Notes from the field: use of electronic cigarettes and any tobacco product among middle and high school students-United States, 2011–2018 [^b7abc59e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-powered devices that provide nicotine and other additives to the user in the form of an aerosol. E-cigarettes entered the U.S. marketplace in 2007, and by 2014, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product among U.S. youths. Data from the 2011–2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), a cross-sectional, voluntary, school-based, self-administered, pencil-and-paper survey of U.S. middle and high school students, were analyzed to determine the prevalence of current use (≥ 1 day in past 30 days) of e-cigarettes, * current use of any tobacco product, † frequency of (number of days during the preceding 30 days) e-cigarette use, and current use (any time during preceding 30 days) of any flavored e-cigarettes among U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students. Logistic regression (2011–2018) and t-tests (2017–2018) were performed to determine statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).

Among high school students, current e-cigarette use increased from 1.5% (220,000 students) in 2011 to 20.8% (3.05 million students) in 2018 (p < 0.001) (Figure). During 2017–2018, current e-cigarette use increased by 78% (from 11.7% to 20.8%, p < 0.001). The proportion of current e-cigarette users who reported use on ≥ 20 of the past 30 days increased from 20.0% in 2017 to 27.7% in 2018 (p = 0.008). Among high school students, during 2017–2018, current use of any flavored e-cigarettes increased among current e-cigarette users (from 60.9% to 67.8%, p = 0.02); current use of menthol- or mint-flavored e-cigarettes increased among all current e-cigarette users (from 42.3% to 51.2%, p = 0.04) and current exclusive e-cigarette users (from 21.4% to 38.1%, p = 0.002).

### Tobacco use among middle and high school students… [^12b538ca]. CDC (2015). Low credibility.

Of 258 schools selected for the 2014 NYTS, 207 participated, with a sample of 22, 007 among 24, 084 eligible students; the overall response rate was 73. 3%. Sample sizes and overall response rates for 2011, 2012, and 2013 were 18, 866, 24, 658, and 18, 406, respectively. * A p-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. SAS-Callable SUDAAN was used for analysis. Among high school non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, †† and persons of non-Hispanic other races, e-cigarettes were the most used product, whereas among non-Hispanic blacks, cigars were used most commonly. Current use of any tobacco and ≥ 2 tobacco products among middle school students was 7. 7% and
3. 1%, respectively. Among middle school students, similar trends were observed during 2011–2014. A statistically significant linear decrease was observed only in middle school students currently using ≥ 2 tobacco products. In 2014, an estimated 4.

6 million middle and high school students currently used any tobacco product, of which an estimated
2. 2 million students currently used ≥ 2 tobacco products. Of current tobacco users, 2. 4 million used e-cigarettes and

1. 6 million used hookahs. From 2013 to 2014, substantial increases also were observed for current hookah use, with prevalence almost doubling for high school students from 5. 2% to
9. 4% and for middle school students from 1. 1% to
2. 5% over this period. In 2014, an estimated 4. 6 million youths, including
3. 7 million high school and 900, 000 middle school students, reported current use of any tobacco product. From 2011 to 2014, statistically significant increases were observed in e-cigarette and hookah use among high school and middle school students, while statistically significant decreases were observed in the use of cigarettes, cigars, tobacco pipes, bidis, and snus.

### Change in weight and adiposity in college students: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^41d2980c]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess changes in body weight and relative adiposity (%FAT) during college and identify potential moderating variables.

Evidence Acquisition

A review of peer-reviewed articles published before June 28, 2013 identified 49 studies evaluating the effect of the first year of college on the dependent variables of body weight (137 effects from 48 studies) and %FAT (48 effects from 19 studies). Statistical analysis was conducted between July 1, 2013, and May 1, 2014. Effect sizes were calculated by subtracting the mean pre-test measurements from the mean post-test measurements.

Evidence Synthesis

Participants' weight increased 1.55 kg (95% CI = 1.3, 1.8 kg) during college, with a 1.17% increase in %FAT (95% CI = 0.7, 1.6%). Meta-regression analysis concluded that changes in body weight and %FAT were positively associated with study duration, suggesting that effects measuring change over a longer duration yielded larger effects when compared to effects with shorter observations. Sex and baseline BMI were not associated with change in weight or %FAT after accounting for study duration.

Conclusions

The increase in weight and %FAT during the college years is equal to 1.55 kg and 1.17%, respectively. Change in body weight during the first year of college is significantly less than that during the cumulative remaining years of college. By understanding the magnitude of change, appropriate prevention efforts can be designed for the college population, which may be beneficial in reducing adult overweight and obesity rates.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^77ed6480]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Population proportions of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people — school- and survey-based estimates in youth and comparative adult ranges — show low single-digit prevalence that varies by definition. Reported estimates include 1.9% TGD overall (0.7% transgender; 1.2% nonbinary) using a three-question instrument; among high school surveys, 1.2% TGD and 2.5% unsure in over 8,000 New Zealand students, 2.7% TGD in nearly 81,000 Minnesota students, and in the 2017 US Youth Risk Behavior Survey 1.8% "Yes, I am transgender" and 1.6% "I am not sure if I am transgender" among nearly 120,000 participants. A 2015 Florida/California survey of just over 6,000 grades 9–12 students using a "high gender-nonconforming" definition reported 13% among assigned male at birth (AMAB) students, 4% among assigned female at birth (AFAB) students, and 8.4% overall. In younger students from San Francisco public middle schools (grades 6–8; age 11–13 years), 2,700 were surveyed, Thirty-three self-identified as TGD, and the resulting proportion was 1.3%. Across study designs, health system–based studies using diagnostic codes report markedly smaller proportions than survey-based findings, and when surveys ask specifically about "transgender" identity, estimates range 0.3% to 0.5% among adults and 1.2% to 2.7% in children/adolescents, whereas broader gender diversity definitions yield higher proportions of 0.5% to 4.5% among adults and 2.5% to 8.4% among children/adolescents.

### A prevention program for multiple health-compromising behaviors in adolescence: baseline results from a cluster randomized controlled trial [^93aa42a9]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the design and present the baseline findings of the evaluation study of 'Paesaggi di Prevenzione', a school-based prevention program tackling smoking, alcohol misuse, dietary risks, and physical inactivity in 12- to 14-year-olds.

Methods

The program was implemented from January 2011 to April 2012 in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and comprised classroom activities and school-wide policies. A two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial was designed. Schools were the units of randomization and were matched by socioeconomic status, size, and type.

Results

Data from 4700 middle school students and 2952 high school students were collected anonymously from October to December 2010. Past-30-day smoking prevalence was 1.9% among middle school students and 20.8% among high school students. Past-30-day prevalence of alcohol intoxication was 2.2% among middle school students and 11.4% among high school students. A total of 39.7% of middle school students and 48.0% of high school students drank sugar-sweetened beverages four or more times per week; 7.5% of middle school students and 7.1% of high school students had intense physical activity every day.

Conclusions

This study seems adequately powered and baseline variables appear evenly distributed between study groups. Findings are in line with those of the WHO Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children study.

### Evaluation of a two-year middle-school physical education intervention: M-SPAN [^2e482240]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

School physical education (PE) is highly recommended as a means of promoting physical activity, and randomized studies of health-related PE interventions in middle schools have not been reported. We developed, implemented, and assessed an intervention to increase physical activity during middle-school PE classes.

Methods

Twenty-four middle schools (approximately 25,000 students, 45% nonwhite) in Southern California participated in a randomized trial. Schools were assigned to intervention (N = 12) or control (N = 12) conditions, and school was the unit of analysis. A major component of the intervention was a 2-yr PE program, which consisted of curricular materials, staff development, and on-site follow-up. Control schools continued usual programs. Student activity and lesson context were observed in 1849 PE lessons using a validated instrument during baseline and intervention years 1 and 2.

Results

The intervention significantly (P = 0.02) improved student moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in PE, by approximately 3 min per lesson. Effects were cumulative; by year 2 intervention schools increased MVPA by 18%. Effect sizes were greater for boys (d = 0.98; large) than girls (d = 0.68; medium).

Conclusions

A standardized program increased MVPA in middle schools without requiring an increase in frequency or duration of PE lessons. Program components were well received by teachers and have the potential for generalization to other schools. Additional strategies may be needed for girls.

### Body composition changes during the first two years of university [^464aff47]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Changes in body weight, composition, and shape were investigated in male and female college students between the freshman and sophomore years.

Methods

Changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), percent and absolute body fat and fat-free mass (via bioelectrical impedance), and waist circumference (via body scans) were assessed over the freshman and sophomore years (2007–2009) among 120 students attending a Southern public university.

Results

Weight (2.5 and 1.7 lbs) and BMI gains (0.3 and 0.3 kg/m(2)) did not significantly differ between the freshman and sophomore years, respectively. Significantly more percent body fat and fat mass were gained during the freshman (1.9% and 3.3 lbs, respectively) than the sophomore year (0.0% and 0.6 lbs, respectively). Females lost significantly more fat-free mass during the freshman (-0.8 lb) than during the sophomore year (1.0 lb). Changes in waist circumference and weight were significantly correlated. Increases in the percentages of females classified as overweight and with unhealthy body fat amounts and waist circumferences were observed.

Conclusion

While the sophomore year was characterized by slightly healthier body composition changes than the freshman year, the gains in weight, fat mass, and waist circumference measurements suggest increased health risks for many college females.

### Iranian university students lifestyle and health status survey: study profile [^e4edc2cf]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The physical health assessment of university students in Iran is a national large scale assessment examining health behaviors among tertiary education students. Understanding risky health behaviors which are the major sources of global mortality and morbidity in adulthood is the key objective of this assessment.

Methods

In academic year of 2012–2013, newly admitted students (N = 151,671) at 74 governmental eligible universities that had health center from 28 provinces were invited to participate in the health assessment program. The physical health behaviors of the students were evaluated by using questionnaire. The test-retest reliability method was applied to estimate the reliability of physical health questionnaire. After filling out the questionnaires, students were led to the examination room for the measurement of height, weight and blood pressure.

Results

From the total study population, 84,298 student's ages between 18 and 29 years old, were participated in the health assessment. The mean response proportion was 63%. The mean age of students was 21.5 ± 4.01, with 49.20% percent being < 20 years old. 32.31% were between 20 and 24 years, 13.44% between 25 and 29 years, 69% of the participants were undergraduate 34.9% were master's students, and 2.9% were Ph.D. students. The mean BMI for total students was 22.5 ± 4.0 and regarding to gender, the mean BMI for male and female were 23.0 ± 4.1 and 22.2 ± 3.8 respectively.

Conclusion

Analysis of student's findings will generate multiple studies which report different aspects of physical health of Iranian university students who constitute a large proportion of young adult aged 18–29 years in the country. This assessment also provides opportunity to compare Iranian student's behavioral patterns with the behavioral pattern of students worldwide.

### Estimates of energy intake, requirements and imbalances based on anthropometric measurements at global, regional and national levels and for sociodemographic groups: a modelling study [^700d4c6f]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The data on physical activity were sourced from a global pooling analysis of surveys on physical inactivity among adults and adolescents commissioned by the WHO. The estimates of physical inactivity cover the years 2001–2016 and 2000–2022 and were derived from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries including 1.6 million students aged 11–17 years for adolescents, and from 507 surveys across 163 countries including 5.7 million participants for adults. The estimates were made for the prevalence of physical inactivity as defined by the WHO, and in line with the NAS classification, as doing less than 60 min of daily physical activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity for adolescents, and doing less than 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week for adults. In the absence of more detailed data, we assumed that the prevalence of physical inactivity among adolescents is indicative of physical inactivity among children, and that those who are not physically inactive can be classified as 'active' on average, which corresponds to the middle active category. Lastly, we adopted urban–rural splits in physical activity by income region from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study based on data from 698 communities across 22 countries. The online supplemental tables 11 and 12 provide an overview of the data on physical inactivity.

To calculate energy imbalances, we subtracted the energy requirements to sustain measured levels of body weights, height and physical activity from the energy requirements to sustain healthy body weights. We estimated healthy body weights by using the estimates of body height together with recommended values of BMI which are calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared. In line with WHO recommendations, we used the BMI category of normal weight (18.5–25 kg/m 2) with a midpoint of 21.75 kg/m 2 as recommended BMI in adults, which is also in line with values that minimise mortality risks in epidemiological cohort studies. For children and adolescents, we used growth reference data provided by the WHO, including recommended levels of BMI, weight and height for age. The online supplemental tables 9 and 10 provide an overview of the growth standards used.
