## Question

One-lung ventilation strategy in thoracic anesthesia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about one-lung ventilation strategy in thoracic anesthesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of one-lung ventilation and how it drives ventilator-induced lung injury. Then, I should verify the core components of a lung-protective strategy, including tidal volume, PEEP, driving pressure, and recruitment. Next, I will examine oxygenation targets and FiO2 titration, followed by ventilator mode selection. After that, I need to review device selection for lung isolation and hypoxemia management. I will then consider special populations and evolving strategies like nonintubated VATS. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, individualized algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and controversies, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiological context of one-lung ventilation, because strategy hinges on it. During OLV, the nondependent lung collapses, increasing intrapulmonary shunt and impairing oxygenation, while the dependent lung is compressed by mediastinal and diaphragmatic weight, predisposing to atelectasis and cyclic opening/closing injury; surgical manipulation and re-expansion of the collapsed lung add atelectrauma and biotrauma, creating a multiple-hit model of ventilator-induced lung injury that is distinct from ARDS but mechanistically related, so I need to ensure protective principles are adapted thoughtfully rather than copied wholesale from ARDS care [^117Ga3Em] [^113k37gh] [^11258yzm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tidal volume. I should verify the evidence. Low tidal volume is a cornerstone, but the optimal target during OLV is debated, with ranges of 4–6 mL/kg versus 6–8 mL/kg PBW appearing in trials and surveys. Meta-analytic data suggest low tidal volume reduces airway pressures and may reduce postoperative infiltrates, yet oxygenation can transiently worsen, and low VT without adequate PEEP fails to reduce complications, so I need to pair VT with appropriate PEEP and recruitment rather than use VT in isolation [^115s6yLe] [^1171L2bN] [^114mr8oA] [^116SmY3W].

> Wait, let me verify the role of PEEP and recruitment, because this is where individualized strategies matter. Fixed PEEP around 5 cm H2O is commonly used, but individualized PEEP titration after a recruitment maneuver improves compliance, oxygenation, and reduces driving pressure; the open-lung approach with a recruitment to about 40 cm H2O followed by decremental PEEP titration to best compliance has been shown in a large multicenter RCT to reduce severe postoperative pulmonary complications compared with standard protective ventilation, and a meta-analysis of individualized PEEP supports fewer PPCs and better mechanics, though I should acknowledge that some physiologic studies used surrogate outcomes and that recruitment carries rare but serious risks, so I need to balance benefit and hemodynamic tolerance carefully [^115ET7xq] [^113NjFty] [^113Hik7X] [^116cAPFo].

> I need to check the role of driving pressure as a unifying target. Retrospective and prospective data in thoracic surgery indicate that minimizing driving pressure, defined as plateau pressure minus PEEP, better predicts postoperative pulmonary complications than VT or plateau alone; a randomized trial showed that driving pressure–guided ventilation with individualized PEEP reduced pneumonia or ARDS compared with conventional protective settings, reinforcing that ΔP is a practical, patient-specific endpoint to titrate PEEP and VT while respecting plateau limits [^114GQ7F1] [^1171L2bN].

> Let me consider oxygenation and FiO2, because this is often where harm is inadvertently introduced. High FiO2 facilitates oxygenation but promotes absorption atelectasis and oxidative injury; observational and interventional data suggest higher FiO2 during OLV associates with more PPCs, and ORI-guided titration has not consistently reduced overall FiO2 exposure, so I should start FiO2 at 0.8–1.0 for induction of collapse and then titrate down as soon as feasible to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90–94% and PaO2 ≥ 60 mmHg, accepting mild hypercapnia if needed to limit oxygen toxicity, while remembering that adjuncts like inhaled PGE1 can improve V/Q matching and allow lower FiO2 in selected patients [^114oYQgC] [^1179VG2n] [^1124zuoS] [^115BEvBU].

> Next, I should review ventilator mode, and I must be careful not to overstate differences. Pressure-controlled ventilation tends to yield lower peak airway pressures than volume-controlled ventilation without consistent differences in oxygenation or major outcomes, and a large randomized trial found no difference in PPCs among VCV, PCV, and PCV-VG during OLV; thus, mode selection should prioritize adherence to protective parameters and clinician familiarity rather than mode per se, with dual-control modes offering theoretical advantages but lacking outcome data to mandate their use [^1145sZAU] [^112RQ9ZY] [^114eAAkU] [^1162VG4X].

> I will now examine lung isolation devices, because device choice affects both safety and efficiency. Double-lumen tubes remain the most widely used first-line devices globally due to speed of placement, stability, and ability to suction and apply CPAP, but bronchial blockers are invaluable for difficult airways, tracheostomy, or when postoperative ventilation is anticipated; randomized and observational data show broadly similar collapse quality with either approach when properly positioned, so device selection should be individualized to airway anatomy, procedural needs, and team expertise [^116yGZJ5] [^112D9uDF] [^115VYDdJ].

> But wait, what if hypoxemia occurs during OLV? I should double-check the escalation sequence. First, I need to verify tube or blocker position with bronchoscopy, clear secretions, and ensure adequate cardiac output; then apply CPAP 5–10 cm H2O to the nondependent lung if surgical exposure permits, increase FiO2 judiciously, and perform a recruitment maneuver to the dependent lung if oxygenation remains inadequate; if refractory, consider differential lung ventilation or, in extreme cases, temporary two-lung ventilation, while continuously reassessing hemodynamics and shunt physiology to avoid overcorrection that worsens V/Q mismatch [^11258yzm] [^113duDxj] [^116mhgjY].

> Let me think about special populations, because one size does not fit all. In obesity, chest wall mechanics alter transpulmonary pressure, so individualized PEEP guided by compliance or driving pressure may be more appropriate than fixed low PEEP. In COPD, I should avoid dynamic hyperinflation and consider permissive hypercapnia with careful plateau pressure limits. In pediatrics, small-airway physiology and equipment constraints demand meticulous device sizing and gentler ventilatory targets. In lung transplantation, consensus recommends low tidal volumes, recruitment, and adequate PEEP while closely monitoring right ventricular interactions and graft mechanics, reflecting the high stakes of injurious ventilation in this population [^112G9Vn6] [^116L3ASt] [^1161CEqq] [^116Y8j6W].

> Hold on, I should verify evolving strategies that might reduce ventilator-induced injury altogether. Nonintubated VATS with spontaneous ventilation avoids OLV and its mechanical stressors in selected patients and procedures, showing signals for faster recovery and fewer ventilation-related complications, but it requires stringent patient selection, vigilant airway management, and a skilled team. Thus, it is a promising adjunct rather than a universal replacement for OLV [^111EzmJ2] [^114Vsa4E] [^112aHdHh].

> I need to ensure the practical algorithm I synthesize is coherent and evidence-aligned. Start with a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker based on airway and procedural factors, initiate OLV with VT 6 mL/kg PBW and PEEP 5 cm H2O while targeting plateau pressure under 30 cm H2O, perform an alveolar recruitment maneuver early, then individualize PEEP to minimize driving pressure and optimize compliance, titrate FiO2 down from 1.0 to the lowest level that maintains SpO2 ≥ 90–94%, monitor for hypoxemia with a low threshold to check position and apply CPAP or recruitment, and transition back to two-lung ventilation with a protective strategy and early extubation when feasible, adjusting for patient-specific risks like obesity or COPD throughout [^115ET7xq] [^114GQ7F1] [^114oYQgC] [^11258yzm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also flag controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. Large observational analyses have not consistently shown that low tidal volume alone reduces PPCs without adequate PEEP, and a multicenter RCT found no difference between lower and higher tidal volume strategies when both included PEEP and recruitment, underscoring that the bundle matters more than any single parameter. Ongoing debates include the optimal PEEP titration method, the true lower limit of safe FiO2 during OLV, and the net benefit of routine recruitment in all patients given rare but serious harms, so shared decision-making and continuous reassessment remain essential [^114mr8oA] [^111zsxLk] [^113NjFty] [^116cAPFo].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most defensible OLV strategy is an individualized, open-lung protective approach that pairs low tidal volume with adequate PEEP, minimizes driving pressure, uses recruitment selectively, and titrates FiO2 as low as safely possible, while tailoring device choice and rescue steps to patient and procedural context. This synthesis aligns with contemporary randomized evidence and expert consensus and provides a pragmatic framework to navigate the remaining uncertainties in thoracic anesthesia practice [^115ET7xq] [^114GQ7F1] [^116yGZJ5].

A lung-protective one-lung ventilation strategy uses **low tidal volume (4–6 mL/kg PBW)** [^115s6yLe] with **PEEP 5–8 cm H2O** [^113NjFty] and **plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O** [^11126DdD] to minimize VILI, atelectasis, and PPCs [^115ET7xq]. Individualized PEEP [^113NjFty] and **driving pressure minimization** [^114GQ7F1] further improve oxygenation and reduce complications. Use the lowest FiO2 to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^114oYQgC] [^1179VG2n], and apply recruitment maneuvers as needed [^116mhgjY]. Ventilation mode (VCV vs PCV) does not significantly affect outcomes [^1145sZAU]; choose based on clinical context and team preference [^112G9Vn6].

## Physiological rationale for lung-protective ventilation during OLV

OLV creates a **shunt in the non-ventilated lung** [^11258yzm] and increases the risk of VILI in the ventilated lung from high volumes, pressures, and cyclic atelectasis [^114ifxqx]. Lung-protective strategies aim to:

- **Reduce VILI**: Minimize barotrauma, volutrauma, and atelectrauma [^113Hik7X].
- **Improve oxygenation**: Optimize V/Q matching and shunt fraction [^11258yzm].
- **Decrease PPCs**: Lower incidence of atelectasis, pneumonia, and ARDS [^112FiS7c].

---

## Key components of lung-protective OLV strategy

| **Parameter** | **Recommended setting** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Tidal volume (VT) | 4–6 mL/kg PBW | Reduces volutrauma and barotrauma [^115s6yLe] [^11126DdD] |
| Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) | 5–8 cm H2O | Prevents atelectasis, improves compliance, reduces shunt [^113NjFty] |
| Plateau pressure (Pplat) | ≤ 30 cm H2O | Limits barotrauma and volutrauma [^11126DdD] |
| Driving pressure (ΔP) | ≤ 14 cm H2O | Strong predictor of PPCs; minimize when possible [^114GQ7F1] [^115uTeTw] |
| Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) | Lowest to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% | Reduces oxidative stress and atelectasis [^114oYQgC] [^112HZVmE] |
| Respiratory rate (RR) | 12–16 breaths/min | Maintain normocapnia, avoid hypercapnia [^112RQ9ZY] |
| Recruitment maneuvers (RMs) | As needed (e.g. 40 cm H2O for 10 s) | Reopens collapsed alveoli, improves oxygenation [^116mhgjY] [^115ET7xq] |

## Evidence supporting lung-protective ventilation during OLV

- **Low tidal volume**: Meta-analysis shows low VT reduces airway pressures and PPCs, with preserved postoperative oxygenation [^115s6yLe].
- **PEEP and recruitment**: Individualized PEEP and RMs improve oxygenation and mechanics without hemodynamic compromise [^113NjFty] [^116mhgjY].
- **Driving pressure**: Minimizing ΔP reduces PPCs; ΔP is a key modifiable target [^114GQ7F1] [^115uTeTw].
- **FiO2 titration**: Lower FiO2 reduces oxidative stress and atelectasis; titrate to SpO2 ≥ 90% [^112vbCg2] [^115cmcpt].

---

## Ventilation modes and their impact on outcomes

VCV, PCV, and PCV-VG are acceptable; **no mode consistently outperforms others** for PPCs or oxygenation [^1145sZAU] [^114eAAkU]. Mode selection should be guided by clinical context, team familiarity, and patient factors [^notfound].

---

## Individualized ventilation strategies

Individualized strategies tailor PEEP, recruitment, and FiO2 to patient-specific mechanics and gas exchange, and **individualized PEEP** improves oxygenation and compliance and reduces PPCs [^113NjFty] [^115ET7xq]. Driving pressure-guided ventilation further reduces PPCs by targeting the lowest feasible ΔP [^114GQ7F1].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

- **Hypoxemia**: Low VT and high PEEP can worsen shunt; monitor closely and adjust [^notfound].
- **Hypercapnia**: Permissive hypercapnia is generally safe but may not suit all patients [^1174B2pM].
- **Recruitment maneuvers**: Rare barotrauma or hemodynamic compromise; use judiciously [^1174B2pM].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **VT**: 4–6 mL/kg PBW.
- **PEEP**: 5–8 cm H2O, individualized.
- **Pplat**: ≤ 30 cm H2O.
- **ΔP**: ≤ 14 cm H2O.
- **FiO2**: Lowest to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%.
- **RMs**: As needed.
- **Mode**: VCV, PCV, or PCV-VG based on context.

---

A lung-protective OLV strategy with low VT, appropriate PEEP, controlled plateau and driving pressures, conservative FiO2, and selective recruitment reduces VILI and PPCs; **individualization and hemodynamic vigilance are essential** [^115ET7xq] [^112FiS7c].

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilatory management — key guideline recommendations are as follows: The recommendations for the following interventions for the treatment of ARDS are strong: mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) with lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) and prone positioning for more than 12 h/d in severe ARDS, each with stated confidence in effect estimates; the recommendation against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in patients with moderate or severe ARDS is strong; the recommendation for higher positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with moderate or severe ARDS and for recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate or severe ARDS is conditional, with the listed confidence ratings; and additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

### ISHLT consensus statement on the perioperative use of ECLS in lung transplantation: part III: postoperative considerations [^111v8dRe]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Analgesia strategies and thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in ECLS after lung transplantation emphasize risk factors, benefits, and limitations. Acute and chronic postoperative pain have a high incidence and are associated with a worsened postoperative course, with recipient risk factors including preoperative opioid-dependent chronic pain and psychiatric comorbidities and surgical sources such as incisions, tubes, and ECMO cannulae. TEA is the gold standard after lung transplantation but has not been well-studied in patients requiring ECLS; reported benefits include improved pain control, graft function, extubation times, and reduced ICU length of stay, and one observational study found improved analgesia without differences in CPB, PGD, length of mechanical ventilation, or adverse pulmonary events versus postoperative TEA. Patients with coagulopathy or likely postoperative ECMO dependence are not good TEA candidates due to risks including epidural hematoma and hemodynamic challenges. Non-catheter regional techniques (bilateral paravertebral blocks, multi-level intercostal nerve blocks, thoracic fascial plane blocks, cryoablation of intercostal nerves) have shown some benefit, but their efficacy has not been directly compared to TEA and clinical trials are lacking; if anticoagulation and ECLS is ongoing, these techniques are reasonable to consider, however, we recommend placement only within appropriate regional anesthesia coagulation guidelines.

Over the 90 years since the first description of one-lung ventilation, the practice of thoracic surgery and anaesthesia continues to develop. Minimally invasive surgical techniques are increasingly being used to minimise the surgical insult and facilitate improved outcomes. Challenging these outcomes, however, are parallel changes in patient characteristics with more older and sicker patients undergoing surgery. Thoracic anaesthesia as a speciality continues to respond to these challenges with evolution of practice and strong academic performance.

### Lung isolation in the patient with a difficult airway [^116yGZJ5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

One-lung ventilation is routinely used to facilitate exposure for thoracic surgical procedures and can be achieved via several lung isolation techniques. The optimal method for lung isolation depends on a number of factors that include (1) the indication for lung isolation, (2) anatomic features of the upper and lower airway, (3) availability of equipment and devices, and (4) the anesthesiologist's proficiency and preferences. Though double-lumen endobronchial tubes (DLTs) are most commonly utilized to achieve lung isolation, the use of endobronchial blockers offer advantages in patients with challenging airway anatomy. Anesthesiologists should be familiar with existing alternatives to the DLT for lung isolation and alternative techniques for DLT placement in the patient with a difficult airway. Newer technologies such as videolaryngoscopy with or without adjunctive fiberoptic bronchoscopy may facilitate intubation and lung isolation in difficult airway management.

### Lung separation and the difficult airway [^1111NnGR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Selective collapse of a lung and one-lung ventilation (OLV) is now performed for most thoracic surgical procedures. Modern double-lumen endobronchial tubes and bronchial blockers have made lung separation safe and relatively easy to achieve. However, OLV in the patient with a 'difficult airway' can present a challenge to the anaesthesiologist. This review considers the different techniques used to achieve lung separation and their application to the patient with a difficult airway.

### Thoracic anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic: 2021 updated recommendations by the European association of cardiothoracic anaesthesiology and intensive care (EACTAIC) thoracic subspecialty committee [^112FBpHg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has radically changed the landscape of normal surgical practice. Lifesaving cancer surgery, however, remains a clinical priority, and there is an increasing need to fully define the optimal oncologic management of patients with varying stages of lung cancer, allowing prioritization of which thoracic procedures should be performed in the current era. Healthcare providers and managers should not ignore the risk of a bimodal peak of mortality in patients with lung cancer; an imminent spike due to mortality from acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and a secondary peak reflecting an excess of cancer-related mortality among patients whose treatments were deemed less urgent, delayed, or cancelled. The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Thoracic Anesthesia Subspecialty group has considered these challenges and developed an updated set of expert recommendations concerning the infectious period, timing of surgery, vaccination, preoperative screening and evaluation, airway management, and ventilation of thoracic surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^113gFKxk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

There was a total of 367 registered anesthesiologists in the 16 participated hospitals across the four cardinal regions of Taiwan, and 71 of these anesthesia specialists (19.3%) were on regular thoracic anesthesia service for at least two working days a week (which we defined as thoracic anesthesiologists). The response rate of this study was 95.8%, as there were three participants did not complete the second part of survey form. Table 1 shows the general information of the anesthesia care standard for thoracic surgery in each institute. Eight of these hospitals (50%) undertake more than 1000 thoracic surgeries each year (Table 1). Double-lumen endotracheal tube is the first-choice airway device (93.8%) for intraoperative lung separation, and most of the institutes employ intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) as the first-line pain control method after thoracic surgery (Table 1). Arterial catheterization is the standard intraoperative invasive hemodynamic monitoring system recommended for thoracic surgery, and 87.5% of institutes routinely apply bispectral index (BIS) for the monitoring of anesthetic depth (Table 1).

### Awake thoracic surgery for lung cancer treatment: where we are and future perspectives-our experience and review of literature [^115XZhcF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and the first by incidence and non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 80–85% of all lung cancer. Only the 25–30% of diagnosed NSCLC can be treated with a surgical intervention and nowadays minimally invasive thoracic surgery (VATS and RATS) has become the preferred procedure, with shorter length of hospital stay and lesser post-operative pain. Intubated anaesthesia with one-lung mechanical ventilation (MV) is still considered the gold standard for airway control in these kinds of interventions. However, it is now well known that general anaesthesia and one-lung mechanical ventilation carry their own risk. Indeed, some studies reported a 4% of ventilation-related lung injury after major lung resections performed under one-lung MV and a post-operative mortality rate of 25% after this anaesthesia technique. In 1997, Nezu et al. for the first time showed the perioperative outcomes of lung wedge resection for blebs in non-intubated patients, reporting a shorter hospital stay and a non-inferiority of this technique compared with VATS with one-lung ventilation for simple procedures. Since then, this technique has been used for other conditions such as pneumothorax, empyema, malignant pleural effusions and finally lung resections. Thus, in 2004 Pompeo et al. showed the results of the first randomized controlled trial in which they compared 30 patients who underwent a diagnostic wedge resection of pulmonary nodules with an "awake" technique, with sole thoracic epidural anaesthesia, with a control group of 30 pts who underwent the same intervention in MV with a double-lumen tube and one-lung ventilation. They did not report statistically significant differences with a shorter hospital stay in the awake group (2 days vs. 3 days, P = 0.02), demonstrating the feasibility of the awake technique in lung resections. Following this important study, in 2007 Al-Abdullatief et al. reported for the first time the results of major thoracic resection in 79 patients in awake anaesthesia, including 25 thymectomy (two of these with sternotomy) and 11 major lung resections for NSCLC, concluding that this is a feasible technique also for these major resections with lesser post-operative complications, less need of post-operative intensive care unit (ICU) admission (5/79 pts, 6%) and a shorter hospital stay (1.5 days median).

### Impact of low tidal volumes during one-lung ventilation. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115s6yLe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The link between ventilation strategies and perioperative outcomes remains one of the fundamental paradigms of thoracic anaesthesia. During one-lung ventilation (OLV), one lung is excluded from gas exchange and ventilation is directed at the dependent lung. The authors hypothesised that the use of low tidal volumes (V T) during OLV provides adequate gas exchange and improves postoperative outcome.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.

Setting

Thoracic surgery.

Participants

Patients undergoing OLV.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The authors performed a meta-analysis of all randomized trials on low versus high V T during OLV in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Outcomes of the study were gas exchange and airway pressures during and after OLV, postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), and hospital stay (HLOS). Fourteen randomized trials were selected, but only a few of them contained one outcome of interest. Low V T was associated with lower arterial oxygen tension, lower airway pressures, and higher arterial carbon dioxide tension at specific time points during OLV. Low V T was associated with preserved gas exchange after OLV, lower incidence of pulmonary infiltrations, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Incidences of PPCs and HLOS were similar.

Conclusions

The use of low V T reduces airway pressure but worsens gas exchange during OLV. Preservation of postoperative oxygenation and reduction in infiltrates suggest a lung-protective modality with no demonstrable impact on PPCs and HLOS.

### Nonintubated versus intubated "one-stage" preoperative localization and thoracoscopic lung resection [^114Vsa4E]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

For highly suspicious small pulmonary nodules seen on CT scan, surgical excision can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Owing to the small size, a conventional bronchoscopic or CT-guided biopsy may be nondiagnostic or superfluous. Furthermore, surgical resection is the most appropriate treatment for small early-stage lung cancer in many cases. A recent nationwide study suggested that sublobar resection may be associated with longer survival compared with radiation therapy or ablation in patients with early-stage lung cancer. From the surgeon's perspective, it is mandatory to increase the efficacy and decrease the potential impact of surgical interventions on the patient's physical status. Our approach combines key innovations in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, including nonintubated anesthesia, optimized "one-stage" workflow, and uniportal VATS, to minimize overall surgical trauma and enhance postoperative recovery.

Uniportal VATS has been reported to be a safe and feasible approach for lung resection, with potential additional benefits of reduced surgical trauma and faster recovery. In addition to uniportal VATS, nonintubated anesthesia is another method to reduce surgical stress and make minimally invasive thoracic surgery even less invasive. Since Pompeo and colleagues first proposed thoracoscopic resection of pulmonary nodules by awake VATS without endotracheal intubation in 2004, nonintubated VATS has been increasingly used in a wide range of thoracic procedures. The major benefit of nonintubated anesthesia is the avoidance of intubation-related complications (eg, sore throat, airway injury) and side effects caused by general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation (eg, ventilation-related lung injury and postoperative vomiting and nausea). In a recent meta-analysis, nonintubated VATS was associated with less anesthesia time, chest pain, and chest tube indwelling time. Moreover, the nonintubated VATS group also had a shorter hospital stay and lower perioperative morbidity than the intubated VATS group.

### Ventilatory protective strategies during thoracic surgery: effects of alveolar recruitment maneuver and low-tidal volume ventilation on lung density distribution [^114ifxqx]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The increased tidal volume (V(T)) applied to the ventilated lung during one-lung ventilation (OLV) enhances cyclic alveolar recruitment and mechanical stress. It is unknown whether alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) and reduced V(T) may influence tidal recruitment and lung density. Therefore, the effects of ARM and OLV with different V(T) on pulmonary gas/tissue distribution are examined.

Methods

Eight anesthetized piglets were mechanically ventilated (V(T) = 10 ml/kg). A defined ARM was applied to the whole lung (40 cm H(2)O for 10 s). Spiral computed tomographic lung scans were acquired before and after ARM. Thereafter, the lungs were separated with an endobronchial blocker. The pigs were randomized to receive OLV in the dependent lung with a V(T) of either 5 or 10 ml/kg. Computed tomography was repeated during and after OLV. The voxels were categorized by density intervals (i.e., atelectasis, poorly aerated, normally aerated, or overaerated). Tidal recruitment was defined as the addition of gas to collapsed lung regions.

Results

The dependent lung contained atelectatic (56 ± 10 ml), poorly aerated (183 ± 10 ml), and normally aerated (187 ± 29 ml) regions before ARM. After ARM, lung volume and aeration increased (426 ± 35 vs. 526 ± 69 ml). Respiratory compliance enhanced, and tidal recruitment decreased (95% vs. 79% of the whole end-expiratory lung volume). OLV with 10 ml/kg further increased aeration (atelectasis, 15 ± 2 ml; poorly aerated, 94 ± 24 ml; normally aerated, 580 ± 98 ml) and tidal recruitment (81% of the dependent lung). OLV with 5 ml/kg did not affect tidal recruitment or lung density distribution. (Data are given as mean ± SD.)

Conclusions

The ARM improves aeration and respiratory mechanics. In contrast to OLV with high V(T), OLV with reduced V(T) does not reinforce tidal recruitment, indicating decreased mechanical stress.

### Peep titration based on the open lung approach during one lung ventilation in thoracic surgery: a physiological study [^113Hik7X]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main result of the present study is that during OLV in lateral decubitus, the application of an open lung strategy consisting in a RM followed by a decremental PEEP titration significantly improves oxygenation and lung mechanical properties without significant hemodynamic effects.

It is well acknowledged that OLV in lateral decubitus may induce a "multiple-hit" mechanism for lung injury: on one side the dependent lung is prone to mechanical damage due to intratidal cyclic parenchymal opening and closing, compression by mediastinal structures, surgical manipulations and loss of elastic recoil, on the other there is the collapse and re-expansion of the non dependent lung. Moreover, the reduction of aerated lung capacity may worsen the ventilation-to-perfusion matching that could result in a significant gas exchange impairment. The common ventilatory setting to counterbalance hypoxemia during OLV used to include Vt as high as during two-lungs ventilation (i.e. 8 to 10 ml/Kg) and PEEP as a rescue therapy in case of severe hypoxemia, in selected patients. Recent studies, however, demonstrated that large Vts do exacerbate the risk for Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI) through the enhancement of oxidative and inflammatory reactions, whereas a lung-protective ventilatory strategy with smaller Vt and PEEP applied after appropriate lung recruitment on the dependent lung during OLV minimizes VILI, resulting in less postoperative lung complications, and increases oxygenation. However, very low Vts as the one suggested for ventilating the dependent lung during OLV (4–5 ml/Kg) may per se induce alveolar de-recruitment unless an "adequate" PEEP level is set. Unfortunately, there is no agreement on the correct PEEP setting in the OLV context. In a recent study, Spadaro and coworkers documented the physiological interplay between very low Vts and two PEEP levels (5 and 10 cmH 2 O) on oxygenation, respiratory mechanics and ventilation/perfusion mismatch during OLV. Their findings were that in this setting only a relatively high PEEP level (10 cmH 2 O) guarantees improvement of gas exchange, shunt reduction and improvement of respiratory mechanics. In the present study we found that lower PEEP levels, i.e. 6 ± 0.8 cmH 2 O (range 5–8 cmH 2 O) were able to improve oxygenation and lung mechanics. The apparent discrepancy between ours and Spadaro's data could be explained by the different design of the two studies. Indeed, we applied a complete lung recruitment and individualized PEEP titration strategy whereas Spadaro studied two fix PEEP levels were applied without previous maximal lung recruitment. Our study seems to confirm that in the OLV context, similarly than in early ARDS, a decremental PEEP titration trial is required to keep the lung fully opened after a maximal lung recruitment maneuver.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^112dEvCT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Low tidal volume (6–8 ml/kg PBW) is one of the hallmark parameters for intraoperative lung protective ventilation during non-thoracic surgery. However, the application of an "optimally low" tidal volume during OLV is not standardized. Our survey and other retrospective database analysis suggest that there are a considerably large proportion of patients continue to receive the similar range of tidal volume (6–8 ml/kg PBW) during two-lung and one-lung ventilation. However, the level of tidal volume has been shown to be inversely related to the incidence of respiratory complications and major postoperative morbidity. Furthermore, the Italian and Japanese anesthesiologists recommend a lower tidal volume (4–6 ml/kg PBW) for OLV. Nevertheless, opinions from the expert anesthesiologists highlight that protective ventilation in thoracic anesthesia is not simply synonymous of a low tidal volume, but also involves the appropriate application of PEEP, alveolar recruitment and other ventilatory settings during OLV. Most recently, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted at the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) demonstrated that driving pressure-guided ventilation (median ∆P of 9 cmH 2 O) during OLV significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications compared with the conventional protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 ml/kg PBW, PEEP 5 cmH 2 O and recruitment) in thoracic surgery. PEEP is another important element in practicing intraoperative lung protective ventilation. This survey found that most of the thoracic anesthesiologists in Taiwan apply a PEEP level of 4–6 cmH 2 O during OLV, which is comparable with mean levels (4.2 ± 1.6 cmH 2 O) reported in a large retrospective analysis of the US database. The authors concluded that low tidal volume failed to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications without application of adequate PEEP. A previous study also indicated that individualized PEEP determined by a PEEP decrement trial significantly increased oxygenation and lung mechanics than the standardized PEEP (5 cmH 2 O). However, the appropriate PEEP levels for OLV are yet to be determined by the ongoing clinical trials (Table 2). Our study also found that most Taiwanese thoracic anesthesiologists currently use the bag squeezing maneuver to recruit of the collapsed non-dependent lung. Although the stepwise recruitment methods have been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in comparison to bag squeezing maneuver in abdominal surgery, the evidence for re-expansion methods for the non-dependent lung after OLV requires further investigation. In fact, the ongoing Prothor and iPROVE-OLV trials are analyzing the lung protective effects of high PEEP, recruitment maneuver, and postoperative high-flow nasal cannulas for thoracic surgeries requiring OLV (Table 2).

### Comparison of two protective lung ventilatory regimes on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^114eAAkU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of protective ventilation in acute lung injury has validated its use in the operating room for patients undergoing thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of two different modes of ventilation using low tidal volumes: pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) vs. volume controlled ventilation (VCV) on oxygenation and airway pressures during OLV.

Methods

We studied 41 patients scheduled for thoracoscopy surgery. After initial two-lung ventilation with VCV patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In one group OLV was started with VCV (tidal volume 6 mL/kg, PEEP 5) and after 30 minutes ventilation was switched to PCV (inspiratory pressure to provide a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, PEEP 5) for the same time period. In the second group, ventilation modes were performed in reverse order. Airway pressures and blood gases were obtained at the end of each ventilatory mode.

Results

PaO2, PaCO2 and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference did not differ between PCV and VCV. Peak airway pressure was significantly lower in PCV compared with VCV (19.9 ± 3.8 cmH2O vs 23.1 ± 4.3 cmH2O; p < 0.001) without any significant differences in mean and plateau pressures.

Conclusions

In patients with good preoperative pulmonary function undergoing thoracoscopy surgery, the use of a protective lung ventilation strategy with VCV or PCV does not affect the oxygenation. PCV was associated with lower peak airway pressures.

### Clinical practice of one-lung ventilation in mainland China: a nationwide questionnaire survey [^112vbCg2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lung protective ventilation strategy

The volume control ventilation mode, a tidal volume of 4 to 6 mL per predictive body weight (kg), pure oxygen inspiration, and a low-level PEEP of < 5 cm H 2 O were the most acceptable ventilation parameters for the respondents in this study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the VCV mode was an independent risk factor for intraoperative hypoxemia in pulmonary and cardiac surgery patients in this study. Compared with the volume control ventilation mode and the pressure control volume guarantee mode, lower airway pressure and higher dynamic lung compliance were monitored in patients in the pressure control ventilation mode. However, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of PPCs, indicating a weak relationship between airway pressure, dynamic lung compliance, and short-term respiratory outcomes after surgery. Moreover, patients at high risk of PPCs might benefit from the VCV mode, which is associated with lower volume and driving pressure. Coincidentally, the majority of respondents in this study routinely performed VCV during surgery. However, the authors could not confirm the reason why the VCV mode was prevalent in mainland China.

While low tidal volume ventilation is recommended for LPVSs, the incidence of PPCs does not decrease in patients without a proper level of PEEP during surgery. Accordingly, most anesthesiologists in mainland China support this approach and utilize low tidal volume and low-level PEEP in their daily clinical practice. However, what we should note is that debates still exist regarding whether low tidal volume ventilation combined with proper PEEP can reduce the number of PPCs in OLV.

High concentrations of inhaled oxygen can cause oxygen toxicity, resorption atelectasis, and other oxidative stress injuries and are closely associated with high incidences of PPCs and 30-day mortality. Nevertheless, 100% FiO 2 has been widely adopted in China. Not surprisingly, the main reason was the concern about intraoperative hypoxemia following OLV. The authors strongly recommend titrating the FiO 2 from a low level and keeping the FiO 2 as low as possible to maintain good oxygenation during OLV.

The management of some problematic patients having thoracic surgery is among the most difficult challenges for the anesthesiologist. Increasingly complex operations are performed on seriously compromised patients because of the development of new surgical techniques and the anesthesiologists' awareness of surgical needs and requirements to provide a satisfactory and safe surgical field. In order to facilitate thoracic surgery, the single most important and valuable anesthetic technique used actually is one-lung ventilation. This article reviews the complex pathopysiology of one-lung ventilation.

### Do we have the 'power' to' drive' down the incidence of pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery [^115uTeTw]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

The concept, mechanisms, and physical and physiological determinants of ventilator-induced lung injury, as well as the influence of lung-protective ventilation strategies, are novel paradigms of modern intensive care and perioperative medicine. Driving pressure and mechanical power have emerged as meaningful and modifiable targets with specific relevance to thoracic anaesthesia and one-lung ventilation. The relationship between these factors and postoperative pulmonary complications remains complex because of the methodological design and outcome selection. Larger observational studies are required to better understand the characteristics of driving pressure and power in current practice of thoracic anaesthesia in order to design future trials in high-risk thoracic populations at risk of acute lung injury.

### Comparison of two protective lung ventilatory regimes on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^1138cVHZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anesthesia for thoracic surgery routinely involves one lung ventilation (OLV) to provide optimum surgical operating conditions and to isolate and protect the lungs during the procedure. Unfortunately, this practice may associate with an important impairment in gas exchange, particularly in patients with previous lung disease.

OLV traditionally has been performed with tidal volumes (V T) that are equal to those being used on two lung ventilation (TLV). Over the past decades, V T used by clinicians have progressively decreased from more than 12–15 ml/kg to less than 9 ml/kg actual body weight. This practice is based on several studies that showed that mechanical ventilation using V T of no more than 6 ml/kg resulted in reduction of systemic inflammatory markers, increased ventilator-free days, and reduction in mortality when compared with V T of 12 ml/kg in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory stress syndrome. The reduction of V T has been recommended in patients without pulmonary pathology at the onset of mechanical ventilation.

The use of low V T has been also recommended in patients during OLV. Recent studies have suggested that low V T during OLV can be associated with a decreased incidence of complications. However the effects of low V T on oxygenation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery with OLV have been less examined. In the operating room, volume controlled ventilation (VCV) is commonly used and it has become the dominant ventilator mode. However, the mechanical characteristics of pressure controlled ventilation (PVC) are thought to allow more homogeneous distribution of ventilation and improved ventilation-perfusion matching. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of two currently used protective lung ventilation strategies on oxygenation during OLV in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.

### Differential lung ventilation for increased oxygenation during one lung ventilation for video assisted lung surgery [^113duDxj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

In the past decades, when cardio-thoracic surgery became minimally invasive, good lung deflation became a necessity. Video- and robot- assisted thoracoscopic operations require high quality OLV. Moreover, many of these procedures are performed with the patient in the supine position, with a large shunt and low oxygenation. At the same time, the patient often has poor basic lung functions, and hypoxemia occurs rapidly. Patients with ischemic heart disease who undergo coronary artery bypass graft are especially susceptible to injury during hypoxemia, and aggressive treatment of arterial desaturation is mandatory to ensure the patient's safety. The challenge of the anesthesiologist is to overcome hypoxemia without disturbing exposure of the surgical field. We believe the DLV is an additional tool for improving oxygenation during OLV.

### Theoretical and practical perioperative considerations protective ventilation in lung transplantation [^111vw3Gj]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Protective ventilation is a cornerstone of perioperative management during lung transplantation. However, its current clinical approach is mainly based on literature from intensive care and elective surgery with one-lung ventilation. This review summarizes the pathophysiology of each of the four main end-stage lung diseases and how mechanical power affects the energy exerted on the lungs during the different surgical steps, first on the host and then on the grafts. Each pathology presents specific parenchymal characteristics, and there is great heterogeneity in pulmonary compliance within and between patients. Recognizing these regional heterogeneities in compliance is fundamental to personalizing ventilator settings and avoiding increasing ventilator-induced lung injury. Furthermore, we explored the concept of the multiple-hits model of lung allograft injury. It highlights the consequences over time (additive or synergic) of all the risk factors cumulated on allograft injury, from the donor before harvesting, to the transport, and finally after implantation. Additionally, we discussed the novel opportunity that ex-vivo lung perfusion offers in the assessment of graft quality using various parameters, as well as mechanical power to guide different modes and settings to optimize ventilation. This experimental model could be used to develop new specific ventilation strategies to optimize the mechanical energy exerted on the lungs without a chest wall. Finally, we advocate for early extubation to reduce ventilation-induced lung injury and promote early rehabilitation.

Results

Identification of studies

Initial searches of the databases yielded 2791 articles. After removing 1014 duplicated articles, 1755 further publications were eliminated as it wasclear from their titles and abstracts that they did not fulfill the selection criteria. For the remaining 22 articles, we obtained full manuscripts, and, following scrutiny of these, identified six articles describing potentially relevant studies; the 16 others were excluded because of use of a different mode of ventilation (five articles), two abstracts, no available outcome data (four articles), study design not randomized (one article), andthe same study data reported twice (one article). One article was excluded because of thoracotomies for robotic-assisted esophagectomy with prone position and twoarticles were excluded to remove variables that might affect oxygenation because cardiopulmonary bypass influences HPV and oxygenation. Hence, six studies and 259 participants were included in this review (Fig. 1).

Study characteristics and patient populations

The included articles were published in four countries: South America, Saudi Arabia, Spain (2), and Turkey (2) between 1997 and 2014. The patients in six studies underwent thoracotomies for lung operations such as pneumectomy, lobectomy and wedge resection. The operating position in all cases was lateral decubitus. Each study used the same FiO 2 and ventilator settings throughout each OLV. Five were crossover studies which applied PCV for 30 min followed by VCV, in one experimental group, and the reverse order in the other. The patients were allocated randomly to one of the two groups and all measurements were made 30 min after starting each ventilation mode. One study was non-crossover study (Table 1).

### The effects of thoracic epidural analgesia on oxygenation and pulmonary shunt fraction during one-lung ventilation: an meta-analysis [^1142CNLZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

One-lung ventilation (OLV) in the lateral position is the unique character of the thoracic surgery. During the procedure, with a potential risk of increased pulmonary shunt and occurrence of hypoxemia, the physiologic defense mechanism, termed hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), starts with a rapid onset. HPV is generally considered to be a factor of governing the redistribution of blood flow to prevent partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) from excessively decreasing and to optimize pulmonary gas exchange during OLV. This physiologic response may be altered by many factors and the effects on oxygenation or HPV should be taken into consideration when choosing the anesthetic regimen. It was suggested that the usage of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) may provide adequate analgesia, reduce postoperative mortality, improve pulmonary outcomes and facilitate fast-track approach for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Currently, continuous TEA combined with general anesthesia has been recommended widely in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Due to the fact that pulmonary vasculature is dominant in sympathetic tone, it may be influenced by segmental blocking the activity of the sympathetic system over the vascular pulmonary responses. However, experimental and clinical studies on controversial effects of TEA with local anesthetics or opioids on HPV response during OLV are rare. The optimal anesthetic management during OLV has not been yet clearly determined. Therefore, our meta-analysis is aiming to address this issue based on studies published over 15 years.

### Variations on one-lung ventilation [^115DMUQU]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

One-lung ventilation is a commonly used technique to facilitate surgical visualization during thoracic surgical procedures. New devices for one-lung ventilation have been introduced into clinical practice over the recent years. One such device is the Arndt Endobronchial Blocker which is a bronchial blocker with a central lumen through which a wire with a looped end has been passed. The loop on the distal end is meant to be placed over a fiberoptic bronchoscope which is then used as a guide to facilitate bronchial placement of the balloon-tipped bronchial blocker. Another advantage of the Arndt device is the airway adaptor that contains ports for the anesthesia circuit, the bronchoscope, the bronchial blocker as well as attachment to the endotracheal tube. The port for the bronchial blocker can be tightened down so as to hold the blocker in place during the procedure. However, patient issues such as size or airway alterations such as the presence of a tracheostomy may make necessary certain alterations in airway management. I describe four cases and provide suggestions for minor alterations in airway management that may be used to provide successful options for one-lung anesthesia.

### The potential dangers of recruitment maneuvers during one lung ventilation surgery [^116cAPFo]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing evidence regarding lung-protective ventilation (LPV) during one-lung ventilation (OLV) focuses on surrogate outcomes. Our objective was to assess whether an LPV protocol during OLV surgery is associated with reduced respiratory complications.

Materials and Methods

This was a matched control retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing pulmonary resection at a tertiary Canadian hospital. The experimental group (n = 50) was derived from primary data of two crossover RCTs, which utilized protocolized LPV strategies with varying levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers. The control group was drawn from a prospectively maintained database; these patients received conventional nonprotocolized ventilation (2000–2010). Each experimental group patient was matched 1:1 with a control group patient with respect to clinically relevant variables (age, sex, diagnosis, smoking status, cardiovascular disease status, comorbidity, BMI, preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s, surgery type). Major respiratory complications were defined as composite of acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for new positive-pressure ventilation, and atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy. Paired and unpaired statistical tests were used.

Results

Patients appeared well matched. Major respiratory complications occurred in 8% (n = 4) and 2% (n = 1) of patients in experimental and control groups, respectively (P = 0.50). There was a trend toward increased mortality (4 versus 0, P = 0.06) with protocolized LPV. The patients who died had respiratory complications; one had acute respiratory distress syndrome and two had profound hypoxemia.

Conclusions

There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality with LPV during OLV. Although limited by a small sample size, our findings identify a potential danger to excessive recruitment maneuvers. Larger studies, with clinically important outcomes are needed to better define the risk/benefit trade-offs for LPV during OLV.

Recommendations for perioperative planning according to recipient pathology — in addition to airflow limitations, static hyperinflation (residual volume to total lung capacity) and recent infections, anesthetic assessment of COPD patients should focus on functional limitations.

### Individualized PEEP titration by lung compliance during one-lung ventilation: a meta-analysis [^113NjFty]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

This meta-analysis included the latest evidence and found that individualized PEEP titration by lung compliance was associated with a reduced risk of a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications compared with fixed PEEP. Subgroup analyses suggested that the association was evident in the subgroup with PEEP titration by dynamic compliance or stepwise decremental strategy. Furthermore, individualized PEEP titration by lung compliance was associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia and atelectasis. It also improved respiratory mechanics (higher dynamic compliance and lower driving pressure) and oxygenation (higher PaO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2) with no difference in hemodynamic variables.

Comparison with previous evidence

The rationale for using PEEP is to maintain a lung volume above the closing capacity. This prevents alveolar collapse and intrapulmonary shunting that can cause hypoxemia during OLV. Furthermore, an adequate PEEP level avoids the cyclic recruitment/decruitment of lung units that promote endothelial and epithelial damage and subsequent lung inflammation. Conversely, excessively high PEEP values can cause overdistension with a subsequent increase in alveolar dead space and diversion of blood flow. Recently, in a meta-analysis, Peel et al. confirmed that PEEP, compared with no PEEP, offers physiologic advantages during OLV; however, the optimal PEEP titration strategy is yet to be determined. The authors pointed out that most studies report surrogate outcomes (e.g. physiological measures) rather than clinical outcomes. Therefore, Peel et al. invoked the need to design studies to evaluate the impact of recruitment maneuvers and PEEP on clinical outcomes. Subsequently, another meta-analysis by Li et al. demonstrated that an individualized PEEP setting during OLV was associated with fewer postoperative pulmonary complications and better oxygenation. However, these findings were primarily derived from dissertations from China with a limited sample size of 849 patients, potentially limiting their generalizability. Moreover, Li et al. primarily focused on a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications, neglecting other critical patient-centered outcomes, such as pneumonia, atelectasis, ARDS, cardiovascular complications, and mortality. Additionally, data on respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic variables were lacking.

Notably, our meta-analysis is the largest to date, incorporating seven additional RCTs totaling over 3000 patients compared to previous analyses. We also conducted subgroup analyses based on the PEEP titration method. Moreover, we expanded outcome reporting to include pneumonia, atelectasis, ARDS, cardiovascular complications, and mortality. Additionally, we provided data on respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic variables.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116KQnuT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — conclusions emphasize individualized application of recommendations and research gaps: Significant advances have been made in the ventilatory management of ARDS in the last few decades, and clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline, and they should be careful when comparing the relative benefits of one intervention over another if they have the same rating. The potential benefits or synergies of combined or sequential treatments with interventions included in this guideline have not been explicitly studied, and therefore no recommendations have been made, while most recent studies of ventilatory interventions, however, have used LTV ventilation in recognition of supportive clinical and experimental evidence.

### The impact of different inspired oxygen concentrations combined with nebulized prostaglandin E1 on oxygenation in patients undergoing one-lung ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^1124zuoS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

One-lung ventilation (OLV) is widely employed in the anesthesia process for thoracic surgery. During OLV, the ventilation-receiving lung exhibits reduced compliance due to the gravitational influence of the mediastinum and the elevated diaphragm in the lateral decubitus position. Meanwhile, although the non-ventilated lung remains unventilated, certain blood perfusion increases intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt). These factors may augment the risk of intraoperative hypoxemia in patients. Therefore, during OLV, pure oxygen or high inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2) are typically used to maintain patient oxygenation. Current lung-protective ventilation strategies recommend reducing the FiO 2 as much as possible while ensuring adequate oxygenation, although the specific concentration remains undefined.

Prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1), a selective pulmonary artery dilator, has been previously shown to effectively reduce Qs/Qt and significantly improve oxygenation when nebulized and inhaled into the ventilated lung prior to OLV, with minimal impact on hemodynamics. This study aims to investigate the effects of PGE 1 on lowering the FiO 2 during general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation on oxygenation and postoperative complications in patients undergoing OLV.

### Management of the airway and lung isolation for thoracic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: recommendations for clinical practice endorsed by the association for cardiothoracic anaesthesia and critical care and the society for cardiothoracic surgery in great britain and Ireland [^115AoV3i]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Intra-operative aerosol-generating procedures are arguably unavoidable in the routine provision of thoracic anaesthesia. Airway management for such patients during the COVID-19 pandemic including tracheal intubation, lung isolation, one-lung ventilation and flexible bronchoscopy may pose a significant risk to healthcare professionals and patients. That said, there remains a need for timely thoracic surgery for patients with lung cancer or thoracic trauma. The thoracic anaesthetic community has been confronted with the need to modify existing techniques to maximise safety for patients and healthcare professionals. With appropriate modification, aerosol generation may be mitigated against in most circumstances. We developed a set of practice-based recommendations for airway management in thoracic surgical patients, which have been endorsed by the Association for Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Critical Care and the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland.

### Hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation: prediction, prevention, and treatment [^11258yzm]. Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

When switching from two-lung to one-lung ventilation (OLV), shunt fraction increases, oxygenation is impaired, and hypoxemia may occur. Hypoxemia during OLV may be predicted from measurements of lung function, distribution of perfusion between the lungs, whether the right or the left lung is ventilated, and whether the operation will be performed in the supine or in the lateral decubitus position. Hypoxemia during OLV may be prevented by applying a ventilation strategy that avoids alveolar collapse while minimally impairing perfusion of the dependent lung. Choice of anesthesia does not influence oxygenation during clinical OLV. Hypoxemia during OLV may be treated symptomatically by increasing inspired fraction of oxygen, by ventilating, or by using continuous positive airway pressure in the nonventilated lung. Hypoxemia during OLV may be treated causally by correcting the position of the double-lumen tube, clearing the main bronchi of the ventilated lung from secretions, and improving the ventilation strategy.

### Clinical practice of one-lung ventilation in mainland China: a nationwide questionnaire survey [^112HZVmE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation parameters

Up to 32% of respondents were reluctant to perform LPVS during OLV, with many citing concerns that LPVS was a complicated and impractical technique during cardiothoracic surgery (see Fig. 6). More than half of the respondents chose pure oxygen inspiration during OLV because of concerns about hypoxemia. Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) mode, recruitment maneuvers, 4 to 6 mL per kilogram predictive body weight, pure oxygen inspiration, and a low-level PEEP of ≤ 5 cm H 2 O were accepted by most respondents (see Fig. 7 A, B, C, D and E). The most prevalent reason for performing pure oxygen inhalation during one-lung ventilation was concern about intraoperative hypoxemia (see Fig. 7 F).

Intraoperative ventilation monitoring

The most common thresholds for intraoperative monitoring values were a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of 90–94%, an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) of 45–55 mm Hg, and an airway pressure of 30–34 cm H 2 O (see Fig. 8).

Perioperative complications

Hypoxemia was commonly observed during OLV surgery. The percentages of anesthesiologists who frequently experienced intraoperative hypoxemia were 19%, 24%, and 7% for lung, cardiovascular, and esophageal surgeries, respectively (see Fig. 9 A). Hypoxemia and laryngeal injury were frequently experienced by 75% and 51% of the respondents, respectively (see Fig. 9 B). Subgroup analysis revealed that no significant differences were observed between respondents who performed LPV during OLV and those who did not with respect to the high incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia (see Fig. 10).

### A lower tidal volume regimen during one-lung ventilation for lung resection surgery is not associated with reduced postoperative pulmonary complications [^114mr8oA]. Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protective ventilation may improve outcomes after major surgery. However, in the context of one-lung ventilation, such a strategy is incompletely defined. The authors hypothesized that a putative one-lung protective ventilation regimen would be independently associated with decreased odds of pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery.

Methods

The authors merged Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database and Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group intraoperative data for lung resection procedures using one-lung ventilation across five institutions from 2012 to 2016. They defined one-lung protective ventilation as the combination of both median tidal volume 5 ml/kg or lower predicted body weight and positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O or greater. The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day major postoperative pulmonary complications.

Results

A total of 3,232 cases were available for analysis. Tidal volumes decreased modestly during the study period (6.7 to 6.0 ml/kg; P < 0.001), and positive end-expiratory pressure increased from 4 to 5 cm H2O (P < 0.001). Despite increasing adoption of a "protective ventilation" strategy (5.7% in 2012 vs. 17.9% in 2016), the prevalence of pulmonary complications did not change significantly (11.4 to 15.7%; P = 0.147). In a propensity score matched cohort (381 matched pairs), protective ventilation (mean tidal volume 6.4 vs. 4.4 ml/kg) was not associated with a reduction in pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.32). In an unmatched cohort, the authors were unable to define a specific alternative combination of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume that was associated with decreased risk of pulmonary complications.

Conclusions

In this multicenter retrospective observational analysis of patients undergoing one-lung ventilation during thoracic surgery, the authors did not detect an independent association between a low tidal volume lung-protective ventilation regimen and a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications.

### Continuous titration of inspired oxygen using oxygen reserve index to decrease oxygen exposure during one-lung ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^1179VG2n]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) is administered during one-lung ventilation (OLV). However, a high Fio2 is not physiologic and may lead to various complications. We hypothesized that continuous titration of Fio2 using the oxygen reserve index (ORI) reduces oxygen exposure compared to conventional management during OLV.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blinded trial, patients undergoing thoracic surgery were assigned to an ORI (n = 64) or a control group (n = 60). In the ORI group, ORI was continuously displayed using multiwavelength pulse co-oximetry (Masimo) between 0 and 1 (0, no reserve; 1, maximum reserve), and Fio2 was titrated for a target ORI of 0.21 at 5-minute intervals during OLV. In the control group, Fio2 was adjusted using arterial blood gas analysis measured at 15 minutes after OLV initiation. The primary end point was the time-weighted average Fio2 during OLV.

Results

Overall, time-weighted average Fio2 did not differ between the groups (control versus ORI: median [interquartile range], 0.87 [0.73–1.00] vs 0.82 [0.68–0.93]; p = 0.09). However, in a subgroup analysis, the ORI group reduced time-weighted average Fio2 after pulmonary vascular ligation compared to the control group (control versus ORI: median [interquartile range], 0.75 [0.70–1.00] vs 0.72 [0.59–0.89]; p = 0.0261). The incidence of intraoperative hypoxia (arterial oxygen saturation [Spo2] < 94%; control versus ORI: 32% [19/60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 20–45] vs 19% [12/64; 95% CI, 10–31]; p = 0.09), and postoperative complications within the first 7 days did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

ORI-guided continuous Fio2 titration does not reduce overall oxygen exposure during OLV.

### The year in thoracic anesthesia: selected highlights from 2022 [^114e47QJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

This article reviews research highlights in the field of thoracic anesthesia. The highlights of this year included new developments in the preoperative assessment and prehabilitation of patients requiring thoracic surgery, updates on the use of devices for one-lung ventilation (OLV) in adults and children, updates on the anesthetic and postoperative management of these patients, including protective OLV ventilation, the use of opioid-sparing techniques and regional anesthesia, and outcomes using enhanced recovery after surgery, as well as the use of expanding indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, specialized anesthetic techniques for airway surgery, and nonintubated video-assisted thoracic surgery.

### Rationale and study design for an individualized perioperative open lung ventilatory strategy in patients on one-lung ventilation (iPROVE-OLV) [^113Tm6ic]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this clinical trial is to examine whether it is possible to reduce postoperative complications using an individualized perioperative ventilatory strategy versus using a standard lung-protective ventilation strategy in patients scheduled for thoracic surgery requiring one-lung ventilation.

Design

International, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Setting

A network of university hospitals.

Participants

The study comprises 1,380 patients scheduled for thoracic surgery.

Interventions

The individualized group will receive intraoperative recruitment maneuvers followed by individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (open lung approach) during the intraoperative period plus postoperative ventilatory support with high-flow nasal cannula, whereas the control group will be managed with conventional lung-protective ventilation.

Measurements and Main Results

Individual and total number of postoperative complications, including atelectasis, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia, acute lung injury; unplanned readmission and reintubation; length of stay and death in the critical care unit and in the hospital will be analyzed for both groups. The authors hypothesize that the intraoperative application of an open lung approach followed by an individual indication of high-flow nasal cannula in the postoperative period will reduce pulmonary complications and length of hospital stay in high-risk surgical patients.

### Comparative study of a modified double-lumen tube ventilation control connector and traditional connector in clinical use: a randomised-controlled trial [^116MQUgF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In thoracic surgery, a DLT is required to separate the two sides of the thoracic cavity. The traditional YC connecting the DLT and the respiratory circuit can be achieved by alternating with threaded fittings/using a surgical clamp to seal the side of the DLT in the conversion of one-lung and two-lung ventilation. The use of the surgical clamp easily deforms the tube on the clamped side, which increases the resistance to gas flow in the tube after ventilation is resumed. After the weight of the surgical clamp is integrated with the YC, the instability of the connector is increased, which is easy to cause the connector to fall off. The deficiency of using DLT interchangeably with threaded fitting is that the operation of ventilation conversion process is complicated, and the repeatedly inserting and pulling may cause the shedding or loss of the connector. If the shedding of connector is not detected in time, it will affect the tightness of the whole respiratory circuit during anesthesia, cause hypoxia in patients, and even threaten the safety of patient's life. If the connector is lost, the anesthesiologist's fluency in ventilation switch is reduced and the operation process is delayed. One-lung ventilation differs from two-lung ventilation in terms of pulmonary respiratory dynamics, ventilation and ventilation function, especially pulmonary blood flow. During one-lung ventilation, the uptake of inhaled anesthetics in the lungs at the same inhaled concentration is less than that in two-lung ventilation, and the concentration of anesthetics in exhaled air is higher. Therefore, compared with two-lung ventilation, the depth of anesthesia in one-lung ventilation is shallower at the same time point, and the time required for inhalation anesthesia to reach steady state is longer. Traditionally, potent inhalation anesthetics have been the drugs of choice for one-lung ventilation because they reduce airway responsiveness by acting directly on the airway smooth muscle tissue of the bronchi. However, the traditional connector needs to completely disconnect the respiratory circuit during the conversion of one-lung ventilation and two lung ventilation, and the conversion time is relatively long, which will not only make a large number of inhaled anesthetics leak from the respiratory circuit and pollute the air in the operating room, but also greatly affect the stability of the anesthesia depth of patients.

Part III of the survey form collected the expert opinions of the thoracic anesthesiologists in the protective lung ventilation strategy during OLV. Optimal levels of Vt and PAP were suggested as the two most important ventilatory parameters for lung protection during OLV (Fig. 2). However, there were as high as 60.0 and 66.2% of the thoracic anesthesiologists did not consider Vt and PAP as the most important ventilator indices for lung protection during OLV, respectively (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the proportions of these experts who considered other parameters (i.e. PEEP, FiO2, ∆P, ventilator mode and recruitment maneuver) as the most important indexes to guide the ventilatory strategy for lung protection during thoracic surgery were extremely low (Fig. 2). Most importantly, 91.5% (65/71) of the thoracic anesthesiologists highly recommended that an international clinical practice guideline on the protective lung ventilation strategy for thoracic anesthesia should be established.

### The use of air in the inspired gas mixture during two-lung ventilation delays lung collapse during one-lung ventilation [^111pXD5a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Collapse of the ipsilateral lung facilitates surgical exposure during thoracic procedures. The use of different gas mixtures during two-lung ventilation (2LV) may improve or impede surgical conditions during subsequent one-lung ventilation (OLV) by increasing or delaying lung collapse. We investigated the effects of three different gas mixtures during 2LV on lung collapse and oxygenation during subsequent OLV: Air/Oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO(2)] = 0.4), Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen ("N(2)O", FIO(2) = 0.4) and Oxygen ("O(2)", FIO(2) = 1.0).

Methods

Subjects were randomized into three groups: Air/Oxygen (n = 33), N(2)O (n = 34) or O(2) (n = 33) and received the designated gas mixture during induction and until the start of OLV. Subjects' lungs in all groups were then ventilated with FIO(2) = 1.0 during OLV. The surgeons, who were blinded to the randomization, evaluated the lung deflation using a verbal rating scale at 10 and 20 min after the start of OLV. Serial arterial blood gases were performed before anesthesia induction, during 2LV, and every 5 min, for 30 min, after initiation of OLV.

Results

The use of air in the inspired gas mixture during 2LV led to delayed lung deflation during OLV, whereas N(2)O improved lung collapse. Arterial oxygenation was significantly improved in the O(2) group only for the first 10 min of OLV, after which there were no differences in mean Pao(2) values among groups.

Conclusions

De-nitrogenation of the lung during 2LV is a useful strategy to improve surgical conditions during OLV. The use of FIO(2) 1.0 or N(2)O/O(2) (FIO(2) 0.4) during 2LV did not have an adverse effect on subsequent oxygenation during OLV.

### The EZ-blocker for one-lung ventilation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery: clinical applications and experience in 100 cases in a routine clinical setting [^1173i6j2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracic surgery often requires lung separation and one-lung ventilation (OLV) to perform certain surgical procedures and to provide optimal site exposure. The most commonly used device is the double-lumen tube (DLT). However, the DLT is more rigid and has a larger outer diameter compared with a single-lumen tube (SLT). The placement of a DLT for one-lung ventilation may be technically difficult and has an increased risk for trauma to the trachea and the mainstem bronchi. Therefore the DLT should be avoided for rapid sequence induction. It is not feasible in patients with a difficult airway or tracheostomy, in patients who require unplanned OLV during an ongoing surgery or who might need prolonged mechanical ventilation after surgery, including already intubated critically ill patients. To achieve lung isolation in these settings, bronchial blockers (BBs), such as Cohen Flex-tip Blocker (Cook Critical Care, Bloomington, IN), the Univent Torque Control Blocker (Vitaid, Lewiston, USA) and the wire-guided Arndt Endobronchial Blocker (Cook Critical Care, Bloomington, USA) can be used.

### Intraoperative mechanical ventilation practice in thoracic surgery patients and its association with postoperative pulmonary complications: results of a multicenter prospective observational study [^117A8Egm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 234 million major surgical procedures are undertaken worldwide every year. Among these, approximately 7 million patients develop major complications resulting in one million deaths during surgery or in-hospital stay, contributing to an estimated mortality rate after anesthesia of 34 per million. According to the 'Local assessment of ventilatory management during general anesthesia for surgery and effects on postoperative pulmonary complications' (LAS VEGAS) trial, postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) occur in a significant proportion of surgical patients. However, since thoracic surgery requires a differentiated ventilatory approach, those patients were excluded from the primary analysis of the LAS VEGAS study. In thoracic surgery, conventional methods to prevent and treat hypoxemia during one lung ventilation (OLV) can be harmful to the lung tissue: high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) and low (or no) positive end–expiratory pressure (PEEP) both can promote atelectasis, whereas high tidal volume (VT) can cause baro- and volutrauma. The type of thoracic surgery (open or endoscopic) as well as the intraoperative mechanical ventilation settings may also influence PPCs.

Intraoperative mechanical ventilation with low V T, low driving pressure, and low to moderate PEEP improved postoperative lung function and even outcome in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. When low V T was used in abdominal surgery, high PEEP combined with recruitment maneuvers, as compared to low PEEP without recruitment maneuvers, did not add to the protection against PPCs.

The present study aimed to characterize the current mechanical ventilation practice during general anesthesia for thoracic surgery, describe the incidence of PPCs, and investigate possible associations between type of surgery (open vs. endoscopic), type of ventilation (OLV or two lung ventilation) and risk for PPCs (low risk vs high) with the incidence of PPCs. We hypothesized that intraoperative mechanical ventilation, as recommended in the literature, namely with low V T, low driving pressure, and low to moderate PEEP, is not commonly used during thoracic surgery, and that the incidence of PPCs is higher in this surgical population than in non-thoracic surgery.

### Survey of thoracic anesthetic practice in Italy [^117CZd55]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The object of this study was to conduct and analyze the output of a survey involving a cohort of all Italian hospitals performing thoracic surgery to gather data on anesthetic management, one-lung ventilation (OLV) management, and post-thoracotomy pain relief in thoracic anesthesia.

Design

Survey.

Setting

Italy.

Participants

An invitation to participate in the survey was e-mailed to all the members of the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 62 responses were received from 47 centers. The key findings were: Double-lumen tube is still the first choice lung separation technique in current use; pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation modes are homogenously distributed across the sample and, a tidal volumes (VT) of 4–6 mL/kg during OLV was preferred to all others; moderate or restrictive fluid management were the most used strategies of fluid administration in thoracic anesthesia; thoracic epidural analgesia represented the "gold standard" for post-thoracotomy pain relief in combination with intravenous analgesia.

Conclusion

The results of this survey showed that Italian anesthesiologist follow the recommended standard of care for anesthetic management during OLV.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^117Ga3Em]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

One-lung ventilation (OLV) is the foremost used technique of ventilation during thoracic procedures. Intraoperative lung separation can be managed by means of double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT), bronchial blocker (BB), or nonintubated method. OLV is impeded by significant reduction in lung volume, decline in lung compliance at lateral decubital position, formation of intrapulmonary shunting and exposure of the dependent lung to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). In addition, patients receiving thoracic surgeries are more prone to developing acute lung injuries due to direct surgery-related trauma caused by instrumentation or manipulation of the lung tissues, hypoperfusion induced by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and dysfunction of surfactant system. The non-dependent lung is injured by surgical manipulation and atelectrauma. Re-expansion of the collapsed non-dependent lung at the end of surgery inevitably results in systemic inflammatory response in the local and contralateral lungs, which in turn leads to biotrauma. Therefore, a significantly high pulmonary complication of up to 14–28.4% was reported in patients that received OLV surgery.

In the recent two decades, there is a major paradigm shift for mechanical ventilator support during operation by the introduction of intraoperative lung protective ventilation strategies. Some of these changes include a low tidal volume (Vt), moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), optimal driving pressure (∆P) and the appropriate use of lung recruitment maneuver. Intraoperative lung protective ventilation strategies have been shown to reduce post-operative pulmonary complications and improve overall clinical outcomes in intermediate and high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Currently, however, there is a lack of clinical evidence in regard to appropriate protective-lung strategies during OLV. The optimal levels of intraoperative use of oxygen fraction, the ventilatory settings for volume and pressure variables during OLV and re-expansion phases for lung recruitment are debating. Furthermore, diversities in clinical practice on airway management, advanced monitoring systems and pain control strategies for thoracic surgery are also observed.

Since the international clinical practice guidelines for intraoperative OLV are yet to be established, we conducted a nationwide survey among the thoracic anesthesiologists in Taiwan to determine the current status in practicing ventilatory support and anesthesia care during OLV surgery and analyze the levels of agreement in the intraoperative ventilatory settings among the thoracic anesthesiologists.

### Lung recruitment improves the efficiency of ventilation and gas exchange during one-lung ventilation anesthesia [^116mhgjY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Atelectasis in the dependent lung during one-lung ventilation (OLV) impairs arterial oxygenation and increases dead space. We studied the effect of an alveolar recruitment strategy (ARS) on gas exchange and lung efficiency during OLV by using the single-breath test of CO(2) (SBT-CO(2)). Twelve patients undergoing thoracic surgery were studied at three points in time: (a) during two-lung ventilation and (b) during OLV before and (c) after an ARS. The ARS was applied selectively to the dependent lung and consisted of an increase in peak inspiratory pressure up to 40 cm H(2)O combined with a peak end-expiratory pressure level of 20 cm H(2)O for 10 consecutive breaths. The ARS took approximately 3 min. Arterial blood gases, SBT-CO(2), and metabolic and hemodynamic variables were recorded at the end of each study period. Arterial oxygenation and dead space were better during two-lung ventilation compared with OLV. PaO(2) increased during OLV after lung recruitment (244 ± 89 mm Hg) when compared with OLV without recruitment (144 ± 73 mm Hg; P < 0.001). The SBT-CO(2) analysis showed a significant decrease in dead-space variables and an increase in the variables related to the efficiency of ventilation during OLV after an ARS when compared with OLV alone. In conclusion, ARS improves gas exchange and ventilation efficiency during OLV.

Implications

In this article, we showed how a pulmonary ventilatory maneuver performed in the dependent lung during one-lung ventilation anesthesia improved arterial oxygenation and dead space.

### One-lung ventilation with a bronchial blocker in thoracic patients [^114CMy4i]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Only four of our patients presented with poor pulmonary collapse, requiring a switch to a different device for successful completion of the procedure. The rate of poor collapses in our series was 3%, far lower than that reported in the literature for the different BBs available on the market, which ranges between 9.6 and 60%. Although the scale employed in this study to assess pulmonary collapse is subjective, its use is standard in the literature and the assessments of the anesthesiologists in this study, at least in the case of poor collapses, were fully aligned with those of thoracic surgeons.

A significantly higher proportion of excellent pulmonary collapse rates corresponded to patients operated in the lateral position, who also experienced a lower proportion of poor pulmonary collapses. Although some thoracic surgeons prefer to place their patients in the lateral position to optimize the delivery of anesthesia and prevent the risk of cross-contamination, patient positioning should ideally be guided by the type of procedure, the condition suffered by the patient, the patient's anatomy, and the anesthesiologist's and surgeon's clinical judgement. Also, the proportion of patients with excellent collapses was significantly higher in cases where the device was inserted in the left bronchus. This might be due to the right isolation being more challenging due to potential early emergence of the right upper lobe, as well as specific patient anatomical characteristics.

### Impact of ventilation strategies on pulmonary and cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing general anaesthesia for elective surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111bHjef]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the statement guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022334241).

We performed a comprehensive search in the following databases: Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to May 19, 2022, using the search string "(protective ventilation OR lower tidal volume OR low tidal volume OR positive end-expiratory pressure OR positive end expiratory pressure OR PEEP) AND (surgery OR surgical OR intraoperative OR anesthesia OR anaesthesia)".

Inclusion criteria were: age > 18 yr, RCTs, English language, elective surgery. Exclusion criteria were: pregnant women, patients with history of severe chronic pulmonary disease (COPD, uncontrolled bronchial asthma, severe restrictive lung disease), pulmonary metastases, cardiac and thoracic surgery, need for chest drainage prior to surgery, preoperative renal replacement therapy, congestive heart failure (NYHA: Class III or IV), one-lung intraoperative ventilation, and studies with missing data.

Two authors (FS and SN) independently assessed eligibility based on the titles, abstracts, full-text reports, and further information were acquired from investigators if needed; disagreements were solved by discussion.

Data extraction was performed with a standardised electronic data sheet to summarise information. Two authors (AUDS and PB) independently assessed the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB2) tool; we assigned a value of 'low risk', 'some concerns', and 'high risk' of bias for the following domains: randomisation process, deviation from the intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs: hypoxaemia (defined as P a 2 < 60 mm Hg or SpO 2 < 90%), bronchospasm, development of ARDS, pulmonary infection, and radiological findings (chest radiography, CT scan, or lung ultrasound) of pulmonary infiltrate, aspiration pneumonitis, atelectasis, pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, and pneumothorax.

### ISHLT consensus statement on the perioperative use of ECLS in lung transplantation: part I: preoperative considerations [^1166ZU8b]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation during ECLS as bridge to transplant (BTT) — clinical priorities and evidence gaps emphasize that goals of ECLS during BTT extend beyond simple enhancement of oxygenation and ventilation, and the priority should be to adjust ECMO flow or cannulation strategy to optimize physiological gas exchange, alleviate distressing symptoms of air hunger and minimize sedation; however some patients may require additional mechanical ventilation, even temporarily, to achieve adequate gas exchange or for symptom management; in the context of lung transplant for end‑stage lung disease (ESLD), the primary goal of MV is not lung protection, but ventilatory strategy tailored to the ESLD as well as the protection of multiple organ systems outside of the lungs; unfortunately, there is a paucity of high-quality studies specifically addressing optimal mechanical ventilation practices in patients supported by ECMO as BTT, and in the absence of randomized controlled trials specifically investigating the optimal ventilator settings for this patient population, expert consensus-based guidelines have been established.

### Clinical practice of one-lung ventilation in mainland China: a nationwide questionnaire survey [^1174B2pM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alveolar recruitment maneuvers can prevent pulmonary atelectasis and improve oxygenation during general anesthesia. Nearly all respondents in this study performed manual recruitment maneuvers during OLV. Notably, however, alveolar recruitment maneuvers have been associated with barotrauma, arrhythmia, re-expansion pulmonary edema, and recurrent atelectasis.

Permissive hypercapnia represents a fundamental component of LPVSs and was adopted as part of the ventilation strategy by the majority of respondents in this study. First, hypercapnia may potentiate HPV, augmenting blood flow to the ventilated lung and improving ventilationperfusion (V/Q) matching. Second, mild hypercapnia may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased cardiac output. Specifically, 35% of the respondents permitted ETCO2 levels between 56 and 65 mmHg during OLV, whereas 46% adhered to a more conservative strategy, maintaining the intervention threshold within the range of 45–55 mmHg. A recent prospective, randomized controlled trial suggested that the intraoperative target arterial carbon dioxide tensions of 50 ± 5 mm Hg and 60 ± 5 mm Hg significantly improved pulmonary oxygenation during OLV compared with 40 ± 5 mmHg, without a higher incidence of PPCs or prolongation of hospital stay.

Moreover, up to 32% of respondents did not accept LPVS during OLV, and most regarded LPVS as a complicated and impractical ventilation strategy. Colquhoun, DA, and colleagues reported no obvious difference in outcomes as the application of LPVS increased, indicating that the individualization ventilation strategy was more rational for OLV during cardiothoracic surgery.

### Clinical practice of one-lung ventilation in mainland China: a nationwide questionnaire survey [^115cmcpt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation

Hypoxemia, characterized by a SpO 2 of less than 90% or partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2) of less than 40 KPa (300 mm Hg), frequently occurs during OLV. With advances in lung isolation techniques and anesthetics, intraoperative hypoxemia has decreased significantly. However, 74.6% of the respondents in this study reported episodes of transient hypoxemia during OLV, and 5.0–23.0% of them frequently experienced intraoperative hypoxemia, suggesting that hypoxemia during OLV is still common and warrants more attention in cardiothoracic surgery in China.

No consensus has been reached on the optimal intervention threshold for hypoxemia during OLV. Transient mild hypoxemia (SpO 2 of 85–90%) may be acceptable, followed by elevated cardiac output and hemoglobin levels. However, a dose-dependent relationship has been reported between intraoperative hypoxemia (SpO 2 < 90% for more than 2 min) and postoperative delirium. Given that elderly patients with multiple comorbidities may have impaired tolerance to hypoxemia, maintaining SpO 2 ≥ 90% during OLV is generally recommended. In this study, a SpO 2 of 90% or higher was accepted by 69% of interviewers, and 23% did not address hypoxemia until the SpO 2 decreased from 85 to 89%. Moreover, a transient SpO 2 of less than 85% was permitted in 8% of the respondents. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a threshold of SpO 2 < 85% was an independent risk factor for intraoperative hypoxemia during pulmonary and cardiovascular surgeries, which may be explained by several factors: (1) As the relationship between PaO 2 and arterial oxygen saturation is not linear, pulse oximetry cannot provide immediate warning of hypoxemia. (2) SpO 2 values lower than 85% during surgery indicate several critical situations requiring urgent management, such as DLET malposition, airway obstruction with sputum, or severe V/Q rate mismatches due to increased nonventilated perfusion. (3) Compared with other thoracic surgeries, cardiopulmonary dysfunction often occurs in lung and cardiovascular surgeries. Accordingly, frequent hypoxemia was reported in 19% of respondents during OLV in pulmonary surgery and by 24% in cardiovascular surgery in our study. In contrast, only 7% of respondents frequently reported hypoxemia during OLV in esophageal surgery, suggesting that OLV impaired oxygenation function in cardiopulmonary surgery.

### Anesthesia for nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^111EzmJ2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

With the growing adoption of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols across all surgical groups, including thoracic surgery, coupled with improved video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) equipment and techniques, nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery has gained significant popularity in recent years. Avoiding tracheal intubation with an endotracheal or double-lumen tube and general anesthesia may reduce or eliminate the risks associated with traditional mechanical ventilation, one-lung ventilation, and general anesthesia. Studies have shown a trend toward better preservation of postoperative respiratory function and improved postoperative lengths of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality; however, these have not been conclusively proven. This review article discusses the advantages of nonintubated VATS, the types of thoracic surgery in which this technique has been described, patient selection, appropriate anesthetic techniques, surgical concerns, potential complications relevant to the anesthesiologist during the conduct of nonintubated VATS surgery, and suggested management of these complications.

### Effect of ventilation mode on postoperative pulmonary complications following lung resection surgery: a randomised controlled trial [^1145sZAU]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The effect of intra-operative mechanical ventilation modes on pulmonary outcomes after thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation has not been well established. We evaluated the impact of three common ventilation modes on postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing lung resection surgery. In this two-centre randomised controlled trial, 1224 adults scheduled for lung resection surgery with one-lung ventilation were randomised to one of three groups: volume-controlled ventilation; pressure-controlled ventilation; and pressure-control with volume guaranteed ventilation. Enhanced recovery after surgery pathways and lung-protective ventilation protocols were implemented in all groups. The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications within the first seven postoperative days. The outcome occurred in 270 (22%), with 87 (21%) in the volume control group, 89 (22%) in the pressure control group and 94 (23%) in the pressure-control with volume guaranteed group (p = 0.831). The secondary outcomes also did not differ across study groups. In patients undergoing lung resection surgery with one-lung ventilation, the choice of ventilation mode did not influence the risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications. This is the first randomised controlled trial examining the effect of three ventilation modes on pulmonary outcomes in patients undergoing lung resection surgery.

### Comparison of pressure-controlled ventilation with volume-controlled ventilation during one-lung ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113k37gh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

In addition, as we mentioned before, the focus of mechanical ventilation has moved to prevent the development of lung injury. However, few studies have been performed to evaluate postoperative lung complications after OLV using different ventilator modes. Although we found no differences in the length of postoperative stay, development of lung injury/ARDS and mortality within 30 days between the two groups, it is not reasonable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of different ventilator modes from only two studies.

In the ways that both OLV and ARDS are ventilated with a small lung volume, the so-called baby lung in ARDS and one lung in OLV, OLV is similar to ARDS. Hence, reducing the tidal volume, which is a protective ventilation strategy in ARDS, may also be protective in the case of OLV. Michelet et al. reported that a protective ventilation strategy group, ventilated with a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg and PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O during OLV developed lower proinflammatory systemic responses (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8), and had improved lung function and earlier extubation. Licker et al. have reported clinical benefits of low tidal volumefrom the secondary analysis of an observational cohort. The use of a low tidal volume with PEEP and recruitment maneuvers during OLV significantly reduced the incidence of lung injury and atelectasis after lung cancer resection. Our subgroup analysis also revealed that the studies which applied low tidal volume (6–8 ml/kg) with PCV had the higher PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio than low tidal volume (6–8 ml/kg) with VCV (Fig. 5c). Nevertheless, only few studies which have been reported were using low tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg for OLV. Because the adverse effects of ventilation with a high tidal volume can exacerbate lung injury, the beneficial effects of PCV may be too weak to be detected. Therefore, well-controlled randomized studies using a low tidal volume in each ventilator mode during OLV are needed to accurately assess differences between PCV and VCV.

### Comparison of left double lumen tube and y-shaped and double-ended bronchial blocker for one lung ventilation in thoracic surgery-a randomised controlled clinical trial [^111goWf8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the University's Institutional Review Board (Ethikkommission Marburg, AZ17/18, 16.05.2018) and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the trial. The trial was registered prior to patient enrolment at the German Clinical Trials registry DRKS (DRKS00014816, Principal investigator: Dr. Joachim Risse, Date of registration: 07.06.2018). This randomised controlled and patient-blinded trial adhered to the CONSORT guidelines. This study was performed in compliance with recognised international standards, including the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study uses established methodology from a previously published work of our Airway Research Group with the focus on thoracic anesthesia; therefore there are similarities and overlaps in the methodology. After providing written informed consent, adult patients scheduled for elective thoracic surgery requiring general anesthesia with the need for one lung ventilation with American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I-IV were enrolled from 11.06.2018 until 14.02.2020. Exclusion criteria were patient age < 18 years, non-elective surgery, pregnancy, scheduled rapid sequence induction (RSI), contraindication for DLT insertion or one lung ventilation (risk of aspiration, tumour stenosis, tracheal malformation or obstructions, tumour invasion, small adults, children < 10 years) as well as abnormal physical status of the cervical spine.

### One-lung ventilation and postoperative pulmonary complications after major lung resection surgery. A multicenter randomized controlled trial [^111zsxLk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The effect of one-lung ventilation (OLV) strategy based on low tidal volume (TV), application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARM) to reduce postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary complications (PPCs) compared with higher TV without PEEP and ARM strategy in adult patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy has not been well established.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial.

Setting

Sixteen Italian hospitals.

Participants

A total of 880 patients undergoing elective major lung resection.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive lower tidal volume (LTV group: 4 mL/kg predicted body weight, PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O, and ARMs) or higher tidal volume (HTL group: 6 mL/kg predicted body weight, no PEEP, and no ARMs). After OLV, until extubation, both groups were ventilated using a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg and a PEEP value of 5 cmH 2 O. The primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital ARDS. Secondary outcomes were the in-hospital rate of PPCs, major cardiovascular events, unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, and in-hospital length of stay.

Measurements and Main Results

ARDS occurred in 3 of 438 patients (0.7%, 95% CI 0.1–2.0) and in 1 of 442 patients (0.2%, 95% CI 0–1.4) in the LTV and HTV group, respectively (Risk ratio: 3.03 95% CI 0.32–29, p = 0.372). Pulmonary complications occurred in 125 of 438 patients (28.5%, 95% CI 24.5–32.9) and in 136 of 442 patients (30.8%, 95% CI 26.6–35.2) in the LTV and HTV group, respectively (risk ratio: 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.14, p = 0.507). The incidence of major complications, in-hospital mortality, and unplanned ICU admission, ICU and in-hospital length of stay were comparable in both groups.

Conclusions

In conclusion, among adult patients undergoing elective lung resection, an OLV with lower tidal volume, PEEP 5 cmH 2 O, and ARMs and a higher tidal volume strategy resulted in low ARDS incidence and comparable postoperative complications, in-hospital length of stay, and mortality.

### Peep titration based on the open lung approach during one lung ventilation in thoracic surgery: a physiological study [^114bPb2o]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

During one-lung ventilation (OLV) in the lateral decubitus position for thoracic surgery, hypoxemia may occur in almost 10% of patients, due to the total collapse of the non-dependent lung and, eventually, to atelectasis in the ventilated, dependent lung. We recently demonstrated that a recruitment strategy applied to the dependent lung followed by a moderate PEEP level results in significant alveolar recruitment, increased arterial oxygenation and reduction of the respiratory system elastance (E RS), without hemodynamic impairment. Our data are in agreement with reports from several physiological studies, however little is still known on how to perform recruitment and set PEEP in this context. Recent physiological data suggest that immediately after the recruitment maneuver (RM), PEEP should be titrated through a decremental trial, in order to optimize respiratory mechanics while minimizing alveolar over distension. This approach, originally proposed for patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), is designated as the "open lung approach" (OLA). Its physiological rationale is that alveolar recruitment is a pan-inspiratory phenomenon, so that a maximal inflation is needed to reverse lung atelectasis. Furthermore, due to the hysteresis between the inspiratory and expiratory volume-pressure curve, in the OLA approach, PEEP is titrated in the expiratory limb of the respiratory system volume-pressure curve, immediately after obtaining the maximal recruitment.

A key point in understanding the effects of the OLA strategy is the partitioning between lung and chest wall mechanical properties, through the measurement of transpulmonary pressure (P L), i.e. the lung distending pressure: in clinical conditions, P L allows to evaluate the influence of chest wall mechanics on lung volumes and airway pressures. For a given airway opening pressure (P AO), pleural pressure (P PL) varies depending on the amount of lung compression exerted by the chest wall. Therefore, when the chest wall compression rises, P L drops and lungs may be underinflated, independently from the level of P AO. We recently demonstrated that OLA applied during laparoscopic surgery was associated with a significant increase in P L and improvement in gas exchange, suggesting that PEEP and transpulmonary pressure are important determinants of respiratory mechanics.

Postoperative extracorporeal circulatory life support (ECLS) after lung transplantation — clinical background and evidence base: Reported indications have expanded from initial use for new-onset primary graft dysfunction (PGD) to include postoperative prolongation for intraoperative cardiopulmonary dysfunction, prophylactic extension for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with end-stage lung disease (ESLD), and adjunct use with a protective ventilation strategy for airway complications. The data regarding postoperative ECLS utilization are mixed, with most recommendations resulting from single-center retrospective studies, and a recent American Association of Thoracic Surgery (AATS) consensus provided guidance but used a sample population of experts from a single speciality.

### Lung protective strategies in anaesthesia [^1153zaV9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Patients are at risk for several types of lung injury in the perioperative period including atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anaesthetic management can cause, exacerbate, or ameliorate these injuries. This review examines the effects of perioperative mechanical ventilation and its role in ventilator-induced lung injury. Lung protective ventilatory strategies to specific clinical situations such as cardiopulmonary bypass and one-lung ventilation along with newer novel lung protective strategies are discussed.

### Error traps in pediatric one-lung ventilation [^1161CEqq]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

With the advent of thoracoscopic surgery, the benefits of lung isolation in children have been increasingly recognized. However, because of the small airway dimensions, equipment limitations in size and maneuverability, and limited respiratory reserve, one-lung ventilation in children remains challenging. This article highlights some of the most common error traps in the management of pediatric lung isolation and focuses on practical solutions for their management. The error traps discussed are as follows: (1) the failure to take into consideration relevant aspects of tracheobronchial anatomy when selecting the size of the lung isolation device, (2) failure to execute correct placement of the device chosen for lung isolation, (3) failure to maintain lung isolation related to surgical manipulation and isolation device movement, (4) failure to select appropriate ventilator strategies during one-lung ventilation, and (5) failure to appropriately manage and treat hypoxemia in the setting of one-lung ventilation.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^1162VG4X]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The main objective of this survey was to determine the strategies of ventilatory support during and after OLV. Compared with the Italian study reported 6 years ago, more Taiwanese thoracic anesthesiologists ventilated the patients using the dual-controlled ventilatory modes (PRVC or PCV-VG mode) during OLV, which might be a reflection of increased availability of these novel ventilatory modes in clinical anesthesia. These dual-controlled modes deliver the preset tidal volumes with lowest optimal airway pressure, which may theoretically reduce the risk of barotrauma. Although several clinical studies have suggested that dual-controlled modes enhanced oxygenation parameters with improved respiratory mechanics during OLV in general population and elderly, large-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm the overall pulmonary protective outcomes of the dual-controlled ventilatory modes during OLV and at the lung recruitment phase.

### The impact of different inspired oxygen concentrations combined with nebulized prostaglandin E1 on oxygenation in patients undergoing one-lung ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^115BEvBU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During OLV, the core elements of anesthesia management include adequate oxygenation and lung protection. Effectively reducing the risk of hypoxemia during OLV and minimizing oxidative stress damage caused by high FiO 2 are two critical yet seemingly contradictory aspects of lung protection research during OLV. Regarding the appropriate level of FiO 2 during OLV, clear clinical guidelines are currently lacking. When performing OLV, a protective ventilation strategy should strictly control FiO 2. While ensuring adequate oxygenation, efforts should be made to maintain FiO 2 at the lowest possible level. FiO 2 reduction should start from a baseline below 1.0 to mitigate oxidative stress damage exacerbated by high-concentration oxygen inhalation. This study demonstrates that pre-OLV administration of 0.1 µg/kg PGE 1 to the ventilated lung reduces the required FiO 2 during OLV. The reduction in FiO 2, combined with the physiological effects of PGE 1, not only contributes to a decrease in the Qs/Qt, improved oxygenation, and a lower incidence of hypoxemia but also reduces the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), leading to a reduction in the CPIS.

Studies have indicated that inhaling high FiO 2 during general anesthesia has adverse effects on the human body, and it is recommended to use ventilation with FiO 2 not exceeding 0.6. Additionally, ROCCA reported that the minimum FiO 2 during OLV can be as low as 0.4. Therefore, the FiO 2 values set in this study were 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6. PGE₁ acts as a selective pulmonary vasodilator by activating adenylate cyclase, increasing cyclic AMP, and reducing intracellular calcium. This preferentially dilates vessels in the ventilated lung, redirecting perfusion away from the non-ventilated lung and lowering Qs/Qt. Previous studies have reported that PGE 1 can help maintain adequate oxygenation in OLV patients with FiO 2 0.6, but it remains unclear how low an FiO 2 PGE 1 can help OLV patients tolerate. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of different FiO 2 levels on oxygenation and Qs/Qt in OLV patients after pre-OLV nebulized inhalation of 0.1 µg/kg PGE 1 in the ventilated lung, to determine the optimal FiO 2 value.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^111krDFA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Two other nationwide surveys were reported by the Italian and Taiwanese groups. These two retrospective studies found that more than 90% of the Italian and Taiwanese centers used a DLT as their first choice for intraoperative OLV (90–96%). Consistent with these previous reports, our study also found that only 6.2% of the Taiwanese thoracic anesthesiologists would prefer to use a bronchial blocker for selective lung ventilation during thoracic surgery. A total of 39% of the Italian centers recommended epidural analgesia for postoperative pain management. Our study found that 43.8% of the participated centers performed loco-regional blocks for postoperative pain control. According to the American Pain Society clinical practice guidelines, thoracic epidural analgesia is considered as the most effective route for thoracic pain control and should be routinely considered for management of surgical pain after thoracotomy. In the recent two decades, minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), which is associated with minimal tissue injury, have been widely adapted by the thoracic surgeons. Therefore, less invasive loco-regional techniques are the more favorable approaches than epidural analgesia for VATS. Since majority of the thoracic surgeries are currently underwent using the minimally invasive techniques in Taiwan, the fact that more than half of these centers used parenteral analgesic techniques instead of epidural analgesia as the first-line analgesia method is therefore reasonable. Nevertheless, loco-regional block techniques, such as paravertebral block, intercostal block and serratus anterior plane block, for perioperative pain control after VATS or other minimally invasive thoracic procedures should be vigorously promoted in the Taiwan medical institutes in order to enhance more effective postoperative pain relief, shift toward opioid-free analgesia, and prevent the development of chronic pain syndromes. Furthermore, direct comparisons of the anesthesia management for thoracic surgery between these studies might be inappropriate, as the standards of anesthesia care have changed after the introduction of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols and other clinical pathways.

### One-lung ventilation with a bronchial blocker in thoracic patients [^114uoype]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung isolation is a surgical technique used in a multitude of surgeries, including thoracic procedures such as lobectomies, pneumonectomies, pulmonary resections and lung transplants to allow one-lung ventilation and maximum collapse of the contralateral lung and make it possible for the surgeon to visualize and gain access to critical anatomical structures.

Among the available alternatives for airway management, double-lumen tubes (DLTs) are considered the gold standard for achieving one-lung ventilation. However, some of their design characteristics, such as their stiffness, diameter and distal curvature can at times make them difficult to insert and may result in early complications such as hypoxemia, soreness of the throat and injury to the airway.

Several authors have found bronchial blockers (BBs) to be a safe and effective alternative leading to fewer adverse events, and are mainly indicated for difficult airways, patients with tracheostomy or intubated patients. Other studies, nevertheless, have reported drawbacks associated with their use, such as the length of time required for inserting the device and achieving pulmonary collapse, the need for a higher rate of device repositionings and their higher cost compared to DLTs. Given partly to the scarcity of evidence in the literature and the variability in approaches and sample sizes, there is currently no consensus as to the superiority of one technique over the other, with available literature reporting contradictory results.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the authors' experience of the use of BBs in patients undergoing thoracic surgery over the past seven years, analyzing their effectiveness and safety, as well as the potential relationship between pulmonary collapse and a series of patient- and procedure-related parameters.

### A meta-analysis of intraoperative ventilation strategies to prevent pulmonary complications: is low tidal volume alone sufficient to protect healthy lungs? [^112FiS7c]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical benefits of intraoperative low tidal volume (LTV) mechanical ventilation with concomittent positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and intermittent recruitment maneuvers-termed "protective lung ventilation" (PLV)-have not been investigated systematically in otherwise healthy patients undergoing general anesthesia.

Methods

Our group performed a meta-analysis of 16 studies (n = 1054) comparing LTV (n = 521) with conventional lung ventilation (n = 533) for associated postoperative incidence of atelectasis, lung infection, acute lung injury (ALI), and length of hospital stay. A secondary analysis of 3 studies comparing PLV (n = 248) with conventional lung ventilation (n = 247) was performed.

Results

Although intraoperative LTV ventilation was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative lung infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16–0.68; P = 0.003) compared with a conventional strategy, no difference was noted between groups in incidence of postoperative ALI (OR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.10–1.52; P = 0.17) or atelectasis (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.26–2.81; P = 0.80). Analysis of trials involving protective ventilation (LTV + PEEP + recruitment maneuvers) showed a statistically significant reduction in incidence of postoperative lung infection (OR = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09–0.50; P = 0.0003), atelectasis (OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.64; P = 0.006), and ALI (OR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04–0.61; P = 0.008) and length of hospital stay (Mean Difference = -2.08; 95% CI, -3.95 to -0.21; P = 0.03) compared with conventional ventilation.

Conclusions

Intraoperative LTV ventilation in conjunction with PEEP and intermittent recruitment maneuvers is associated with significantly improved clinical pulmonary outcomes and reduction in length of hospital stay in otherwise healthy patients undergoing general surgery. Providers should consider application of all the 3 elements for a comprehensive protective ventilation strategy.

### International consensus recommendations for anesthetic and intensive care management of lung transplantation. An EACTAIC, SCA, ISHLT, ESOT, ESTS, and AST approved document [^112G9Vn6]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Lung allograft intraoperative ventilation — practice should avoid injurious large tidal volumes, high inspiratory pressures, and low PEEP strategies and should employ lung protective and open concept ventilation strategies, including low tidal volumes below 6 mL/kg PBW, recruitment maneuvers, and appropriate PEEP, while also considering driving pressures and stress index and the influence of high PEEP on pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular function. Both volume controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation modes are acceptable, although the panel believes that pressure-controlled ventilation has potential clinical benefits as it may result in lower peak airway pressures, more homogenous gas exchange, and reduced regional over-distension. Beyond recipient characteristics, donor body weight and allograft size should also be taken into consideration, especially in undersized grafts where normal ventilation may cause ventilator-induced lung injury. Ventilation of the allograft should avoid high FiO2 for prolonged periods, and FiO2 should be kept as low as possible to achieve SpO2 > 90 and PaO2 > 60 mm Hg, balanced by maintaining adequate O2 delivery, SmvO2 particularly in the setting of perioperative end-organ dysfunction.

### Nonintubated spontaneous ventilation versus intubated mechanical ventilation anesthesia for video-assisted thoracic surgery in terms of perioperative complications and practitioners' workload assessments: a pilot randomized control study [^112aHdHh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been developed and widely used due to minor trauma and rapid recovery. The uniportal approach is a more minimally invasive form of VATS. Conventional VATS is commonly performed under double-lumen intubated anesthesia with one-lung ventilation as the standard technique. This technique can fully expose the surgical field and perfectly isolate the operative lung, and may also leads to intubation- and mechanical ventilation (MV)-induced injuries.

Nonintubated spontaneous ventilation (NI-SV) anesthesia with a laryngeal mask (LMA) may be a suitable alternative to conventional intubated mechanical ventilation (I-MV) anesthesia with a double-lumen tube (DLT) for VATS in selected patients. Evidence has demonstrated the potential advantages of nonintubated VATS, such as reduced intubation- and MV-related complications, avoidance of postoperative muscle paralysis due to muscle relaxant residues, decreased opioid-related side effects, and enhanced recovery after surgery. However, the advantages and safety of this nonintubated strategy have not been fully confirmed. Thus, at present, the NI-SV strategy has not yet been routinely adopted for VATS, mainly owing to the potential risk of an unsafe airway and the concerns of poor surgical conditions, which emphasize the need for anesthesiologists to be vigilant of the surgical process and to act accordingly for providing the adequate anesthetic conditions.

Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and feasibility of NI-SV anesthesia with an LMA compared to I-MV anesthesia with a DLT in uniportal VATS, with a focus on perioperative complications and practitioners' workload evaluation for both scenarios. Based on the hypothesis that adequate SV and adequate intraoperative anesthetic conditions are fraught with difficulties when administering NI-SV anesthesia for VATS, the occurrence of intraoperative airway intervention events was investigated for both intervention strategies, including conversion to mechanical ventilation or intubation under NI-SV anesthesia and repositioning of the DLT and double-lung ventilation under I-MV anesthesia.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^11124MEi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are a number of limitations with this study. First, the case scenario of lung tumor proposed in section 2 of the questionnaire specified that the lung resection was performed with VATS. Therefore, the data collected in the study may not be applicable to anesthesia and ventilatory care for patients receiving open thoracotomies. Secondly, this study analyzed the opinions of anesthesiologists in perioperative care for general patients. Patients with other underlying disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may need individualized ventilatory support strategy for thoracic surgery. Thirdly, all responses were based on the expert opinion or clinical experience of the participating thoracic anesthesiologists and could be subject to respondent bias. The optimal ventilatory settings or indices during OLV (e.g. Vt, PAP, PEEP and FiO 2) suggested by the anesthesiologists could be arbitrary or not evidence based. Fourthly, this study primarily aimed to analyze the expert opinions of thoracic anesthesiologists on the anesthesia care and ventilatory support during thoracic surgery requiring OLV. Other unexpected perioperative adverse events such as surgical-related injury, severe bleeding, unstable hemodynamics, hypothermia, delirium or drug-responses that could influence the general outcomes of thoracic surgeries were not taken into consideration in this report. Lastly, these results might not be completely representative of the expert opinions of all the Taiwanese thoracic anesthesiologists, as some medical centers and other regional hospitals were not included in our study.

### Clinical practice of one-lung ventilation in mainland China: a nationwide questionnaire survey [^115Aq65Q]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited information is available regarding the application of lung-protective ventilation strategies during one-lung ventilation (OLV) across mainland China. A nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate this issue in current clinical practice.

Methods

The survey covered various aspects, including respondent demographics, the establishment and maintenance of OLV, intraoperative monitoring standards, and complications associated with OLV.

Results

Five hundred forty-three valid responses were collected from all provinces in mainland China. Volume control ventilation mode, 4 to 6 mL per kilogram of predictive body weight, pure oxygen inspiration, and a low-level positive end-expiratory pressure ≤ 5 cm H 2 O were the most popular ventilation parameters. The most common thresholds of intraoperative respiration monitoring were peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of 90–94%, end-tidal CO 2 of 45 to 55 mm Hg, and an airway pressure of 30 to 34 cm H 2 O. Recruitment maneuvers were traditionally performed by 94% of the respondents. Intraoperative hypoxemia and laryngeal injury were experienced by 75% and 51% of the respondents, respectively. The proportions of anesthesiologists who frequently experienced hypoxemia during OLV were 19%, 24%, and 7% for lung, cardiovascular, and esophageal surgeries, respectively. Up to 32% of respondents were reluctant to perform lung-protective ventilation strategies during OLV. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the volume-control ventilation mode and an SpO 2 intervention threshold of < 85% were independent risk factors for hypoxemia during OLV in lung and cardiovascular surgeries. In esophageal surgery, working in a tier 2 hospital and using traditional ventilation strategies were independent risk factors for hypoxemia during OLV. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in intraoperative hypoxemia during OLV between respondents who performed lung-protective ventilation strategies and those who did not.

Conclusions

Lung-protective ventilation strategies during OLV have been widely accepted in mainland China and are strongly recommended for esophageal surgery, particularly in tier 2 hospitals. Implementing volume control ventilation mode and early management of oxygen desaturation might prevent hypoxemia during OLV.

Ongoingregistered trials regarding OLV during thoracic surgery

Collapse of non-dependent lung and atelectasis of dependent lung during OLV increases intrapulmonary shunt and leads to the development of intraoperative hypoxemia. Therefore, higher oxygen fractions are more commonly supplemented during lung separation procedures than the non-thoracic surgeries. However, oxygen therapy in clinical anesthesia is considered as a two-edged sword and excessive oxygen supplement should be avoided to prevent the potential oxygen toxicity, as potentially preventable hyperoxemia is considered as a SpO 2 greater than 98%, despite a FiO 2 of more than 0.21. An observational study found that higher FiO 2 during OLV was associated with significantly higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.04–1.65). High quality-controlled studies are thus essential to compare the clinical outcomes of low versus high fractions of oxygen used for OLV.

Current clinical practice guidelines recommend that a tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg predicted body weight and an optimal PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O are the most important ventilatory indices to guide intraoperative lung protection during mechanical ventilation in general population and obese patients. However, consensus on the individual ventilatory parameters that are considered as lung protective during OLV is still lacking. Our results found that the Taiwanese thoracic anesthesiologists concern that there is currently no common consensus in the intraoperative lung protective ventilation during thoracic surgery, particularly at the OLV phase. These anesthesiologists have diverse agreement to recommend the most important ventilator-derived parameters (i.e. tidal volume, PAP, PEEP and ∆P) for the guidance of lung protection during OLV (degrees of agreement: Vt > PAP > PEEP > FiO2 > ∆P > mode > recruitment; Fig. 2). In fact, a number of prospective randomized controlled trials are currently undertaking, including several international multicenter studies, to determine the strategy for lung protective ventilation during thoracic surgery (Table 2).

### Individualised, perioperative open-lung ventilation strategy during one-lung ventilation (iPROVE-OLV): a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial [^115ET7xq]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether individualisation of the perioperative open-lung approach (OLA) to ventilation reduces postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing lung resection. We compared a perioperative individualised OLA (iOLA) ventilation strategy with standard lung-protective ventilation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised controlled trial enrolled patients scheduled for open or video-assisted thoracic surgery using one-lung ventilation in 25 participating hospitals in Spain, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, and Ecuador. Eligible adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) were randomly assigned to receive iOLA or standard lung-protective ventilation. Eligible patients (stratified by centre) were randomly assigned online by local principal investigators, with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Treatment with iOLA included an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre to 40 cm H 2 O of end-inspiratory pressure followed by individualised positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrated to best respiratory system compliance, and individualised postoperative respiratory support with high-flow oxygen therapy. Participants allocated to standard lung-protective ventilation received combined intraoperative 4 cm H 2 O of PEEP and postoperative conventional oxygen therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of severe postoperative pulmonary complications within the first 7 postoperative days, including atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy, severe respiratory failure, contralateral pneumothorax, early extubation failure (rescue with continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or reintubation), acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary infection, bronchopleural fistula, and pleural empyema. Due to trial setting, data obtained in the operating and postoperative rooms for routine monitoring were not blinded. At 24 h, data were acquired by an investigator blinded to group allocation. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03182062, and is complete.

Between Sept 11, 2018, and June 14, 2022, we enrolled 1380 patients, of whom 1308 eligible patients (670 [434 male, 233 female, and three with missing data] assigned to iOLA and 638 [395 male, 237 female, and six with missing data] to standard lung-protective ventilation) were included in the final analysis. The proportion of patients with the composite outcome of severe postoperative pulmonary complications within the first 7 postoperative days was lower in the iOLA group compared with the standard lung-protective ventilation group (40 [6%] vs 97 [15%], relative risk 0·39 [95% CI 0·28 to 0·56]), with an absolute risk difference of -9·23 (95% CI -12·55 to -5·92). Recruitment manoeuvre-related adverse events were reported in five patients.

Interpretation

Among patients subjected to lung resection under one-lung ventilation, iOLA was associated with a reduced risk of severe postoperative pulmonary complications when compared with conventional lung-protective ventilation.

### Clinical practice of one-lung ventilation in mainland China: a nationwide questionnaire survey [^115QjfoA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

One-lung ventilation (OLV), typically achieved by placing a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLET) or bronchial blockers, plays a critical role in cardiothoracic surgery by providing optimal surgical exposure and protection of the nonoperated lung. Currently, lung protective ventilation strategies (LPVSs), characterized by low tidal volume, permissible hypercapnia, individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), recruitment maneuvers, and low inspiratory oxygen concentrations, have become increasingly popular worldwide. Studies have also reported that the perioperative application of LPVS can ameliorate ventilation-induced lung injury, reduce postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), and improve patient outcomes, especially in those at high risk for PPCs. However, no consensus or guidelines for LPVSs during OLV have been achieved. Ongoing debates persist regarding the benefit of the ventilation strategy and how to set the proper perioperative ventilation parameters.

Hypoxia is one of the most common complications during and after OLV, affecting 3.6–10.0% of patients undergoing OLV, and leads to cerebral dysfunction, myocardium ischemia, arrhythmia, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to inhibited hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), hypoxia may be partially caused by airway problems, preexisting lung malfunction, and inappropriate ventilation strategies (high tidal volume, zero PEEP, etc.). Additional risk factors for intraoperative hypoxemia in cardiothoracic surgery include the side of surgery, surgical position, and the volume of the excised lung.

This study aimed to explore the routine strategy for establishing and maintaining OLV in cardiothoracic surgery in China through a nationwide questionnaire survey and to identify the risk factors for intraoperative hypoxia during OLV in clinical practice using the lung isolation technique.

### Driving pressure during thoracic surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^114GQ7F1]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

What We Already Know About This Topic

Driving pressure (plateau minus end-expiratory airway pressure) is a target in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and is proposed as a target during general anesthesia for patients with normal lungs. It has not been reported for thoracic anesthesia where isolated, inflated lungs may be especially at risk.

What This Article Tells Us That Is New

In a double-blinded, randomized trial (292 patients), minimized driving pressure compared with standard protective ventilation was associated with less postoperative pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Background

Recently, several retrospective studies have suggested that pulmonary complication is related with driving pressure more than any other ventilatory parameter. Thus, the authors compared driving pressure-guided ventilation with conventional protective ventilation in thoracic surgery, where lung protection is of the utmost importance. The authors hypothesized that driving pressure-guided ventilation decreases postoperative pulmonary complications more than conventional protective ventilation.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized, controlled study, 292 patients scheduled for elective thoracic surgery were included in the analysis. The protective ventilation group (n = 147) received conventional protective ventilation during one-lung ventilation: tidal volume 6ml/kg of ideal body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5cm H2O, and recruitment maneuver. The driving pressure group (n = 145) received the same tidal volume and recruitment, but with individualized PEEP which produces the lowest driving pressure (plateau pressure-PEEP) during one-lung ventilation. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications based on the Melbourne Group Scale (at least 4) until postoperative day 3.

Results

Melbourne Group Scale of at least 4 occurred in 8 of 145 patients (5.5%) in the driving pressure group, as compared with 18 of 147 (12.2%) in the protective ventilation group (P = 0.047, odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.99). The number of patients who developed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome was less in the driving pressure group than in the protective ventilation group (10/145 [6.9%] vs. 22/147 [15.0%], P = 0.028, odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92).

Conclusions

Application of driving pressure-guided ventilation during one-lung ventilation was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications compared with conventional protective ventilation in thoracic surgery.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^111rNhKV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The thoracic anesthesiologists in Taiwan share certain general consensuses in regard to the practice in the ventilatory care during thoracic anesthesia. However, the clinical evidence in supporting the beneficial outcomes of the current lung protective strategies used during OLV is apparently insufficient. Several large-scale clinical trials are currently undertaking in thoracic surgery to evaluate the pulmonary protective ventilatory strategy during OLV and lung recruitment. There is an essential need to make a call for generating evidence-based practice guideline regarding intraoperative lung protective ventilation for thoracic anesthesia.

### Single-lung ventilation in pediatric anesthesia [^116Y8j6W]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Single-lung ventilation is requested for an increasing spectrum of surgical procedures in infants and children. A clear understanding of the physiology of single-lung ventilation, the techniques of lung separation, and the technical skill necessary to apply these techniques are essential for an anesthesiologist practicing thoracic anesthesia. This article focuses on various devices available for single-lung ventilation in the pediatric age group, the relevant respiratory physiology, and the strategies that optimize oxygenation during one-lung anesthesia.

### Reducing tidal volume and increasing positive end-expiratory pressure with constant plateau pressure during one-lung ventilation: effect on oxygenation [^1149LuTV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It is no longer safe to use large tidal volumes (V(T)) (> 8 mL kg(-1)) for one-lung ventilation (OLV), and limiting plateau pressure should be a major objective. Due to the specificity of OLV, the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) remains controversial. This study determined whether at the same low plateau pressure, reducing V(T) and increasing PEEP were not inferior to larger V(T) and lower PEEP ventilation in terms of oxygenation.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, non-inferiority, cross-over trial included 88 patients undergoing open thoracotomy who received two successive ventilatory strategies in random order: V(T) (8 mL kg(-1) of ideal body weight) with low PEEP (5 cm H(2)O), or low V(T) (5 mL kg(-1)) with a high PEEP. Respiratory rate and PEEP were, respectively, adjusted to maintain constant ventilation and plateau pressure. The primary endpoint was the ratio under each ventilatory strategy.

Results

The non-inferiority of low-V(T) ventilation could not be established. The mean adjusted ratio was lower overall during low-V(T) ventilation, and differences between the two ventilatory modes varied significantly according to baseline (T0). Decreased oxygenation during low V(T) was smaller when baseline values were low. Systolic arterial pressure was not lower during low-V(T) ventilation.

Conclusion

During OLV, lowering V(T) and increasing PEEP, with the same low plateau pressure, reduced oxygenation compared with larger V(T) and lower PEEP. This strategy may reduce the risk of lung injury, but needs to be investigated further.

### Anesthesia for patients undergoing anesthesia for elective thoracic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: a consensus statement from the Israeli society of anesthesiologists [^113hr8UB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Anesthesia for thoracic surgery requires specialist intervention to provide adequate operating conditions and one-lung ventilation. The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted by aerosol and droplet spread. Because of its virulence, there is a risk of transmission to healthcare workers if appropriate preventive measures are not taken. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may show no clinical signs at the early stages of the disease or even remain asymptomatic for the whole course of the disease. Despite the lack of symptoms, they may be able to transfer the virus. Unfortunately, during current COVID-19 testing procedures, about 30% of tests are associated with a false-negative result. For these reasons, standard practice is to assume all patients are COVID-19 positive regardless of swab results. Here, the authors present the recommendations produced by the Israeli Society of Anesthesiologists for use in thoracic anesthesia for elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic for both the general population and COVID-19-confirmed patients. The objective of these recommendations is to make changes to some routine techniques in thoracic anesthesia to augment patients' and the medical staff's safety.

### Current practice of thoracic anaesthesia in Europe-a survey by the European society of anaesthesiology part I-airway management and regional anaesthesia techniques [^114v16R6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This Europe-wide survey yields multiple important insights and regional differences with regard to the structures of care in thoracic anaesthesia.

Especially in comparison to Western Europe, there was a high number of Northern European respondents working in university hospitals (76.4%). Based on these results, one might speculate that in contrast to Western Europe, Northern European nations perform intrathoracic operations predominantly at large specialized university centres. This hypothesis could be further supported by the high rate of specialized thoracic surgeons and the number of respondents performing lung transplantations in Northern Europe. In contrast, general surgeons certified for thoracic surgery are commonly performing intrathoracic operations in Western Europe (40.5%). It would be interesting, to investigate the impact of specialization of care in thoracic centres with highly qualified personnel and high case numbers on patient-centred outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality.

The DLT was most commonly chosen for lung separation and there was a high level of expertise. Considering that DLT intubations may be difficult in 2.8% of cases, a structured approach to difficult airway management of a DLT in thoracic anaesthesia is necessary. According to our results, this was rarely the case. While regular difficult airway algorithms are widely available and useful to ensure adequate oxygenation, in case of thoracic anaesthesia the frequent need for lung separation and one-lung ventilation needs to be taken into account. In thoracic anaesthesia, in addition to the establishment of a safe airway for oxygenation of the patient, there is also the need for lung separation and one-lung ventilation. The three areas of securing the airway, lung separation and one-lung ventilation are so complex that, in the authors' view, a detailed European recommendation would be necessary, as our survey showed a very heterogeneous approach in Europe. In this survey, we focused mainly on the airway and did not look in detail at the issue of one-lung ventilation.

### Efficiency and safety of double-lumen bronchial tube and bronchial blocker for one-lung ventilation in patients with thoracic surgery: a meta-analysis [^115VYDdJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One-lung ventilation (OLV) has become a standard technique in thoracic surgery, playing a crucial role in ensuring both a clear surgical field and the safety of the patient. It not only allows the surgeon to maintain an unobstructed view during procedures but also prevents the passage of sputum or blood from the operative lung into the healthy lung, thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination and infection. Additionally, OLV helps maintain adequate gas exchange during fluctuations in lung compliance, minimizes intraoperative complications, and enhances the overall safety and efficiency of thoracic surgeries. The selection of appropriate lung isolation devices, along with the mastery of proper operational techniques, is fundamental to achieving effective OLV and ensuring patient safety. Among the available tools, the double-lumen bronchial tube (DLBT) and bronchial blocker (BB) are the two most commonly employed devices for lung isolation during OLV.

### The effects of thoracic epidural analgesia on oxygenation and pulmonary shunt fraction during one-lung ventilation: an meta-analysis [^112n5AmE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

All experimental procedures listed below were approved by the Ethics Committee of China Medical University and were performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (the World Medical Association, Finland, created in 1964 and revised 2013).

Literature review

This meta-analysis was performed with a prospective protocol (outline below) using recommended literature search strategies incorporating multiple search terms. The literature search was performed in EMBAS, MEDLINE and the Cochrane central register of Controlled Trials databases published from Jan 1990 to Jan 2014 for the trials related to thoracic epidural anesthesia. Thoracic epidural analgesia, thoracic epidural block or 'epidural-general' were combined with procedure specific search terms (one-lung ventilation, intrapulmonary shunt) and limited by Human and Clinical trials. For the TEA portion, MESH term thorax, epidural, anesthesia AND text word thoracic epidural anesthesia were used and combined with OR (n = 1603). MESH term thorax, analgesia, epidural and the word thoracic epidural analgesia were used and combined with OR (n = 1292). MESH term lung, ventilation, respiration and text word one lung ventilation were used to search the database and combined with the term OR (7902). The primary investigations of 14 trials were acquired when all search terms were combined with the term AND. Each was then further checked by another two authors for any additional studies, as were the author's personal files for additional references that met all inclusion criteria.

### A nationwide survey of intraoperative management for one-lung ventilation in Taiwan: time to accountable for diversity in protective lung ventilation [^116SmY3W]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a major paradigm shift for intraoperative mechanical ventilator support by the introduction of lung protective ventilation strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and improve overall clinical outcomes in non-thoracic surgeries. However, there is currently a lack of standardized practice guideline for lung protection during thoracic surgeries that require one-lung ventilation (OLV). This study aimed to collect the expert opinions of the thoracic anesthesiologists in perioperative care for OLV surgery in Taiwan.

Methods

This prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken in 16 tertiary hospitals in Taiwan from January to February 2019. A structured survey form was distributed across the participating hospitals and the thoracic anesthesiologists were invited to complete the form voluntarily. The survey form consisted of three parts, including the basic information of the institutional anesthesia care standards, ventilatory settings for a proposed patient receiving OLV surgery and expert opinions on OLV.

Results

A total of 71 thoracic anesthesiologists responded to the survey. Double-lumen tubes are the most commonly used (93.8%) airway devices for OLV. The most commonly recommended ventilator setting during OLV is a tidal volume of 6–7 ml/kg PBW (67.6%) and a PEEP level of 4–6 cmH 2 O (73.5%). Dual controlled ventilator modes are used by 44.1% of the anesthesiologists. During OLV, high oxygen fraction (FiO 2 > 0.8) is more commonly supplemented to achieve an oxygen saturation higher than 94%. The consensus of anesthesiologists on the indices for lung protection in thoracic surgery is considerably low. Large majority of the anesthesiologists (91.5%) highly recommend that an international clinical practice guideline on the protective lung ventilation strategy for thoracic anesthesia should be established.

Conclusions

This study found that the thoracic anesthesiologists in Taiwan share certain common practices in ventilator support during OLV. However, they are concerned about the lack of fundamental clinical evidences to support the beneficial outcomes of the current lung protective strategies applicable to OLV. Large-scale trials are needed to form an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for thoracic anesthesia.

### Modern anesthetic techniques for thoracic operations [^112wdwvj]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Continuing advances in anesthesiology enable surgeons to perform more and more complex operations. Nowhere is this relation more important than for the patient undergoing thoracic surgery. Specialized anesthetic techniques including safe lung separation, the maintenance of oxygenation during selective one-lung ventilation, and effective postoperative analgesia allow procedures such as lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation to be performed routinely. This paper reviews modern clinical practices in the field of thoracic anesthesia.

### Anesthesia management of a patient with a unilateral absence of the left pulmonary artery who underwent right lung cancer surgery: a case report and literature review [^1148fYd5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the surgical management of UAPA complicated by contralateral lung cancer, one-lung ventilation (OLV) poses an inescapable challenge with significantly elevated risks. During OLV, the contralateral healthy lung is prone to inducing pulmonary hypertension if exposed to overventilation or volume injury, while the non-functional affected lung cannot assist in sharing the ventilatory load. Reviewing the four reported cases of contralateral lesions (Table 1), 3 required conversion to two-lung ventilation or open thoracotomy due to inadequate oxygenation during OLV. To address this challenge, this case innovatively employed a bronchial blocker to precisely isolate the target lobe (right lower lobe). This approach aligns with the technical principles of targeted lung isolation in complex thoracic surgeries, as previously described in Amar et al.'s study, where segmental lung isolation was successfully applied in a postpneumonectomy patient undergoing contralateral lung resection to optimize ventilation-perfusion matching. Similar to their experience, our strategy avoided potential airway trauma from double-lumen endotracheal tubes and allowed continuous ventilation of non-target lobes (right upper and middle lobes). Intraoperatively, a strategy of low tidal volume (4–6 mL/kg), intermittent lung recruitment, and 5 cmH 2 O PEEP was adopted, successfully maintaining effective oxygenation (SpO 2 consistently > 95%) while minimizing mechanical injury to the healthy lung. Compared to conventional double-lumen tube techniques, this strategy offered enhanced flexibility, preserved the option for segmental-level isolation if needed, and significantly reduced the risk of postoperative airway complications, particularly in elderly patients.

### Effects of the disconnection technique and preemptive one-lung ventilation on lung collapse during one-lung ventilation in thoracoscopic surgery [^1116akaR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Preoperative preparations and anaesthesia protocol

Upon arrival at the operating room, venous and arterial access was established, and the invasive arterial blood pressure (Edwards TruWave PX260), heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and other basic vital signs were obtained. After denitrogenation for 5 min, anaesthesia was induced with 0.3–0.5 µg/kg of sufentanil, 0.03–0.05 mg/kg of midazolam, 0.2–0.3 mg/kg of etomidate, and 0.15–0.2 mg/kg of cisatracurium. The patients were intubated with a nonoperative lateral double-lumen tube (DLT). Commonly used pulmonary isolation tools include double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blocker, and there is insufficient evidence to show a difference in lung collapse. Both have their own advantages, disadvantages, and indications, but in general, double-lumen tracheal catheters are often preferred because they can be inserted quickly, are less prone to displacement, and allow for the suctioning of secretions from either lung. We therefore chose the double-lumen endotracheal tube as the lung isolation tool, the DLT was selected based on the preoperative chest CT scan, sex, and height. The correct position of the tube was verified using a fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) both after intubation and after the patient was positioned. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, propofol and remifentanil, as indicated by a BIS between 40 and 50. Cisatracurium was administered intermittently to maintain neuromuscular blockade. Perioperative blood pressure control is maintained within 20% above or below baseline blood pressure. Two-lung ventilation (TLV) was initiated using volume-controlled ventilation: the tidal volume was 6–8 ml/kg, the respiratory rate was 12 bpm, the I/E ratio was 1:2, the positive end-expiratory pressure was 5–10 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen was 1.0. PetCO2 was maintained at 35–45 mmHg. Different strategies for OLV were implemented based on the various groupings. In group C, OLV was initiated when the surgeon commenced the skin incision and opened the lumen of the operative side. In Group D, OLV was initiated 2 min after disconnection of the DLT. This procedure started when the surgeon performed the skin incision. If the time to open the pleura exceeded 120 s or if the pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) decreased from the previous level, the study was stopped, and the ventilator was connected immediately. In group P, OLV was initiated promptly after the patient was turned to the lateral position while the bronchial tube port was clamped on the operative side at the lateral position until pleural opening, The time between lateral position and pleural opening was recorded, which was guaranteed to be no less than six minutes. In OLV, the tidal volume was 4–6 ml/kg, the respiratory rate was 12–15 breaths/min, the PEEP was 5–10 cmH2O, the I/E ratio was 1:2, and the fraction of inspired oxygen was 1.0. PetCO2 was maintained at 35–45 mmHg. We did not utilize negative pressure suction to facilitate lung collapse because the optimal suction pressure suction pressure, suction time are not clear, and no studies have clearly established whether it can cause occult lung injury.

### Prophylactic protective ventilation: lower tidal volumes for all critically ill patients? [^1163ABDF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

High tidal volumes have historically been recommended for mechanically ventilated patients during general anesthesia. High tidal volumes have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Barriers exist in implementing a tidal volume reduction strategy related to the inherent difficulty in changing one's practice patterns, to the current need to individualize low tidal volume settings only for a specific subgroup of mechanically ventilated patients (i.e. ARDS patients), the difficulty in determining the predicated body weight (requiring the patient's height and a complex formula). Consequently, a protective ventilation strategy is often under-utilized as a therapeutic option, even in ARDS. Recent data supports the generalization of this strategy prophylactically to almost all mechanically ventilated patients beginning immediately following intubation. Using tools to rapidly and reliably determine the predicted body weight (PBW), as well as the use of automated modes of ventilation are some of the potential solutions to facilitate the practice of protective ventilation and to finally ventilate our patients' lungs in a more gentle fashion to help prevent ARDS.

### Management of one-lung ventilation: impact of tidal volume on complications after thoracic surgery [^1171L2bN]. Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of lung-protective ventilation (LPV) strategies may minimize iatrogenic lung injury in surgical patients. However, the identification of an ideal LPV strategy, particularly during one-lung ventilation (OLV), remains elusive. This study examines the role of ventilator management during OLV and its impact on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected from the hospital electronic medical record and the Society of Thoracic Surgery database for subjects undergoing thoracic surgery with OLV between 2012 and 2014. Mean tidal volume (VT) during two-lung ventilation and OLV and ventilator driving pressure (ΔP) (plateau pressure - positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) were analyzed for the 1,019 cases that met the inclusion criteria. Associations between ventilator parameters and clinical outcomes were examined by multivariate linear regression.

Results

After the initiation of OLV, 73.3, 43.3, 18.8, and 7.2% of patients received VT greater than 5, 6, 7, and 8 ml/kg predicted body weight, respectively. One hundred and eighty-four primary and 288 secondary outcome events were recorded. In multivariate logistic regression modeling, VT was inversely related to the incidence of respiratory complications (odds ratio, 0.837; 95% CI, 0.729 to 0.958), while ΔP predicted the development of major morbidity when modeled with VT (odds ratio, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.068).

Conclusions

Low VT per se (i.e., in the absence of sufficient PEEP) has not been unambiguously demonstrated to be beneficial. The authors found that a large proportion of patients continue to receive high VT during OLV and that VT was inversely related to the incidence of respiratory complications and major postoperative morbidity. While low (physiologically appropriate) VT is an important component of an LPV strategy for surgical patients during OLV, current evidence suggests that, without adequate PEEP, low VT does not prevent postoperative respiratory complications. Thus, use of physiologic VT may represent a necessary, but not independently sufficient, component of LPV.
