## Question

What condition category is represented by ICD-10-CM code Q87.8?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition category is represented by ICD-10-CM code Q87.8. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10-CM chapter and subchapter structure to anchor the code family. Then, I should verify the exact code description and its placement within the Q87 series. Next, I will consider the clinical context and examples of syndromes captured by this code. Finally, I will double-check for any nuances or exceptions that might alter interpretation before concluding the category succinctly.

> Let me first confirm the chapter context. ICD-10-CM codes beginning with Q fall under Chapter 17, which covers congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, so Q87.8 is inherently a congenital condition code rather than an acquired disease code.

> Wait, let me verify the specific subcategory. The Q87 series denotes congenital malformation syndromes, and Q87.8 is explicitly described as "Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified", which places it among syndromic congenital anomalies that do not fit the more specific Q87.0–Q87.7 subtypes such as those predominantly affecting facial appearance, short stature, limbs, overgrowth, or Marfan syndrome [^11429UiZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical meaning without examples. I should confirm representative syndromes that map to Q87.8. The Q87 group includes entities like Alport syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Laurence-Moon syndrome, MED13L syndrome, and Kleefstra syndrome, and when these are not captured by a more specific Q87 subcode, they are appropriately assigned to Q87.8 as "other specified" syndromes, reinforcing that Q87.8 functions as a residual category for recognized syndromes lacking a dedicated code [^11429UiZ].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking any coding nuances. Q87.8 is a billable diagnosis code used when a documented congenital malformation syndrome is identified but does not match the narrower Q87.0–Q87.7 definitions, and it carries the same congenital implications for risk adjustment and epidemiology as other Q87 codes, which matters for pediatric complex chronic condition frameworks and surveillance systems that rely on ICD-10-CM categorization [^11429UiZ] [^114Zhwb2].

> Let me reconsider the final phrasing to be precise. Q87.8 represents congenital malformation syndromes that are specified in the record but not otherwise classified within the defined Q87 subcategories, so the most accurate short descriptor is "other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified", which aligns with ICD-10-CM tabular language and clinical usage patterns for syndromic congenital anomalies [^11429UiZ].

---

ICD-10-CM code Q87.8 denotes **other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified** [^11429UiZ]. This category includes congenital syndromes with multiple malformations that do not fit more specific Q87 subcategories, such as Alport syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Laurence-Moon syndrome [^11429UiZ]. Accurate coding of Q87.8 supports precise diagnosis, appropriate management, and reliable epidemiologic tracking of these rare, complex conditions [^112jDLPm].

---

## Clinical conditions included in Q87.8

Q87.8 encompasses several **congenital syndromes** characterized by multiple malformations, including:

- **Alport syndrome**: A hereditary nephritis with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular anomalies [^11429UiZ].
- **Bardet-Biedl syndrome**: A ciliopathy with retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal anomalies, and cognitive impairment [^11429UiZ].
- **Laurence-Moon syndrome**: Similar to Bardet-Biedl but with spastic paraplegia and absent obesity [^11429UiZ].
- **MED13L syndrome**: A neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, speech delay, and facial dysmorphism [^11429UiZ].
- **Kleefstra syndrome**: Characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features [^11429UiZ].

These syndromes share **multisystem involvement** and often have genetic underpinnings, underscoring the importance of precise diagnostic coding for clinical management and genetic counseling [^115Rckfo].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical features

Diagnosis of Q87.8 conditions relies on **clinical evaluation**, genetic testing, and imaging. Common features include:

- **Multiple congenital anomalies**: Involving two or more organ systems (e.g. renal, ocular, skeletal, neurological) [^11429UiZ].
- **Genetic predisposition**: Many syndromes have identifiable genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities [^115Rckfo].
- **Familial occurrence**: A family history of similar anomalies supports diagnosis [^115Rckfo].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Conditions classified under Q87.8 often require **multidisciplinary care** due to their complexity:

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for affected individuals and families to understand inheritance patterns and reproductive risks [^notfound].
- **Specialist management**: Involvement of nephrologists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, and other specialists depending on organ involvement [^notfound].
- **Regular monitoring**: Ongoing surveillance for complications such as renal failure, vision loss, or neurological deterioration [^notfound].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

The prevalence of Q87.8 conditions varies by syndrome; many are **rare**, with some (e.g. Bardet-Biedl) affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 to 160,000 individuals. Accurate ICD-10-CM coding is critical for epidemiologic surveillance and research on these rare diseases [^112jDLPm].

---

## Coding considerations and documentation requirements

Accurate coding of Q87.8 requires:

- **Detailed clinical documentation**: Specify the syndrome or constellation of anomalies when known [^11429UiZ].
- **Genetic testing results**: Include molecular or chromosomal findings when available [^notfound].
- **Exclusion of more specific codes**: Ensure no other Q87 subcategory (e.g. Q87.0–Q87.7) applies before assigning Q87.8 [^11429UiZ].

---

## Impact on healthcare utilization and reimbursement

Q87.8 conditions often involve **complex, chronic care** with frequent specialist visits, diagnostic testing, and potential surgical interventions. Accurate coding supports appropriate reimbursement and resource allocation for these high-need patients [^116SAXmM].

---

## Recent updates and changes

Recent ICD-10-CM updates have expanded the Q87 category to include newly recognized syndromes, reflecting advances in **genetic diagnostics** and clinical recognition. Clinicians should stay informed of these updates to ensure accurate coding [^114EKZuM].

---

ICD-10-CM code Q87.8 represents **other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified**, encompassing rare, multisystem congenital syndromes. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for optimal patient care, epidemiologic tracking, and appropriate reimbursement.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^116SAXmM]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

Statistical Analysis

To derive the monthly diagnostic category prevalence rates, we first applied HHS software filtersto calendar months based on the earliest service date of each claim line. We then standardized monthly disease prevalence to eliminate variation based on the number of days in the month. In each month, we counted the number of distinct individuals with any diagnosis code in a category, divided by the number of people enrolled in that month, and multiplied by 30.437 (the mean number of days in a month) per day in the month. This upweights prevalence rates in short months, such as February and September, by between 1.5% and 8.7% and downweights 31-day months, such as October, by 1.8%. We also examined trends in available population descriptors: sample size, age, sex, preferred provider organization and health maintenance organization enrollment, and fraction in California (the state with the largest representation in our sample). This confirmed that no large changes in the study population occurred during our study period (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Therefore, we conducted all analyses without controlling for these variables.

We used piecewise linear regression models to examine level and trend changes in standardized monthly diagnostic category prevalence associated with the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition for each diagnostic category in all 3 classification systems. All regressions included time (to model secular trends), a post– ICD-10-CM indicator variable to estimate any immediate level change associated with the ICD-10-CM transition, a 2-way interaction term to determine whether the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with a change in trend, and dummy variables for each month to control for seasonality (eAppendix in the Supplement).

We conducted statistical significance tests for all diagnostic categories in each classification system. However, in this article, we focus attention on 3 common conditions: diabetes, cardiac disease, and pregnancy. Within each condition we selected 3 HHS-HCC categories that illustrate a range of observed patterns and chose clinically similar WHO chapters and AHRQ-CCS categories for comparison.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^112EVJG1]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Exotropia ICD-10 CM classifications — the page lists specific coding categories and codes: Alternating (H50.15), Alternating with A pattern (H50.16), Alternating with specified noncomitancy not elsewhere classifiable (includes alphabetical patterns) (H50.18), Alternating with V pattern (H50.17), Monocular (H50.11–), Monocular with A pattern (H50.12–), Intermittent unspecified (H50.30), Alternating, intermittent (H50.34), Monocular, intermittent (H50.33–), and Unspecified (H50.10). The notation states "CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye", and additional guidance explains that "the final character of the codes indicates laterality", that "Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes", so "if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side", and that when laterality is specified "most often you will find: Right is 1" and "Left is 2".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116Vtydx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^111q9W1H]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^114Zhwb2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

The new classification system provides significant improvements through greater detailed information and the ability to expand in order to capture additional advancements in clinical medicine. ICD-10-CM
- The diagnosis classification system developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for use in all U. S. health care treatment settings. Diagnosis coding under this system uses a different number of digits and some other changes, but the format is very much the same as ICD-9-CM. The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services has mandated industry-wide adoption of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets by Oct. 1, 2011. ICD-10-CMS will affect all components of the healthcare industry. Ambulatory surgery centers will not be affected by ICD-10-PCS unless they are utilizing ICD-9-CM volume 3 for inpatient procedures. The two major changes in the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM code sets are structure and detail.

The codes will move from a numeric five-character size to an alphanumeric seven-character size. At current count, there are approximately 17, 000 ICD-9-CM codes and the possibility of 155, 000 ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. The codes are far more specific which will allow for greater accuracy.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112dBv6L]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. The transition from ICD-9-CM was effectively instantaneous, with 99.8% of all diagnoses coded using ICD-10-CM in October 2015.

We examined study population characteristics by month from 2010 through 2017 to look for changes that might have introduced trend artifacts (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Although the number of eligible enrollees varied by year, population characteristics remained nearly constant across all months. In particular, no noteworthy changes in the number of eligible enrollees, mean age, sex, health insurance plan type, or fraction of enrollees located in California occurred at the October 2015 transition to ICD-10-CM. The proportion of enrollees with at least 1 eligible diagnosis in a month was consistent over the sample period.

Table 1 summarizes overall findings on changes in diagnostic category prevalence rates within each classification system. No large changes were observed in the WHO chapters, suggesting that overall coding practice (and population health) was relatively stable across the transition. However, the F test rejects simple linearity in favor of a model with a discontinuity in slope or trend for 11 of 17 WHO chapters (58%), identifying small changes at the ICD-10-CM transition but none that approached the threshold that we considered large (ie, ≥ 20%).

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^112dTi7a]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^113QXP77]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112fo3nV]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The HHS Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs) system was developed for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace risk adjustment payment model and is used to allocate funds among competing health plans. The HHS-HCC system used 127 condition categories for the ACA population when it was implemented from 2014 through 2017, and its mappings were updated to accommodate ICD-10-CM diagnoses in 2015. To ensure that recently added diagnostic codes were recognized, we applied the 2017 HHS-HCC software to the full range of study data for 2010 to 2017. For sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the effects of the HHS filtering logic and the 2015 HHS software with the original ICD-10-CM mappings.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS) categories are used by managed care plans, insurers, researchers, and surveillance systems for payment, quality assessment, and epidemiology. Its categories are also widely used for risk adjustment and examining disease trends. The AHRQ-CCS largely maintained its category structure with the transition to ICD-10-CM, and we used its 282 diagnostic categories appearing in our data before and after the transition applying the 2017 category mappings.

All 3 classification systems updated their diagnostic categories to accommodate ICD-10-CM. However, because only 5% of ICD-9-CM codes can be mapped 1-to-1 to ICD-10-CM and the crosswalk algorithms were developed before ICD-10-CM coding was adopted for clinical care, it was not possible to prospectively examine the continuity of diagnostic categories across the transition. For comparability across classification systems, we generated the condition categories described by Kautter et albut did not impose the hierarchies used in the HHS-HCC model.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^1164A8Vn]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^1176khwk]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, 14 discrepancies (10 in MCA, 4 in MCB) involved the 'unspecified' category. The large number of new and more detailed external cause codes in ICD-10-CM allowed some records to be reassigned to other categories by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, a single ICD-10-CM code (X58, 'exposure to other specified factors') encompasses both the concept of 'other specified (unintentional injury), not elsewhere classifiable' and the concept of unspecified unintentional injury, whereas these concepts were represented by two different codes in ICD-9-CM (E928.8 and E928.9, respectively). As a result, some records categorised as 'other specified' by the ICD-9-CM matrix were categorised as 'unspecified' by the ICD-10-CM matrix. This finding is also consistent with the Kentucky data, which showed an immediate significant increase in 'unspecified' injury hospitalisation rates and a corresponding decrease in 'other specified' injury hospitalisation rates when ICD-10-CM was implemented.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112jDLPm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^111e2TLS]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Figure 3 shows monthly diagnostic category prevalence rates for 6 selected pregnancy-related categories. Additional pregnancy-related categories are included in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. We found no change overall in the broad WHO chapter including complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (eFigure 3 in the Supplement), nor for pregnancies without complications in the HHS-HCC or AHRQ-CCS systems. The AHRQ-CCS system had a large negative level change in other complications of birth (−58.8% [95% CI, −62.6% to −55.0%]) and an increase in other complications of pregnancy (66.6% [95% CI, 61.3% to 71.9%]). No other pregnancy categories examined in the AHRQ-CCS system had large changes in level or trend (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

The diagnostic category prevalence rate per 10 000 enrollees in September 2015 is presented in the lower left corner of each panel as the reference rate. Curves are fitted with a discontinuity at October 2015. Circles indicate the normalized rate (rate of enrollees with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic category divided by the September 2015 rate); orange lines, predicted rate using a piecewise linear model; blue lines, predicted rate using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithm; AHRQ-CCS, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System; HHS-HCC, Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Category; and ICD-10-CM, International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification.

Our clinical review noted that the number of obstetrical codes doubled in ICD-10-CM vs ICD-9-CM and that the ICD-10-CM coding system was restructured to remove designation of antepartum, delivery, and postpartum status and to add separate codes to indicate weeks of gestation for ongoing pregnancies or pregnancy results for individuals who are no longer pregnant. Among HHS-HCCs, some conditions, such as breech presentation and previous cesarean delivery, were removed from the category for completed pregnancies with complications, contributing to declines in the prevalence of these diagnostic categories. In contrast, the AHRQ-CCS system adapted to the increased detail and restructuring of the obstetrical codes by adding many more specific codes to its existing categories, resulting in abrupt increases in their prevalence at the ICD-10-CM transition.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^111THQ32]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112VmNkr]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116c2FUZ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our findings have important implications for interpreting differences in billing-code-derived disease prevalence over time. For epidemiology, it is critical to distinguish between changes in actual disease prevalence and changes in coding behaviors and mappings, which are often responsible for observed changes in coded prevalence. We have seen that 3 separate, widely used classification systems made different distinctions that affected apparent diagnostic category prevalence. Given that HHS payment formulas rely on the prevalence of HCC categories to set billions of dollars in payments, our finding of many large (artifactual) changes in diagnostic category prevalence has potentially large implications for reimbursement.

Although HHS-HCCs are used for the ACA's marketplace risk adjustment payments, this study did not examine financial outcomes. Because the ACA uses risk adjustment to reallocate the available funds among plans in a given region rather than to decide on the size of the funds available (as is done in Medicare Advantage and Part D), changes in diagnostic category prevalence may have had less financial effect in the marketplace than in Medicare Advantage. Classifications used for bonus or performance evaluation are also vulnerable to large changes in level or trend when preexisting ICD-9-CM –derived formulas are used across the ICD-10-CM transition. In addition, claims-based analyses of disease prevalence may also be misleading if changes in the underlying classification system are not recognized.

Our study used the earliest mappings accommodating all valid 2017 diagnoses for the included classification systems. In 2019, the WHO, HHS, and AHRQ released new classification systems with expanded diagnostic categories designed for 2019 diagnoses. Future research will need to examine changes under these new systems. In the meantime, it is important to understand the current mappings that will continue to be used to set payments and evaluate performance for several more years.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^116FdJ2B]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^111joL6o]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia — ICD-10 CM coding categories and laterality conventions are listed as follows: Amblyopia, unspecified is H53.00–; Strabismic amblyopia (suppression) is H53.03–; Deprivation amblyopia is H53.01–; Refractive amblyopia, including anisometropic and isoametropic amblyopia, is H53.02–; and Amblyopia, suspect is H53.04–. Laterality uses the final character, with mappings "1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral; 9, eye not specified"; when laterality is specified it can appear in different digit positions, and if no bilateral code is provided for a bilateral condition, separate left and right codes are assigned; unspecified laterality can be "a 0 or 9 depending on whether it is a 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th digit".

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^114EKZuM]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Since implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) in the US, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The widely used pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) system required a major update from version 2 (V2) to version 3 (V3) to capture the range of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Objective

To update the CCC V3 system, creating V3, with new, missing, or retired codes; to reconceptualize the system's use of technology codes; and to compare CCC V3 with V2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional study examined US hospitalization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and the Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019, for all patients aged 0 to 18 years. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to April 1, 2024.

Exposures

The CCCs were identified in both data sources using the CCC V2 and V3 systems.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The (1) percentage of pediatric hospitalizations associated with a CCC, (2) numbers of CCC body-system categories per patient, and (3) explanatory power for hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared over time for V3 vs V2.

Results

Among 7 186 019 hospitalizations within PHIS, 54.3% patients were male, the median age was 4 years (IQR, 1–11 years), and 51.2% were aged 0 to 4 years). The CCC V2 identified 2 878 476 (40.1%) patients as having any CCC compared with 2 753 412 (38.3%) identified by V3. In addition, V2 identified 100 065 (1.4%) patients with transplant status compared with 146 683 (2.0%) by V3, and V2 identified 914 835 (12.7%) as having technology codes compared with 805 585 (11.2%) by V3. The 2 systems were similar in accounting for the number of CCC body-system categories per patient and in explaining variation in hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality. For both V2 and V3, 10.0% of the variance in hospital length of stay and 12.0% of the variance in in-hospital mortality was explained by the presence of a CCC. Similar patterns were observed when analyzing the 2 999 420 Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases' hospitalizations (52.3% of patients were male, the median age was 1 year [IQR, 0–12 years], and 62.0% were 0 to 4 years old), except that the percentages of identified CCCs were all lower: V2 identified 758 110 hospitalizations (25.3%) with any CCC compared with 718 100 (23.9%) identified by V3.

Conclusions and Relevance

These results suggest that, moving forward, V3 should be used to identify CCCs, and ongoing, frequent updates to V3, using a transparent, structured process, will enable V3 to accurately reflect the evolving spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^112re7WE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^111X2TSE]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^112hJ6Sx]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — ICD-10 CM classifications and coding rules include the following: open-angle glaucoma is coded as H40.10X-; primary open-angle glaucoma uses H40.111-, H40.112-, or H40.113-; low-tension glaucoma uses H40.121-, H40.122-, or H40.123-; residual stage of open-angle glaucoma uses H40.151, H40.152, or H40.153; and glaucomatous atrophy of the optic disc uses H47.231, H47.232, or H47.233. The footnote defines " = 0, stage unspecified; 1, mild stage; 2, moderate stage; 3, severe stage; 4, indeterminate stage". Additional ICD-10 CM instructions state that certain categories require a "7th character" and, if needed, "a placeholder X must be used" to ensure it is in the seventh position, that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality" and if no bilateral code exists "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and that laterality mapping is standardized as "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Uncovering the heritable components of multimorbidities and disease trajectories using a nationwide cohort [^115Rckfo]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Heritability and genetic correlation across the full spectrum of diseases

We estimated the additive genetic heritability (h²) across 866 level three ICD-10 codes fulfilling the selection criteria, adjusted for non-linear genetic effects and close environment. Across the disease areas, congenital malformations, endocrine diseases, and mental disorders had the highest heritability (Fig. 2). The ICD-10 codes with the highest heritability were diseases with known large genetic components, often with well-described specific genes known where genetic variants are known to impact diseases, such as cystic kidney disease (Q61, h² = 0.85, 0.78; 0.89 95% CI), osteochondrodysplasias (Q78, h² = 0.77, 0.66; 0.83 95% CI), and congenital malformation syndromes (Q87, h² = 0.75, 0.62; 0.82 95% CI). Looking beyond these known genetic diseases, almost 50% (N = 424 codes) of the level three ICD-10 codes displayed a heritability with a magnitude of h² > 0.1. We observed a negative correlation between the heritability and mean age of onset (⍴ = −0.24, p = 2.97e−13), as well as a small correlation to the prevalence (⍴ = −0.07, p = 0.054). Resolving the heritability at the less specific 2nd level (N = 183 codes) and more specific 4th level (N = 1519 codes) of ICD-10 supported the same pattern of heritability (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) with 63% (N = 971) Level 4 codes having h² > 0.1, indicating the importance of acquiring accurate family history for diagnoses, even outside of well-established genetic conditions. Heritability estimates across the full ICD-10 ontology are available at.

Fig. 2
Estimated additive heritability across 866 ICD10 codes at the third level.

The most heritable disease areas were congenital malformations, endocrine diseases, and mental disorders. ICD10 codes are grouped and colored according to the chapter they belong to. The center of the box plot is denoted by the median, a horizontal line dividing the box into two equal halves. The bounds of the box are defined by the lower quartile (25th percentile) and the upper quartile (75th percentile). The whiskers extend from the box and represent the data points that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the lower and upper quartiles. All data points are shown.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Development and assessment of a new framework for disease surveillance, prediction, and risk adjustment: the diagnostic items classification system [^111Y5ium]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Health systems use diagnostic codes for individual patient care as well as to validate insurance claims, calculate risk-adjusted health plan payments, establish case-mix indices, track disease prevalence, and evaluate clinician performance. In October 2015, the US expanded the number and precision of diagnoses available for coding patient conditions by more than 5-fold when it transitioned from the ninth to the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). While the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR)incorporates certain features of the new ICD-10-CM codes, it largely still reflects its origin in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification structure and does not capture the full richness of the increased detail available in the ICD-10-CM system.

In this diagnostic modeling study, we developed novel diagnostic items (DXIs), a new classification system that leveraged the additional information in the ICD-10-CM system in 4 ways. First, many individual diagnoses were mapped into multiple DXIs, taking advantage of ICD-10-CM 's richer diagnosis-level information. Second, DXIs were ex ante designed to predict multiple outcomes, including spending, admissions, quality measures, and emergency department use. Third, DXIs were chosen to explain differences between realized outcomes and predicted values within subgroups defined by an existing base model — the AHRQ CCSR. Finally, DXIs were calibrated using very large sample sizes to enable robust estimation of the incremental influence of disease categories that are as rare as 1 in 100 000.

Several existing classification systems map diagnoses to categories. The World Health Organization has created and updates the international ICD-10 coding system, which contains 21 chapters and finer subchapters that are comprehensive but not organized to predict costs or utilization. The Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Category (HHS-HCC) systemwas developed for the Medicare Advantage program, revised for Medicare Part D, and further expanded for plan payment in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Our effort builds on the comprehensive and up-to-date AHRQ CCSR system that managed care plans, insurers, researchers, and surveillance programs use for myriad applications related to payment, quality assessment, and epidemiology.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^112kisfo]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^116jDUtX]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^1162fCob]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Switching to ICD-10-CM and the new version of the External Cause of Injury Matrix may affect injury surveillance statistics. The magnitude of these potential effects can be assessed by identifying discontinuities in temporal trends within specific jurisdictions across the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition. Another approach, which has been particularly useful for mortality data, is to code the same records in both code sets and estimate CRs for specific mechanism/cause categories. With caution and awareness of the study's limitations, injury epidemiologists can use our CRs (where total cell counts are at least 20) to estimate the potential impact of ICD-10-CM implementation on observed rates within specific mechanism/cause categories. Future revisions to the ICD-10-CM matrix may change these findings. Analyses of larger and more representative dually coded datasets would help to inform data users around future code set conversions, including the forthcoming conversion to ICD-11.

What is already known on the subject

External cause of injury matrices for morbidity data coded using the International Classification of Diseases have proven to be very useful for surveillance and research.
The new matrix for Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM) has been extensively tested and refined, but never compared with the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the ICD matrix on the same hospital records.

What this study adds

Switching to ICD-10-CM and the new external cause of injury matrix may affect injury surveillance statistics and research, especially for certain mechanisms/causes.

For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^1149aNAt]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^11366FEM]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^112joPc3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — classification codes include the primary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes "M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabuli, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament". The corresponding ICD-9-CM codes and conditions are "719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh". Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated are "M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.2 Flexion deformity", "M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified", and "M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint".

### A seamless navigation to ICD-10-CM for interventional pain physicians: is a rude awakening avoidable? [^116SDQAQ]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Since October 1, 2015, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) was integrated into U.S. medical practices. This monumental transition seemingly occurred rather unceremoniously, despite significant opposition and reservations having been expressed by the provider community. In prior publications, we have described various survival strategies for interventional pain physicians. The regulators and beneficiaries of system-CMS, consultants, and health information technology industry are congratulating themselves for a job well done. Nonetheless, this transition comes at an immeasurable financial and psychological drain on providers. However, a rude awakening may be making its way with expiration of initial concessions from government and private payers. This manuscript provides a template for interventional pain management professionals with multiple steps for seamless navigation, including descriptions of the most commonly used codes, navigation through ICD-10-CM manual, steps for correct coding, and finally, detailed coding descriptions for various interventional techniques.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^116z7qCb]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

A total of nine discrepancies (three in MCA, six in MCB) involved the ICD-10-CM external cause code of V.19.9 ("pedal cyclist… injured in unspecified traffic accident cause"), which was assigned to the 'MVT pedal cyclist' category by the ICD-10-CM matrix, while the equivalent ICD-9-CM code (E826.1) was assigned to the 'other pedal cyclist' category by the ICD-9-CM matrix. This choice may reflect an assumption by the developers of the ICD-10-CM matrix that unspecified pedal cyclist traffic injuries are likely to involve an MV.

Sixteen MCA records and three MCB records were classified as fall injuries by the ICD-9-CM matrix, but as overexertion, 'struck by/against', or machinery-related injuries by the ICD-10-CM matrix. One contributing factor is that ICD-10-CM has a specific set of external cause codes for 'slipping, tripping, and stumbling without falling' (W18.4-), which are classified as overexertion injuries by the ICD-10-CM matrix, whereas the same concept of accidental slipping was indexed to E885.9 ('fall from other slipping, tripping, or stumbling') in ICD-9-CM. The latter code was classified as a fall in the ICD-9-CM matrix, even though it was also used to describe slipping events without falls. Another contributing factor is that ICD-10-CM has codes for 'striking against unspecified object with subsequent fall' (W18.00-) and 'striking against other object with subsequent fall' (W18.09-), whereas ICD-9-CM only offered the options of striking an 'object in sports' (E917.5), 'caused by a crowd, by collective fear or panic' (E917.6), furniture (E917.7), and 'other stationary object' (E917.8), with subsequent fall. A patient who described 'bumping into something and falling' would thus be classified as having had a fall injury by the ICD-9-CM matrix, but as having had a 'struck by/against' injury by the ICD-10-CM matrix. An interrupted time series analysis from Kentucky showed an immediate significant increase in hospitalisation rates for 'struck by/against' injuries in October 2015, presumably also due to this difference between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^1174DYHf]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Analysis 2: other chapters

The ICD-10-CM codes are organised by major clinical conditions. To parsimoniously characterise possible broad co-occurring conditions among records with a drug overdose code in any field, the ICD-10-CM chapters of the coding manual (eg, 'A00–B99', 'C00–D99' and so on) of the primary diagnosis codes were examined. The primary diagnosis codes were categorised into ICD-10-CM coding chapters and quantified.

Analysis 3: encounter type

To examine the distribution of encounter types among drug overdose codes and their sequelae, records with a drug overdose code or sequelae to a drug overdose code were identified by searching all diagnosis fields, and the encounter type was categorised into initial (A), subsequent (D), sequela (S) or missing encounters based on the seventh character of the code.

Analysis 4: intent

To examine the distribution of intents among drug overdose, adverse effect and underdosing codes, records with a drug overdose, adverse effect or underdosing code were identified by searching all diagnosis fields, and the intent for the drug overdose code was categorised into unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect, underdosing or missing based on the fifth/sixth character of the code. All categories of intent were analysed for completeness, though adverse effect and underdose are by definition not considered drug overdoses in this manuscript.

State staff tabulated frequencies and percentages for code position categories, encounter types, intents and primary diagnosis chapters using SAS V.9.4. State-specific results and averages of all state results are presented.

### How well doCodes predict true congenital heart defects? A centers for disease control and prevention-based multisite validation project [^114Bhmfx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Ideally, constructing an algorithm that utilizes data from administrative and eHRs will help to identify true CHD cases with improved accuracy and sensitivity. Machine learning is one possibility to improve both the PPV and sensitivity of CHD codes for CHD, and specific CHD type, based on ICD codes and other variables from clinical and administrative data sets, using the most predictive factors, while reducing the false negative rate. Restricting analyses to certain ICD codes and age categories may also improve the PPV. As a result of the current findings and previous research, researchers may consider excluding the following codes from administrative data sets to improve the PPV for analyses seeking to study CHD:
ICD‐9‐CM and anatomically equivalent ICD‐10‐CM codes that code for conditions other than heart defects, including congenital heart block (746.86, Q24.6), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (747.32, Q25.72), absent/hypoplastic umbilical artery (747.5, Q27.0), other anomalies of peripheral vascular system (747.6x, Q27.9), and other specified anomalies of circulatory system (747.8x, Q28.8). These codes were also excluded in the surveillance methodology.
The "Other" CHD anatomic group (as noted in Figure 1 and Data S1) and nonspecific ICD‐9‐CM codes and the equivalent ICD‐10‐CM codes including: other specified congenital anomalies of heart 746.8 (Q24.8), obstructive anomalies of heart, not elsewhere classified 746.84, coronary artery anomaly 746.85 (Q24.5), malposition of heart and cardiac apex 746.87 (Q24.0), other specified congenital anomalies of heart 746.89 (Q24.8), unspecified congenital anomaly of heart 746.9 (Q24.9), other congenital anomalies of aorta 747.2 (Q25.49), anomaly of aorta, unspecified 747.20 (Q25.40), anomalies of aortic arch 747.21, other anomalies of aorta 747.29 (Q25.49), congenital anomalies of great veins 747.4 (Q26.1), anomaly of great veins, unspecified 747.40 (Q26.9), other anomalies of great veins 747.49 (Q26.8), unspecified anomaly of circulatory system 747.9 (Q28.9, personal history of congenital malformations of heart and circulatory system V13.65 (Z87.74)
Patent foramen ovale / atrial septal defect 745.5 / Q21.1 alone or in combination with the "Other" CHD category.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^115LVtjK]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^114yYhrF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^111mt148]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Third, subsequent encounters and sequelae represent a small proportion of ICD-10-CM codes in the T36–T50 range. Given that subsequent and sequela encounters do not represent new drug overdoses, their inclusion could potentially count a single drug overdose multiple times, modestly inflating measures of drug overdose incidence.

Fourth, the distribution of cases across intent categories varied across states. The change in coding guidelines that instructs coders to default to accidental intent when the intent of the injury is unspecified is likely to impact the number of cases within each intent category in ICD-10-CM coded data. Future research exploring how medical coders assign intent categories is warranted.

Adverse effects constitute a relatively large proportion of records with codes T36–T50, while codes for underdosing are relatively rare. Adverse effects could represent common side-effects which are inconsistent with a drug overdose. Including adverse effects could dramatically inflate estimates of drug overdose-related discharges. Underdosing can represent non-compliance or improper administration and is also inconsistent with a drug overdose. To prevent overestimation of drug overdoses, researchers should exclude both adverse effects and underdosing.

Next steps to validate drug overdose indicators include replication of these analyses with nationally representative data, and medical chart review to assess the predictive value of codes for drug overdose, adverse effects and substance use with intoxication, and to understand how medical coders categorise drug overdose intent. Appropriate training for medical coders in applying ICD-10-CM codes for drug overdose may alleviate missing data and benefit end users.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^117JU1Un]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^116CscF4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) ICD coding — severe nonproliferative and diabetic macular edema mappings are listed as follows: ICD-9 CM 362.06 corresponds to ICD-10 CM codes "E10.341- Type 1 with macular edema", "E10.349- Type 1 without macular edema", "E11.341- Type 2 with macular edema", "E11.349- Type 2 without macular edema", "E13.341- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR with macular edema", and "E13.349- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR without macular edema". For diabetic macular edema, ICD-9 CM 362.07 corresponds to ICD-10 CM "E10.321 Type 1 mild nonproliferative DR", "E10.331 Type 1 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E10.341 Type 1 severe nonproliferative DR", "E10.351 Type 1 proliferative DR", "E11.321 Type 2 mild nonproliferative DR", "E11.331 Type 2 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E11.341 Type 2 severe nonproliferative DR", "E11.351 Type 2 proliferative DR", "E13.321 other specified diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative DR", and "E13.331 other specified diabetes mellitus with moderate nonproliferative DR". Additional information states: "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 6th characters. In the DR series, indicate 'with or without' macular edema. Laterality indicators are not required in this series", with "1 = with macular edema" and "9 = without macular edema". It further specifies, "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available".

### Anatomic and physiologic classification of adults with congenital heart disease to predict adverse outcomes: use of administrative codes compared to clinical staging [^113f5uVe]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018 anatomic physiologic (AP) classification American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Guidelines for Adults with Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) encompasses both native and post-operative anatomy and physiology to guide care management. As some physiologic conditions and post-operative states lack specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9- Clinical Modification (CM) and 10-CM codes, an ICD code-based classification approximating the ACHD AP classification is needed for population-based studies.

Methods

A total of 232 individuals, aged ≥ 18 years at the time of a health encounter between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 and identified with at least one of 87 ICD codes for a congenital heart defect were validated through medical chart review. Individuals were assigned one of 4 mutually exclusive modified AP classification categories: (1) severe AB, (2) severe CD, (3) non-severe AB, or (4) non-severe CD, based on native anatomy "severe" or "non-severe" and physiology AB ("none" or "mild") or CD ("moderate" or "severe") by two methods: (1) medical record review, and (2) ICD and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code-based classification. The composite outcome was defined as a combination of a death, emergency department (ED) visits, or any hospitalizations that occurred at least 6 months after the index date and was assessed by each modified AP classification method.

Results

Of 232 cases (52.2% male, 71.1% White), 28.4% experienced a composite outcome a median of 1.6 years after the index encounter. No difference in prediction of the composite outcome was seen based on modified AP classification between chart review and ICD code-based methodology.

Conclusion

Modified AP classification by chart review and ICD codes are comparable in predicting the composite outcome at least 6 months after classification. Modified AP classification using ICD code-based classification of CHD native anatomy and physiology is an important tool for population-based ACHD surveillance using administrative data.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^1154SH85]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^116quvNV]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^113coEMA]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Because chronic pain has been poorly represented in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) despite its significant contribution to the burden of disease worldwide, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) developed a classification of chronic pain that was included in the ICD-11 version as "MG30" and approved by the World Health Assembly in 2019. The objective of this field test was to determine how well the classification of chronic pain works in the context of the ICD-11. A web-based survey using the WHO-FiT platform recruited 177 healthcare professionals from all WHO regions. After a training on coding chronic pain hosted by the IASP Web site, participants evaluated 18 diagnostic codes (lines) of the 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 and 12 vignettes (cases) describing chronic pain conditions. Correctness, ambiguity, and perceived difficulty of the coding were compared between the ICD-11 and the ICD-10 and the applicability of the morbidity rules for the ICD-11 verified. In the line coding, 43.0% of correct chronic pain diagnoses assigned with the ICD-10 contrasted with 63.2% with the ICD-11. Especially in cases in which the chronic pain is regarded as the symptom of an underlying disease, the ICD-11 (63.5%) commanded more correct diagnoses than the ICD-10 (26.8%). The case coding was on average 83.9% accurate, only in 1.6% of cases any difficulty was perceived. The morbidity rules were applied correctly in 74.1% of cases. From a coding perspective, the ICD-11 is superior to the ICD-10 in every respect, offering better accuracy, difficulty, and ambiguity in coding chronic pain conditions.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### General surgeon involvement in the care of patients designated with an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-endorsed ICD-10-CM emergency general surgery diagnosis code in Wisconsin [^113T2LFQ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current national burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) illnesses and the extent of surgeon involvement in the care of these patients remain largely unknown. To inform needs assessments, research, and education, we sought to: (1) translate previously developed International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes representing EGS conditions to ICD 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes and (2) determine the national burden of and assess surgeon involvement across EGS conditions.

Methods

We converted ICD-9-CM codes to candidate ICD-10-CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings then iteratively refined the code list. We used National Inpatient Sample 2016 to 2017 data to develop a national estimate of the burden of EGS disease. To evaluate surgeon involvement, using Wisconsin Hospital Association discharge data (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018), we selected adult urgent/emergent encounters with an EGS condition as the principal diagnosis. Surgeon involvement was defined as a surgeon being either the attending provider or procedural physician.

Results

Four hundred and eighty-five ICD-9-CM codes mapped to 1,696 ICD-10-CM codes. The final list contained 985 ICD-10-CM codes. Nationally, there were 2,977,843 adult patient encounters with an ICD-10-CM EGS diagnosis. Of 94,903 EGS patients in the Wisconsin Hospital Association data set, most encounters were inpatient as compared with observation (75,878 [80.0%] vs. 19,025 [20.0%]). There were 57,780 patients (60.9%) that underwent any procedure. Among all Wisconsin EGS patients, most had no surgeon involvement (64.9% [n = 61,616]). Of the seven most common EGS diagnoses, surgeon involvement was highest for appendicitis (96.0%) and biliary tract disease (77.1%). For the other five most common conditions (skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/ileus, pancreatitis, diverticular disease), surgeons were involved in roughly 20% of patient care episodes.

Conclusion

Surgeon involvement for EGS conditions ranges from highly likely (appendicitis) to relatively unlikely (skin/soft tissue infections). The wide range in surgeon involvement underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of EGS patients.

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^111pCxC5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ICD-10-AM codes

In the ICD-10-AM, two codes may be used to record NAFLD/NASH: K75.8 'Other specified inflammatory liver diseases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)' and K76.0 'Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)'. NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis may also attract code K74.6 'Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver'. Obesity may be represented by ICD-10-AM codes under the E66 code block or by the chronic condition supplementary code U78.1. T2DM codes are contained in the E11 code block. Codes for other causes of CLD are outlined in table 1.

Table 1
ICD-10-AM codes for aetiologies of chronic liver disease

All ICD-10-AM codes were obtained from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection registry (QHAPDC) for every hospital encounter within the study cohort during a minimum 12-month follow-up period. For the current study, one encounter was randomly selected for each patient to be included in the audit sample. In a subset of patients who had ≥ 1 encounter with and ≥ 1 encounter without code K74.6, a second encounter was selected (one encounter containing code K74.6 and one encounter that did not contain code K74.6) to ensure the sample contained a representative number of patients with possible NAFLD.

In Australia, assignment of ICD-10-AM diagnosis codes is impacted by the Australian Coding Standards, which stipulate the condition must be either the chief reason for admission or required commencement, alteration or adjustment of therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures or increased clinical care and/or monitoring during the encounter. T2DM and HCV are exceptions to this assignment process, as these conditions are always coded when documented. In addition, a supplementary 'U' coding capability was introduced on 1 July 2015, to capture conditions (such as obesity) that contribute to a patient's health status during the admission, but do not otherwise meet the criteria for coding. The index pathway used by coders for coding of cirrhosis, CLD aetiology, obesity and T2DM remained consistent during the audited time period.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^113FDxNv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^111SFNW6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### A machine learning model for identifying patients at risk for wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^116jnrfc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Feature selection

We identified all ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes that were present in at least 2% of wild-type ATTR-CM patients in the IQVIA medical claims data. Each of these codes were then used as potential features for the machine learning model. Features derived from ICD codes of any amyloidosis condition (i.e. ICD-9 277.30 or ICD-10 E85) and a specific code for "cardiomyopathy in diseases classified elsewhere" that tends to accompany a cardiac amyloid diagnoses were removed, to ensure no information relevant to the diagnosis of ATTR-CM or cardiac amyloidosis was "leaked" to the machine learning model. Model features were created by using a hierarchical mapping of ICD codes at the Sub Chapter (diagnosis category), Major (diagnosis name), and Short Description (diagnosis description) levels, obtained from the ICD Data R package and derived from the 2016 release of ICD-10-CM. New codes added after 2016 used the 2019 release of ICD-10-CM.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^115dkWHL]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Cleft lip sidedness and the association with additional congenital malformations [^116QBQWQ]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional Congenital Malformations (ACMs)

ACMs were classified based on the International Classification of Disease Version 10 (ICD-10) codeswhich are reported in HES data. ICD-10 is considered the international standard diagnostic classification for disease and is developed and maintained by the World Health Organisation. Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosome abnormalities are coded Q00-Q99 and are categorised according to the body or organ system they affect (see Appendix 1). Codes for ACMs relating to cleft lip and palate (Q35-Q37) were excluded from the analysis. The code for nasal ACMs (Q30) was included in the analysis because despite the nose being positioned anatomically adjacent to the lip and palate, the specified nasal anomalies would not be expected to represent the underlying orofacial cleft (Q30.1 Agenesis and underdevelopment of nose; Q30.2 Fissured, notched and cleft nose; Q30.3 Congenital perforated nasal septum; Q30.8 Other congenital malformations of nose; Q30.9 Congenital malformation of nose, unspecified). Similarly, code Q38 relating to malformations of tongue, mouth and pharynx was included as it specified that it excluded cleft lip and/or palate.

We did not attempt to remove individuals with a specific genetic and/or syndromic diagnosis from the analysis cohort, since there was no means of reliably achieving this distinction using ICD-10 codes.

### Data consistency in the english hospital episodes statistics database [^113dYVwq]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Spells were removed from the datasets if:

The only ICD-10 code present in the record was R69 (unknown and unspecified causes of morbidity) or there was no valid entry in the diagnostic code field.
The spell was a regular attendance for renal or liver dialysis (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4 code X40 or X43; or other regular attendance with ICD-10 code N185 (chronic renal failure) present. Regular day-attendances are usually for a specific procedure, and in most cases only that procedure and the related diagnosis is coded. Inclusion of these spells would unduly bias the dataset.
Patients were in age bands where the initial coding diagnoses were most likely miscoded: we removed patients with PDD younger than 40 years, and patients with DMPC younger than 18 years. The data extraction and cleaning procedure for each dataset is summarised in online supplemental figures S1–S3.

Identification of data inconsistencies

All data inconsistencies are reported at the spell level. A subsequent spell was considered consistent with the first spell if at least one of its constituent episodes mentioned the ICD-10 codes listed below for that condition:

Autism: F84.0, F84.1 or F84.5.

DMPC (representing the broader disease category of diabetes mellitus): E10-, E11-, E14-.

PDD (representing the broader disease category of dementia): F00-, F01-, F02-, F03-, F05.1, G30.1, G30.8, G309.

Further details on the definitions of these codes are summarised in online supplemental table S1. In the case of DMPC and PDD, a broader definition of the condition was used for subsequent spells than for the first spell. This was in recognition of the fact that details may not be recorded regarding the diabetes subtype or its presentation or the exact role of Parkinson's disease in the development of dementia.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^114pEknp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### The impacts of ICD-10-CM on U.S. army injury surveillance [^1115qt9W]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries are the leading cause of medical encounters and lost work days in the U.S. Army, affecting more than half of active-duty soldiers annually. Historically, Army injury surveillance has captured both acute traumatic and cumulative microtraumatic overuse injuries. This article describes how the transition from the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM impacted U.S. military injury surveillance by comparing injury rates and distributions under both systems.

Methods

Mapping ICD-9-CM codes to the expanded ICD-10-CM codes is not a straightforward endeavor; therefore, the Army Public Health Center incorporated ICD-10-CM codes into a comprehensive, systematic approach to taxonomically categorize injuries. This taxonomic methodology was applied to Army injuries under ICD-10-CM (2016–2019) and compared with the ICD-9-CM Army injury surveillance definitions (2012–2015).

Results

Soldier injury rates appeared to increase when surveillance with ICD-10-CM began. Soldiers experienced 1,276 incident injury medical encounters per 1,000 person-years in 2015 (ICD-9-CM), compared with 1,804 injuries per 1,000 in 2016 (ICD-10-CM), a 41% increase. Importantly, the distribution of injuries also shifted, such that the average cumulative microtraumatic injury rate increased by 42% during 2016–2019 (ICD-10-CM) compared with the 2012–2015 average (ICD-9-CM), whereas acute traumatic injuries only increased by 17%.

Conclusions

The enhanced descriptions provided by ICD-10-CM codes and the applied taxonomic categorizations have improved precision in Army injury surveillance. Data unequivocally show that most injuries in this physically active population are cumulative microtraumatic injuries. The taxonomic methodology can be extended to injury surveillance in other populations and may allow a more efficient transition to ICD-11-CM.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^112d4gSc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

Analysis 4: intent

The frequency of the intents captured among drug overdose, adverse effect, and underdosing records is shown in figure 4 and online supplemental table 4. Among hospitalisations, adverse effects codes were present across participating states in an average of 74.9% of records with drug overdose codes (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%–81.1%). Among ED visits, adverse effects codes were present across participating states in an average of 50.8% of records with drug overdose codes (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%–66.8%). Unintentional intent represented an average of 11.1% of hospitalisations (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%–14.5%) and 28.2% of ED visits (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%–40.7%), followed by self-harm with 9.6% of hospitalisations (median = 7.9%; range = 5.8%–23.0%) and 12.3% of ED visits (median = 11.6%; range = 8.3%–17.6%). On average, undetermined, assault and underdosing intents represent 4.3% (median = 3.8%; range = 3.1%–7.7%) of hospitalisations and 4.8% (median = 4.1%; range = 3.8%–7.8%) of ED visits, respectively. State 3 had a relatively large percentage of missing intents among hospitalisations and ED visits compared with other states.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^111NZdoW]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External cause of injury matrices is used to classify mechanisms/causes of injuries for surveillance and research. Little is known about the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new external cause of injury matrix for Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM), compared with the ICD-9-CM version.

Methods

Dually coded (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) administrative data were obtained from two major academic trauma centres. Injury-related cases were identified and categorised by mechanism/cause and manner/intent. Comparability ratios (CR) were used to estimate the net impact of changing from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM on the number of cases classified to each mechanism/cause category. Chamberlain's percent positive agreements (PPA) were calculated and McNemar's test was used to assess the significance of observed classification differences.

Results

Of 4832 and 5211 dual-coded records from the two centres, 632 and 520 with injury-related principal diagnoses and external cause codes in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM were identified. CRs for the mechanisms/causes with at least 20 records ranged from 0.85 to 1.9 at one centre and from 0.97 to 1.07 at the other. Among these mechanisms/causes, PPAs ranged from 33% for 'other transport' to 94% for poisoning at one centre, and from 75% for 'other transport' to 100% for fires/burns at the other centre. Case assignment differed significantly for falls, motor vehicle traffic, other transport, and 'struck by/against' injuries at one centre, and for 'other pedal cyclist' at the other centre.

Conclusion

Switching to ICD-10-CM and the new external cause of injury matrix may affect injury surveillance and research, especially for certain mechanisms/causes.

### Impact of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, on head and neck surgery [^117Xay2N]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Review changes in the number of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes utilized in head and neck surgery service and associated changes in cost and charges of health services.

Methods

A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed utilizing the Nationwide Readmissions Database, 2015. The study population included patients who were admitted for a primary head and neck procedure. Patients discharged in the third quarter (Q3), coding system ICD-9-CM, compared to patients discharged in the fourth quarter (Q4), coding system ICD-10-CM.

Results

A total of 11,456 and 10,431 patients discharged in Q3 and Q4, respectively. Comparing the top 90% billed disease codes demonstrated that the number of ICD-10-CM codes was more by a factor of 1.20. However, classifying codes by type of surgery, fewer codes were used in patients who had laryngeal surgeries or tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy by a factor of 0.8. Codes used to document the primary diagnoses for patients who underwent tracheostomy increased the most by a factor of 1.42. Controlling for multiple factors that would affect the cost of health services, there were no significant changes in the cost of management per case (Q3: $70,189.00 ± 1,546.39 vs. Q4: $70,502.00 ± 1,560.17, P = 0.68) or hospital charges (Q3: $273,411.00 ± 7,852.78 vs. Q4: 265,996 ± 7922.77, P = 0.05).

Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM provides an expansion of codes. Initial indication is that utilization of ICD-10-CM codes for head and neck surgery is within expected parameters and appears not to affect the cost of management and hospital charges despite the overall increase in ICD codes in the newer version.

We searched PubMed for articles published from 2012 to 2022, with all-cause dementia or ADRD as a primary exposure or primary outcome, or where the research population of interest was persons living with all-cause dementia or ADRD (eAppendix in Supplement 1). We found 28 studies utilizing 20 distinct researcher-developed ICD-10-CM or prescription drug code algorithms in addition to the CCW algorithm (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).,

We extracted 43 ICD-10-CM codes and 5 prescription drugs across algorithms (Table 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We shared the codes with 3 clinicians (2 neurology clinicians and 1 geriatrics clinician) who provide care to persons living with dementia, who recommended excluding 8 codes deemed to not indicate dementia (Table 1). We grouped the remaining codes into tiers by use frequency (tier 1, ≥ 15 algorithms; tier 2, 10–14 algorithms; tier 3, 5–9 algorithms; and tier 4, 1–4 algorithms). We designated prescriptions for ADRD-targeting drugs as indicated by National Drug Codes (NDC) without presence of an ADRD ICD-10-CM code as tier 5.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^113u9pf5]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems — payer conformity to CPT published guidance and compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act code set requirements are emphasized to minimize administrative burden and ensure consistent claims adjudication. Technological evolution, site of service, or provider type should not limit payer acknowledgment of CPT coding principles, and HIPAA‑compliant telecommunication capability need not limit payment for services reported with conventional CPT codes. For immunization administration, following CPT coding guidance is especially important; unilateral payer modification that focuses on each vaccine component rather than each vaccine product imposes inappropriate payment limits and fosters errors in claim submission, and variation in interpretation can impede effective reporting of quality measures, such as through the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set. Claim submission constraints are noted: the CMS 1500 paper claim form allows only 4 ICD-10-CM codes for each line-item CPT, although 12 total ICD-10-CM codes can be entered. The page also notes that conventional quality measures reflected by Category II CPT codes and their numerator–denominator structure were developed for shorter-term clinical scenarios, whereas pediatric care emphasizes longer-term care.

### Impact of the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition on the incidence of severe maternal morbidity among delivery hospitalizations in the United States [^116frLSA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surveillance of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity is important to identify temporal trends, evaluate the impact of clinical practice changes or interventions, and monitor quality of care. A common source for severe maternal morbidity surveillance is hospital discharge data. On October 1, 2015, all hospitals in the United States transitioned from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for diagnoses and procedures.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding systems on the incidence of severe maternal morbidity in the United States in hospital discharge data.

Study Design

Using data from the National Inpatient Sample, obstetrical deliveries between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, were identified using a validated case definition. Severe maternal morbidity was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (January 1, 2012, to September 30, 2015) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (October 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017) codes provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An interrupted time series and segmented regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding on the incidence of severe maternal morbidity per 1000 obstetrical deliveries.

Results

From 22,751,941 deliveries, the incidence of severe maternal morbidity in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding era was 19.04 per 1000 obstetrical deliveries and decreased to 17.39 per 1000 obstetrical deliveries in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding era (P < .001). The transition to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding led to an immediate decrease in the incidence of severe maternal morbidity (-2.26 cases of 1000 obstetrical deliveries) (P < .001). When blood products transfusion was removed from the case definition, the magnitude of the decrease in the incidence of SMM was much smaller (-0.60 cases/1000 obstetric deliveries), but still significant (P < .001).

Conclusion

After the transition to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for health diagnoses and procedures in the United States, there was an abrupt statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the incidence of severe maternal morbidity in hospital discharge data. Changes in the underlying health of the obstetrical population are unlikely to explain the sudden change in severe maternal morbidity. Although much work has been done to validate the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for severe maternal morbidity, it is critical that validation studies be undertaken to validate the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for severe maternal morbidity to permit ongoing surveillance, quality improvement, and research activities that rely on hospital discharge data.

### An aetiological classification of birth defects for epidemiological research [^111ytYYu]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital anomaly registers collect data on antenatally and postnatally detected anomalies for surveillance, research, and public health purposes. Each anomaly is coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9/ICD-10) based on body systems, allowing accurate comparisons between registers for individual anomalies. When commencing an environmental, epidemiological study, it became clear to us that there is no standard classification that takes aetiology into account. This paper describes a new classification for use in studies addressing aetiology.

Method

A classification system was evolved and piloted using cases in a study of geographical variation in congenital anomaly prevalence.1 Cases that were difficult to categorise were noted, and after discussion with a team of experts, the classification was adjusted accordingly.

Results and Conclusion

A robust, hierarchical method of classifying birth defects into eight categories has been produced, for use at source of data registration in conjunction with, but independent of, ICD coding.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^117ABYQr]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In October 2015, discharge data coding in the USA shifted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), necessitating new indicator definitions for drug overdose morbidity. Amid the drug overdose crisis, characterising discharge records that have ICD-10-CM drug overdose codes can inform the development of standardised drug overdose morbidity indicator definitions for epidemiological surveillance.

Methods

Eight states submitted aggregated data involving hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge records with ICD-10-CM codes starting with T36-T50, for visits occurring from October 2015 to December 2016. Frequencies were calculated for (1) the position within the diagnosis billing fields where the drug overdose code occurred; (2) primary diagnosis code grouped by ICD-10-CM chapter; (3) encounter types; and (4) intents, underdosing and adverse effects.

Results

Among all records with a drug overdose code, the primary diagnosis field captured 70.6% of hospitalisations (median = 69.5%, range = 66.2%-76.8%) and 79.9% of ED visits (median = 80.7%; range = 69.8%-88.0%) on average across participating states. The most frequent primary diagnosis chapters included injury and mental disorder chapters. Among visits with codes for drug overdose initial encounters, subsequent encounters and sequelae, on average 94.6% of hospitalisation records (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%-98.8%) and 95.5% of ED records (median = 99.5%; range = 79.2%-99.8%), represented initial encounters. Among records with drug overdose of any intent, adverse effect and underdosing codes, adverse effects comprised an average of 74.9% of hospitalisation records (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%-81.1%) and 50.8% of ED records (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%-66.8%), while unintentional intent comprised an average of 11.1% of hospitalisation records (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%-14.5%) and 28.2% of ED records (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%-40.7%).

Conclusion

Results highlight considerations for adapting and standardising drug overdose indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^113BmPpd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

### Trends and factors associated with concordance between international classification of diseases, ninth and tenth revision, clinical modification codes and stroke clinical diagnoses [^112zHurp]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) codes are often used for disease surveillance. We examined changes in concordance between ICD-CM codes and clinical diagnoses before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM in the United States (October 1, 2015), and determined if there were systematic variations in concordance by patient and hospital characteristics. Methods- We included Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program patient discharges from 2014 to 2017. Concordance between ICD-CM codes and the clinical diagnosis documented by the physician (assumed as accurate) was calculated for each diagnosis category: ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Results- In total, 314857 patient records were included in the analysis (n = 280 hospitals), 55.9% of which were obtained after the transition to ICD-10-CM. While concordance was generally high, a small, and temporary decline occurred from the last calendar quarter of ICD-9-CM (average unadjusted concordance = 92.8%) to the first quarter of ICD-10-CM use (91.0%). Concordance differed by diagnosis category and was generally highest for ischemic stroke. In the analysis of ICD-10-CM records, disagreements often occurred between ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack records and between subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage records. Compared with the smallest hospitals (≤ 200 beds), larger hospitals had significantly higher odds of concordance (ischemic stroke adjusted odds ratio for ≥ 400 beds, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5–1.9). Conclusions- This study identified a small and transient decline in concordance between ICD-CM codes and stroke clinical diagnoses during the coding transition, indicating no substantial impact on the overall identification of stroke patients. Researchers and policymakers should remain aware of potential changes in ICD-CM code accuracy over time, which may affect disease surveillance. Systematic variations in the accuracy of codes by hospital and patient characteristics have implications for quality-of-care studies and hospital comparative assessments.

### Specificity of international classification of diseases codes for bronchopulmonary dysplasia: an investigation using electronic health record data and a large insurance database [^111XE2sz]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for health services research, in spite of unknown diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy of ICD codes to identify bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study in a single-center NICU (n = 166) to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 codes for the diagnosis of BPD. Analysis of large insurance claims database (n = 7887) to determine date of assignment of the code.

Results

The sensitivity of any BPD-related ICD codes ranged from 0.82 to 0.95, while the specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.36. In a large national insurance database, the most common date of ICD-9 or ICD-10 code assignment was the day of birth, which is inconsistent with the clinical definition.

Conclusions

ICD codes registered for BPD are unlikely to accurately reflect the current clinical definition and should be interpreted with caution.

### Use of and comorbidities associated with diagnostic codes for COVID-19 in US health insurance claims [^112y3XUx]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate identification of COVID-19 diagnosis in patient medical records is essential for studies using administrative data to examine morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with COVID-19. Before April 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested using the existing International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code B97.29 (other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) as the primary diagnostic code for patients infected with COVID-19. On April 1, 2020, a new code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease) was added to ICD-10-CM and was rapidly adopted by hospitals. Our study examined how nonhospital and hospital health care professionals have used these diagnostic codes in practice using a national medical claims data set in the US. We analyzed the comorbidities associated with COVID-19 diagnosis to assess the specificity of the legacy code and the importance of using both codes.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^115BJ9c8]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^11347NH6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^116aPYrn]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.
