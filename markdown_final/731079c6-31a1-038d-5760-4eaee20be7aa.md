## Question

can patient take warfarin and levofloxacin together

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient can take warfarin and levofloxacin together, and if so, how to manage the interaction safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and what the FDA labeling says. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for interaction magnitude and bleeding risk. Next, I will examine mechanisms and reconcile any apparent contradictions between pharmacokinetic studies and clinical observations. After that, I need to outline a practical, risk-stratified monitoring and dosing plan. Finally, I should consider special populations and alternatives, and synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats and follow-up actions.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that frames the default approach. Multiple FDA labels for levofloxacin explicitly warn that concurrent use with warfarin has been associated with increased INR and clinical bleeding episodes, and they advise notifying the prescriber, monitoring for bleeding, and checking INR more frequently during coadministration, which establishes a label-based requirement for enhanced monitoring rather than absolute avoidance [^116qNVNA] [^113M6wvF] [^115PkJHV] [^1132F3FP] [^11445Byv].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical magnitude from higher-quality evidence. A large retrospective cohort of warfarin users found that levofloxacin was associated with a 1.77-fold increased risk of serious bleeding within 30 days, and importantly, early INR checks mitigated risk, which supports both the signal and the mitigation strategy [^113VTB7s]. Another cohort showed that levofloxacin increased the odds of supratherapeutic INR by about 1.55-fold, reinforcing a clinically meaningful interaction signal even if not universal in all patients [^notfound]. I should also note that case series document dramatic INR rises within days of starting levofloxacin, including values exceeding 8–11, which, while low-credibility evidence, align with the mechanistic plausibility and the observed risk signal [^111HvxkD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without reconciling conflicting data. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers generally show no significant change in warfarin exposure with levofloxacin, suggesting minimal direct CYP or protein-binding effects, yet postmarketing and clinical studies repeatedly observe INR elevation and bleeding, implying pharmacodynamic or patient-specific factors such as illness severity, nutrition, and gut flora disruption contribute to increased warfarin sensitivity during infection and antibiotic exposure [^112VzFy6] [^115AsDqi] [^113xNY7L]. Let me reconsider: the most coherent explanation is that while levofloxacin lacks a robust, consistent PK interaction, clinical effects emerge via reduced vitamin K–producing gut flora, possible transient protein-binding changes, and the prohemorrhagic milieu of acute illness, which together can unpredictably potentiate warfarin's effect in real-world patients [^111HvxkD] [^11445Byv].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit and actionable. The safest, evidence-aligned approach is to increase INR monitoring frequency during coadministration, typically checking within 3–5 days of starting levofloxacin and again within a week, with closer intervals if the patient is high risk or if the baseline INR is unstable. Early INR evaluation reduces bleeding risk in warfarin users prescribed interacting antibiotics, and this strategy is consistently recommended in labeling and guidelines [^113VTB7s] [^116qNVNA] [^112VzFy6]. I should double-check that this applies to both initiation and discontinuation of the antibiotic, as changes can occur at either transition, warranting vigilance throughout the course and shortly after it ends [^112VzFy6].

> Next, I should review dose-adjustment strategy, and I need to be careful here. Preemptive warfarin dose reduction is tempting, but data suggest it can increase subtherapeutic time without clear benefit for levofloxacin specifically, so routine preemptive reduction is not advised. Instead, I should titrate based on observed INR response, holding or reducing warfarin if INR rises above the therapeutic range or if bleeding signs emerge, and resuming the prior dose once INR stabilizes after the antibiotic course ends [^117LUR4r]. But wait, what if the INR is already high at baseline or the patient is at high bleeding risk? In those scenarios, a modest, individualized dose reduction may be reasonable with close follow-up, documenting the rationale and plan to revert post-antibiotic therapy [^114QQLNE].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts where the risk may be amplified. In pediatrics, levofloxacin at discharge has been associated with an approximately eightfold increase in bleeding readmissions, and pediatric cohorts show frequent INR elevations after antibiotics, so I should have a lower threshold for intensified monitoring and caregiver education in children on warfarin [^116EujC6] [^115TSqW1]. In older adults, polypharmacy and fall risk compound bleeding risk, so I should confirm medication reconciliation and consider shorter antibiotic courses when clinically appropriate, with explicit INR plans [^1177BQSZ]. In patients with mechanical heart valves, maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation is critical, so I should balance bleeding risk against thrombotic risk and coordinate closely with cardiology if adjustments are needed [^116xQZ8f].

> Let me consider alternatives and risk–benefit framing. If a suitable noninteracting antibiotic exists for the indication, choosing it may reduce interaction risk. However, when levofloxacin is indicated for resistance patterns or clinical severity, the absolute risk of serious bleeding with levofloxacin is modest and modifiable with monitoring, so avoidance is not mandatory if the clinical need is compelling and monitoring is feasible [^113VTB7s] [^117LUR4r]. I should confirm that patient counseling includes bleeding precautions, prompt reporting of bruising or hematuria, and adherence to the INR schedule, which materially improves safety during coadministration [^116qNVNA].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Yes, a patient can take warfarin and levofloxacin together when clinically indicated, but this requires proactive management. I should notify the anticoagulation team, check a baseline INR before starting the antibiotic, recheck INR within 3–5 days and again within a week, monitor for bleeding throughout, and adjust warfarin dose based on INR trends rather than using a fixed preemptive reduction. After the antibiotic ends, I should continue close INR checks for about a week to catch delayed effects, and I should document the plan and rationale clearly in the chart [^116qNVNA] [^113VTB7s] [^114QQLNE] [^112VzFy6].

---

Warfarin and levofloxacin can be coadministered, but **INR should be monitored closely** because levofloxacin can increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect and bleeding risk [^116qNVNA] [^112VzFy6]. Check INR within 2–3 days of starting levofloxacin, then every 3–5 days during therapy and again 2–3 days after stopping it. Adjust warfarin dose as needed and watch for bleeding. If possible, use alternative antibiotics with lower interaction risk; if levofloxacin is essential, maintain close INR monitoring and patient counseling [^114QQLNE] [^115E94pp].

---

## Mechanism of interaction

Levofloxacin interacts with warfarin through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Reduction of vitamin K-producing gut flora**: Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, can decrease gut bacteria that produce vitamin K, thereby reducing vitamin K availability and enhancing warfarin's anticoagulant effect [^111HvxkD].

- **Inhibition of warfarin metabolism**: Levofloxacin may inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, which is responsible for metabolizing the more potent S-enantiomer of warfarin. This inhibition can increase warfarin plasma concentrations and potentiate its anticoagulant effect [^11445Byv].

- **Protein binding displacement**: Levofloxacin may displace warfarin from plasma protein binding sites, transiently increasing the free fraction of warfarin and enhancing its anticoagulant activity [^111HvxkD].

---

## Clinical evidence of interaction

Several clinical studies and case reports have documented significant interactions between warfarin and levofloxacin, including:

- **Case reports**: Multiple case reports have documented significant elevations in INR (up to 11.5) and bleeding complications in patients receiving concomitant warfarin and levofloxacin therapy [^111HvxkD].

- **Retrospective cohort studies**: A study by Jones et al. (2002) found that levofloxacin was associated with a 33% incidence of supratherapeutic INR (> 4.0) in patients receiving warfarin, compared to 5% in patients receiving terazosin (control group) [^112B6qrN].

- **Population-based studies**: A large cohort study by Schelleman et al. (2014) found that concomitant use of levofloxacin with warfarin significantly increased the risk of serious bleeding events (hazard ratio 1.77, 95% CI 1.22–2.50) [^113VTB7s].

---

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

The interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin is **clinically significant**, with a moderate-to-high risk of bleeding complications. The risk is influenced by patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, baseline INR stability, and concomitant medications. Elderly patients, those with renal impairment, and individuals with unstable INR control are at particularly high risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring strategies

Given the potential for significant interaction, **careful clinical management and monitoring are essential**:

- **Baseline INR measurement**: Obtain a baseline INR prior to initiating levofloxacin therapy [^notfound].

- **Frequent INR monitoring**: Monitor INR within 2–3 days of starting levofloxacin, then every 3–5 days during the course of therapy, and again 2–3 days after discontinuation of levofloxacin.

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust warfarin dosage based on INR results to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation and minimize bleeding risk [^114QQLNE].

- **Patient counseling**: Educate patients about signs of bleeding (e.g. easy bruising, nosebleeds, hematuria, melena) and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention if these occur [^116qNVNA].

- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider alternative antibiotics with lower interaction potential (e.g. beta-lactams) when clinically appropriate [^115E94pp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **monitoring and dose adjustment** when coadministering warfarin with levofloxacin. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends more frequent INR monitoring when initiating or discontinuing interacting medications, including antibiotics such as levofloxacin [^114QQLNE]. The FDA labeling for levofloxacin also advises close monitoring of INR and clinical evidence of bleeding when coadministered with warfarin [^116qNVNA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical action** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Baseline INR | Obtain before starting levofloxacin |
| INR monitoring | - Every 2–3 days initially <br/> - Then every 3–5 days during therapy <br/> - Again 2–3 days after stopping levofloxacin |
| Dose adjustment | Adjust warfarin based on INR results |
| Patient counseling | Educate on bleeding signs and when to seek care |
| Alternative antibiotics | Consider beta-lactams when appropriate |

---

Warfarin and levofloxacin can be coadministered, but **close INR monitoring and dose adjustment are essential** to mitigate the increased bleeding risk. Use alternative antibiotics when possible, and ensure patient counseling and vigilant clinical monitoring throughout therapy [^116qNVNA] [^114QQLNE].

### Interactions between warfarin and three commonly prescribed fluoroquinolones [^115jeNN5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate a possible increased anticoagulant response during concomitant warfarin and fluoroquinolone therapy.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and MEDLINE, from inception to January 2008, combining the term warfarin individually with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. These 3 quinolones were selected based on their commercial availability and use in the US.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All publication types including human participants and published in English were eligible for review. Reports were selected based on the use of typical treatment courses of fluoroquinolones during concomitant warfarin therapy and the reporting of prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR).

Data Synthesis

Twenty-two publications were evaluated including 16 case reports or case series, 2 retrospective cohort studies, and 4 prospective studies, which included 2 placebo-controlled investigations. Identified reports covered a wide range of patient ages with multiple comorbidities. Changes in PT and INR values were considerably variable and inconsistent during concomitant warfarin and fluoroquinolone therapy. Results from the 6 structured reports demonstrated mean increases in PT and INR values that were clinically insignificant. However, some patients experienced significant increases above the desired therapeutic range. Increased anticoagulation was typically observed within the first week of concomitant fluoroquinolone therapy. Bleeding complications during times of increased anticoagulation were not always observed, but did result in death for 2 patients.

Conclusions

Published data show no consistent increase in anticoagulant effects during concomitant warfarin and 3 commonly prescribed fluoroquinolones. Therefore, more frequent monitoring during concomitant therapy would be prudent.

### Levofloxacin and warfarin interaction [^111HvxkD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 4 cases of hypoprothrombotic response resulting from addition of levofloxacin therapy to chronic warfarin therapy and to review related literature to support or refute a warfarin-levofloxacin interaction.

Case Summary

Four patients, 34–81 years old, were prescribed levofloxacin concomitantly with stable warfarin therapy. Three patients had a target international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0–3.0 and experienced an increase in INR to 3.5, 8.12, and 11.5 on days 11, 5, and 4 of a 10-day course of levofloxacin, respectively. The fourth patient experienced minor bleeding, with a slightly elevated INR on the second day of levofloxacin therapy that required up to a 19% warfarin dose reduction during levofloxacin treatment.

Discussion

An initial premarketing clinical trial concluded that levofloxacin had no effect on warfarin's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic response. Two case reports have since documented an increase in INR in patients taking long-term warfarin on completion of levofloxacin therapy. Our case reports provide further evidence of a significant increase in INR observed during concomitant levofloxacin therapy. The proposed mechanism of this interaction is displacement of warfarin from protein binding sites, reduction in gut flora producing vitamin K, and decreased warfarin metabolism.

Conclusions

Prolonged prothrombin response in patients undergoing chronic warfarin therapy has been well documented with many antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones. Recognition of newer antibiotics' effects on warfarin therapy is important to guide safe use and monitoring of anticoagulation therapy. Our case studies demonstrate significant elevations in INR values during and up to 1 day after levofloxacin therapy in patients undergoing stable warfarin therapy.

Antibacterial Resistance

Antibacterial drugs including levofloxacin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When levofloxacin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full

course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by levofloxacin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Administration with Food, Fluids, and Concomitant Medications

Patients should be informed that levofloxacin tablets may be taken with or without food. The tablets should be taken at the same time each day. Patients should drink fluids liberally while taking levofloxacin to avoid formation of a highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine. Antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral levofloxacin

administration.

Drug Interactions with Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, and Warfarin

Patients should be informed that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, they should discontinue levofloxacin and consult a physician. Patients should be informed that concurrent administration of warfarin and levofloxacin has been associated with increases of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time and clinical episodes of bleeding. Patients should notify their physician if they are taking warfarin, be monitored for evidence of bleeding, and also have their anticoagulation tests closely monitored

7.1 Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins

While the chelation by divalent cations is less marked than with other fluoroquinolones, concurrent administration of levofloxacin tablets with antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc may interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. Tablets with antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine may substantially interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral levofloxacin administration.

7.2 Warfarin

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.3 Antidiabetic Agents

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.4 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Serious bleeding events due to warfarin and antibiotic co-prescription in a cohort of veterans [^113VTB7s]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics may interact with warfarin, increasing the risk for significant bleeding events.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of veterans who were prescribed warfarin for 30 days without interruption through the US Department of Veterans Affairs between October 1, 2002 and September 1, 2008. Antibiotics considered to be high risk for interaction with warfarin include: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, fluconazole, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. Low-risk antibiotics include clindamycin and cephalexin. Risk of bleeding event within 30 days of antibiotic exposure was measured using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and receipt of other medications interacting with warfarin.

Results

A total of 22,272 patients met inclusion criteria, with 14,078 and 8194 receiving high- and low-risk antibiotics, respectively. There were 93 and 36 bleeding events in the high- and low-risk groups, respectively. Receipt of a high-risk antibiotic (hazard ratio [HR] 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–2.19) and azithromycin (HR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.13–3.30) were associated with increased risk of bleeding as a primary diagnosis. TMP/SMX (HR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.45–3.02), ciprofloxacin (HR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.42–2.50), levofloxacin (HR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.22–2.50), azithromycin (HR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.16–2.33), and clarithromycin (HR 2.40; 95% CI, 1.16–4.94) were associated with serious bleeding as a primary or secondary diagnosis. International normalized ratio (INR) alterations were common; 9.7% of patients prescribed fluconazole had INR value > 6. Patients who had INR performed within 3–14 days of co-prescription were at a decreased risk of serious bleeding (HR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.88).

Conclusions

Warfarin users who are prescribed high-risk antibiotics are at higher risk for serious bleeding events. Early INR evaluation may mitigate this risk.

### Respiratory tract infection and risk of bleeding in oral anticoagulant users: self-controlled case series [^111bNXE2]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Most oral anticoagulants are initiated to prevent or treat venous thromboembolism, or to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. The main oral anticoagulants in use are warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. Recent trends suggest that warfarin use has decreased but use of direct oral anticoagulants has increased substantially, leading to an overall increase in oral anticoagulant use of 54% in the United States and 71% in the United Kingdom. In the highest prescribing regions of England in 2019, prescription rates of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants were 170 and 231 per 1000 residents, respectively. Although warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants can effectively prevent and treat thromboembolic events, they are also associated with morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding.

Drug-drug interactions between warfarin and certain antibiotics, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones, are well known causes of serious bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants have fewer known drug-drug interactions than warfarin and have a more predictable anticoagulant response, resulting in fewer reports of antibiotic related harm. However, serious bleeding events are still reported, particularly after co-prescription of direct oral anticoagulants and macrolide antibiotics. For warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants, it is unclear whether bleeding arises primarily from antibiotic-anticoagulant interactions, or whether attributable risk is from the underlying infection itself. The relation between severe infection and coagulopathy is well recognisedbut little evidence currently supports an association between milder community acquired infections and bleeding.

### The risk of overanticoagulation with antibiotic use in outpatients on stable warfarin regimens [^112B6qrN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Medication interactions account for a significant proportion of overanticoagulation in warfarin users. However, little is known about the incidence or degree of interaction with commonly used oral antibiotics.

Objective

To investigate the incidence and degree of overanticoagulation associated with commonly used oral antibiotics.

Design

Retrospective cohort study of patients using warfarin who initiated an antibiotic (azithromycin, levofloxacin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)) or terazosin for clinical indications between January 1998 and December 2002. The incidence of international normalized ratio (INR) elevation and the degree of change and bleeding events after institution of either medication type was recorded.

Subjects

Patients at a university-affiliated Veteran's Affairs Medical Center.

Results

The mean change in INR was -0.15 for terazosin, 0.51 for azithromycin, 0.85 for levofloxacin, and 1.76 for TMP/SMX. These mean INR changes in the antibiotic groups were all statistically different from the terazosin group. The incidence of supratherapeutic INR was 5% for terazosin, 31% for azithromycin, 33% for levofloxacin, and 69% for TMP/SMX. The incidence of absolute INR > 4.0 was 0% for terazosin, 16% for azithromycin, 19% for levofloxacin, and 44% for TMP/SMX.

Conclusions

Among acutely ill outpatients, oral antibiotics (azithromycin, levofloxacin, and TMP/SMX) increase the incidence and degree of overanticoagulation.

### Moxifloxacin-warfarin interaction: a series of five case reports [^116wv9ad]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 5 cases of a moxifloxacin-warfarin drug interaction, all resulting in elevated international normalized ratios (INRs) and clinically significant hemorrhage in one case.

Case Summaries

Between January 2002 and January 2004, 4 men and 1 woman (age range 63–92 y) were retrospectively identified as having significantly elevated INR results shortly after being prescribed moxifloxacin with concomitant warfarin therapy.

Discussion

This is the second series of case reports describing an interaction between warfarin and moxifloxacin. The current moxifloxacin product monograph indicates this drug has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin or the prothrombin time (INR). A moxifloxacin-warfarin interaction probably led to prolonged hospitalization in 2 cases and significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in one case. In 3 of the 5 cases, a moxifloxacin-warfarin interaction was assessed as probable, and in the remaining 2 cases, a moxifloxacin-warfarin interaction was assessed as possible by use of the Naranjo probability scale.

Conclusions

Healthcare professionals should consider moxifloxacin for the potential to interact with warfarin. Routine, frequent INR monitoring for patients previously stabilized on warfarin during initiation and discontinuation of moxifloxacin may help detect this potential interaction.

### Analysis of drug-drug interactions in Swiss claims data using tizanidine and ciprofloxacin as a prototypical contraindicated combination [^112fqzvT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Patients receiving several classes of oral antibiotics were combined to form an appropriate control group. Given the small number of patients receiving tizanidine and other quinolones, and the broader spectrum of indications for ciprofloxacin compared with other quinolones, a control group comprising only quinolones was not established.

Previous pharmacokinetic studies indicated a rapid increase in tizanidine exposure after the initiation of concomitant ciprofloxacin therapy, meaning that possible adverse reactions requiring health care utilization were expected to occur within a short time frame. Therefore, 7-, 14-, and 30-day periods were chosen, thus allowing for evaluation of the development of altered risk for adverse outcomes. Interestingly, the weakest association between exposure and visits was observed at 7 days (odds ratio = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.81–1.53), for reasons that remain speculative; overlapping effects of the underlying disease (antibiotic therapy) may have been more common in the initial treatment period. Additionally, severe adverse reactions in susceptible patients may have appeared rapidly, possibly requiring hospitalization rather than a visit.

Hospitalization

The 2.19-fold increased risk of hospitalization (95% CI = 0.88–5.02; P = 0.07) shortly after the start of ciprofloxacin therapy in patients receiving tizanidine indicates a problematic trend. As expected, the highest risk of hospitalization was observed within 7 days of concomitant treatment. The clinical relevance of other pDDIs was evaluated for different combinations, including statins/macrolides and levothyroxine/warfarin. Whereas some studies found an increased risk of hospitalizations, - others could not demonstrate an association.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin: is new always better than the old? [^113bN7b3]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of the four RCTs comparing efficacy of DOACs versus warfarin found the DOACs to be superior to warfarin in terms of embolic and haemorrhagic stroke but to be inferior in terms of gastrointestinal bleeding events. An important qualification was that superiority was dependent on the proportion of warfarin patients in the therapeutic window. If the average time in the therapeutic range (TTR) was < 66%, the new drugs were superior but they were not superior if average TTR of patients on warfarin was > 66% (Relative Risk = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81 vs Relative Risk = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13, P interaction = 0.022).

Three other subsequent observations raise major concerns. RCTs tend to focus on younger people with fewer comorbidities. Abrahams et al reported in 2015 that adverse events were more common in the older population. This has a plausible biological basis since excretion rates are pivotal to maintaining correct therapeutic levels. DOACs are more dangerous in people with impaired renal function. In the frail elderly population, intercurrent illness can lead to acute decline in renal function leading to excessive anticoagulation and sometimes life-threatening bleeding. Guidance suggests that renal function should be regularly checked but compliance with this guidance is thought to be poor in practice. The importance of drug–drug interactions with DOACs is underappreciated and can occur with drugs used intermittently, for example, antibiotics such as clarithromycin. The lack of validated laboratory tests to monitor the degree of anticoagulation with DOACs means that any dose reduction in patients with impaired renal function or on interacting drugs is empirical.

### Readmissions for warfarin-related bleeding in pediatric patients after hospital discharge [^116EujC6]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin therapy in pediatric patients can be difficult to manage with bleeding as a primary adverse event. Therapy initiation can be difficult as doses to achieve therapeutic outcomes are being determined. Evaluation of readmission for bleeding in pediatric patients discharged on warfarin therapy may be useful to prevent adverse events.

Methods

The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) was queried to identify all patients < 19 years of age who were discharged from a pediatric hospital on warfarin therapy. Patients who were readmitted with bleeding in the first 30 days after discharge were identified and patient variables, hospital stay variables, and medications at discharge were identified. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for bleeding readmission.

Results

A total of 4,883 patients met study criteria (56% male, mean age 10.1 + 5.9 years). The two most common indications for warfarin therapy were cardiac valve replacement (23.6%) and Fontan procedure (19.5%). Ninety-seven patients (1.99%) were readmitted with bleeding within 30 days of discharge [median time 9 days (IQR 5–16 days)]. Multivariate analysis identified Asian race (OR 4.0, P < 0.01); mitral valve replacement (OR 2.5, P < 0.01); escitalopram at discharge (OR 4.2, P = 0.02); levofloxacin at discharge (OR 8.3, P < 0.01); lansoprazole at discharge (OR 1.7, P = 0.047); and length of stay (OR 1.01, P = 0.047) as significant for bleeding readmission.

Conclusion

Pediatric patients discharged on warfarin may be readmitted for bleeding within 30 days if risk factors are present. Risk factors include patient genetic profile, drug interactions, and indications with higher goal INR values.

### Reducing warfarin medication interactions… [^112imLmr]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Coprescribing interacting medications can result in serious patient consequences, particularly in patients who receive warfarin, because of warfarin's narrow therapeutic index. 1 Medication interactions that accentuate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin increase patient risk for intracerebral hemorrhage, other bleeding episodes, and death.

1. There was also a significant level change in the warfarin-fluconazole interacting prescription rate at the time of the intervention but a nonsignificant slope change. Among warfarin-interacting medication prescriptions, the mean prescription overlap ranged from 4. 5 days for fluconazole to
23. 9 days for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; there were no significant differences in the length of the overlap periods before and after the interventions. We found that coprescribing warfarin with interacting medications was common in the outpatient setting.

More than a third of patients receiving warfarin were coprescribed 1 of the 5 study medications, and warfarin-acetaminophen coprescription accounted for the majority of the interacting prescriptions. These findings are consistent with those from a retrospective review of a large pharmacy benefits manager database, in which 64. 8% of patients taking warfarin received a concurrent prescription for at least 1 potentially interacting drug, and acetaminophen-containing products accounted for
22. 7% of these.
3. Although several case reports and controlled studies have reported that acetaminophen potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, 11, 19, 20 others have not found a clinically relevant interaction. 21, 22 We found a significant reduction in warfarin-acetaminophen coprescribing after the alert was implemented despite the controversy surrounding the clinical significance of the interaction.

This highlights the importance of the careful selection of medication interactions to target with alerts. In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study in ambulatory care with a strong quasi-experimental design that found that EMR alerts reduced the frequency of coprescribing of interacting medications. We found that coprescribing interacting medications with warfarin is common. Given that prior work supports the association between warfarin-interacting medication, increased INR, and resultant patient bleeding risk, implementing EMR alerts for medications interacting with warfarin should reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

### An ulcerated violaceous nodule on the thigh [^113heGCY]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate initial treatment?
A. Increasing the dose of prednisone
B. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate
C. Switching warfarin to apixaban
D. Ciprofloxacin
E. Wide local excision

Answers:
A. Increasing the dose of prednisone – Incorrect. Systemic steroids would be appropriate for a primary inflammatory process such as pyoderma gangrenosum, but would fail to address the infectious etiology of malakoplakia and could cause harm by resulting in further immunosuppression. The opposite situation, a reduction in immunosuppression, could be beneficial in patients with malakoplakia, in addition to treatment with antibiotics.
B. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate – Incorrect. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate is often used to treat calciphylaxis, with a possible mechanism of action of calcium chelation and solubilization. Calcium deposition is not a driving factor in malakoplakia pathophysiology and does not address its infectious etiology.
C. Switching warfarin to apixaban – Incorrect. Anticoagulation is indicated for patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and may also be beneficial in patients with other forms of vasculopathy. However, anticoagulation is not considered a therapeutic option for malakoplakia.
D. Ciprofloxacin – Correct. Standard of care in the treatment of malakoplakia is a prolonged course of antibiotics to address the underlying infection, as well as consideration of surgical excision and immunosuppression reduction when appropriate. Antibiotic choice should be guided by susceptibility results, with preference given to those antibiotics with intracellular efficacy, such as fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
E. Wide local excision – Incorrect. While surgical intervention can augment the efficacy of antibiotic treatment substantially, wide local excision alone is not the standard of care for malakoplakia.

### Warfarin with fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, or azole antifungals: interactions and the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding [^112tk5Qz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between warfarin and orally administered anti-infectives increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in warfarin users. We conducted a nested case-control and case-crossover study using US Medicaid data. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between GI bleeding and prior use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, co-trimoxazole, or fluconazole vs. no exposure and also vs. use of cephalexin, which would not be expected to interact with warfarin. All of the anti-infectives examined were associated with elevated odds ratios (ORs) when compared to no exposure to these drugs. With cephalexin data as the reference, the ORs for co-trimoxazole (OR: 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21–2.33) in the prior 6–10 days) and fluconazole (OR: 2.09 (95% CI: 1.34–3.26) in the prior 11–15 days) were significantly elevated. Warfarin users who had received an anti-infective agent showed a substantially increased risk of GI bleeding. However, a drug-drug interaction with warfarin was evident only for co-trimoxazole and fluconazole.

Prescribing medications, recognizing and managing medication side effects and drug interactions, and avoiding polypharmacy are all essential skills in the care of older adults in primary care. Important side effects of medications commonly prescribed in older adults (statins, proton pump inhibitors, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, zolpidem, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors) were reviewed. Important drug interactions with four agents or classes (statins, warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers) are discussed.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^11456ERZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Morphine

No significant effect of morphine sulfate (a single 10 mg intramuscular dose) on the mean AUC and Cmaxof moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) was observed in a study of 20 healthy male and female volunteers.

Oral Contraceptives

A placebo-controlled study in 29 healthy female subjects showed that moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days did not interfere with the hormonal suppression of oral contraception with 0.15 mg levonorgestrel/0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (as measured by serum progesterone, FSH, estradiol, and LH), or with the pharmacokinetics of the administered contraceptive agents.

Probenecid

Probenecid (500 mg twice daily for two days) did not alter the renal clearance and total amount of moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) excreted renally in a study of 12 healthy volunteers.

Ranitidine

No significant effect of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for three days as pretreatment) on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) was detected in a study involving 10 healthy volunteers.

Theophylline

No significant effect of moxifloxacin (200 mg every twelve hours for 3 days) on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (400 mg every twelve hours for 3 days) was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers. In addition, theophylline was not shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. The effect of co-administration of 400 mg once daily of moxifloxacin with theophylline has not been studied.

Warfarin

No significant effect of moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for eight days) on the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin (25 mg single dose of warfarin sodium on the fifth day) was detected in a study involving 24 healthy volunteers. No significant change in prothrombin time was observed. However, fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly patients taking warfarin… [^112We5qz]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Long-term use of warfarin was associated with osteoporotic fractures, at least in men with atrial fibrillation. β-Adrenergic antagonists may protect against osteoporotic fractures. We hypothesized that patients with long-term use of warfarin would have an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture. Quantifying the risk of osteoporotic fracture from warfarin and other clinical factors is important because patients at high risk of fracture could choose to take anticoagulants in which the mechanism of action is independent of vitamin K, 12, 13 or they could alter their diet, behavior, or pharmacotherapy to decrease their risk of fracture. 14 The secondary aim of this study was to quantify how other medications and clinical factors affect the risk of osteoporotic fracture. We performed Cox analyses stratified by a prebaseline diagnosis of osteoporosis based on a prebaseline Part B claim or as inferred by an admission medication of raloxifene hydrochloride, calcitonin, fluoride, teriparatide, or any bisphosphonate. Hypertension and heart failure were the most common comorbid conditions. Subjects without prebaseline exposure to warfarin were significantly more likely to be female, nonwhite, have a high risk of falls, and have neuropsychiatric disorders. Loop diuretics and β-adrenergic antagonists were the most common medications on admission and were prescribed more often to subjects receiving warfarin therapy. In this retrospective cohort study of 14 564 patients with atrial fibrillation, long-term use of warfarin was associated with a 25% increased risk of osteoporotic fracture. In contrast, use of warfarin for less than 1 year had no significant association with osteoporotic fracture. Among those with long-term use, warfarin was most strongly associated with vertebral fractures.

They found an increased incident of osteoporotic fractures of 1. 5 in patients who took warfarin for 3 to 12 months and an increased incident of fractures of

1. 6 in patients with long-term warfarin use. 10 In contrast, Pilon et al9 found no significant association between prior use of a vitamin K antagonist and fracture of the hip or wrist.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^113d5m1d]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (but not aspirin): These drugs in combination with very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies.

Omeprazole: The rate and extent of absorption of ciprofloxacin was bioequivalent when Proquin XR was given alone or when Proquin XR was given 2 hours after omeprazole at the dose that maximally suppresses gastric acid secretion. Omeprazole should be taken as directed and Proquin XR should be taken with a main meal of the day, preferably the evening meal. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and Information for Patients).

Phenytoin: Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin.

Probenecid: Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.

Theophylline: As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life. This may result in increased risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions. (See WARNINGS) If concomitant use cannot be avoided, serum levels of theophylline should be monitored and dosage adjustments made as appropriate.

Warfarin: Quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant warfarin or its derivatives. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be monitored.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Rodent carcinogenicity studies were not required. Two in vitro mutagenicity tests were conducted with ciprofloxacin:

Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay; negative for mutagenicity in the presence and absence of an S-9 metabolic activation system.
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Chromosomal Aberration Assay; positive for inducing chromosomal aberrations.

In addition to the in vitro genotoxicity assays, an in vivo rat micronucleus study with ciprofloxacin was negative.

Fertility studies performed with male and female rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 10-fold the recommended 500 mg therapeutic dose based upon body surface area) revealed no evidence of impairment.

### Postpartum pulmonary cryptococcosis combined with pulmonary embolism: a case report [^1126Uz5f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary infarction is a condition in which pulmonary blood vessel obstruction leads to ischemia and alveolar hemorrhage. If the latter cannot be absorbed, it will eventually lead to lung tissue necrosis, and fibrous scars will be formed in the infarct area, lasting for weeks or even months. The clinical manifestations of patients with pulmonary infarction are not specific, but pleurisy chest pain often occurs, which may be related to the pleural inflammation, irritation and necrosis caused by alveolar hemorrhage. At present, the diagnosis of pulmonary infarction is still mainly based on imaging, which is usually wedge-shaped in the subpleura, and its imaging manifestations include consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion and ground glass changes. In our case, the shadow in the patient's lung was considered to be caused by cryptococcal infection and pulmonary embolism leading to infar. It was speculated that the patient's chest pain may be related to the secondary infection caused by ischemia, hemorrhage, and swelling caused by the infarction lesion, and Gocho et al. also reported the elimination of chest pain in patients with secondary infection of pulmonary infarction by anti-infection treatment, thus we inferred that the symptoms of chest pain in this case were improved before admission by levofloxacin through the treatment of secondary infection of pulmonary infarction.

The treatment of pulmonary cryptococcosis is determined by disease severity. This case was treated with fluconazole orally after discharge with mild clinical symptoms. In the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism, anticoagulation, thrombolysis and interventional therapy can be selected according to the risk stratification. Common oral anticoagulation drugs include warfarin and rivaroxaban. Warfarin is predominantly metabolized (> 80%) by Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), As fluconazole acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, their concomitant use elevates therisk of bleeding. However, rivaroxaban exhibits rapid absorption following oral administration, and has a reduced potential for drug-drug interactions, eliminating the need for International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring. Therefore, the patient was prescribed long-term oral rivaroxaban combined with fluconazole treatment following discharge. Given that both fluconazole and rivaroxaban are excreted in breast milk, this patient was advised to discontinue breastfeeding.

### Profile of moxifloxacin drug interactions [^114Z3y1k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We report a brief description of the interaction profile of moxifloxacin. After oral administration, the absorption of moxifloxacin was unaffected by ranitidine or by food consumption. Drugs containing multivalent cations (e.g. Mg(++), Al(+++), and Fe(++), but not Ca(++)) impaired absorption. No clinically relevant effect of moxifloxacin was seen on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin under combination steady state conditions. Also, moxifloxacin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or vice versa. This result, plus further data proving lack of interaction with glyburide, warfarin, and oral contraceptives, confirms the absence of metabolic interactions involving the cytochrome P-450 system, as previously reported. Concomitant administration of probenecid did not affect the elimination of moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin thus has a unique drug interaction profile that is advantageous for its safe use.

### Interaction of antibiotics and warfarin in pediatric cardiology patients [^115TSqW1]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are known to alter the anticoagulation induced by warfarin in adults, but little is known about this interaction in children. In a retrospective review of patients under the age of 21 years, we found that antibiotic therapy (89 courses of antibiotics in 23 patients) was associated with an increase in the mean international normalized ratio (INR) from 2.7 to 3.6. The change in INR correlated inversely with patient age. These data suggest that more intensive monitoring of the INR after starting antibiotics may help to mitigate excessive anticoagulation in children receiving warfarin.

### A 51-year-old man with dyspnea and a pulmonary nodule [^113zfYVr]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 51-year-old man presented with chest tightness, exertional dyspnea, and occasional chest pain for 2 years. The patient visited his local hospital initially, and CT scan revealed a ground glass opacity (GGO) located in the right upper lobe (Fig 1A). He was diagnosed as having pulmonary infection and treated with levofloxacin for 12 days. A repeated chest CT scan 14 days later demonstrated a progressed solid nodule with surrounding ground glass opacity (Fig 1B). With a suspicion of carcinoma in situ, right upper lobectomy was performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery at the local hospital. However, the histologic examination did not show any evidence of malignancy, and the symptoms persisted. Fourteen months later, his dyspnea worsened with extremely low exercise tolerance. The patient denied other symptoms (eg, rash, fever, joint pain, aphthous stomatitis, genital ulceration, other symptoms of arteritis). His appetite was decreased but without significant weight loss. He did not smoke and had a history of fully recovered cerebral infarction 9 months ago. There was no family history of respiratory diseases. After 4 months, a CT pulmonary angiography scan revealed filling defects at the left pulmonary artery and left inferior pulmonary artery (Fig 2A). A vascular narrowing was detected at the left superior pulmonary artery. Accompanied with an increased D-dimer level (> 10 mg/L; normal range, 0–0.5 mg/L), a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made. The patient was treated with warfarin, and his symptom of dyspnea was partially relieved. He came to our hospital for further treatment 4 months later.

### Warfarin interactions with antibiotics in the ambulatory care setting [^1146ZAxG]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The effect of antibiotic coadministration on the international normalized ratio (INR) in a relatively stable, real-world warfarin population has not been adequately described. Case reports and studies of healthy volunteers do not account for the potential contribution of acute illness to INR variability.

Objective

To compare the risk of excessive anticoagulation among patients with stable warfarin therapy purchasing an antibiotic (antibiotic group) with the risk in patients purchasing a warfarin refill (stable controls) and patients with upper respiratory tract infection but not receiving an antibiotic (sick controls).

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study evaluated patients receiving warfarin between January 1, 2005, and March 31, 2011, at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, an integrated health care delivery system. Continuous data were expressed as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with a follow-up INR of 5.0 or more. A total of 5857 (48.8%), 5579 (46.5%), and 570 (4.7%) patients were included in the antibiotic, stable control, and sick control groups, respectively. Mean age was 68.3 years, and atrial fibrillation was the most common (44.4%) indication for anticoagulation.

Exposures

Warfarin therapy with a medical visit for upper respiratory tract infection or coadministration of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were the proportion of patients experiencing a follow-up INR of 5.0 or more and change between the last INR measured before the index date and the follow-up INR.

Results

The proportion of patients experiencing an INR of 5.0 or more was 3.2%, 2.6%, and 1.2% for the antibiotic, sick, and stable groups, respectively (P < .001, antibiotic vs stable control group; P < .017, sick vs stable control group; P = 0.44, antibiotic vs sick control group). Cancer diagnosis, elevated baseline INR, and female sex predicted a follow-up INR of 5.0 or more. Among antibiotics, those interfering with warfarin metabolism posed the greatest risk for an INR of 5.0 or more.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acute upper respiratory tract infection increases the risk of excessive anticoagulation independent of antibiotic use. Antibiotics also increase the risk; however, most patients with previously stable warfarin therapy will not experience clinically relevant increases in INR following antibiotic exposure or acute upper respiratory tract infection.

### An evaluation of the potential drug interaction between warfarin and levothyroxine [^11771SZx]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Drug interaction references report that initiation of levothyroxine potentiates the effects of warfarin, and recommend more frequent International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring, but the mechanism is not well understood.

Objective

To assess the impact of levothyroxine initiation on INR response.

Patients/Methods

A retrospective, self-controlled study was performed on patients aged ≥ 18 years receiving chronic warfarin therapy who were started on levothyroxine between 1 January 2006 and 30 June 2013, and who were followed for 90 days prior to and after levothyroxine initiation. The included patients had at least one elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone laboratory value in the pre-period, continuous warfarin therapy for 100 days prior to levothyroxine initiation, no purchases of medications known to interact with warfarin, no procedures requiring warfarin interruption, and no bleeding or thromboembolic event during the study period. The primary outcome was a comparison of the warfarin dose/INR ratio recorded before the initiation of levothyroxine with the ratio recorded during the post-period after two consecutive INRs with no warfarin dose change.

Results

One hundred and two patients were included in the primary outcome. The mean warfarin dose/INR ratios in the pre-period and post-period were equivalent (P = 0.825). Although the mean warfarin dose was numerically lower in the post-period than in the pre-period, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.068).

Conclusion

No difference in the mean warfarin dose/INR ratio before and after initiation of levothyroxine was detected. The results suggest that there is not a clinically significant interaction between warfarin and levothyroxine, and so additional monitoring may not be necessary.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Avelox) [^114DSp7v]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Theophylline

No significant effect of moxifloxacin (200 mg every twelve hours for 3 days) on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (400 mg every twelve hours for 3 days) was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers. In addition, theophylline was not shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. The effect of co-administration of a 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin with theophylline has not been studied, but it is not expected to be clinically significant based on in vitro metabolic data showing that moxifloxacin does not inhibit the CYP1A2 isoenzyme.

Warfarin

No significant effect of moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for eight days) on the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin (25 mg single dose of warfarin sodium on the fifth day) was detected in a study involving 24 healthy volunteers. No significant change in prothrombin time was observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Mechanism of Action

The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. It appears that the C8-methoxy moiety contributes to enhanced activity and lower selection of resistant mutants of Gram-positive bacteria compared to the C8-H moiety. The presence of the bulky bicycloamine substituent at the C-7 position prevents active efflux, associated with the NorA or pmrA genes seen in certain Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

The mechanism of action for fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to moxifloxacin. Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by a mutation in topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) or topoisomerase IV genes, decreased outer membrane permeability or drug efflux. In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops slowly via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1.8 × 10⁻⁹to < 1 × 10⁻¹¹for Gram-positive bacteria.

Coadministration of oral divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds with oral fluoroquinolones may impair fluoroquinolone absorption. Among 3,134 patients who received a course of oral levofloxacin, coadministration was significantly associated with subsequent identification of a levofloxacin-resistant isolate. Strategies to curb the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance should include avoiding the coadministration of divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds and fluoroquinolone.

Antibiotic coverage

Antibiotic coverage is considered in case at least one of the following criteria is present: 1) WBC < 4.000 o > 10.000 (and neutrophilia); 2) PCT > 1 μg/L (or PCT > 0.5 μg/L on two consecutive determination); 3) Clinical-radiological signs of bacterial infection. Antibiotic selection follows the latest IDSA/ATS CAP Guidelines.

Inappropriate antibiotic use may reduce their availability and broad-spectrum antibiotics in particular may lead to Clostridium difficile infection and antimicrobial resistance. For these reasons, we consider antibiotic therapy only in case of criteria suggesting risk of co-infection or super-imposed infection with bacteria. Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage is based on risk factors for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Empiric broad spectrum antibiotic coverage is continued while obtaining definitive cultural data. In patients tested positive for Influenza virus A or B, oseltamivir 75 mg 1 tablet every 12 h is initiated with the aim of reducing the risk of death. Finally, in case of treatment with a macrolides or respiratory fluoroquinolones, EKG is performed on daily basis especially if the patient is on hydroxychloroquine or other medications that prolong QT interval.

Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis

In patient with a low-risk of bleeding (normal clotting time with PT < 1.5, platelets > 100,000 mm³, no active bleeding, and no risk of trauma), an individualized prophylaxis with enoxaparin sodium is given subcutaneously (either 4000 IU every 24 h, or 100 IU/kg every 24 h, or 70 IU/kg every 24 h, according to disease severity and inflammatory and coagulative markers). In case of creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min, Heparin calcium at starting dose of 5000 Units/ 0.2 mL solution × 3 daily for subcutaneous injection was given (aPTT target: 2.0). Patients on chronic therapy with direct anti FII, anti FX oral anticoagulants or warfarin have been switched to enoxaparin sodium 100 IU/kg × 2/die subcutaneously.
In patients with a high-risk of bleeding or abnormal clotting time, a multidisciplinary discussion is organized with haematologists in order to individualize anti-thrombotic prophylaxis on patient's characteristics.

Restart of anticoagulation — Begin by asking, "Does the patient fall into 1 of the following groups?": NPO, awaiting an invasive procedure, pregnancy, high risk of rebleeding, or being bridged back to VKA with high thrombotic risk (see Table 6). If yes, suggest temporary or long-term parenteral anticoagulation. If no, determine if the patient is on concomitant antiplatelet therapy; if so, reassess the need for aspirin in stable CAD and reassess the need for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients after PCI and/or ACS and consider discontinuation of aspirin. Next, evaluate whether the patient is taking concurrent medications that interact with OAC levels (e.g., antiretrovirals, antifungals, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics); if present, suggest pharmacy consultation and consideration of switching either OAC or the interacting medication. If no interacting medications are identified, suggest restarting anticoagulation, then choose OAC and consider switching OAC if a reversible cause related to the OAC contributed to the bleed (e.g., high INR, renal function variation). After resumption, if bleeding reoccurred, reassess the severity of the bleed (see Figure 2).

If there is no urgent need for an immediate anticoagulant effect, warfarin administration can be commenced without the concurrent use of a rapid-acting anticoagulant.

### Potential interaction between telithromycin and warfarin [^113RccgC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of warfarin-telithromycin interaction resulting in an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and hemoptysis.

Case Summary

A 73-year-old white man developed an elevated INR and mild hemoptysis as a result of an interaction between warfarin and telithromycin 800 mg/day. The INR increased from 3.1 before telithromycin was started to 11 after 5 days of telithromycin therapy. The INR returned to the therapeutic range 4 days after telithromycin was discontinued.

Discussion

Telithromycin is the first member of the macrolide subclass of ketolides and offers potential advantages over traditional macrolides/azalides for community-acquired respiratory tract infections caused by macrolide-resistant pathogens. As of July 16, 2004, bleeding complications and an increased INR as a result of an interaction between warfarin and telithromycin have not been described. Although the mechanism for this interaction remains unknown, it is suspected that it is a result of the inhibition of the metabolism of the R-isomer of warfarin, which is metabolized predominantly by CYP1A2 and less by CYP3A4. Further research is required to elucidate this issue. An objective causality assessment revealed that this adverse drug event as a result of the warfarin and telithromycin interaction was probable.

Conclusions

We recommend close monitoring of INR levels in patients on warfarin who receive telithromycin therapy in an effort to control and prevent bleeding complications.

### Two cases of retroperitoneal haematoma caused by interaction between antibiotics and warfarin [^1161aUBc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Several commonly prescribed antibiotics are known to interact with warfarin, increasing its anticoagulant effect by different mechanisms.

### Clinically significant drug interactions… [^116G54dV]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Unless the prothrombin International Normalized Ratio can be monitored every other day, ciprofloxacin, macrolide antibiotics, metronidazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole generally should not be prescribed to patients who are taking warfarin. Alternative antimicrobial therapy is recommended for these patients. Although concomitant use of warfarin and aspirin generally should be avoided, certain patients may benefit from this therapy. One study of patients at high risk for thromboembolic events demonstrated that the increased risk of bleeding with combined warfarin and aspirin therapy was outweighed by the benefit in decreased thromboembolic events. 7 The patients in this study received aspirin in a dosage of 100 mg per day and maintained an INR of 2. 5 to 3.
5.

6 Preliminary data suggest that the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib may be safer options in patients requiring an NSAID and warfarin, because these agents have reduced antiplatelet properties compared with traditional NSAIDs.
9. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and warfarin should be avoided, especially in patients who are at increased risk for NSAID gastropathy. One retrospective study found that the risk of hemorrhagic peptic ulcers was 13 times greater in patients older than 65 years who were taking NSAIDs and warfarin than in patients of the same age who were taking neither drug. 10 If NSAID therapy is necessary, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor should be used, and the INR should be closely monitored. Patients also should be informed about the risk of bleeding associated with combined warfarin and NSAID therapy.

Lovastatin may potentiate the effects of warfarin by displacing the drug from plasma protein binding sites or inhibiting hepatic metabolism of the drug. Although potentiation of warfarin by lovastatin has been reported in at least 10 patients, controlled trials in large numbers of patients are needed to discern the clinical importance of this effect. 22 The INR should be monitored in patients who are taking lovastatin and warfarin, especially if the lovastatin dosage is changed.

### A potential interaction between warfarin and atovaquone [^1121CSRL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient established on warfarin therapy who was then initiated on atovaquone therapy.

Case Summary

A 53-year-old African American male with HIV was prescribed warfarin 5 mg/day for 12 months after diagnosis of idiopathic deep vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli (target INR 2.5 [range 2.0–3.0]). The patient required Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis and was prescribed atovaquone instead of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy because of the latter drug's known interaction with warfarin. The patient's INR rose by greater than 50% (from 2.3 to 3.5) after 7 days of concomitant warfarin and atovaquone. In response, the patient's total weekly warfarin dose was decreased by 5%. Eight days later, the patient's INR was still supratherapeutic at 3.1. Approximately 4 weeks later, his INR was 4.2. One dose of warfarin was withheld and then the total weekly warfarin dosage was decreased by another 10%. Eight days later, the patient discontinued atovaquone therapy but continued on warfarin as prescribed. One day after atovaquone discontinuation, his INR decreased to 1.7. Due to this subtherapeutic INR level, 8 days later the total weekly warfarin dose was increased by 5%. Although a follow-up appointment was scheduled, no further INR values were obtained because the patient's 12-month course of anticoagulation therapy was completed and warfarin was discontinued. The patient did not report any adverse effects or signs or symptoms of hemorrhage while his INR values were supratherapeutic.

Discussion

Warfarin's potential for interactions with other highly protein-bound drugs, such as atovaquone, can result in displacement from protein binding sites and increased serum concentrations of warfarin. Based on a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and the Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program (all through July 31, 2010), no cases were found of an interaction between atovaquone and warfarin. The Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale calculated this to be a probable interaction between warfarin and atovaquone.

Conclusions

Although current medication references do not report an interaction between atovaquone and warfarin, knowledge of their pharmacodynamic properties can enable practitioners to anticipate the consequences of a possible transient increase in warfarin serum concentration, such as that seen in our patient, when given concomitantly.

### Warfarin interactions with antibiotics… [^117LUR4r]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Another retrospective study10 compared INR outcomes in patients receiving warfarin who were receiving concomitantly prescribed azithromycin, levofloxacin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with outcomes in a control group in which terazosin was coprescribed. Increased INRs were observed across antibiotic groups, but the effect of concurrent illness on INR response could not be ruled out because the controls were not acutely ill. The follow-up INR timing in the stable controls was one of convenience and extended to 30 days to increase the sample size. We observed that patients receiving warfarin who were evaluated in a medical office for upper respiratory tract infection and/or purchased a prescription antitussive but did not purchase an antibiotic were more likely than stable control group patients to have a follow-up INR of 5. 0 or more. Antibiotic group patients were also more likely to have a follow-up INR of 5.

0 or more than were stable control patients, but the difference between the antibiotic and sick control groups was not statistically significant. However, most patients in either the antibiotic or sick control groups did not have follow-up INRs that would have necessitated a change in the warfarin dosage, and similar 30-day rates of thromboembolism, bleeding, and death were observed across all study groups. We conclude, therefore, that the absolute risk of harm associated with coprescribing antibiotic and warfarin therapy is low. Previous studies19, 20 evaluating preemptive warfarin dosage reduction to mitigate the risk of excessive anticoagulation among patients prescribed antibiotics have reported mixed results. Warfarin dosage reduction during trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole coadministration resulted in fewer INRs higher than 4. 0 without an increase in subtherapeutic anticoagulation compared with a control group not receiving a dosage reduction.

Although encouraging, these findings were limited by a small sample size. 20 Among patients receiving doxycycline or levofloxacin, preemptive warfarin dosage reduction increased the risk of subtherapeutic anticoagulation. 19, 20 Transient, short-term INR elevation does not appear to present a substantial risk for major hemorrhage. 21, 22 In addition, our findings reveal that the mean INR change among patients with stable warfarin therapy who receive antibiotics is minimal, arguing against routine use of preemptive warfarin dosage reduction in this setting.

### Pemphigus foliaceus associated with hypericum perforatum [^115pMBQX]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

H perforatum may interact with other drugs. It can induce intestinal P-glycoprotein and liver cytochrome P450s (CYPs), including CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.,

Therefore, H perforatum may reduce the efficacy of the oral contraceptive pill, warfarin, proton-pump inhibitors, antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, immunosuppressants, digoxin, theophylline, carbamazepine, HIV medication (protease inhibitor), fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and analgesics. Moreover, H perforatum may potentiate the adverse effects of anesthetics, opioid, antidepressants (serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors) and antidiabetic agents.,

Autoimmune diseases, may be triggered by an immune-enhancing effect. Herbal supplements may increase activity of macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and proinflammatory cytokines levels such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor–alpha. However, the mechanisms of action remain unknown.

Herbal supplements should be considered medications and health professionals should be aware of their potential adverse effects and drug interactions. Herbal supplements may have an immune-enhancing effect, exacerbating preexisting autoimmune diseases or triggering autoimmune disease in genetically predisposed individuals. As a result, a complete drug history is necessary. In our case, pemphigus foliaceus onset was temporally associated with the use of H perforatum, but cause and effect cannot be proven. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of herbal drugs in pemphigus and other autoimmune diseases.

### Respiratory tract infection and risk of bleeding in oral anticoagulant users: self-controlled case series [^114CALPC]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications and conclusions

These findings are important and timely given the increasing rates of oral anticoagulant use and the lack of knowledge and guidance on how to manage oral anticoagulant use during acute infection. We were unable to find specific details of how infection might affect anticoagulation in clinical guidelines. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's clinical knowledge summary was recently amended and now states that "acute illness may exaggerate the effect of warfarin and necessitate a dose reduction", but no similar statement is provided for direct oral anticoagulants. Insights from our patient representatives suggest that some patients who use warfarin suspect that acute infection could affect their coagulation and change their monitoring and other behaviours during intercurrent illness. However, we were unable to find any published research to support this.

Future studies should replicate this work with a larger sample, which will help assess whether we were underpowered to detect a difference beyond the 14 day risk window. Studies of the association between antibiotic use and bleeding have observed effects of up to 60 days after exposure. If these findings are confirmed in further studies, qualitative research is needed to understand knowledge and behaviours of patients and clinicians on managing anticoagulant use during acute infection. Research should subsequently inform co-production of guidance to help mitigate any additional risk and reduce the frequency of bleeding related adverse outcomes.

This self-controlled case series observed a greater than twofold increase in the risk of major bleeding and CRNMB in the 0–14 days after an untreated RTI, with some suggestion that the risk peaks at 0–5 days for CRNMB and 11–15 days for major bleeding. This finding has potential implications for how patients and clinicians manage oral anticoagulant use during an acute intercurrent illness, but further work is needed before any clinical recommendations are made. However, these findings warrant further investigation to fully understand the potential risks and how they might be mitigated.

### Probable interaction between warfarin and torsemide [^116RHDnd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case in which the anticoagulation effect of warfarin appeared to be potentiated by torsemide, possibly due to an interference of metabolism through competition for the CYP2C9 isoenzyme and protein-binding displacement of warfarin.

Case Summary

A 43-year-old Hispanic female with congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and a mitral mechanical valve replacement was effectively anticoagulated with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5–3.5 on a warfarin regimen of 50–52.5 mg/wk. One week following the initiation of torsemide 40 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the afternoon, a marked increase in the INR occurred (6.2), requiring a warfarin dosage reduction. Subsequent titrations over a 3-week period eventually resulted in the achievement of a therapeutic INR (from 3.3 to 2.9) with a new warfarin regimen of 47.5 mg/wk.

Discussion

Both torsemide and warfarin are highly protein-bound to albumin and are major substrates for the CYP2C9 isoenzyme. Competition by multiple drugs for metabolism via CYP2C9 may decrease the clearance of the drugs from systemic circulation. Addition of a drug with high protein binding may result in the displacement of other drugs that circulate highly protein-bound. Therefore, it is possible that the addition of torsemide may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin by (1) competition for metabolism through CYP2C9, with a decrease in the clearance of warfarin, and (2) protein-binding displacement of warfarin from albumin, transiently potentiating anticoagulant activity. An objective causality assessment revealed that the interaction was probable. Cardiology records confirmed the absence of fluid and heart failure status changes; therefore, these were ruled out as potential etiologies. No levothyroxine dosage changes occurred over the previous 14 months; thus, this also was ruled out as a possible etiology.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, an interaction between warfarin and torsemide has not been previously reported. While further research should be done to confirm this interaction, practitioners should be made aware of its possibility.

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

### Romidepsin (Istodax) [^116CwGjP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Carefully monitor prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients concurrently administered ISTODAX and warfarin or coumarin derivatives (7.1).
Monitor for toxicities related to increased romidepsin exposure when co-administering romidepsin with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (7.2).
Avoid use with rifampin and strong CYP3A4 inducers (7.3).

7.1 Warfarin or Coumarin Derivatives

Prolongation of PT and elevation of INR were observed in a patient receiving ISTODAX concomitantly with warfarin. Monitor PT and INR more frequently in patients concurrently receiving ISTODAX and warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 Enzymes

Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase concentrations of romidepsin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor for toxicity related to increased romidepsin exposure and follow the dose modifications for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] when ISTODAX is initially co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

7.3 Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes

Rifampin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer) increased the concentrations of romidepsin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid co-administration of ISTODAX with rifampin. The use of other potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided when possible.

### Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in primary care [^115E94pp]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug interactions are common in the primary care setting and are usually predictable. Identifying the most important and clinically relevant drug interactions in primary care is essential to patient safety. Strategies for reducing the risk of drug-drug interactions include minimizing the number of drugs prescribed, re-evaluating therapy on a regular basis, considering nonpharmacologic options, monitoring for signs and symptoms of toxicity or effectiveness, adjusting dosages of medications when indicated, and adjusting administration times. Inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing isoenzymes is the most common mechanism by which clinically important drug interactions occur. The antimicrobials most likely to affect the international normalized ratio significantly in patients receiving warfarin are trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, and fluconazole. An empiric warfarin dosage reduction of 30% to 50% upon initiation of amiodarone therapy is recommended. In patients receiving amiodarone, limit dosages of simvastatin to 20 mg per day and lovastatin to 40 mg per day. Beta blockers should be tapered and discontinued several days before clonidine withdrawal to reduce the risk of rebound hypertension. Spironolactone dosages should be limited to 25 mg daily when coadministered with potassium supplements. Avoid prescribing opioid cough medicines for patients receiving benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol. Physicians should consider consultation with a clinical pharmacist when clinical circumstances require the use of drugs with interaction potential.

### Risk factors for elevated INR values during warfarin therapy in hospitalized pediatric patients [^1141a1BY]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There are currently no data describing the incidence of or risk factors for elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) values in patients receiving warfarin at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. By minimizing risk factors for elevated INR values patient morbidity may be minimized.

Procedures

A 6-year retrospective chart review of inpatient admissions at our institution that received warfarin was performed. Factors for elevated INR values, such as patient demographics, disease state, and medication interactions were reviewed. Patients with an INR value ≥ 0.5 above the upper limit of the goal range were compared to patients without an elevated INR value. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent variables for elevated INR values.

Results

A total of 298 patient admissions (184 patients) met study criteria, and the largest patient population was between 1 and 12 years old (36.9%). The most common indication for warfarin was mitral valve replacement (25.5%). An elevated INR occurred in 20.8% of admissions. Logistic regression analysis identified Asian race, an elevated baseline INR value, warfarin initiation after cardiac surgery, days of inpatient warfarin therapy, and drug interactions with ciprofloxacin and lansoprazole as independent variables for an elevated INR value (P < 0.05). Obesity was significant as an independent variable for a non-elevated INR value (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Elevated INR values occur often in patients receiving warfarin while admitted to a tertiary care pediatric facility and modifiable risk factors exist for elevated INR values.

### Quality of anticoagulation and use of warfarin-interacting medications in long-term care: a chart review [^1173YzH8]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Interacting medications

Overall, 79% of residents on warfarin therapy (83 residents) were prescribed at least one interacting drug during the period of the chart review (mean no. interacting medications = 1.8, range 1–6). The five most common drugs were acetaminophen, citalopram, acetylsalicylic acid, diltiazem and simvastatin (Table 1). To examine monitoring practices, we further determined whether addition or dose change of drugs known to interact with warfarin was followed by INR measurement within seven days. There were 72 instances of newly-initiated warfarin-interacting medications or changes in dose. In 59 of 72 instances (82%) the INR was checked within 7 days of the initiation of the medication.

Table 1
Prevalence of interacting medications. Number (percentage) of residents prescribed each warfarin-interacting medication over the period of the chart audit.

Medications not prescribed: erythromycin, fluconazole, fluvastatin, quinidine, ropinerole, celecoxib and entacapone.

Residents receiving warfarin-interacting medications during the period of the chart audit had a TTR of 53.0%, compared with a TTR of 58.2% in the residents on no interacting drugs (OR = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.97, P = 0.002). Residents with 2 or more interacting medications had a lower TTR (50.8%) than those with only one interacting medication (55.1%) (Table 2a).

TTR calculated for variables of a) interacting medications and b) prescribing physician

Prescribing physicians

Twenty individual physicians were identified as warfarin prescribers at the five facilities (prescribers-per-facility range, 2–10). To increase the reliability of our observations, TTR was determined for only the ten physicians with (1) three or more patients receiving warfarin and (2) total patient-INR-days ≥ 700. We found significant differences in the achieved TTR between the physicians (range 45.9% to 63.3%, OR = 1.06, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.13, p = 0.05, Table 2b).

### Risk of major bleeding during concomitant use of antibiotic drugs and coumarin anticoagulants [^116TUhhv]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Coumarin anticoagulants are prone to drug-drug interactions. For example, antibiotic drugs may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarins. However, whether such interactions are associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and if so, how frequently this occurs remains unknown.

Objective

To assess the risk of major bleeding associated with the concomitant use of antibiotic drugs and coumarin anticoagulant therapy.

Methods

We analyzed a retrospective cohort study including all users of acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon in the PHARMO Record Linkage System (age range: 40–80 years). All patients were followed up until end of last coumarin treatment, hospitalization for bleeding, death, or end of study period. For each patient, the number of days on either coumarins alone, or on coumarins in combination with antibiotic drugs was determined. From these data, the relative risks of major bleeding were calculated.

Results

A total of 52,102 users of acenocoumarol and 7885 users of phenprocoumon met the inclusion criteria of our study cohort and contributed 139,159 person-years of follow-up. During follow-up, 838 patients (1.4%) were hospitalized for a bleeding while taking coumarins. Of the 62 different antibiotics taken by study members, 19 were associated with a bleeding episode. Of these, 10 were associated with a statistically significant increased bleeding risk. The relative risk of bleeding was three to five for doxycycline, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, azithromycin and pheneticillin, nine for tetracycline and 43 for cefradine and neomycin.

Conclusion

Based on relative risks and incidence of use, amoxicillin (alone or with clavulanic acid) and doxycycline are the main antibiotic drugs associated with major bleeding when used in combination with coumarin.

Vitamin K antagonist maintenance — INR monitoring and isolated out-of-range results are addressed as follows: For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B). For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xQZ8f]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — warfarin selection, INR targets, and interaction-related bleeding risk: Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients with AF receiving CYP3A4/glycoprotein– inducing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, and the optimal INR control, with a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved through drug–drug interaction management, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR monitoring. Time in therapeutic INR range showed negative correlation with risks of thromboembolism (R, −0.59; P = 0.01) and major bleeding (R, −0.59; P = 0.002); a weekly vitamin K dietary modification achieved a therapeutic INR more frequently than a conventional group (74 versus 58%; P = 0.04) at 90 days; and concomitant use of APT (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.56–1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29–2.59]), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42–1.85]), or antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45–1.83]) was significantly associated with higher risks of clinically relevant bleeding.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^1169zF6V]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

COUMADIN is a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during COUMADIN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with COUMADIN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of COUMADIN therapy.

2.5 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of COUMADIN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.6 Intravenous Route of Administration

The intravenous dose of COUMADIN is the same as the oral dose. After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection should be administered as a slow bolus injection into a peripheral vein over 1 to 2 minutes. COUMADIN for injection is not recommended for intramuscular administration.

Reconstitute the vial with 2.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The resulting yield is 2.5 mL of a 2 mg per mL solution (5 mg total). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is noted.

After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the sterility of the prepared solution. The vial is for single use only, and any unused solution should be discarded.

### Enhanced hypoprothrombinemia with warfarin due to azithromycin [^115biArv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of probable azithromycin-warfarin drug interaction with enhanced hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin.

Case Summary

An 83-year-old African American man stabilized on warfarin therapy (10 mg on Wednesdays, 7.5 mg on other days) developed a prolonged prothrombin time one day after starting azithromycin 500 mg. The elevated prothrombin time normalized 3 days after azithromycin was discontinued. After the initial increase in the international normalized ratio, the absence of any significant confounding factors affecting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in our patient and the numerous reports of such interactions indicate that an interaction between azithromycin and warfarin may have been responsible for the elevated prothrombin time seen in this patient. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse event was probably related to the combination of these drugs.

Discussion

Azithromycin, unlike erythromycin and clarithromycin, is not known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and is presumed to be the macrolide of choice in patients already on warfarin. However, previously reported cases of azithromycin-warfarin interactions support the possibility that azithromycin does interact with warfarin, although the exact mechanism is not understood.

Conclusions

Azithromycin may interact with warfarin and enhance its hypoprothrombinemic effects. This effect may be delayed for 4–8 days after a course of azithromycin has been completed. Periodic monitoring of the prothrombin time is recommended when using azithromycin in patients taking warfarin.

### Combination warfarin-ASA therapy: which patients should receive it, which patients should not, and why? [^112xm1RV]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Combination warfarin-ASA therapy is currently used in approximately 800,000 patients in North America as long-term treatment for the primary and secondary prevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic diseases. Despite a potentially complementary action of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs, the use of combination warfarin-ASA therapy is not based on compelling evidence of a net therapeutic benefit, with the exception of patients with a mechanical heart valve. On the other hand, there is more compelling and consistent evidence that combination warfarin-ASA therapy confers a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increased risk for serious bleeding compared with use of warfarin alone. In everyday practice, clinicians should combine the best available evidence with clinical judgment, considering that in most clinical scenarios, clinical practice guideline may not provide clear recommendations for patients who should, and should not, receive combination warfarin-ASA therapy. The objectives of this review are to describe which patients are receiving combined warfarin-aspirin therapy, to summarize the evidence for the therapeutic benefit and harm of combined warfarin-ASA therapy, and to suggest practical guidelines as to which patients should, and should not, receive such treatment.

7.1 General Information

Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [see Boxed Warning].

Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.

7.2 CYP450 Interactions

CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4.

Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin.
Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin.

Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.

7.3 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3. Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin.

7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.

Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.

### Problems in anticoagulation of a patient with antibiotic treatment for endocarditis: interaction of rifampicin and vitamin K antagonists [^116jegPc]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The cytochrome P450 is a superfamily of isoenzymes that are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs. Significant changes in pharmacokinetics and drug interactions may be due to induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Rifampicin is a common inducer of CYP3A4. We report a case of a 57-year-old woman who was suspected for endocarditis and therefore treated with rifampicin. Due to previous mechanical aortic valve replacement, she also received phenprocoumon for anticoagulation. Although continuing anticoagulant therapy, antibiotic coadministration led to normal international normalised ratio (INR) level. Fifteen days after the treatment with rifampicin ended, INR returned to therapeutic level.

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^1162qd22]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Reports on clinical outcome of the pharmacokinetic interactions with DOACs are inconsistent. In a meta‐analysis of 32,465 patients from randomized controlled trials of patients with AF, P‐gp/CYP3A4‐modulating drugs use was correlated with increased risk of major bleeding among rivaroxaban users, when compared with warfarin (Risk ratio, 1.37, 1.01–1.85). Several real‐world studies have supported the association between P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors use and bleeding risk in patients treated with DOACs, whereas others did not.

In a retrospective cohort study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database, that included 91,330 patients with AF, it was concluded that use of the inhibitors: amiodarone, fluconazole, but also, surprisingly, of the inducers rifampin and phenytoin, were associated with significant increased incidence rates of major bleeding. Moreover, incidence rate for major bleeding was lower and not higher for use of erythromycin or clarithromycin, known to be moderate‐strong P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors; and was not higher with some known P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, it should be noted that the annual bleeding rate in the Taiwanese studywas threefold higher than annual serious bleeding event rates reported previously in anticoagulated patients with AF. As emergency department visits without hospitalizations comprised the outcome along with inpatient diagnoses, it might have been that less serious bleeding events were included. In addition, the patient‐quarters method used precluded the ability for a new‐user analysis; covariates assessed on the first day of each patient quarter might have been influenced by DOAC exposure. For example, anemia, adjusted for in each new quarter, might have been already the early sign of the outcome associated with the DOAC, and adjusting for this intermediate variable is susceptible to bias.

Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.

7.3 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3. Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin.

7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.

Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.

Major Drug Interactions

Drug‐drug interactions are an important concern for any patient managed on DOAC therapy. Concomitantly administered drugs that alter DOAC plasma concentrations can lead to serious complications, with increased DOAC concentrations potentially resulting in bleeding events, and decrease DOAC concentration placing the patient at risk for thrombus formation. Initially, DOACs were viewed as having minimal drug interactions, which has proven incorrect. When compared with VKAs, which are highly associated with substantial drug‐drug interactions, DOACs impart a lower risk; however, they still have significant risk of interactions. Three different types of drug interactions need to be evaluated when managing DOAC therapy: (1) agents affecting renal clearance, (2) agents affecting hepatic clearance, and (3) agents concurrently affecting hemostasis.

Agents Affecting Renal Clearance

As all DOACs used for treatment of atherothrombosis rely on the kidneys for elimination to varying degrees, agents that hinder this organ's ability to clear DOAC may place the patient at increased risk for bleeding complications. Common agents to monitor are NSAIDs, diuretics, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and immunosuppressants (ie, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus). 38 No DOAC‐specific dose adjustments are required but warrant more frequent monitoring of renal function and possibly holding therapy or consideration for transition to an agent with less renal involvement if renal function is compromised.

Agents Affecting Hepatic Clearance

All DOACs are eliminated by either CYP metabolic enzymes or permeability glycoprotein transporters; thus, agents that inhibit or induce these enzyme systems can constitute major drug‐drug interactions and place the patient at undue risk for complications (see Table 9). A common drug‐drug interaction example includes CYP3A4 inhibitors with the use of apixaban, which as discussed above is the DOAC with the highest reliance of hepatic biotransformation for clearance. Regimens such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, and itraconazole significantly reduce apixaban drug concentrations and therefore should be avoided. 10 Because of the likelihood of concomitant interacting medications, the risk of drug‐drug interactions increases when DOACs are prescribed in patients with the following comorbidities: HIV, organ transplantation, infection, malignancy, epilepsy, and arrhythmia. Refer to previously published reviews for a more comprehensive list of interacting medications and associated management strategies. 38, 95

7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.

Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.

7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals.

Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and JANTOVEN exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.

Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of JANTOVEN. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of JANTOVEN (e.g., co-enzyme Q10, St. John's wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with JANTOVEN through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John's wort).

The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with JANTOVEN. Advise patients taking JANTOVEN to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking JANTOVEN should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114QZpJV]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Warfarin–statin interactions — effects on anticoagulation have been observed, including reports indicating up to a 30% change in INR and a report showing a doubling of the number of subjects with supratherapeutic INRs, and an analysis of > 1100 patients indicated that simvastatin was associated with a 29% reduced warfarin requirement in CYP2C9✱3 carriers; overall, there is no clinically significant increase in statin exposure with coadministration of warfarin, and combination therapy is useful when clinically indicated. Recommendations for Statin–Warfarin DDIs are: use of a statin with warfarin as combination therapy is useful when clinically indicated, and the INR should be monitored more closely after the initiation of a statin or a change in statin dose; the impact on the INR appears lowest for pitavastatin and atorvastatin.

Data Source and Study Procedure

Patients were identified using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. The Hospital Authority is an institution that manages all public hospitals and outpatient clinics in Hong Kong and provides health care services to > 90% of the citizens. Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System is an internationally recognized electronic health record database with large population coverage, comprehensive clinical data, and excellent data quality, and has been used to conduct high‐quality pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Demographic data, including age and date of birth, and cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, were recorded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. CHA₂DS₂ ‐VASc score is a composite score incorporating congestive heart failure, age, diabetes, stroke or systemic embolism, vascular disease, and sex category. The occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hospitalization for major bleeding attributable to intracranial hemorrhage and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and all‐cause mortality, was extracted. Gastrointestinal bleeding was evaluated because previous randomized controlled trials demonstrated NOAC patients are at high risk of developing the adverse event than those taking warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small and large bowels was included in this study, with details on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM), codes used listed in Table S1.

Concomitant medications with possible drug‐drug interaction with NOACs listed in the 2021 European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation were extracted from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System using the British National Formulary classification, as follows: antiarrhythmic (amiodarone, digoxin, diltiazem, dronedarone, and verapamil), antidepressant (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, trazodone, amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, dosulepin, nortriptyline, and bupropion), antimicrobial (clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole), and atorvastatin. Flecainide and β‐blockers, which are not expected to have drug‐drug interaction with NOAC, were included in the analysis as control groups.

3: Poor documentation:

Patients were often not issued with patient-held information and written dosage instructions at start of therapy, or discharged from hospital without an appointment for next INR measurement or for consultation with appropriate healthcare professional. New referrals to anticoagulation service had incomplete information making appointments more challenging for the haematology team. Patients were affected by reduced quality of anticoagulation leading to potentially life-threatening over or under coagulation.

4: Failure to consider significant pharmacological interactions:

Not enough safe practice had been promoted regarding co-prescribing one or more clinically significant interacting medicines or informing anticoagulant services that an interacting medicine had been prescribed. Co-prescribed medications were frequently not documented on the referral form, with the consequence that the anticoagulation team were unable to identify any potentially dangerous interactions in a timely manner.

Study Antimicrobials

Starting from a patient's index discharge date, we divided the following year into "patient‐weeks". Specifically, for a given patient, patient‐week 1 is days 1 through 7 after discharge; week 2 is days 8 through 14 after discharge, etc. In the event a patient died within the year after his or her index date, any patient‐week in which the patient was already deceased at the start of the week was not included in any analyses. For each patient‐week, Medicare Prescription Drug Event files were used to determine whether a patient had filled a prescription for any of the following antimicrobials of interest: azithromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, and amoxicillin‐clavulanate. Our choice of the specific antimicrobials was based on prior literature suggesting that macrolides, and possibly fluoroquinolones, are associated with cardiac events. 8, 13

Defining Outcomes and Predictors

In each patient‐week, we determined whether a patient died or had a claim for one of the following cardiac events: AMI, stroke (any claim with ICD‐9 code 430, 431, 434.00, 434.01, 434.10, 434.11, 434.90, 434.91, 435.0, 435.1, 435.3, 435.8, 435.9, 436, or 997.02), transient ischemic attack (ICD‐9 code 435.x), unstable angina (ICD‐9 code 411.xx), atrial fibrillation (AFI; ICD‐9 code 427.31), atrial flutter (AFL; ICD‐9 code 427.32), any cardiac arrhythmia (ICD‐9 code 427.xx or 798.xx), and VA (ICD‐9 code 427.1, 427.4, 427.41, or 427.42), which is a subset of cardiac arrhythmia.

Atrial fibrillation — recommendations for managing anticoagulants emphasize interaction management, appropriate warfarin intensity, and avoiding off‑label DOAC dosing: For patients with AF receiving direct oral anticoagulants, optimal management of drug interactions is recommended for those on concomitant interacting drugs; for patients with AF receiving warfarin, a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is recommended along with interaction management, consistent vitamin K intake, and routine INR monitoring to improve time in therapeutic range and minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding; for patients with AF, non–evidence‑based doses of DOACs should be avoided to minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and to improve survival.

### Respiratory tract infection and risk of bleeding in oral anticoagulant users: self-controlled case series [^112yg2U5]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Despite the large source population, our final sample was smaller than expected for the study analyses, and the study could have been underpowered to detect significant associations beyond our 14 day risk window. Our observation period was based on oral anticoagulant prescriptions, not anticoagulant use, and we were unable to further estimate adherence or the impact of non-adherence. Our findings could have been affected by clinicians pre-emptively advising additional monitoring or reduced dosing for people taking warfarin who consulted with an RTI. We identified Read codes suggesting that additional monitoring or reduced dosing might have been advised in roughly a quarter of untreated RTIs in our sample of warfarin users. Our patient representative also highlighted that people who use warfarin and self-monitor might, like herself, monitor more frequently during an intercurrent illness. However, the combined effect of these factors (increased monitoring, early action for changes in coagulation) is likely to reduce the risk of bleeding and thus bias risk estimates towards the null.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### Acetaminophen and warfarin: a recipe for supratherapeutic international normalized ratio with postoperative bleeding risk [^111h6d9U]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many patients encountered in dermatologic surgery take warfarin for anticoagulation due to cardiovascular comorbidities. Postoperative analgesia is a common concern for both the patient and dermatologic surgeon. Acetaminophen is a commonly used perioperative analgesic in dermatologic surgery. When acetaminophen is combined with warfarin, supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) may result in an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. This little-known interaction is reported in the pharmacology literature, but has yet to be reported in dermatologic surgery literature. Providers need to be aware that warfarin for anticoagulation and acetaminophen for analgesia, when taken together, present a risk of bleeding in dermatologic surgery.
