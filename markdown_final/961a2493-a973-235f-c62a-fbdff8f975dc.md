## Question

Normal lab values for newborn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about normal laboratory values for newborns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that "normal" in neonates is actually a reference interval derived from healthy populations. Then, I should verify which analytes are most clinically urgent and commonly needed at the bedside. Next, I will examine gestational and postnatal age effects that shift these intervals. After that, I should review pre-analytical pitfalls unique to neonates. Finally, I will synthesize practical, reference-supported ranges and highlight where local validation is essential, while noting areas of controversy and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: in neonatology, "normal" lab values are reference intervals typically defined as the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles from healthy reference populations, and these intervals must be age-specific because neonatal physiology changes rapidly with gestational age and postnatal age. Importantly, many neonatal reference intervals are not well established, so clinicians often rely on local validation or published ranges from comparable populations, and the literature repeatedly warns against extrapolating adult ranges to neonates [^e43914f9] [^1ef0049a] [^fbb809e8].

> I need to check which analytes are most critical and commonly used at the bedside. The highest-yield categories include hematology (CBC with differential, reticulocytes, nucleated RBCs), glucose, electrolytes and renal function, bilirubin, thyroid function, and selected inflammatory markers. I will prioritize these because they drive immediate management decisions and are most often misinterpreted without age-appropriate ranges [^1ef0049a] [^493f5c98] [^b8a01970] [^4fc69317].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hematology. I should confirm that neonatal CBC parameters differ markedly from older infants and adults, with higher hemoglobin, MCV, and WBC counts at birth, and that these values vary by gestational age and postnatal age. For example, term cord hemoglobin averages around 14–20 g/dL, and WBC counts commonly reach 9–30 × 10⁹/L in the first days of life, while nucleated RBCs are physiologic in neonates and can falsely elevate automated leukocyte counts, necessitating manual correction when present in significant numbers [^d4721497] [^da5439e4] [^fd966ca3].

> Wait, let me verify glucose thresholds because this is controversial. In the first 48 hours, transitional hypoglycemia is common, and the threshold for concern is lower than after 48–72 hours. Prospective data suggest that in healthy term infants, point-of-care glucose values around 1–2 hours of life can be as low as about 34–41 mg/dL at the 1st–5th percentiles, yet many clinicians use pragmatic cutoffs of 40–45 mg/dL in the first 24 hours and 45–50 mg/dL after 24 hours, while recognizing that persistent or symptomatic hypoglycemia warrants evaluation and treatment. By 72 hours, fasting glucose should approximate infant norms around 70–100 mg/dL, and the concept of a single "safe" glucose value remains debated [^1dbcc37b] [^45d0398f] [^2d74df40] [^493f5c98].

> I should double-check electrolytes and renal function. Cord and early postnatal sodium, potassium, and chloride differ from adult ranges, and creatinine reflects maternal levels initially with a physiologic decline over the first week. In very-low-birth-weight infants, creatinine may remain elevated for weeks, so trends matter more than single values. Enzymatic creatinine assays are preferred in pediatrics to avoid Jaffe interferences, and neonatal AKI definitions must account for baseline maturation rather than fixed absolute thresholds [^3d70402e] [^8e9c9108] [^cd83be9c] [^32918582].

> Next, I should review bilirubin interpretation. Virtually all newborns have higher total bilirubin than adults, and physiologic jaundice peaks around days 3–5 in term infants. Direct (conjugated) bilirubin should remain low; a direct bilirubin greater than 1.0 mg/dL after 24 hours of life is abnormal and warrants evaluation for cholestasis, while a direct bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL is strongly concerning. Prolonged jaundice beyond 2 weeks in formula-fed infants or 3–4 weeks in breastfed infants mandates measurement of total and direct bilirubin to exclude pathologic causes [^d9afb76e] [^ccace590] [^3aa8dab0].

> Let me consider thyroid function carefully. Neonatal TSH surges in the first 24–72 hours, so screening is ideally performed at 2–5 days to avoid false positives. A TSH above about 20 mIU/L is generally actionable, and confirmatory serum TSH and free T4 should be obtained promptly. Assay-specific differences are substantial, so interpretation should rely on method- and age-appropriate reference intervals, and preterm infants may have transiently altered binding proteins affecting total T4 without changing free T4 [^701afc03] [^4fc69317] [^ca45cb27] [^6c6c7483].

> I will now examine inflammatory markers. CRP and procalcitonin rise physiologically after birth and are influenced by mode of delivery and perinatal factors; thus, single values in the first 48 hours are neither sensitive nor specific for early-onset sepsis, whereas serial normal values are reassuring. If used, interpret trends and integrate with clinical risk assessment rather than isolated cutoffs [^7460b122] [^a6c8c965] [^881422fb].

> But wait, what if I need CSF values. I should confirm that neonatal CSF differs from older infants: in term neonates, CSF WBC up to about 10 cells/μL can be normal, and protein is higher than in older children, often up to roughly 100–150 mg/dL, with preterm infants having even higher protein limits. These ranges cannot reliably exclude meningitis, so clinical correlation and culture remain decisive [^f3c4e4d9].

> Hold on, I should verify pre-analytical pitfalls that commonly mislead interpretation. Low blood volumes, hemolysis, and site of sampling (capillary versus venous) can distort results; nucleated RBCs inflate automated WBC counts; and timing relative to feeds and medications affects glucose and other analytes. Reporting should specify gestational age, postnatal age, specimen type, and clinical context to allow correct interpretation and comparison with age-appropriate intervals [^d4721497] [^fd966ca3] [^fc3e2084].

> Let me synthesize a practical, reference-aware approach. For term infants in the first 72 hours, hemoglobin around 14–24 g/dL, WBC 9–30 × 10⁹/L, platelets 150–450 × 10⁹/L, glucose generally above about 40–45 mg/dL with rising thresholds after 24–48 hours, sodium 135–145 mmol/L, potassium 3.5–6.0 mmol/L, chloride 98–110 mmol/L, creatinine 0.3–1.0 mg/dL with expected decline, total bilirubin peaking near 6–12 mg/dL by day 3–5, and direct bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dL are reasonable anchors, but I must emphasize that these are population- and method-dependent and should be verified locally. For preterm infants, many values are shifted downward for hematology and upward for electrolytes and creatinine, and maturational trajectories differ, so serial assessment and gestational age–specific ranges are essential [^da5439e4] [^1dbcc37b] [^45d0398f] [^3d70402e] [^8e9c9108] [^d9afb76e] [^ccace590].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite a single authoritative table of neonatal reference ranges, but I should correct that impulse. There is no universally accepted, single compendium of neonatal reference intervals; instead, clinicians should rely on locally validated ranges where available, method-specific pediatric references, and high-quality studies that specify gestational and postnatal age, with awareness that many published neonatal "reference ranges" are derived from non-healthy populations and thus approximate rather than define "normal" [^fbb809e8] [^1ef0049a] [^e43914f9].

> Finally, I need to ensure I flag controversies and evidence gaps. Glucose thresholds remain debated, creatinine interpretation in preterms requires trend-based assessment, and thyroid assays lack harmonized neonatal intervals across platforms. These uncertainties reinforce the need to document clinical context, sampling details, and analytic methods whenever interpreting or reporting neonatal laboratory data, and to participate in or consult evolving consensus efforts to standardize neonatal reference ranges [^493f5c98] [^8e9c9108] [^6c6c7483] [^fc3e2084].

Normal newborn lab values vary by **gestational age, postnatal age, and clinical context** [^1b09270f]. For term infants at 24–48 hours, typical ranges include: hemoglobin 14–24 g/dL, hematocrit 42–65%, WBC 9–30 × 10⁹/L, platelets 150–450 × 10⁹/L, glucose 40–80 mg/dL, sodium 135–145 mmol/L, potassium 3.5–5.5 mmol/L, calcium 8.0–11.0 mg/dL, creatinine 0.3–1.0 mg/dL, and bilirubin < 12 mg/dL (indirect predominates) [^da5439e4] [^1dbcc37b] [^66c3b291]. Preterm infants have lower hemoglobin/hematocrit, higher WBCs, and immature renal function with higher creatinine; glucose thresholds are lower in the first 48 hours [^d4721497] [^8e9c9108] [^0c52cbfa]. Always interpret results using **age- and method-specific reference intervals** [^e43914f9] and clinical context, and confirm critical values before acting [^b5399b30].

## Glucose metabolism

- **Glucose (mg/dL)**: 40–80 (term, 24–48 hours); 30–60 (preterm, 24–48 hours) [^1dbcc37b] [^45d0398f].
- **Transitional hypoglycemia**: Common in first 48 hours; persistent low levels after 48 hours require evaluation [^9c099a59] [^2d74df40].

---

## Bilirubin metabolism

- **Total bilirubin (mg/dL)**: < 12 (term, 24–48 hours); < 15 (preterm, 24–48 hours) [^notfound].
- **Direct bilirubin (mg/dL)**: < 1.0 (term, after 24 hours); < 1.5 (preterm, after 24 hours) [^ccace590].
- **Physiologic jaundice**: Peaks at 3–5 days in term infants; direct bilirubin should remain low [^d9afb76e].

---

## Thyroid function

TSH is **0.5–20 mIU/L** at 24–48 hours, with a physiologic surge in the first 72 hours [^37bd7e8b], and free T4 is **1.5–3.5 ng/dL** at 24–48 hours, with assay-specific interpretation required [^a8f4d654].

---

## Clinical implications and interpretation

- **Gestational age**: Strongly influences hematologic and renal parameters; preterm infants have lower hemoglobin/hematocrit and higher creatinine [^d4721497] [^8e9c9108].
- **Postnatal age**: Rapid physiologic changes, especially in glucose, bilirubin, and thyroid function, necessitate age-specific interpretation [^2d74df40] [^d9afb76e] [^37bd7e8b].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret results alongside clinical presentation, maternal history, and perinatal events [^7c7e2fd5].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Reference intervals**: Many neonatal reference intervals are derived from limited cohorts; local validation is ideal [^e43914f9] [^9b890353].
- **Analytical variability**: Assay differences, especially for bilirubin and thyroid tests, can affect interpretation [^b8a01970] [^6c6c7483].
- **Individual variability**: Neonates exhibit significant interindividual variability; trends are often more informative than single values [^8e9c9108] [^493f5c98].

---

Normal newborn lab values are **age- and context-specific**; use gestational- and postnatal age–appropriate reference intervals, interpret results in clinical context, and confirm critical values before acting [^e43914f9] [^b5399b30].

### The publication quality of laboratory values in clinical studies in neonates [^1b09270f]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on this assessment of the literature, published information on laboratory values for neonates is sparse, not systematic, and incomplete. There is marked variation in how neonatal laboratory data, actionable thresholds, or reference ranges are presented. This variation undermines efforts to compare practices and establish quality standards for clinical care and research. No publication was identified that presented a publication standard for the planned INC work to develop laboratory reference ranges in neonates.

As highlighted by Sun et al. inadequate reporting of analytical characteristics of biomarkers in clinical research is not unique to neonates, despite a statement by the Consortium of Laboratory Medicine Journal Editors to fully describe laboratory methods and specimen handling. However, neonates add further complexity, in part related to laboratory techniques (low volume samples, differences in plasma and blood composition) but mainly related to their biological variation (gestational and postnatal age).

A next step should be a multidisciplinary effort to generate publication recommendations that present neonatal laboratory data, consistent with the existing approaches, but with considerations related to variability within the neonatal population. Such tools can subsequently be applied to the ongoing INC effort to define actionable reference ranges of commonly used laboratory values and will improve the impact of papers presenting laboratory values in neonates. This is critically important for investigators, industry, and regulators to facilitate multiple clinical trial processes, such as the development of inclusion and exclusion criteria, adverse event reporting, or outcome measures.

### The CBC: reference ranges for neonates [^1ef0049a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

"Normal values" for blood parameters of neonates are generally unavailable, because blood is not usually drawn on healthy, normal neonates to establish normal ranges. Instead, "reference ranges" are used, consisting of the 5th to the 95th percentile values compiled from tests performed on neonatal patients with minimal pathology, under the premise that such ranges approximate normal values. In recent years, we have been seeking to establish reference ranges for various elements of the complete blood count (CBC) of neonates, using the large databases of Intermountain Healthcare, a health care system in the western United States. Establishing these reference ranges has been facilitated by using modern hematology analyzers and electronic data repositories of clinical and laboratory information. The present review brings together several of our recent reports, displaying reference ranges for elements of the CBC among neonates at various gestational and postnatal ages.

### Publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates-a modified Delphi approach [^fc3e2084]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates were developed. These recommendations apply to neonates, a special patient population requiring specific recommendations. The recommendations are based on three categories: 'Clinical Characteristics', 'Bio-analytical Information' and 'Data-analytical Information'. Each of these categories is classified into 'Core Data' (variables that should always be reported) and 'Supplemental Considerations' (variables that should be reported when considered relevant to the study). The implementation of these recommendations will enhance the comparison, replication, and application of study results in research initiatives and clinical practice. This is likely to significantly contribute to the overall quality of neonatal clinical research and neonatal healthcare. In addition, this is foundational work for developing reference ranges for neonatal laboratory values by standardizing the quality of information needed for such efforts.

### Publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates-a modified Delphi approach [^b343b668]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In neonates, interpreting laboratory data becomes even more complex due to their time-dependent and developmental physiology, the impact of maternal characteristics, and the paucity of well-established age-appropriate reference ranges. During the recent development of the Neonatal Adverse Event Severity Score, the absence of accepted reference ranges for neonatal laboratory data excluded these variables in the assessment of adverse events. To address this issue, the INC is currently working on defining normal and abnormal reference ranges for commonly used laboratory data in neonates. To obtain credible data for defining these reference ranges, a standardized method for collecting and reporting laboratory data of neonates is critical to improve data quality and utility.

Neonatal datasets are heterogeneous due to developmental changes occurring both before and after birth, as well as the effects of non-maturational factors like perinatal drug exposure. These distinctive population-specific characteristics necessitate precise and tailored recommendations for publications incorporating laboratory data of neonates, aimed at enhancing the quality of these data. These recommendations should align with established general guidelines for data-analytical and bio-analytical methods, while considering population-specific aspects such as neonatal clinical characteristics (e.g. gestational age, postnatal age, birth weight, nutrition), the use of low-volume samples, or clinical practices impacting laboratory values in both pre-analytical and analytical stages.

In this study, we aim to develop publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates using a modified Delphi approach to achieve more standardized reporting of these data. The Delphi approach is a structured communication method based on expert opinions and experience to reach consensus on specific research questions, and is commonly used to develop healthcare quality indicators. The implementation of the recommendations will support researchers and healthcare professionals with a standardized framework to report and interpret neonatal laboratory data in publications, thereby enhancing their applicability in clinical practice.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^10e54ee1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Newborn screening test reports — content and CLIA compliance — test reports should include all necessary information, be easy to understand, and be structured in a way that encourages users to read the entire report, rather than just a positive or negative indication, and newborn screening test reports must comply with the CLIA general test report requirements (42 CFR §493.1291) and applicable state requirements. Results should be reported in a way that is consistent with the urgency of any needed intervention. For a screening result that is outside the expected range of normal test results or is an invalid screen, the following information should be communicated to the newborn's primary care provider without delay: the newborn's identifying information (name, date of birth, and time of birth), place of birth, and national or local health number; the date and time of specimen collection and arrival in the laboratory; screening test results in appropriate measurement units; the normal range and cutoff values appropriate for the newborn's conditions, including gestational age, birth weight, and health or disease status; and notification of whether the results are out-of-range or invalid. Test reports should also include reporting requirements to the newborn screening program, including confirmatory test results, treatment date, and other information on the newborn's health outcome.

### What is a normal blood glucose? [^493f5c98]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Glucose is the key metabolic substrate for tissue energy production. In the perinatal period the mother supplies glucose to the fetus and for most of the gestational period the normal lower limit of fetal glucose concentration is around 3mmol/L. Just after birth, for the first few hours of life in a normal term neonate appropriate for gestational age, blood glucose levels can range between 1.4 mmol/L and 6.2mmol/L but by about 72h of age fasting blood glucose levels reach normal infant, child and adult values (3.5–5.5mmol/L). Normal blood glucose levels are maintained within this narrow range by factors which control glucose production and glucose utilisation. The key hormones which regulate glucose homoeostasis include insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and growth hormone. Pathological states that affect either glucose production or utilisation will lead to hypoglycaemia. Although hypoglycaemia is a common biochemical finding in children (especially in the newborn) it is not possible to define by a single (or a range of) blood glucose value/s. It can be defined as the concentration of glucose in the blood or plasma at which the individual demonstrates a unique response to the abnormal milieu caused by the inadequate delivery of glucose to a target organ (eg, the brain). Hypoglycaemia should therefore be considered as a continuum and the blood glucose level should be interpreted within the clinical scenario and with respect to the counter-regulatory hormonal responses and intermediate metabolites.

### The publication quality of laboratory values in clinical studies in neonates [^fbb809e8]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no generally accepted age-appropriate reference ranges for laboratory values in neonates. This also matters for drug development. The International Neonatal Consortium (INC) is engaged to define actionable reference ranges of commonly used laboratory values in neonates.

Methods

A structured literature search was performed to identify standards or recommendations for publications that present neonatal laboratory data to assess the publication quality of laboratory values in neonates. Using a modified Delphi approach, an assessment and data extraction instrument to screen on completeness of information was developed.

Results

On 2908 hits, 281 papers were retained for full reading and 257 for data extraction. None of the papers reported a publication standard. Using the extraction instrument, most papers presented single country or unit findings. The median number of neonates was 120, with uncertainty on single or repeated measurements. Clinically meaningful information on age, sex, and medical conditions was commonly provided. Information on pharmacotherapy, equipment, analytical method, or laboratory location was rarely mentioned.

Conclusions

Published information on laboratory values for neonates is sparse, not systematic, and incomplete. This undermines efforts to compare treatments, safety monitoring, or clinical management. Furthermore, there appears to be no standard yet to report laboratory values in neonates.

Impact

There are no generally accepted age-appropriate reference ranges for laboratory values in neonates, leading to a significant knowledge gap, also for safety reporting and drug development in neonates. We performed a literature search to identify standards or recommendations for publications on neonatal laboratory data and to assess the publication quality of laboratory values in clinical studies involving neonates. Standards or recommendations for publications that present neonatal laboratory data were not identified, while published information on laboratory values for neonates is sparse, not systematic, and incomplete.

### The normal newborn exam, or is it? [^c004fb63]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the broad technologic advancements of medicine, screening for illness in infants is highly reliant on a complete physical exam. For this reason it is critical that the examining physician not only have a thorough understanding of abnormal findings but also the normal findings and their variants. The vast majority of infants are healthy and findings predictive of future health problems are subtle and infrequent. Yet, outcomes can be devastating. Therefore it is critical the physician remain diligent when screening for these. It is our hope that this article will assist you in this task and allow for more accurate and timely diagnosis that prevents or minimizes long-term health problems in children.

Glossary — laboratory measurement concepts in biochemical genetic testing — defines cut-off value as the quantitative analyte value used as the decision point between a positive and a negative result and clarifies analytical sensitivity terms including limit of detection (LOD) as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected and limit of quantitation (LOQ) as the lowest concentration at which an analyte can be quantitatively determined with stated acceptable precision and trueness under stated conditions, which might be equal to the limit of detection or at a higher concentration. Operational result categories are specified, with in-range result for newborn screening results within the expected range of normal or negative test results for a particular condition and out-of-range result for results outside the expected range, including carrier results and any need for additional testing. Measurement components include measurand as the quantity to be measured and internal control material as a control placed in the same reaction tube as the specimen and subjected to exactly the same internal conditions and external parameters as any analyte present in the tube.

### The publication quality of laboratory values in clinical studies in neonates [^7c7e2fd5]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A laboratory result report can be defined as " a combination of specimen information and results… and contains other information pertinent to correct interpretation ". In clinical studies, laboratory values are used to detect and quantify (side) effects or as exclusion/inclusion criteria. However, this relies heavily on availability of age-appropriate reference ranges and normative values. During neonatal research, disentangling "true" effects from confounders (e.g. maturational changes in laboratory values, organ dysfunction, co-morbidities) remains challenging. Therefore, neonatal laboratory reference ranges (information pertinent to correct interpretation) are particularly important. Unfortunately, there are no generally accepted age-appropriate reference ranges or actionable thresholds in neonates, especially for preterm infants. This has been identified as a critical knowledge gap, since laboratory values are commonly based on ad hoc local data or even adult reference values.

Although multiple factors contribute to difficulties with safety reporting and neonatal drug development, this paradigm is changing. For example, the Critical Path Institute's International Neonatal Consortium (INC) developed the Neonatal Adverse Event Severity Scale (NAESS). However, when the NAESS was developed, laboratory-based adverse events were not included because of absence of age-appropriate reference values.

INC is currently working toward a data aggregation and integration effort to define actionable reference ranges of commonly used laboratory values in neonates. These reference values will be derived from real world data (RWD) and presented transparently. INC further aims to present the data quality and analysis. To inform how the quality of reference values is presented, a structured literature search was performed in order to:
Identify standards for publications that present neonatal laboratory data.
Assess the publication quality of laboratory values presented in clinical studies in neonates.

It is hereby important to note that standards or recommendations for publications that present laboratory data are different from standards that inform how laboratories report to clinicians. Furthermore, we are fully aware that laboratory values are also relevant in disease diagnosis and prognosis.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^e6917b0e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening glossary — this page provides definitions for laboratory terms used in inherited metabolic disorder testing. It defines precision as "Closeness of agreement between independent test results from the same sample obtained under stipulated conditions, often determined by assessing repeatability and reproducibility", and reproducibility as "Closeness of agreement between independent test results for the same measurand under changed conditions". It specifies the reference interval as "The range of test values expected for a designated population of persons (e.g., 95% of persons that are presumed to be healthy [or normal])" and describes a waived test as "A test system, an assay, or an examination that has been found to meet the statutory criteria specified in the Public Health Service Act (§§353[d] [3]) (12)".

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^2dd3bfef]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Newborn screening test performance — timing, sample quality, and cut-off/critical values are specified as follows: some conditions warrant specimen collection in the first 24–48 hours to enable detection and early treatment, whereas for other conditions the abnormal analytes might be more readily detected on a later day, and laboratories should document the course of abnormal analyte presentation and use age-adjusted reference intervals with consideration of infant term, birth weight, and health status. The number of samples included in performance establishment or verification should be sufficiently large, and laboratories should consider using samples that have the same dried blood spot matrix as that used for newborn specimen collection. If unsatisfactory or invalid specimens are accepted, such as dried blood spots of insufficient quantity, oversaturated, scratched or abraded, or not completely dry before mailing, these specimen variances should be addressed in test performance establishment. Determination of the reportable range should include appropriate cut-off values and critical values that require prompt follow-up and clinical intervention, and determination of cut-off values for each analyte should be based on statistically derived values and testing of patient samples with a confirmed diagnosis. Laboratories should continuously monitor the performance of their newborn screening tests and determine the need for reevaluating performance specifications as new disease information or test performance data become available.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^9b890353]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Biochemical genetic testing — reference ranges and reportable range requirements specify that the laboratory should establish a reference range appropriate for the laboratory's patient population, and when possible should establish their own ranges by evaluating samples; if verifications rely on tested patient specimens rather than healthy controls, laboratories should systematically evaluate the ranges and monitor the need to adjust over time; if representative specimens are not available, laboratories may use manufacturer-suggested or published ranges appropriate for their patients; laboratories should monitor these reference values, make adjustments when appropriate, and inform clients of the sources; the laboratory is responsible for determining the reportable range for each test, which can be established or verified by assaying low and high reference materials or by evaluating known samples of abnormally high and low values.

### Publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates-a modified Delphi approach [^08978626]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical and analytical information on laboratory data of neonates in scientific publications is sparse and incomplete. Furthermore, interpreting neonatal laboratory data can be complex due to their time-dependent and developmental physiology, and paucity of well-established age-appropriate reference ranges for neonates. This study aims to develop publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates to enhance the quality of these data in research and clinical care.

Methods

A modified Delphi approach was used to develop recommendations in cooperation with the International Neonatal Consortium. A Core Group, including different stakeholders, was responsible for developing the recommendations, in collaboration with a Reflection Group, responsible for providing additional input.

Results

The recommendations were classified into three categories: 'Clinical Characteristics', 'Bio-analytical Information' and 'Data-analytical Information'. These were each divided into 'Core Data' (always to be reported) and 'Supplemental Considerations' (to be reported when considered relevant to the study).

Conclusion

Our recommendations provide guidance on standardization of neonatal laboratory data in publications. This will enhance the comparison, replication, and application of study results in research initiatives and clinical practice. Furthermore, these recommendations also serve as foundational work to develop reference ranges for neonatal laboratory values by standardizing the quality of information needed for such efforts.

Impact

Standardized reporting of neonatal laboratory data in scientific publications will enhance the comparison, replication, and application of study results in research initiatives and clinical practice, as well as improve reporting to regulatory agencies.
To integrate multistakeholder perspectives, a modified Delphi approach was used to develop publication recommendations which strengthens the applicability of the recommendations.
Implementation of standardization will likely improve the overall quality of neonatal clinical research and neonatal healthcare.
In addition, these recommendations are foundational to develop reference ranges for neonatal laboratory values by standardizing the quality of information needed for such efforts.

### Neonatal hypoglycemia [^0cc10d76]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common condition. Consensus on significant values has been difficult to establish. Due to potential for long-term impacts, screening and treatment are recommended. Infants at risk warrant monitoring. Various modalities exist to measure glucose levels. Plasma concentrations remain most accurate. Acute symptoms overlap with other conditions and are best treated with intravenous dextrose fluids. Asymptomatic newborns can be supported with enteral options that minimize separation of the mother-infant dyad. Further research into physiologic neonatal glycemic trends and the relation to long-term outcomes could aid in the prevention of overdiagnosis and overtreatment while providing reassurance against harm.

### Issues in neonatal cellular analysis [^d4721497]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Hematologic values in neonates differ significantly from those in older children and adults. Quantitative and qualitative differences are present as a reflection of the developmental changes during fetal hematopoiesis and, so, correlate with gestational age. At birth, the hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and WBC counts of term newborns are significantly higher than those of older children and adults, and in preterm neonates the differences are even more pronounced. This review explores these differences and the major factors that account for them from the hematology laboratory standpoint. After a discussion of the developmental hematopoiesis and normal hematologic values in term and preterm neonates, important preanalytic factors, such as limited blood availability, effect of sampling site, and violent crying, and analytic interferences are examined. Finally, the review addresses resulting challenges in interpretation of hematologic test results in term and preterm neonates, especially issues surrounding neonatal reference intervals and critical value reporting, and suggests possible solutions.

### Publication recommendations to report laboratory data of neonates-a modified Delphi approach [^ba930bb7]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To enhance the quality and utility of published laboratory data of neonates, we developed recommendations on how to report these data. The recommendations were classified into three categories: 'Clinical Characteristics', 'Bio-analytical Information' and 'Data-analytical Information'. These were each classified into 'Core Data' and 'Supplemental Considerations'. The recommendations are non-binding, but should provide a framework for researchers when reporting laboratory data of neonates in scientific publications. The recommendations are intended to be consulted before data collection takes place to ensure structured data collection which is a key step in standardization of data reporting.

As described in the results, multiple discussions were needed to reach consensus on the recommendations. 'Clinical Characteristics' was the most challenging category to achieve the appropriate balance between data needed to interpret laboratory values of neonates versus the burden of collecting and reporting all these data. The compromise led to the creation of 'Core Data' and 'Supplemental Considerations'. 'Core Data' are necessary to interpret and potentially extrapolate study results. Therefore, depending on the study, components of 'Supplemental Considerations' could be considered as core information. Authors, reviewers, and editors are encouraged to evaluate the need for reporting variables in 'Supplemental Considerations' to enable the interpretation and extrapolation of study results.

The ICMJE has already published general recommendations to report scholarly work on laboratory data in medical journals. However, these recommendations mainly focus on the bio-analytical method section of papers and are not specific to neonates. Innovative in our recommendations is the multistakeholder approach and its focus on a special patient population requiring specifications related to clinical characteristics (e.g. gestational age, postnatal age, birth weight, neonatal co-morbidities, maternal characteristics) and bio-analytical information (e.g. low-volume samples).

Specific age-appropriate reference ranges for many laboratory values are currently missing for neonates. Well-established reference ranges are important for interpreting neonatal laboratory results, and will improve the overall quality and precision of neonatal medicine. Our recommendations are foundational work to standardize the quality of information needed for developing such reference ranges.

### Neonatal hypoglycemia [^9c099a59]. Pediatrics in Review (2017). Low credibility.

Lower blood glucose values are common in the healthy neonate immediately after birth as compared to older infants, children, and adults. These transiently lower glucose values improve and reach normal ranges within hours after birth. Such transitional hypoglycemia is common in the healthy newborn. A minority of neonates experience a more prolonged and severe hypoglycemia, usually associated with specific risk factors and possibly a congenital hypoglycemia syndrome. Despite the lack of a specific blood glucose value that defines hypoglycemia, concern for substantial neurologic morbidity in the neonatal population has led to the generation of guidelines by both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES). Similarities between the 2 guidelines include recognition that the transitional form of neonatal hypoglycemia likely resolves within 48 hours after birth and that hypoglycemia that persists beyond that duration may be pathologic. One major difference between the 2 sets of guidelines is the goal blood glucose value in the neonate. This article reviews transitional and pathologic hypoglycemia in the neonate and presents a framework for understanding the nuances of the AAP and PES guidelines for neonatal hypoglycemia.

### Laboratory reference intervals in the assessment of iron status in young children [^e43914f9]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Laboratory tests play an important role in clinical decision making. Clinical laboratories are required to establish or verify 'reference intervals' (previously named 'normal ranges') for all tests offered by the laboratory. In conjunction with other health information, clinicians make diagnostic and treatment decisions based on their patients' laboratory results in the context of the accompanying reference interval. However, clinicians are often unaware of the methods used to establish laboratory reference intervals. Reference intervals are derived from apparently healthy populations and provide two limits (lower and upper limits). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) established the theory of reference intervals in 1987, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) provides guidelines for establishing and verifying reference intervals. These guidelines address issues of selection of the reference subjects, statistical methods including sample size requirements, approaches to grouping results according to categories such as age and sex (termed 'partitions') and approaches to the detection and removal of outliers.

Reference intervals differ from 'decision limits'. Decision limits provide one (or more) cut-points intended to distinguish individuals with disease from those without disease. According to a recently published quality hierarchy, decision limits based on clinical outcome studies are considered the highest quality; followed by reference intervals, and cut-off values based on clinicians' opinions or published professional recommendations. An example of a decision limit based on clinical outcome studies is HbA 1c for the diagnosis of diabetes.

It has been recognised that establishing paediatric reference intervals poses specific challenges. These challenges include the difficulties of obtaining samples from children, and the rapidly changing physiology from the newborn period to late adolescence. A recent systematic review of the current published literature examined the statistical methods used to construct paediatric reference intervals. Of the 22 publications identified, only 7 cited and followed the CLSI guidelines.

### Diagnosing anemia in neonates: an evidence-based approach [^1def8ec1]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

It is important for clinicians who render neonatal care to precisely and reproducibly diagnose anemia; however, confusion arises from various definitions. For the simplicity and consistency of detection, we advocate defining neonatal anemia as a hemoglobin level or hematocrit below the 5th percentile of the reference population, which is highly dependent on gestational and postnatal ages. Thus, a newborn infant delivered at 24 weeks' gestation will have anemia with a blood hemoglobin concentration much lower than a hemoglobin concentration defining anemia at term. Moreover, a hemoglobin concentration defining anemia at term birth is higher than that defining anemia in the same infant 60 days after birth. Diagnosing neonatal anemia can be evidence-based and consistent by using reference intervals derived from large neonatal databases. To do this, we advocate defining anemia as a hemoglobin level that plots below the 5th percentile lower reference interval, defining moderately severe anemia as a hemoglobin value between the 1st and 5th percentile, and defining severe anemia as a hemoglobin level that plots below the 1st percentile. The information provided in this review can easily be adopted by clinical laboratories and individual neonatal care units, thereby fostering application of these definitions for all infants whose hemoglobin levels are measured. Additional normative values included in this review describing various other erythrocyte metrics can likewise be easily adopted. Doing so will codify and standardize the diagnosis of neonatal anemia and will facilitate identifying the cause of the anemia, thus pointing the way to proper additional diagnostic testing and treatment.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^fd966ca3]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Defining normal healthy term newborn automated hematologic reference intervals at 24 hours of life [^d3f6507f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

Automated analyzers have advanced the field of clinical hematology, mandating updated complete blood count (CBC) reference intervals (RIs) to be clinically useful. Contemporary newborn CBC RI publications are mostly retrospective, which some authors have cited as one of their cardinal limitations and recommended future prospective studies.

Objective —

To prospectively establish accurate hematologic RIs for normal healthy term newborns at 24 hours of life given the limitations of the current medical literature.

Design —

This prospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center, and hematology samples were collected from 120 participants deemed to be normal healthy term newborns. Distributions were assessed for normality and tested for outliers. Reference intervals were values between the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile.

Results —

The novel RIs obtained for this study population are as follows: absolute immature granulocyte count, 80/μL to 1700/μL; immature granulocyte percentage, 0.6% to 6.1%; reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, 31.7 to 38.4 pg; immature reticulocyte fraction, 35.9% to 52.8%; immature platelet count, 4.73 × 10³/μL to 19.72 × 10³/μL; and immature platelet fraction, 1.7% to 9.8%.

Conclusions —

This prospective study has defined hematologic RIs for this newborn population, including new advanced clinical parameters from the Sysmex XN-1000 Automated Hematology Analyzer. These RIs are proposed as the new standard and can serve as a strong foundation for continued research to further explore their value in diagnosing and managing morbidities such as sepsis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

### Normal point of care glucose values after birth in the well-baby nursery [^1dbcc37b]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Normal initial blood glucose values in healthy newborns are not well defined and are subject to controversy. Despite substantive research, there is no single initial value of glucose that can be used with certainty of safety in newborns, and thus various protocols and cutoffs have been proposed.

Study Design

We sought to characterize the normal values of blood glucose levels in a large cohort of neonates admitted to the well-baby nursery in Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The blood glucose levels were measured with a point of care (POC) glucometer (Accu-Chek Performa) within 180 minutes after birth.

Results

The study population included 3,912 newborns with a mean birth weight of 3,322 ± 439g and a mean gestational age of 39.4 ± 1.3 weeks. Sampling was performed at a median age of 73 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 55–92 minutes). Median glucose concentration was 58 (IQR, 51–67) mg/dL, and first, third, and fifth percentiles were 34, 39, and 41 mg/dL, respectively.

Conclusion

Our data describe the normal range of POC blood glucose levels in healthy neonates on admission to the nursery. Extreme low levels were rare.

### Analysis of serum free thyroxine concentrations in healthy term neonates underlines need for local and laboratory-specific reference interval: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data [^6c6e7483]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Initial evaluation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis is done by measuring serum free thyroxine (fT4) and thyrotropin concentrations. For correct interpretation of these measurements, reliable age-specific reference intervals (RIs) are fundamental. Since neonatal fT4 RIs conforming to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines are not available for all assays, we set out to create literature-based uniform age-specific neonatal fT4 RIs that may be used for every assay. Methods: For meta-analysis of individual participant fT4 concentrations, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase (search date December 6, 2023; PROSPERO registration CRD42016041871). We searched for studies reporting fT4 concentrations in healthy term newborns aged 2–27 days, born to mothers without thyroid disease in iodine-sufficient regions. Authors were invited to supply data. Due to standardization differences between assays, data could not be combined for meta-analysis directly, and we attempted to normalize the data using two distinct methods. Results: We obtained 4206 fT4 concentrations from 20 studies that used 13 different assays from 6 manufacturers. First, we set out to normalize fT4 data using the mean and standard deviation of (assay-specific) adult RIs. fT4 concentrations were transformed into Z-scores, assuming a normal distribution. Using a linear mixed-effects model (LMM), we still found a significant difference between fT4 concentration across studies (p < 0.001), after this normalization. As a second approach, we normalized the fT4 concentrations using data from a method/assay comparison study. We used the relationship between the Cobas assay and the other assays as a reference point to convert all values to Cobas values. However, this method also failed to produce consistent results, with significant differences between the normalized data (LMM p < 0.001). Conclusions: We conclude that our attempts at normalizing fT4 assay results were unsuccessful. Confounders related to our unsuccessful analysis may be assay related and/or biological. These findings have significant implications for patient care, since relying on RIs from literature may result in erroneous interpretation of results. Therefore, we strongly recommend to establish local RIs for accurate interpretation of serum fT4 concentrations in neonates.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^46536f67]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Appendix B glossary — key definitions for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening are provided as follows. Accuracy is the closeness of agreement between a measurement result and the true value or the accepted reference value. Analytical sensitivity in quantitative testing is the change in response of a measuring system or instrument divided by the corresponding change in the stimulus; in qualitative testing it is the test method's ability to obtain positive results in concordance with positive results obtained by the reference method, while analytical specificity is the ability of a measurement procedure to measure solely the measurand. Clinical sensitivity is the proportion of patients with a well-defined clinical disorder whose test values are positive or exceed a defined decision limit, and clinical specificity is the proportion of patients who do not have a specified clinical disorder whose test results are negative or within the defined decision limit; clinical validity is the accuracy with which a test predicts designated intermediate or final clinical outcomes. Biochemical genetic testing is a diverse spectrum of laboratory analyses of metabolites, enzyme activities, and functional assays for evaluation, diagnosis, treatment monitoring, disease management, and assessing a person's risk for carrying a specific disease trait such as inborn errors of metabolism. Competency assessment is evaluation of a person's ability to perform a test, including all aspects of testing, from specimen collection to reporting of results. A confirmatory test is a test to prove or disprove the presence of a specific condition identified by screening tests and, for newborn screening using dried blood spot specimens, this testing is from a specimen other than the screening specimen. Control material is a device, solution, or lyophilized preparation intended for use in the quality control process to monitor the reliability of a test system and to maintain its performance within established limits, and critical values are test results that require immediate notification of the clinician for patient evaluation or treatment.

### Haemoglobin and red blood cell reference intervals during infancy [^58572b77]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Scarcity of modern reference interval studies of haemoglobin and red blood cell biomarkers during infancy can have implications on what is considered as normative.
Historical reference intervals risk being outdated due to technical advancements and need to be adjusted to analytical methodology.
Well-defined and narrow reference intervals can strengthen the diagnostic power.

What this study adds?

Reference interval quality improves if detailed population characteristics are known, including information on variables such as gestational age and timing of cord clamping.
Reference interval widths are mainly narrower than those previously reported for these biomarkers.
The WHO lower threshold of haemoglobin 110 g/L for ages 6–12 months may need reinvestigation.

### Normal values for cerebrospinal fluid in neonates: a systematic review [^f3c4e4d9]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of neonatal meningitis often rests on microscopic and biochemical findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There is ongoing uncertainty about age-related normal values for CSF findings in neonates, and many previous studies have included infants in whom antibiotics were administered before lumbar puncture or in whom viral meningitis was not excluded.

Methods

A systematic search was done using MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify original studies which investigated CSF normal values in either healthy neonates or febrile neonates in whom bacterial and viral meningitis were reliably excluded.

Results

We identified seven studies investigating 270 term and 96 preterm neonates. There were minimal differences between preterm and term neonates in the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count and glucose concentration. In contrast, the CSF neutrophil count and protein concentration were influenced by gestational and chronological age. In the four studies that reported individual patient data, in 95% of cases the CSF WBC count was < 12 cells/μL in preterm and < 10 cells/μL in term neonates, the neutrophil count was < 16 and 8 cells/μL, and the protein concentration was < 210 and 110 mg/dL, respectively.

Conclusion

The normal range for CSF parameters in neonates is different to that in older infants, and some parameters are influenced by gestational and chronological age. CSF parameters alone are not sufficiently reliable to exclude meningitis.

### An Indian perspective for umbilical cord blood haematological parameters reference interval [^9c1de578]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The spread of values which is defined by an upper and a lower reference limit is termed as Reference interval (RI). They are one of the most important elements of a laboratory test result. Physicians compare their patients' test results and further interpret them on the basis of these intervals. It is hence deemed very necessary that the laboratory community devotes all the sufficient resources in order to ensure that the RI are well–established. It has been observed that most frequently, these intervals represent values for healthy, adult patients and hence, RI for other sets need to be established as in case for newborn, children or pregnant women.

The word "normal" has several different connotationions and hence can develop confusion. The terms normal values and normal ranges are obsolete and hence must not be used as a synonym for RI or reference range. To prevent such ambiguities, the terms reference ranges and intervals have been introduced and widely implemented.

RI have a major role in the interpretation of laboratory data in patient management i.e. if the laboratory data of the patient is within normal limits or not, clinical trials as well as selection of eligible participants for vaccine trials. These reference values are a subject to change by several factors including age, sex, race, geographical location as well as their dietary pattern. Various studies published globally established the age-related changes occurring in haematological parameters. Significant quantitative as well as qualitative differences in these parameters were exhibited by infants compared to older children and adults. A significant higher value of haematological parameters than those seen in older children and adults were observed in term newborns. It was thus concluded that, it is extremely unsuitable to utilise the reference ranges of adults in order to assess paediatric blood sample.

On the other hand, utilising a reference interval obtained from some other geographical location or individuals with a specific age group to a population of interest could potentially lead to inappropriate patient management and futile use of resources. Additionally, individual laboratories determining their own RI often display variations in the final reference intervals that are not supported by analytical or population differences.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^b8a01970]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Evaluating elevated direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin — laboratory practices and interpretation: In some laboratories, either a direct or conjugated bilirubin concentration is measured whenever a TSB is measured, direct and conjugated bilirubin are different, direct bilirubin concentrations are higher and more variable than conjugated bilirubin and tend to increase with the TSB, and reference ranges for direct bilirubin measurements vary by clinical laboratory.

### Interpretating normal values and reference ranges for laboratory tests [^64d4427e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory test results drive about 70% of clinical decisions and are important in making diagnosis, prognosis, ruling out conditions, testing for propensity to disease and monitoring the course of illnesses. The requirement for releasing laboratory results to patients has altered the dynamics of doctor patient interaction. Minor variations in laboratory test results that are labeled by the laboratory as low/high/abnormal may cause unwarranted worry to the patients. The number of laboratory results that are outside the "normal range" far exceeds the clinically meaningful abnormal results due to the usually accepted methodology for ascertaining "normal values"/reference ranges, variations in methods of testing at different laboratories, variations due to age, gender, ethnicity, seasonality, and random variations. The usual process for establishing "normal values/reference ranges" entails testing at least 120 healthy individuals in a given age-group, gender, ethnicity, testing method and related health issues. The central 95% of the values is usually adopted as the normal range. This practice, by definition, labels 5% of healthy individuals as having abnormal laboratory results. This review addresses various issues that affect laboratory test results and interpretation of such results. It also addresses doctor and patient concerns about assessing and reporting laboratory results. In addition to reporting normal values along with patient results, it may be useful to include clinical significance of the findings, in simple terms, such as, no immediate concern, warrants discussion with doctor at the next visit, recommend contacting your doctor for further action.

For quantitative tests, the laboratory is responsible for determining the ability of the test method to produce accurate results, and for qualitative methods, the laboratory should establish the capacity of the test method to identify the presence or absence of the analyte; accuracy and trueness might be assessed by testing reference materials or comparing assay results to a reference method.

### Quality performance of newborn screening systems: strategies for improvement [^6eadecba]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Newborn metabolic screening is a public health activity with the potential to realize significant health gains for infants affected with a range of congenital conditions. Many of these are inborn errors of metabolism. The activities required to achieve the gains are diverse and carried out by a number of organizations, by families and by many health care professionals. Laboratories have the best-developed quality strategies, which include quality assurance programmes, guidelines, protocols and standards. Two-tier testing and use of multiple markers improve sensitivity and specificity. There are international initiatives to harmonize assay materials and definitions to allow better benchmarking between programmes. Outside the laboratory, standards, education and protocols improve the quality of specimen collection, diagnosis and treatment, which together produce the health gains.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^2d74df40]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Normal plasma glucose (PG) concentrations — neonates, infants, and children — After the first 48 hours of life, mean PG in the postabsorptive state in normal neonates and in infants and children does not differ from adults at 70–100 mg/dL, although children under age 4 years may have a PG concentration < 70 mg/dL and lethargy and tachycardia in fatty acid oxidation defects are observed when PG decreases to 60–70 mg/dL. In normal newborns shortly after birth, the mean PG threshold for suppression of insulin secretion is ~55–65 mg/dL, compared with ~80–85 mg/dL in older infants, children, and adults; by 72 hours of age PG is similar to older infants and children, therefore the standards for normal neonates must never be extrapolated beyond 2–3 days after birth, and we suggest delaying diagnostic evaluations until 2–3 days after birth.

### Serum creatinine concentration in very-low-birth-weight infants from birth to 34–36 wk postmenstrual age [^8e9c9108]. Pediatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine concentration (s[Cr]) is the most widely used marker of renal function, specifically to make inferences about glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants, interpretation of a single s[Cr] is problematic. S[Cr] changes markedly after birth, reflecting the dynamic interaction of maternal renal function, neonatal muscle mass, GFR, and slowly-maturing glomerular and tubular function, precluding a single reference range for s[Cr] values. Definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the newborn based on an absolute change in s[Cr] may not account for physiologic changes in s[Cr]. For example, the absence of a physiologic decline in s[Cr] during the first month of life may represent diminished renal function. Thus, it is imperative that reference ranges accounting for physiologic changes in s[Cr] be defined. Although studies have described changes in s[Cr] after birth in preterm infants, their samples have often included infants with risk factors for renal impairment or have not been presented in a way that allows s[Cr]s outside a normal reference range to be easily recognized. Only a few studies have examined how gestational age (GA) influences the chronological age at which s[Cr] equilibrium is reached.

We report estimates of mean and upper 95th prediction interval of s[Cr] for VLBW infants with uncomplicated clinical courses as functions of gestational and postnatal age from birth to 34–36 wk postmenstrual age (PMA). Because the assessment of the pattern and progression of s[Cr] may be of far more interest to a clinician than an individual s[Cr] value, our goal was to create reference ranges that allow the assessment of s[Cr] trends.

Biochemical genetic testing — performance specification challenges are highlighted, noting that laboratories used laboratory-developed methods with variable practices for establishing test performance specifications such as reference intervals, that obtaining sufficiently large healthy-person sample sets makes establishing reference intervals (including by sex and age group) difficult, and that a lack of commercially available standards and reference materials is a major challenge; expanded newborn screening adds challenges such as establishing age-specific infant reference intervals and characterizing interfering substances, and new tests might require substantial literature review or research before clinical use.

Other inflammatory markers — CRP and procalcitonin in early-onset sepsis assessment: "Both CRP and procalcitonin concentrations increase in newborn infants in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli", and "Procalcitonin concentrations also increase naturally over the first 24 to 36 hours after birth". Consequently, "Single values of CRP or procalcitonin obtained after birth to assess the risk of EOS are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to guide EOS care decisions". "Consistently normal values of CRP and procalcitonin over the first 48 hours of age are associated with the absence of EOS, but serial abnormal values alone should not be used to extend antibiotic therapy in the absence of a culture-confirmed infection".

### Enhanced interpretation of newborn screening results without analyte cutoff values [^a6eae2ee]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To improve quality of newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry with a novel approach made possible by the collaboration of 154 laboratories in 49 countries.

Methods

A database of 767,464 results from 12,721 cases affected with 60 conditions was used to build multivariate pattern recognition software that generates tools integrating multiple clinically significant results into a single score. This score is determined by the overlap between normal and disease ranges, penetration within the disease range, differences between conditions, and weighted correction factors.

Results

Ninety tools target either a single condition or the differential diagnosis between multiple conditions. Scores are expressed as the percentile rank among all cases with the same condition and are compared to interpretation guidelines. Retrospective evaluation of past cases suggests that these tools could have avoided at least half of 279 false-positive outcomes caused by carrier status for fatty-acid oxidation disorders and could have prevented 88% of known false-negative events.

Conclusion

Application of this computational approach to raw data is independent from single analyte cutoff values. In Minnesota, the tools have been a major contributing factor to the sustained achievement of a false-positive rate below 0.1% and a positive predictive value above 60%.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment challenges in infants and children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^976e6df7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Suggested diagnostic algorithm for CAH in the neonatal period. *Note that these suggestions include fewer labs than current guidelines recommend. Many neonates, particularly premature babies, cannot have a complete adrenocortical profile drawn as suggested by guidelines due to blood volume limitations. For premature infants or small for gestational age infants with abnormal newborn screens and/or those with repeated minimally elevated 17-OHP values, we suggest periodic 17-OHP draws until normal or until the value meets criteria for additional workup based on the algorithm. These are suggested labs when blood draw volume limits a complete adrenocortical profile and will evaluate for the most common causes of CAH, 21-hydroxylase deficiency and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency. ‡A negative newborn screen or normal 17-OHP does not rule out CAH due to other enzymatic defects; if there are signs/symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, additional evaluation should be performed. Note that not all regions have a second newborn screen. This figure was adapted from the following publications.

Abbreviations: 17-OHP, 17-hydroxyprogesterone; CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia; K, potassium; Na, sodium; NBS, newborn screen; NCCAH, non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Fetal adrenal steroidogenesis is unique from adults. The fetal adrenal gland is comprised of an inner fetal zone and an outer adult zone. In term infants, the ratio of the fetal to adult zone is 4:1 but the ratio is higher in premature infants, as the permanent zone matures later in gestation in response to fetal pituitary ACTH. Compared to term infants, preterm infants (and particularly sick preterm infants) have higher 17-OHP and other adrenal androgens and steroid precursors. Laboratory and newborn screening norms for adrenal steroidogenic precursors vary by gestational age.

### Defining the newborn blood spot screening reference interval for TSH: impact of ethnicity [^b74c69af]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The UK newborn blood spot screening program for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) was established in 1983. It has led to the diagnosis and early levothyroxine treatment for thousands of babies with CH who might otherwise have developed profound neurodevelopmental impairment.

The UK screening program for CH is based on the measurement of TSH concentration in a heel-prick blood spot taken at 5–10 days of age. Babies whose TSH concentration exceeds 20 mU/L are considered to be screen positive and require immediate referral for venous thyroid function tests and clinical evaluation. A lower borderline TSH cutoff was introduced to minimize false-positive notifications due to a delayed physiological TSH surge. It was assumed that such babies would normalize TSH over the following week. Therefore, in babies with an initial blood spot screen between the lower cutoff and 19.9 mU/L, a second sample is taken 7 days after the first. Cases that remain abnormal are referred for venous testing and clinical evaluation.

The value of this lower TSH cutoff has been the subject of much debate because differences have arisen over time between screening laboratories across the United Kingdom and internationally. This has occurred in response to differences and changes in TSH assays, reports of missed cases of CH, and the rigor with which the normal reference values were constructed. The lower cutoff in our center is currently 6 mU/L.

There is a lack of evidence to assess the optimal lower cutoff point in terms of screening sensitivity and specificity. In addition, UK children vary between regions in terms of ethnicity and iodine sufficiency, which may also influence the optimal cutoff value.

To address these issues, we examined screening data for the whole newborn population from a single laboratory in North London over a 7-year period. We aimed to document changes in TSH concentration over time and the differences between ethnic groups.

### C reactive protein in healthy term newborns during the first 48 hours of life [^881422fb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease in newborns. C reactive protein (CRP) is the most used laboratory biomarker for the detection of EOS. Little is known about normal reference values of CRP during the perinatal period as several factors are able to influence it.

Objectives

To identify an appropriate range of CRP values in healthy term newborns during the first 48hours of life.

Design

CRP determination was performed in 859 term newborns at 12, 24 and 48hours of life. Mode of delivery, maternal vaginal culture results, intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis (IAP) and other perinatal variables were recorded.

Results

CRP mean values were significantly higher at 48hours (4.10mg/L) than at both 24 (2.30 mg/L) and 12hours of life (0.80mg/L). CRP levels were affected by a number of perinatal proinflammatory variables. In particular, CRP mean values were significantly higher in babies born by vaginal delivery (3.80mg/L) and emergency caesarean section (3.60mg/L) than in babies born by elective caesarean section (2.10mg/L). Completed course of IAP led to lower CRP mean values (2.90mg/L) than IAP not completed (3.80mg/L) or not performed (4.70mg/L).

Conclusions

Postnatal age and mode of delivery significantly influence CRP values. Reliable reference values are crucial in order to obtain an adequate diagnostic accuracy.

### Tunisian newborn's cord blood: reference values of complete blood count and hemoglobin fractions [^9c5d1bf5]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was aimed to establish local reference values for hematological indices and hemoglobin (Hb) fractions in umbilical cord blood (UCB) for the northern population of Tunisia.

Study Design

Our study included full-term newborns by vaginal deliveries. Hematological parameters were collected using an automated blood cell counter. The amounts of Hb fractions were measured by capillary electrophoresis of Hb. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.

Results

A total of 328 cord blood samples were analyzed. Among them, 154 (male: 44.8%, female: 55.2%) were used to establish reference values. The normal reference values of complete blood count (CBC) and Hb fractions were calculated. Mean neonatal Hb was 14.75 ± 2.26g/dL. Gestational age affects the expression of CBC values as red blood cell (RBC), Hb, hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), white blood cell (WBC), and the Hb profile. Umbilical blood hemogram parameters and Hb profile are affected by the environment; higher in newborns from urban regions but not affected by gender ratio.

Conclusion

Reference ranges of normal CBC indices and Hb fractions have been successfully established in Tunisian neonates' UCB. Our data suggest reference values that could be useful for neonatal patients' laboratory results and clinical interpretation.

Key Points

· Reference values for CBC and hemoglobin fractions have been established. · Hematological reference for UCB is useful to identify hemolytic anemia cases early. · UCB hematological values are influenced by gestational age and probably by environmental factors.

### Newborn with lethargy, jaundice, and coagulopathy [^da5439e4]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory results include the following: white blood cell count, 21,600/μL (21.6×10⁹/L; reference range, 9,000–30,000/μL [9–30×10⁹/L]); hemoglobin, 18.2 g/dL (182 g/L; reference range, 14.0–24.0 g/dL [140–240 g/L]); platelet count, 111×10³/μL (111×10⁹/L; reference range, 150–450×10³/μL [150–450×10⁹/L]); blood type, B+; direct antiglobulin test, negative; and reticulocyte count, 4% (reference range, 3%-7%). Comprehensive metabolic panel is significant for hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 132 mEq/L (132 mmol/L; reference range, 135–145 mEq/L [135–145 mmol/L]). Liver enzyme levels are normal (alanine aminotransferase, 41 U/L [0.68 μkat/L]; aspartate aminotransferase, 86 U/L [1.44 μkat/L]), as are total protein (5.4 g/dL [54 g/L]) and albumin (3.0 g/dL [30 g/L]) levels. Repeated bilirubin level is 12.4 mg/dL (212 µmol/L) at 14 hours after birth, with an elevated direct bilirubin level of 2.9 mg/dL (49.6 µmol/L). Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is defined as a direct bilirubin level greater than 2 mg/dL (34.2 mmol/L) or more than 20% of total bilirubin. γ-Glutamyl transferase level is normal. Coagulation studies show an elevated prothrombin time of 23.4 seconds (reference range, 11–17 seconds), with an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9–1.3); activated partial thromboplastin level is 49.5 seconds (reference range, 30–60 seconds). Fibrinogen level is decreased at 70 mg/dL (0.70 g/L) (reference range, 230–450 mg/dL [230–450 g/L]). Lactate level is 24.3 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L; reference range, 2.0–26.9 mg/dL [0.22–2.98 mmol/L]). Ammonia level is 96.6 µg/dL (69 μmol/L; reference range, 89.6–149.9 µg/dL [64–107 μmol/L]). Cerebrospinal fluid studies are unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and echocardiography are normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows diffuse hepatic echogenicity. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are negative. Further testing reveals the diagnosis.

Hyperbilirubinemia of the newborn — prevalence and thresholds indicate that "Virtually all newborns have some elevation of their total serum bilirubin (TSB) (> 90% of which is unconjugated or indirect reacting) relative to normal adult values, which are < 17 μmol/L (≤ 1.0 mg/dL)". In the first week, "more than 80% of newborns appear jaundiced" and, depending on population mix, "about 75% have a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) of > 100–150 μmol/L (> 6–9 mg/dL) by 96 hours". The protocol notes that "The term physiologic jaundice is often used to describe newborns with a TSB well above normal adult levels, but not attributable to a specific cause such as hemolytic disease; however, such terminology may be inappropriate because having an unknown etiology does not necessarily mean that a condition is physiologic".

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^ca45cb27]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism — confirmatory serum testing after abnormal newborn screening (NBS): In any child whose NBS suggests CH, perform a physical examination and measure serum TSH and FT4 (or total T4), optimally using a laboratory with a 24-hour turn around, and note that other thyroid hormones (T3, free T3, reverse T3) are rarely of clinical value. For confirmation, FT4 is preferred over total T4, but choosing FT4 or total T4 is based on cost, time to obtain results, and clinical factors; for example, preterm or low birth weight (LBW) infants with normal thyroid function may have protein-binding alterations causing low total T4 despite normal FT4. Therefore, if TSH is normal, evaluate low serum total T4 by measuring FT4, and if concern for a binding abnormality exists, measuring FT4 by a dialysis method performed in a reference laboratory may be more reliable than the standard analog method.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^57d2c643]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Samples for establishment of test performance in biochemical genetic assays should be established with an adequate number, type, and variety of specimens; the number and type of both positive and normal samples should be considered and should be adequate for determining performance specifications, and both disease prevalence and sample characteristics might influence sample availability and should be considered. Sample types should represent expected patient specimens (e.g., whole blood, serum, urine, dried blood spot, fresh or frozen tissue, or prenatal specimens), and if amino acid analysis is intended for urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid, test performance specifications need to be established for all three specimen types. Laboratories should include samples representing anticipated specimen variances or interfering conditions, such as insufficient specimen volume, hemolysis, or clotting, when determining test performance, acceptance criteria, and the influence of variances on results interpretation.

### Glucose homeostasis in newborns: an endocrinology perspective [^0bd30679]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Physiologic adaptations in the postnatal period, along with gradual establishment of enteral feeding, help maintain plasma glucose concentrations in the neonatal period. The definition of normal plasma glucose in the neonatal period has been a subject of debate because of a lack of evidence linking a set plasma or blood glucose concentration to clinical symptoms or predictors of short- and long-term outcomes. However, there is consensus that maintaining plasma glucose in the normal range for age is important to prevent immediate and long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The specific management strategy for abnormal glucose levels in neonates depends on the underlying etiology, and interventions could include nutritional changes, medications, hormone therapy, or even surgery. Here, we will review the physiological processes that help maintain plasma glucose in newborns and discuss the approach to a newborn with disordered glucose homeostasis, with an emphasis on the endocrine basis of abnormal glucose homeostasis.

### Pregnancy and laboratory studies: a reference table for clinicians [^3b846a5d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish normal reference ranges during pregnancy for common laboratory analytes.

Data Sources

We conducted a comprehensive electronic database review using PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. We also reviewed textbooks of maternal laboratory studies during uncomplicated pregnancy.

Methods Of Study Selection

We searched the databases for studies investigating various laboratory analytes at various times during pregnancy. All abstracts were examined by two investigators and, if they were found relevant, the full text of the article was reviewed. Articles were included if the analyte studied was measured in pregnant women without major medical problems or confounding conditions and if the laboratory marker was measured and reported for a specified gestational age.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

For each laboratory marker, data were extracted from as many references as possible, and these data were combined to establish normal reference ranges in pregnancy. When possible, the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles were reported as the normal range. In some of the reference articles, however, the reported range was based on the minimum and maximum value of the laboratory constituent. In those cases, the minimum to maximum range was used and combined with the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile range. We found that there is a substantial difference in normal values in some laboratory markers in the pregnant state when compared with the nonpregnant state.

Conclusion

It is important to consider normal reference ranges specific to pregnancy when interpreting some laboratory results that may be altered by the normal changes of pregnancy.

### Haemoglobin and red blood cell reference intervals during infancy [^be2077fe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

The difficulties in establishing high-quality paediatric reference intervals have been recognised by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry.

The technical development of analytical instruments changes their performance and reference intervals need to be methodology specific. Infant reference intervals have been difficult to address in modern healthcare and the more abundant data in older reports risk being outdated. Small study cohorts and relatively broad age intervals introduce uncertainty about reference limits since observations at the population edges are unstable due to the rapid physiological changes. Reference interval quality is also affected by sensitivity to pre-analytical conditions and the need for prompt transportation to the laboratory.

Infant reference intervals present a challenge and the importance of establishing accurate intervals specific also to the neonatal period has recently been underlined. Therefore, the aim of our study was to define new reference intervals for red blood cell (RBC) biomarkers at birth (umbilical cord), postnatal age 48–118 hours, 4 months and 12 months, based on data from a large well-defined cohort of longitudinally followed and presumably healthy Swedish infants.

### Clinical validation of cutoff target ranges in newborn screening of metabolic disorders by tandem mass spectrometry: a worldwide collaborative project [^43d294ea]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To achieve clinical validation of cutoff values for newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry through a worldwide collaborative effort.

Methods

Cumulative percentiles of amino acids and acylcarnitines in dried blood spots of approximately 25–30 million normal newborns and 10,742 deidentified true positive cases are compared to assign clinical significance, which is achieved when the median of a disorder range is, and usually markedly outside, either the 99th or the 1st percentile of the normal population. The cutoff target ranges of analytes and ratios are then defined as the interval between selected percentiles of the two populations. When overlaps occur, adjustments are made to maximize sensitivity and specificity taking all available factors into consideration.

Results

As of December 1, 2010, 130 sites in 45 countries have uploaded a total of 25,114 percentile data points, 565,232 analyte results of true positive cases with 64 conditions, and 5,341 cutoff values. The average rate of submission of true positive cases between December 1, 2008, and December 1, 2010, was 5.1 cases/day. This cumulative evidence generated 91 high and 23 low cutoff target ranges. The overall proportion of cutoff values within the respective target range was 42% (2,269/5,341).

Conclusion

An unprecedented level of cooperation and collaboration has allowed the objective definition of cutoff target ranges for 114 markers to be applied to newborn screening of rare metabolic disorders.

Neonatal thyroid screening pathways — follow‑up actions after initial tests: Most programs initially assessing T4 only subsequently evaluate TSH concentration for neonates with the lowest T4 values (usually the lowest 10% of the T4 values for the day); if TSH concentration is high, the infant is recalled for evaluation and testing; repeat dried blood spot (DBS) specimens are collected if the T4 value is below a defined cutoff for gestational age; if the initial TSH was normal but repeat analysis shows TSH to be high, evaluation should be initiated promptly; neonates with a persistently low T4 in DBS tests should have serum FT4 and TSH determinations to confirm or exclude central congenital hypothyroidism (CCH).

### Hematological reference intervals among full-term newborns in Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study [^cac29c9f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The RI is the range between values from the lower reference limit to the upper reference limits. They are ideally defined on apparently healthy individuals, and should be distinguished from clinical decision limits that are derived from known diseased patients. It is a distribution of numerical test results expected in a representative population of healthy individuals. It is mainly used to make medical decisions about hematological disease diagnosis, treatment & monitoring of disease prognosis of the patients. According to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guideline, the RIs are defined in relation to a healthy population to include the values in which 95% of apparently healthy individuals would fall and in which 2.5% of results in the lower range are out of the RI and 2.5% of values in the upper range will be out of the RI.

Hematological RIs are the most common medical decision-supporting tools used for the interpretation of numerical hematological test results. Accurate patient result interpreting within the correct RI is mandatory to minimize the patient risks from disease, increase recovery rates, and improve monitoring therapy of various hematological disorders. Almost 80% of physicians' medical decisions are based on information provided by laboratory reports. Therefore, locally established hematological RI among newborns is very important for the physician to correctly diagnosis and early treatment of the patients.

In Ethiopia there is no locally determined hematological RI among healthy full-term newborns in the country, particularly is in the study area. They used in Western and American RI. Since hematological RI is varying through age, race, ethnicity, altitude, sex, drug intake, time of sampling and socioeconomic status. It is commonly known that newborn hematological parameters are different from those of neonates, infants or adults. It needs locally determined RI. Due to this reason we motivate to conduct this study. The aim of this study was to establish hematological RI by using UCB of apparently healthy, full-term newborns at University of Gondar compressive specialized hospital, northwest Ethiopia.

Early-onset sepsis (EOS) inflammatory markers — clinical utility and limitations in term newborns are described: Investigated biomarkers include "C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, interleukins (ILs) (soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-6, and IL-8), tumor necrosis factor α, and CD64". "Both CRP and procalcitonin concentrations increase in newborn infants in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, including infection, asphyxia, and pneumothorax", and "Procalcitonin concentrations also increase naturally over the first 24 to 36 hours after birth". "Single values of CRP or procalcitonin obtained after birth to assess the risk of EOS are neither sensitive nor specific to guide EOS care decisions", while "Consistently normal values of CRP and procalcitonin over the first 48 hours of age are associated with the absence of EOS", yet "serial abnormal values alone should not be used to decide whether to administer antibiotics in the absence of culture-confirmed infection". Accordingly, "a serial evaluation of inflammatory markers should not be used to assess well-appearing term newborn infants for risk of EOS".

### A reappraisal of neonatal blood chemistry reference ranges using the nova M electrodes [^66c3b291]. American Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to establish new reference ranges for whole blood electrolytes, gases, and selected chemistries in normal healthy newborn infants obtained from cord blood and at 2–4 hours of life based on modern analytic techniques. Healthy appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA), term infants were studied. Whole venous cord blood and blood drawn at 2–4 hours of life were analyzed for gases, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, ionized magnesium, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Concentrations for blood glucose and blood urea nitrogen were close to older published concentrations. Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) were significantly different and had much narrower normal margins. New norms are included for blood gases, lactate, iCa, and iMg. We offer a range of values for often-measured blood chemistries in term, healthy infants, using modern laboratory methods. These values could serve as more up-to-date references compared with older values found in major textbooks of Neonatology.

### Normal B-cell ranges in infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^35e01d01]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

During the first year of life, B-cell level is a valuable indicator of whether external factors, such as exposure to B-cell-depleting therapies, have an adverse impact on immune system development. However, there are no standard reference ranges of B-cell levels in healthy infants by age.

Objective

Our aim was to estimate the normal range of B-cell levels in infants, by age, during the first year of life by pooling data from published studies.

Methods

Studies reporting B-cell levels measured by using flow cytometry and CD19 markers in healthy infants were identified via a systematic literature review. Quality and feasibility assessments determined suitability for inclusion in meta-analyses by age group and/or continuous age. Means and normal ranges (2.5th-97.5th percentile) were estimated for absolute and percentage B-cell levels. Sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of various assumptions.

Results

Of the 37 relevant studies identified, 28 were included in at least 1 meta-analysis. The means and normal ranges of B-cell levels were found to be 707 cells/μL in cord blood (range 123–2324 cells/μL), 508 cells/μL in infants aged 0 to 1 month (range 132–1369 cells/μL), 1493 cells/μL in infants aged 1 to 6 months (range 416–3877 cells/μL), and 1474 cells/μL in infants older than 6 months (range 416–3805 cells/μL). The continuous age model showed that B-cell levels peaked at week 26. Trends were similar for the percentage B-cell estimates and in sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

These meta-analyses provide the first normal reference ranges for B-cell levels in infants, by week of age, during the first year of life.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^b5399b30]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Section 1: Which Neonates, Infants, and Children to Evaluate for Hypoglycemia

1.1. For children who are able to communicate their symptoms, we recommend evaluation and management only of those in whom Whipple's triad (see below) is documented. GRADE 1++++.

1.2. For infants and younger children who are unable to reliably communicate symptoms, we suggest evaluation and management only of those whose PG concentrations are documented by laboratory quality assays to be below the normal threshold for neurogenic responses (< 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]). GRADE 2+++0.

1.3. For those neonates who are suspected to be at high risk of having a persistent hypoglycemia disorder, we suggest evaluation when the infant is ≥ 48 hours of age so that the period of transitional glucose regulation has passed and persistent hypoglycemia may be excluded before discharge home. GRADE 2++00.

Clinical Definition of Hypoglycemia

Clinical hypoglycemia is defined as a PG concentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs of impaired brain function. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific, and a single low PG concentration may be an artifact. For these reasons, guidelines in adults emphasize the value of Whipple's triad for confirming hypoglycemia: symptoms and/or signs consistent with hypoglycemia, a documented low PG concentration, and relief of signs/symptoms when PG concentration is restored to normal. Young infants and children often cannot dependably recognize and/or communicate their symptoms, however; therefore, recognition of hypoglycemia may require confirmation by repeated measurements of PG concentration and formal testing. Nevertheless, suspected hypoglycemia should be treated promptly to avoid potential adverse consequences.

Hypoglycemia cannot be defined as a specific PG concentration, because: (1) thresholds for specific brain responses to hypoglycemia occur across a range of PG concentrations, and these thresholds can be altered by the presence of alternative fuels, such as ketones, and by recent antecedent hypoglycemia; (2) it is not possible to identify a single PG value that causes brain injury, and the extent of injury is influenced by other factors, such as duration and degree of hypoglycemia; and (3) potential artifacts and technical factors that lead to inaccuracies in glucose determination may complicate the interpretation of any single PG value.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^9746433f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Values

Failure to investigate a neonate, infant, or child with suspected hypoglycemia increases the risk of delaying a definitive diagnosis and instituting effective treatment. Expeditiously identifying the specific cause of hypoglycemia, as outlined above, will enable prompt institution of appropriate treatment and decrease the risk of permanent brain injury from persistent and recurrent severe hypoglycemia. The decision to subject an infant or child to a diagnostic investigation for suspected hypoglycemia, which includes a monitored assessment of fasting adaptation that may expose the patient to the risk of another episode of hypoglycemia, places a higher value on achieving diagnostic certainty and a lower value on avoiding the discomfort, inconvenience, and cost of such procedures.

### Implementing and validating newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism in south India: a 2-year observational study at a tertiary care hospital [^af44dd6b]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Despite the promising results from targeted screening efforts, research on all treatable IEMs in India remains limited and a major challenge persists, that is, the lack of population-specific screening cut-off values. Currently, Indian laboratories often rely on cut-off values derived from Western populations, which may not be appropriate for the Indian demographic. Given the genetic and environmental differences between populations, it is crucial for each laboratory to define its own threshold values, either by percentiles or through normal ranges. This gap in the screening process highlights the need for studies that tailor NBS programmes to the Indian population. In response to these challenges, this study aims to introduce an NBS programme at a tertiary care hospital in South India. Specifically, the study seeks to validate the suitability of existing cut-off values for the South Indian population, taking into account varying gestational ages (GAs) and birth weights. By addressing these key issues, the study will contribute to the development of a more accurate and effective screening protocol for IEMs in India, ultimately reducing the burden of undiagnosed metabolic disorders.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^eeb68310]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

2.0 Criteria for Diagnosis

2.1 Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration

Recommendations

2.1.1 We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is < 40 mU/L of whole blood, the clinician may postpone treatment, pending the serum results, for 1–2 days (1|⊕⊕○).

2.1.2 We recommend starting treatment immediately if serum FT4 concentration is below the norm for age, regardless of TSH concentration (1|⊕⊕⊕).

2.1.3 We suggest that treatment should be started if venous TSH concentration is persistently > 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal (2|⊕○○).

2.1.4 When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis (2|⊕○○). If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment (2|⊕○○).

2.1.1–2.1.4 Evidence

L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment if DBS TSH concentration is above this value. Given that the period between birth and the age of 3 years is a critical time for neurocognitive development, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L, carefully monitoring thyroid function to avoid overtreatment, and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located. Management remains a matter of debate for cases in which TSH concentrations are high, but to a lesser extent (6–20 mU/L), and FT4 levels are normal. The family should be informed that this is a "gray area" but that many clinicians would advise "playing safe" and treating during early childhood in this situation.

### Is there an association between thyrotropin levels within the normal range and birth growth parameters in full-term newborns? [^908d358e]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background It has been suggested that thyroid hormone concentration at birth may have some role in regulating foetal growth. The aim of this study was to provide seminal data regarding any association between thyrotropin (TSH) concentration within the normal range and growth parameters at birth in full-term newborns. Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted in Tehran, Iran, 314 mother-newborn pairs were randomly selected from health care centres responsible for congenital hypothyroidism screening. Neonatal TSH concentration was measured using a heel-prick blood sample taken from all neonates 3–5 days after birth, as part of the routine neonate screening. Anthropometrics, including birth weight, length and head circumference were obtained from the birth record of each neonate. The z-score values for weight-for-age, weight-for-length, length-for-age and head-for-age were calculated using the World Health Organisation growth standards. Results The median interquartile range neonatal TSH values were 0.9 mIU/L (0.4–1.7 mIU/L). Neonates in the top tertile of TSH values had higher birth weights and weight-for-age z-scores than those in the bottom tertile (p < 0.05). In addition, neonatal TSH was associated with weight-for-age z-scores in unadjusted (β = 0.113, p = 0.020) and adjusted (β = 0.122, p = 0.013) analysis. However, in both unadjusted and adjusted analysis, no association was observed between TSH concentrations of neonates and weight-for-length, length-for-age and head-for-age z-scores. Conclusions Our findings indicate a positive association between the normal range of neonatal screening TSH concentration and birth weight; however, this association was not observed for other anthropometric parameters at birth.

### Recommendations for uniform definitions used in newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency [^68d88eb4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Considerations in defining screening terminology

The systematic literature review highlighted the diversity of terminology used in NBS programs. Clear recommendations without ambiguity are required for clinicians, public health specialists, and other NBS stakeholders, such as policy makers and parents. Positive and negative are commonly used terms in NBS, but definitions vary between programs. "TREC positive" could imply the presence of TRECs, but the term positive is also broadly used for a screen with TRECs below cutoff. In addition, families can interpret a positive test result as "positive" or good news. Abnormal and normal are nonspecific terms that can have negative connotations. Labeling an infant as abnormal causes parental anxiety, while the term normal excludes the fact that newborns can have serious disorders not screened for. The terms within normal range or outside normal range might be preferred, but ranges are not applicable to SCID NBS because only TRECs below a certain cutoff value are important. We therefore recommend the terms abnormal value and normal value to describe TREC screening results (Fig 3). Incomplete is recommended if further action is required due to DNA amplification failure.

For screening algorithm outcomes, we agree with the term retest, which is commonly used in literature. However, it should be specified that retesting is TREC analysis of the same NBS card (not going back to the newborn for a new card). If TREC analysis is repeated on a new NBS card, we feel that the term new sample test is best. The term second NBS card/sample is not completely correct as some programs are requesting a routine second NBS card for other disorders, such as congenital hypothyroidism, and this new sample to resolve SCID screening could be the third NBS card. It is important to highlight when a new sample is taken from the newborn as repeated sampling is not without anxiety and emotional insecurity for parents and additional distress for the newborn. Finally, we prefer the term referral (meaning sending for specialist evaluation) over recall, as recall is differently used across programs (Fig 3).

### Cord-blood derived chemistry reference values in preterm infants for sodium, chloride, potassium, glucose, and creatinine [^3d70402e]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

International guidelines recommend that preterm infants should be supported to maintain their serum electrolytes within "normal" ranges. In term babies, cord blood values differed in pathological pregnancies from healthy ones.

Study Design

We examined cord blood sodium, chloride, potassium, glucose, and creatinine to derive maturity-related reference intervals. We examined associations with gestational age, delivery mode, singleton versus multiple, and prenatal maternal adverse conditions. We compared preterm cord values to term, and to adult reference ranges.

Results

There were 591 infants, 537 preterm and 54 term. Preterm cord glucose levels were steady (3.7 ± 1.1 mmol/L), while sodium, chloride, and creatinine increased over GA by 0.17, 0.14 mmol/L/week, and 1.07 µmol/L/week, respectively (p < 0.003). Average preterm cord potassium and chloride were higher than the term (p < 0.05). Compared with adult reference intervals, cord preterm reference intervals were higher for chloride (100–111 vs. 98–106 mmol/L), lower for creatinine (29–84 vs. 62–115 µmol/L), and more variable for potassium (2.7–7.9 vs. 3.5–5.0 mmol/L) and sodium (130–141 vs. 136–145 mmol/L). Cesarean section was associated with higher potassium and lower glucose, multiple births with higher chloride and creatinine and lower glucose, and SGA with lower glucose.

Conclusion

Cord blood values varied across the GA range with increases in sodium, chloride, and creatinine, while glucose remained steady. Average preterm reference values were higher than term values for potassium and chloride. Preterm reference values differed from published adults' reference values. The changes across GA and by delivery mode, SGA, and being a multiple, which may have direct implications for neonatal care and fluid management.

Key Points

· Cord blood electrolyte, creatinine, and glucose values vary across neonatal gestational age. · Average preterm cord values of potassium and chloride were higher than term values. · Cord reference values differ by delivery mode, growth, and multiple impacting neonatal care decisions.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^0c52cbfa]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

PG Concentrations in Neonates Aged < 48 Hours

In normal newborn infants, PG concentration commonly decreases immediately after birth to levels below those in older infants and children. The interpretation and response to PG concentration during the first 2 days of life have been controversial. Whether the brain of newborn infants has greater or lesser susceptibility to hypoglycemic injury is controversial as well. As discussed previously, the committee's review of available data on transitional neonatal hypoglycemia in normal newborns (ie, hypoketonemic hypoglycemia with inappropriately large glycemic responses to glucagon or epinephrine stimulation) suggests that it is a mild and transient form of hyperinsulinism in which the mean PG threshold for suppression of insulin secretion is ~55–65 mg/dL (3.0–3.6 mmol/L) shortly after birth, compared with ~80–85 mg/dL (4.4–4.7 mmol/L) in older infants, children, and adults. As the glucose stimulated-insulin secretion mechanism matures, mean PG concentration in normal newborns increases and by 72 hours of age is similar to those in older infants and children; therefore, the standards for normal neonates must never be extrapolated beyond 2–3 days after birth. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing a suspected persistent hypoglycemia disorder from transitional neonatal glucose concentrations during the first 48 hours of life, we suggest delaying diagnostic evaluations until 2–3 days after birth.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^701afc03]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Newborn thyroid dysfunction screening — scope, methods, and timing: Congenital hypothyroidism screening is performed routinely in all 50 states of the United States and programs are also being introduced in many developing countries, accounting overall for approximately one third of the world's population. Blood spot specimens eluted from filter paper are utilized, and the optimal timing of measurement is at 2–5 days of age to avoid confounding by the physiologic surge in neonatal TSH. Some programs employ primary T4 screening with TSH measurement when specimens demonstrate a value below a specified cutoff, whereas others use a primary TSH determination with reflex FT4 strategy. Newborn screening for hypothyroidism should be performed routinely on all infants, with blood spot analysis typically 2–5 days after birth. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

### Metabolic screening and postnatal glucose homeostasis in the newborn [^5d5bba70]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Although individual metabolic diseases are relatively uncommon, inherited metabolic diseases collectively represent a more common cause of disease in the neonatal period than is generally appreciated. Newborn screening is among the most successful public health programs today. Every day, newborns considered to be at risk for hypoglycemia are screened. The definition of clinically significant hypoglycemia remains among the most confused and contentious issues in neonatology. There are 2 "competing" methods of defining hypoglycemia that suggest very different levels for management: one based on metabolic-endocrinologic hormones and another that uses outcome data to determine threshold levels of risk.

Well-child visit between 2 and 4 weeks of life — direct or conjugated bilirubin testing algorithm: At the "By 1 month" visit for a 2- to 4-week-old infant, "Any jaundice in eyes or skin?" leads to "Measure a direct or conjugated bilirubin within 48 hours". If "Direct or conjugated bilirubin level ≥ 1 mg/dL?" then "Contact Gastroenterology urgently"; if the "Direct or conjugated bilirubin level within lab reference range?" the pathway states "No further testing needed". "Stools pale, gray, or white (by inspection or report)?" also directs to "Measure a direct or conjugated bilirubin within 48 hours". The figure notes "Before 2 weeks of life, values are interpreted using the reference range specific to the laboratory performing the test (do not use a fixed cut-off or a bilirubin ratio)". It also specifies "A measurement may not be needed if either of the following is true: (a) Any prior direct or conjugated bilirubin value was within the laboratory's derived reference range. (b) Prior direct or conjugated bilirubin values were all abnormal but both (i) less than or equal to the initial value and (ii) < 1 mg/dL".

### Population meta-analysis of low plasma glucose thresholds in full-term normal newborns [^45d0398f]. American Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

There is extreme variation in the definition of low plasma glucose levels in newborn infants in the first postnatal days, ranging from < 30 to ≤ 60 mg/dL. The goal of the present study was to define low thresholds (≤ 5th percentile) of plasma glucose concentrations in full-term normal newborns during the first 72 hours of life. Population meta-analysis was performed on published studies of neonatal hypoglycemia ascertained by MedLine search. One-way analysis of variance was computed across the studies for each of the following four postnatal time periods: 1 to 2 (physiological nadir), 3 to 23, 24 to 47, and 48 to 72 hours. The estimated ≤ 5th percentiles of neonatal hypoglycemia during 1 to 2, 3 to 23, 24 to 47, and 48 to 72 hours after birth were ≤ 28, ≤ 40, ≤ 41, and ≤ 48 mg/dL, respectively. Based on this statistical definition, we recommend that low thresholds of plasma glucose levels of 28, 40, and 48 mg/dL be adopted in full-term normal newborns at 1 to 2, 3 to 47, and 48 to 72 hours of life, respectively.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^565a6b6f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Biliary atresia and other congenital liver diseases are distinguished from physiological prolonged neonatal jaundice as they are associated with conjugated (direct), rather than unconjugated, hyperbilirubinaemia.
The natural history of the total bilirubin level in the first 4 weeks of life in disease-free neonates is to decrease over time.
The criteria currently recommended for further investigation in cases of prolonged neonatal jaundice are variable and supported by little evidence.

What this study hopes to add?

In disease-free states, direct bilirubin decreases with age, particularly at the level of the individual. We produce centile charts that may serve as reference tools.
However, the direct–total bilirubin ratio shows no clear trend and thus is an unreliable marker of serious pathology, including congenital liver disease.
Our data support the NICE guidance advocating investigation for liver disease in neonates with conjugated bilirubin > 25 µmol/L, although more stringent criteria may also be valid.

After birth, term neonates generally lose up to 10 to 15 percent of their total body water in the first postnatal week followed by a return to birth weight by 10 to 14 days PNA. For preterm neonates, the total body water loss could be greater than in term neonates, and the recovery of birth weight usually takes longer.

### How well does the capillary thyroid-stimulating hormone test for newborn thyroid screening predict the venous free thyroxine level? [^a8f4d654]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

When capillary TSH is grossly elevated, for example, > 100 mU/L, with or without clinical features of hypothyroidism, the clinician will wish to start L-T4 treatment immediately since moderate or severe hypothyroidism is likely. The decision is less clear in an asymptomatic newborn with modest capillary TSH elevation, for example, 15–40 mU/L, where venous fT4 is unlikely to be frankly low, and more likely to be either mildly subnormal (10 to < 15 pmol/L) or within the newborn reference range of 15–32 pmol/L. When the results of venous thyroid function tests (TFTs) will be available on the same day as venepuncture, the clinician can be guided by the fT4 levels. Although this same-day service will be routinely provided nowadays by laboratories in developed countries, the availability of venous results may still be problematic outside normal working hours and at weekends. Moreover, a same-day service may not be feasible in many countries with limited resources. In such situations, the clinician faces the dilemma as to whether to treat immediately or whether to await the venous results before committing the infant to several years of treatment with L-T4.

To date the relationship between capillary TSH levels measured in the course of newborn screening and serum thyroid hormone levels has not been explored. In this study, data from all infants referred by the Scottish Newborn Screening Programme with capillary TSH elevation has been reviewed with particular focus on infants evaluated by the AutoDELFIA assay since 2002. The aim is to determine a capillary TSH threshold below which decompensated primary hypothyroidism is unlikely so that immediate treatment with L-T4 is not indicated and can be deferred until venous TFT results become available.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^da2dae30]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Calibration verification and materials — laboratories performing testing for inherited metabolic diseases must comply with CLIA calibration and calibration verification requirements and should implement specified additional practices. Calibration verification procedures must be performed at least once every 6 months and when a complete change of reagents for a procedure is introduced unless the laboratory can demonstrate and document that changing reagent lot numbers does not affect the range used to report patient test results and control values are not adversely affected by reagent lot number changes, when major preventive maintenance or replacement of critical parts occurs that might influence test performance, when control materials reflect an unusual trend or shift or are outside of the laboratory's acceptable limits, when other means of assessing and correcting unacceptable control values have failed to correct and prevent the problem, or when the laboratory's established schedule for verifying the reportable range for patient test results requires more frequent calibration verification. Additional practices include that when reference materials for calibration are commercially available and stable, laboratories should consider obtaining quantities adequate for a reasonable period of testing to reduce variability in these materials (but not to exceed their expiration date), and when reference materials for calibration are not commercially available, each laboratory preparing these materials at its own facility should ensure their validation including verifying each new batch against an old batch and ensure that appropriate calibration and calibration verification procedures are in place; laboratories should refer to available professional guidelines (e.g. ACMG Standards and Guidelines for Clinical Genetic Laboratories and CLSI method-specific guidelines).

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

### The publication quality of laboratory values in clinical studies in neonates [^5b815e11]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Countries and number of sites

Two hundred and fifty-four studies presented on the country of origin, with the United States (51), Turkey (26), India (22), Iran (14), Canada (12), South Korea (10), China (9), Germany (8), United Kingdom (8), and Egypt (7). Multinational papers were rare (3), and the study country was uncertain in another 3 papers. The majority were single-center studies (199), with significantly fewer (40) multicenter studies. For 7 papers, this information was not retrieved.

Number of neonates included and those with repeated measurements

In 250 papers, the median number of included neonates was 120 (range 10–66,526). If presented, 74/198 were single measurement dataset. In the papers (124) that clearly presented repeated measurements, the median number of neonates was 100 (range 2–26,871). Consequently, information on repeated measurements was unclear in a relevant portion (59/198).

Demographics

Using standard GA definitions, 154, 115, 117, and 125 papers reported data on term, preterm, very preterm or extreme preterm cases, respectively, with some information on subgroups in 225 papers. In 22 papers, the age characteristics were unclear. Data on sex were included in 210 papers, while information on the proportion of sex (male/female) was presented in 124 papers. The potential impact of sex was analyzed in only 6 papers. Clinically meaningful information on age (e.g. gestational or postnatal) at sampling was provided in 227/257 papers. Consequently, for a relevant portion (30/257) of papers, age-related aspects were limited to "neonate". Whether neonates were outpatients, hospitalized, or both were included was mentioned in 32, 227, and 12 papers. At least some information on medical conditions (clinical information, medical diagnosis, or healthy) was presented in 236/257 papers. Information on drugs administered was only provided in 120/257 papers.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^095f9859]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Medium credibility.

First-tier screening test performance factors — Several technical factors limit the accuracy of these tests, including that 17OHP levels are normally high at birth and decrease rapidly during the first few postnatal days in healthy infants, whereas 17OHP levels increase with time in infants affected with CAH, making diagnostic accuracy poor in the first 2 days unless robust mechanisms exist to obtain follow-up samples. Female infants have lower mean 17OHP levels than do males, slightly reducing the sensitivity of newborn screening in some reports. Premature, sick, or stressed infants have higher levels of 17OHP than do term infants, generating many false positives, and in 26 years of operation of the Swedish screening program, the positive predictive value was 25% for full-term infants but only 1.4% for preterm infants, with the predictive value correlating very strongly with gestational age; there are no universally accepted standards for stratifying infants, but most laboratories use a series of birth weight–adjusted cut-offs.

A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.
